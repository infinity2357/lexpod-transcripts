question you're getting me to reflect on
 

119
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,149
question you're getting me to reflect on
this question of whether the feeling of

00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:58,159
this question of whether the feeling of
 

121
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,950
this question of whether the feeling of
producing mathematical output if you

122
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:00,960
producing mathematical output if you
 

123
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,670
producing mathematical output if you
want

124
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:01,680
want
 

125
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,910
want
is like the process of you know uttering

126
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
is like the process of you know uttering
 

127
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,950
is like the process of you know uttering
language or producing linguistic output

128
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:06,960
language or producing linguistic output
 

129
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,029
language or producing linguistic output
i think it feels something like that and

130
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:09,039
i think it feels something like that and
 

131
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,469
i think it feels something like that and
it's certainly the case

132
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:10,479
it's certainly the case
 

133
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,830
it's certainly the case
let me put it this way it's hard to

134
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
let me put it this way it's hard to
 

135
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,630
let me put it this way it's hard to
imagine doing mathematics in a

136
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:14,640
imagine doing mathematics in a
 

137
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,270
imagine doing mathematics in a
completely non-linguistic way

138
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,280
completely non-linguistic way
 

139
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,589
completely non-linguistic way
it's hard to imagine doing mathematics

140
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:19,599
it's hard to imagine doing mathematics
 

141
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:20,790
it's hard to imagine doing mathematics
without

142
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:20,800
without
 

143
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,309
without
talking about mathematics and sort of

144
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
talking about mathematics and sort of
 

145
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,309
talking about mathematics and sort of
thinking in propositions but you know

146
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:24,319
thinking in propositions but you know
 

147
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,990
thinking in propositions but you know
maybe it's just because that's the way i

148
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:26,000
maybe it's just because that's the way i
 

149
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,670
maybe it's just because that's the way i
do mathematics so maybe i can't imagine

150
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:27,680
do mathematics so maybe i can't imagine
 

151
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,510
do mathematics so maybe i can't imagine
it any other way right it's a

152
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:29,520
it any other way right it's a
 

153
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,710
it any other way right it's a
well what about visualizing shapes

154
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:32,720
well what about visualizing shapes
 

155
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,589
well what about visualizing shapes
visualizing concepts to which language

156
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:35,599
visualizing concepts to which language
 

157
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,070

is not

158
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,080
is not
 

159
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,190
is not
obviously attachable ah that's a really

160
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,200
obviously attachable ah that's a really
 

161
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,470
obviously attachable ah that's a really
interesting question and

162
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:40,480
interesting question and
 

163
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,830
interesting question and
you know one thing it reminds me of is

164
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:41,840
you know one thing it reminds me of is
 

165
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,509

very beautiful proofs of geometric
propositions

172
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:48,400
propositions
 

173
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,470
propositions
um there's a very famous one by bhaskara

174
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
um there's a very famous one by bhaskara
 

175
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,830
um there's a very famous one by bhaskara
of the the pythagorean theorem

176
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,840
of the the pythagorean theorem
 

177
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,790
of the the pythagorean theorem
proofs which are purely visual proofs

178
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:56,800
proofs which are purely visual proofs
 

179
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,309
proofs which are purely visual proofs
where you show that

180
00:02:58,309 --> 00:02:58,319
where you show that
 

181
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,550
where you show that
two quantities are the same by taking

182
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:00,560
two quantities are the same by taking
 

183
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,670
two quantities are the same by taking
the same pieces

184
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:01,680
the same pieces
 

185
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,390
the same pieces
and putting them together one way uh and

186
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
and putting them together one way uh and
 

187
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,350
and putting them together one way uh and
making one shape

188
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:05,360
making one shape
 

189
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,270
making one shape
and putting them together another way

190
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,280
and putting them together another way
 

191
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,550
and putting them together another way
and making a different shape and then

192
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:08,560
and making a different shape and then
 

193
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,070
and making a different shape and then
observing those two shapes must have the

194
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,080
observing those two shapes must have the
 

195
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,509
observing those two shapes must have the
same area because they were built out of

196
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:11,519
same area because they were built out of
 

197
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,390
same area because they were built out of
the same

198
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
the same
 

199
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,790
the same
pieces um you know there's a there's a

200
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:14,800
pieces um you know there's a there's a
 

201
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,589
pieces um you know there's a there's a
famous

202
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
famous
 

203
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,190
famous
story and it's a little bit disputed

204
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
story and it's a little bit disputed
 

205
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,509
story and it's a little bit disputed
about how accurate this is but that in

206
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:19,519
about how accurate this is but that in
 

207
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,110
about how accurate this is but that in
bhaskara's manuscript he sort of gives

208
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,120
bhaskara's manuscript he sort of gives
 

209
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,550
bhaskara's manuscript he sort of gives
this proof just gives the diagram and

210
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
this proof just gives the diagram and
 

211
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,110
this proof just gives the diagram and
then the

212
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:23,120
then the
 

213
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,750
then the
the entire uh verbal content of the

214
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:25,760
the entire uh verbal content of the
 

215
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,030
the entire uh verbal content of the
proof is he just writes under it

216
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,040
proof is he just writes under it
 

217
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,390
proof is he just writes under it
behold like that's it it's like

218
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:30,400
behold like that's it it's like
 

219
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,789
behold like that's it it's like
um there's some dispute about exactly

220
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:32,799
um there's some dispute about exactly
 

221
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,070
um there's some dispute about exactly
how accurate that is but

222
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
how accurate that is but
 

223
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,509
how accurate that is but
so then that's an interesting question

224
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:35,519
so then that's an interesting question
 

225
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,270
so then that's an interesting question
um if your proof

226
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:37,280
um if your proof
 

227
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,750
um if your proof
is a diagram if your proof is a picture

228
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:39,760
is a diagram if your proof is a picture
 

229
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,350
is a diagram if your proof is a picture
or even if your proof is like a movie of

230
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,360
or even if your proof is like a movie of
 

231
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,949
or even if your proof is like a movie of
the same pieces like coming together in

232
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:42,959
the same pieces like coming together in
 

233
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,070
the same pieces like coming together in
two different formations to make two

234
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,080
two different formations to make two
 

235
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,190
two different formations to make two
different things is that

236
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,200
different things is that
 

237
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,229
different things is that
language i'm not sure i have a good

238
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:46,239
language i'm not sure i have a good
 

239
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,869
language i'm not sure i have a good
answer what do you think i think it is

240
00:03:48,869 --> 00:03:48,879
answer what do you think i think it is
 

241
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,589
answer what do you think i think it is
i think the process of manipulating

242
00:03:53,589 --> 00:03:53,599
i think the process of manipulating
 

243
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,830
i think the process of manipulating
the visual elements is the same as the

244
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:55,840
the visual elements is the same as the
 

245
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,789
the visual elements is the same as the
process of

246
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:56,799
process of
 

247
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,350
process of
manipulating the elements of language

248
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
manipulating the elements of language
 

249
00:03:59,360 --> 00:03:59,990
manipulating the elements of language
and i think

250
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,000
and i think
 

251
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,149
and i think
probably the manipulating the

252
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:02,159
probably the manipulating the
 

253
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,630
probably the manipulating the
aggregation the stitching stuff together

254
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,640
aggregation the stitching stuff together
 

255
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,149
aggregation the stitching stuff together
is the important part it's not the

256
00:04:06,149 --> 00:04:06,159
is the important part it's not the
 

257
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,309
is the important part it's not the
actual specific elements it's more

258
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:08,319
actual specific elements it's more
 

259
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,470
actual specific elements it's more
more like to me language is a process

260
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:10,480
more like to me language is a process
 

261
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,710
more like to me language is a process
and math is a process it's not a

262
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:12,720
and math is a process it's not a
 

263
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,710
and math is a process it's not a
it's not just specific symbols it's uh

264
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:16,720
it's not just specific symbols it's uh
 

265
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,710
it's not just specific symbols it's uh
it's in action it's it's ultimately

266
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:20,720
it's in action it's it's ultimately
 

267
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,590
it's in action it's it's ultimately
created through action through change

268
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
created through action through change
 

269
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,590
created through action through change
and uh so you're constantly evolving

270
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:25,600
and uh so you're constantly evolving
 

271
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,150
and uh so you're constantly evolving
ideas

272
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,160
ideas
 

273
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,070
ideas
of course we kind of attach there's a

274
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
of course we kind of attach there's a
 

275
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,830
of course we kind of attach there's a
certain destination you arrive to that

276
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:29,840
certain destination you arrive to that
 

277
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,909
certain destination you arrive to that
you attach to and you call that a proof

278
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
you attach to and you call that a proof
 

279
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,590
you attach to and you call that a proof
but that's not that doesn't need to end

280
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:33,600
but that's not that doesn't need to end
 

281
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,510
but that's not that doesn't need to end
there it's just at the end of the

282
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:35,520
there it's just at the end of the
 

283
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,870
there it's just at the end of the
chapter and then it goes on

284
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:36,880
chapter and then it goes on
 

285
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,350
chapter and then it goes on
and on and on in that kind of way but i

286
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:39,360
and on and on in that kind of way but i
 

287
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,270
and on and on in that kind of way but i
got to ask you about geometry and it's a

288
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:41,280
got to ask you about geometry and it's a
 

289
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,070
got to ask you about geometry and it's a
prominent

290
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
prominent
 

291
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,469
prominent
topic in your new book shape so for me

292
00:04:46,469 --> 00:04:46,479
topic in your new book shape so for me
 

293
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,469
topic in your new book shape so for me
geometry is the thing just like as

294
00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:48,479
geometry is the thing just like as
 

295
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,629
geometry is the thing just like as
you're saying made me fall in love with

296
00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:50,639
you're saying made me fall in love with
 

297
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,189
you're saying made me fall in love with
mathematics when i was young

298
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:53,199
mathematics when i was young
 

299
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,030
mathematics when i was young
so being able to prove something

300
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:55,040
so being able to prove something
 

301
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,710
so being able to prove something
visually

00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
visually
 

303
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,830
visually
just did something to my brain that

304
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
just did something to my brain that
 

305
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,469
just did something to my brain that
it had this it planted this hopeful seed

306
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
it had this it planted this hopeful seed
 

307
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:02,870
it had this it planted this hopeful seed
that

308
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
that
 

309
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,070
that
you can understand the world like

310
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:06,080
you can understand the world like
 

311
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,189
you can understand the world like
perfectly

312
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:07,199
perfectly

maybe it's an ocd thing but from a

314
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
maybe it's an ocd thing but from a
 

315
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,310
maybe it's an ocd thing but from a
mathematics perspective

316
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:10,320
mathematics perspective
 

317
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,629
mathematics perspective
like humans are messy the world is messy

318
00:05:12,629 --> 00:05:12,639
like humans are messy the world is messy
 

319
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,390
like humans are messy the world is messy
biology is messy

320
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:14,400
biology is messy

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,390
biology is messy
your parents are yelling or making you

your parents are yelling or making you
 

323
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,430
your parents are yelling or making you
do stuff but

do stuff but
 

325
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,510
do stuff but
you know you can cut through all that bs

326
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:19,520
you know you can cut through all that bs
 

327
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,189
you know you can cut through all that bs
and truly understand the world through

and truly understand the world through
 

329
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,230
and truly understand the world through
mathematics and

330
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
mathematics and
 

331
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,189
mathematics and
nothing like geometry did that for me

332
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:25,199
nothing like geometry did that for me
 

333
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,909
nothing like geometry did that for me
for you

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,150
for you
you did not immediately fall in love

336
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,160
you did not immediately fall in love
 

337
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,830
you did not immediately fall in love
with geometry so

338
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:29,840
with geometry so
 

339
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,950
with geometry so
uh how do you how do you think about

340
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:32,960
uh how do you how do you think about
 

341
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,909
uh how do you how do you think about
geometry

342
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:33,919
geometry
 

343
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,629
geometry
why is it a special field in mathematics

344
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:36,639
why is it a special field in mathematics
 

345
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,749
why is it a special field in mathematics
and

346
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
and
 

347
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,270
and
how did you fall in love with it if you

348
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:39,280
how did you fall in love with it if you
 

349
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,430
how did you fall in love with it if you
have wow you've given me like a lot to

350
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,440
have wow you've given me like a lot to
 

351
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,070
have wow you've given me like a lot to
say and

352
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:42,080
say and
 

353
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,350
say and
certainly the experience that you

354
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:43,360
certainly the experience that you
 

355
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,590
certainly the experience that you
describe is so

356
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:45,600
describe is so
 

357
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,670
describe is so
typical but there's two versions of it

358
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:47,680
typical but there's two versions of it
 

359
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,110
typical but there's two versions of it
um you know one thing i say in the book

360
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:49,120
um you know one thing i say in the book
 

361
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,590
um you know one thing i say in the book
is that geometry is the cilantro of math

362
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,600
is that geometry is the cilantro of math
 

363
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,950
is that geometry is the cilantro of math
people are not neutral about it there's

364
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:52,960
people are not neutral about it there's
 

365
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,029
people are not neutral about it there's
people who are like who like you

366
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:55,039
people who are like who like you
 

367
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,469
people who are like who like you
are like the rest of it i could take or

368
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
are like the rest of it i could take or
 

369
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,309
are like the rest of it i could take or
leave but then at this one moment

370
00:05:58,309 --> 00:05:58,319
leave but then at this one moment
 

371
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,309
leave but then at this one moment
it made sense this class made sense why

372
00:06:00,309 --> 00:06:00,319
it made sense this class made sense why
 

373
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,670
it made sense this class made sense why
wasn't it all like that there's other

374
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:01,680
wasn't it all like that there's other
 

375
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,270
wasn't it all like that there's other
people i can tell you because they come

376
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:03,280
people i can tell you because they come
 

377
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,550
people i can tell you because they come
and talk to me all the time

378
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
and talk to me all the time
 

379
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,629
and talk to me all the time
who are like i understood all the stuff

380
00:06:06,629 --> 00:06:06,639
who are like i understood all the stuff
 

381
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,990
who are like i understood all the stuff
we were trying to figure out what x was

382
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:08,000
we were trying to figure out what x was
 

383
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,189
we were trying to figure out what x was
there's some mystery or trying to solve

384
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
there's some mystery or trying to solve
 

385
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,710
there's some mystery or trying to solve
it x is a number i figured it out but

386
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:10,720
it x is a number i figured it out but
 

387
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,150
it x is a number i figured it out but
then there was this geometry like what

388
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:12,160
then there was this geometry like what
 

389
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,790
then there was this geometry like what
was that

390
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:12,800
was that
 

391
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,990
was that
what happened that year like i didn't

392
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,000
what happened that year like i didn't
 

393
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,430
what happened that year like i didn't
get it i was like lost the whole year

394
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:15,440
get it i was like lost the whole year
 

395
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,029
get it i was like lost the whole year
and i didn't understand like why we even

396
00:06:17,029 --> 00:06:17,039
and i didn't understand like why we even
 

397
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:18,070
and i didn't understand like why we even
spent the time doing that

398
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:18,080
spent the time doing that
 

399
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,390
spent the time doing that
so um but what everybody agrees on is

400
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:20,400
so um but what everybody agrees on is
 

401
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,070
so um but what everybody agrees on is
that it's somehow different

402
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:22,080
that it's somehow different
 

403
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,749
that it's somehow different
right there's something special about it

404
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
right there's something special about it
 

405
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,590
right there's something special about it
um

406
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,600
um
 

407
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,710
um
we're gonna walk around in circles a

408
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:26,720
we're gonna walk around in circles a
 

409
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,390
we're gonna walk around in circles a
little bit but we'll get there you asked

410
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
little bit but we'll get there you asked
 

411
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,270
little bit but we'll get there you asked
me

412
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
me
 

413
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,550
me
um how i fell in love with math i have a

414
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:32,560
um how i fell in love with math i have a
 

415
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,070
um how i fell in love with math i have a
story about this

416
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:34,080
story about this
 

417
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,070
story about this
um when i was a

418
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
um when i was a
 

419
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,430
um when i was a
small child i don't know maybe like i

420
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:39,440
small child i don't know maybe like i
 

421
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,830
small child i don't know maybe like i
was six or seven i don't know um

422
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:41,840
was six or seven i don't know um
 

423
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,510
was six or seven i don't know um
i'm from the 70s i think you're from a

424
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:43,520
i'm from the 70s i think you're from a
 

425
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,029
i'm from the 70s i think you're from a
different decade than that but you know

426
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
different decade than that but you know
 

427
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,990
different decade than that but you know
in the 70s we

428
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:46,000
in the 70s we
 

429
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,469
in the 70s we
had them you had a cool wooden box

430
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:48,479
had them you had a cool wooden box
 

431
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,029
had them you had a cool wooden box
around your

432
00:06:49,029 --> 00:06:49,039
around your
 

433
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,469
around your
stereo that was the look everything was

434
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:50,479
stereo that was the look everything was
 

435
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,469
stereo that was the look everything was
dark wood uh and the box had a bunch of

436
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
dark wood uh and the box had a bunch of
 

437
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,430
dark wood uh and the box had a bunch of
holes in it

438
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:53,440
holes in it
 

439
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,550
holes in it
to lift the sound out yeah um and the

440
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:56,560
to lift the sound out yeah um and the
 

441
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,270
to lift the sound out yeah um and the
holes

442
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:57,280
holes
 

443
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,510
holes
were in this rectangular array a six by

444
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
were in this rectangular array a six by
 

445
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,029
were in this rectangular array a six by
eight array

446
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:01,039
eight array
 

447
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,029
eight array
um of holes and i was just kind of like

448
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
um of holes and i was just kind of like
 

449
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,790
um of holes and i was just kind of like
you know zoning out in the living room

450
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:04,800
you know zoning out in the living room
 

451
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,909
you know zoning out in the living room
as kids do

452
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
as kids do
 

453
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,150
as kids do
looking at this six by eight rectangular

454
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
looking at this six by eight rectangular
 

455
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,749
looking at this six by eight rectangular
array of holes

456
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
array of holes
 

457
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,830
array of holes
and if you like just by kind of like

458
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:11,840
and if you like just by kind of like
 

459
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,350
and if you like just by kind of like
focusing in and out just by kind of

460
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:13,360
focusing in and out just by kind of
 

461
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,950
focusing in and out just by kind of
looking at this box looking at this

462
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:14,960
looking at this box looking at this
 

463
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,550
looking at this box looking at this
rectangle

464
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
rectangle
 

465
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,670
rectangle
i was like well there's six rows of

466
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
i was like well there's six rows of
 

467
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,670
i was like well there's six rows of
eight holes each

468
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:21,680
eight holes each
 

469
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,230
eight holes each
but there's also eight columns of six

470
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:24,240
but there's also eight columns of six
 

471
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,510
but there's also eight columns of six
holes each

472
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:25,520
holes each
 

473
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,029
holes each
whoa so eight sixes and six eighths it's

474
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:29,039
whoa so eight sixes and six eighths it's
 

475
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:29,510
whoa so eight sixes and six eighths it's
just like the

476
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:29,520
just like the
 

477
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,469
just like the
section bruce you were just talking

478
00:07:30,469 --> 00:07:30,479
section bruce you were just talking
 

479
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,469
section bruce you were just talking
about but it's the same holes it's the

480
00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:32,479
about but it's the same holes it's the
 

481
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,230
about but it's the same holes it's the
same 48 holes that's how many there are

482
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:34,240
same 48 holes that's how many there are
 

483
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,909
same 48 holes that's how many there are
no matter of whether you count them

484
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
no matter of whether you count them
 

485
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,070
no matter of whether you count them
as rows or count them as columns and

486
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
as rows or count them as columns and
 

487
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,430
as rows or count them as columns and
this was like

488
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:39,440
this was like
 

489
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,230
this was like
unbelievable to me am i allowed to cost

490
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:42,240
unbelievable to me am i allowed to cost
 

491
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,589
unbelievable to me am i allowed to cost
on your podcast i don't know if that's

492
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:43,599
on your podcast i don't know if that's
 

493
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,189
on your podcast i don't know if that's
uh we fcc regulated

494
00:07:45,189 --> 00:07:45,199
uh we fcc regulated
 

495
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,110
uh we fcc regulated
okay it was [\h__\h] unbelievable okay

so two different perspectives and the

502
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
so two different perspectives and the
 

503
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,150
so two different perspectives and the
same physical reality

504
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,160
same physical reality
 

505
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,070
same physical reality
exactly and it's just as you say um

00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
exactly and it's just as you say um
 

507
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,230
exactly and it's just as you say um
you know i knew that 6 times 8 was the

508
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,240
you know i knew that 6 times 8 was the
 

509
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,070
you know i knew that 6 times 8 was the
same as 8 times 6 when i knew my times

510
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,080
same as 8 times 6 when i knew my times

00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:04,479
table like i knew that that was a fact
 

513
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,150
table like i knew that that was a fact
but did i really know it until that

514
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,160
but did i really know it until that
 

515
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,309
but did i really know it until that
moment that's the question

516
00:08:08,309 --> 00:08:08,319
moment that's the question
 

517
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,830
moment that's the question
right i knew that i sort of knew that

518
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
right i knew that i sort of knew that
 

519
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,430
right i knew that i sort of knew that
the times table was symmetric

520
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:11,440
the times table was symmetric
 

521
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,189
the times table was symmetric
but i didn't know why that was the case

522
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
but i didn't know why that was the case
 

523
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,550
but i didn't know why that was the case
until that moment and in that moment i

524
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
until that moment and in that moment i
 

525
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,990
until that moment and in that moment i
could see like oh i didn't have to have

526
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,000
could see like oh i didn't have to have
 

527

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:46,800
when we say something is symmetrical
 

631
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,710
when we say something is symmetrical
we usually means it has what's called an

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:48,720
we usually means it has what's called an
 

633
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,990
we usually means it has what's called an
axis of symmetry maybe

634
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,000
axis of symmetry maybe
 

635
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,670
axis of symmetry maybe
like the left half of it looks the same

636
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:51,680
like the left half of it looks the same
 

637
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,670
like the left half of it looks the same
as the right half that would be like a

639
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,269
as the right half that would be like a
left-right axis of symmetry or maybe the

640
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
left-right axis of symmetry or maybe the
 

641
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,870
left-right axis of symmetry or maybe the
top half looks like the bottom half

top half looks like the bottom half
 

643
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,389
top half looks like the bottom half
or both right maybe there's sort of a

644
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
or both right maybe there's sort of a
 

645
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,750
or both right maybe there's sort of a
four-fold symmetry where the top looks

646
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
four-fold symmetry where the top looks
 

647
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,030

um one of my first loves in mathematics

662
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:14,800
um one of my first loves in mathematics
 

663
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,470
um one of my first loves in mathematics
what i thought about a lot when i was

664
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
what i thought about a lot when i was
 

665
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,670
what i thought about a lot when i was
in college but the notion of symmetry is

666
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:19,680
in college but the notion of symmetry is

actually
much more general than the things that

much more general than the things that
 

671
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,350

we would call symmetry if we were

00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
um you know nowadays in
 

681
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,430
um you know nowadays in
in math um

682
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:35,440
in math um
 

683
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,630
in math um
we could use a symmetry to to refer to

684
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
we could use a symmetry to to refer to
 

685
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,430
we could use a symmetry to to refer to
any kind of transformation of an image

703
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,470

that i would call a symmetry it's not a

00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:00,480
that i would call a symmetry it's not a
 

705
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,190

symmetry in the classical sense
 

707
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,590
symmetry in the classical sense
but it's a well-defined transformation

708
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:05,600
but it's a well-defined transformation
 

709
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,230
but it's a well-defined transformation
that

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,949
mathematical idea
in some sense i might even say the idea

754
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
in some sense i might even say the idea
 

755
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,110
in some sense i might even say the idea
that dominates contemporary mathematics

756
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:51,120
that dominates contemporary mathematics
 

757
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,470
that dominates contemporary mathematics
or by contemporary by the way i mean

758
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
or by contemporary by the way i mean
 

759
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,389
or by contemporary by the way i mean
like the last like 150 years we're on a

00:11:54,389 --> 00:11:54,399
like the last like 150 years we're on a
 

761
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,750
like the last like 150 years we're on a
very long time scale

very long time scale
 

763
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,030
very long time scale
in math i don't mean like yesterday i

764
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:57,040
in math i don't mean like yesterday i
 

765
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,590
in math i don't mean like yesterday i
mean like a century or so

766
00:11:59,590 --> 00:11:59,600
mean like a century or so
 

767
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,509
mean like a century or so
up till now is this idea that's a

00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:01,519
up till now is this idea that's a
 

769
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,710
up till now is this idea that's a
fundamental question of

00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:02,720
fundamental question of
 

771
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,910
fundamental question of
when do we consider two things to be the

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:05,920
when do we consider two things to be the
 

773
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,949
when do we consider two things to be the
same

same
 

775
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:07,910

um are those the same or different well
 

787
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,470
um are those the same or different well
you might say like well look there's two

788
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:20,480
you might say like well look there's two
 

789
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,350
you might say like well look there's two
different things this one's over here

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,310
different things this one's over here
this one's over there

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,069
this one's over there
on the other hand if you prove a theorem

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,509
about this one
it's probably still true about this one

798
00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:27,519
it's probably still true about this one
 

799
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,190
it's probably still true about this one
if it has like all the same side lanes

800
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
if it has like all the same side lanes
 

801
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,629
if it has like all the same side lanes
and angles and like looks exactly the

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:32,720
the term of art if you want it you would

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,629
the term of art if you want it you would
say they're congruent

808

say they're congruent
 

809
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,230
say they're congruent
but one way of saying it is there's a

810
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
but one way of saying it is there's a
 

811
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,990
but one way of saying it is there's a
symmetry called translation which just

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,629
means
move everything three inches to the left

816
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:40,639
move everything three inches to the left
 

817
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,069
move everything three inches to the left
and we want

00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:42,079
and we want
 

819
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,470
and we want
all of our theories to be translation

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,550
invariant
what that means is that if you prove a

824
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:46,560
what that means is that if you prove a
 

825
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,710
what that means is that if you prove a
theorem about a thing if it's over here

826
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:48,720
theorem about a thing if it's over here
 

827
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,310
theorem about a thing if it's over here
and then you move it three inches to the

828
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:50,320
and then you move it three inches to the
 

829
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,870
and then you move it three inches to the
left it would be kind of weird if all of

830
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:52,880
left it would be kind of weird if all of
 

831
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,110
left it would be kind of weird if all of
your theorems like didn't still

832
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,120
your theorems like didn't still
 

833
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,430
your theorems like didn't still
work so this question of like what are

834
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
work so this question of like what are
 

835
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,550
work so this question of like what are
the symmetries

836
00:12:58,550 --> 00:12:58,560
the symmetries
 

837
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,750
the symmetries
and which things that you want to study

838
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
and which things that you want to study
 

839
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,509
and which things that you want to study
or invariant under those symmetries is

840
00:13:01,509 --> 00:13:01,519
or invariant under those symmetries is
 

841
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,629
or invariant under those symmetries is
absolutely fundamental but this is

842
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:02,639
absolutely fundamental but this is
 

843
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,910
absolutely fundamental but this is
getting a little abstract right

844
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
getting a little abstract right
 

845
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,269
getting a little abstract right
it's not at all abstract i think this

846
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
it's not at all abstract i think this
 

847
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,230
it's not at all abstract i think this
this this is completely central

848
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:08,240
this this is completely central
 

849
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,069
this this is completely central
to everything i think about in terms of

850
00:13:10,069 --> 00:13:10,079
to everything i think about in terms of
 

851
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:11,590
to everything i think about in terms of
artificial intelligence i don't know if

852
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:11,600
artificial intelligence i don't know if
 

853
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,230
artificial intelligence i don't know if
you know about

854
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
you know about
 

855
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,389
you know about
the mnist dataset with handwritten

856
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
the mnist dataset with handwritten
 

857
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,230
the mnist dataset with handwritten
digits yeah

858
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:16,240
digits yeah
 

859
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,150
digits yeah
and uh you know i don't smoke much weed

860
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:20,160
and uh you know i don't smoke much weed
 

861
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,790
and uh you know i don't smoke much weed
or any really but it certainly feels

862
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
or any really but it certainly feels
 

863
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,230
or any really but it certainly feels
like it when i look at eminence and

864
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:24,240
like it when i look at eminence and
 

865
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,230
like it when i look at eminence and
think about this stuff which is like

866
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:26,240
think about this stuff which is like
 

867
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,590
think about this stuff which is like
what's the difference between one and

868
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:27,600
what's the difference between one and
 

869
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,550
what's the difference between one and
two and why are all the twos

870
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:30,560
two and why are all the twos
 

871
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,829
two and why are all the twos
similar to each other what kind of

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:32,839
similar to each other what kind of
 

873
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,389
similar to each other what kind of

875
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,829

and what kind of transformations are
 

881
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,470
and what kind of transformations are
those that make it different

and so i kind of stared and wonder
 

917
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,910
and so i kind of stared and wonder

00:14:57,829 --> 00:14:57,839
yeah right so here's what would be easy
 

955
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,750
yeah right so here's what would be easy
if if if humans

right it would be very easy to like
 

971
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,150
right it would be very easy to like
write a program that

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,670
we're doing when you recognize the digit
one and distinguish it from the digit

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:27,920
incorporating
 

989
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,710
incorporating
uh one of the types of symmetries that

990
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:30,720
uh one of the types of symmetries that
 

991
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,430
uh one of the types of symmetries that
we

992
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:31,440
we
 

993
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,629
we
understand now i would say that

994
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
understand now i would say that
 

995
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,110
understand now i would say that
i would be shocked if there was some

996
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:37,120
i would be shocked if there was some
 

997
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,749
i would be shocked if there was some
kind of

998
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:37,759
kind of
 

999
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,590
kind of
classical symmetry type formulation that

1000
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:41,600
classical symmetry type formulation that
 

1001
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,590
classical symmetry type formulation that
captured what we're doing when we tell

1002
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:43,600
captured what we're doing when we tell
 

1003
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,590
captured what we're doing when we tell
the difference between a two and a three

1004
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:45,600
the difference between a two and a three
 

1005
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,590
the difference between a two and a three
to be honest i think i think what we're

1006
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:47,600
to be honest i think i think what we're
 

1007
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,189
to be honest i think i think what we're
doing is actually more

1008
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:49,199
doing is actually more
 

1009
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,629
doing is actually more
complicated than that i feel like it

1010
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:50,639
complicated than that i feel like it
 

1011
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,509
complicated than that i feel like it
must be they're so simple these numbers

1012
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:53,519
must be they're so simple these numbers
 

1013
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,230
must be they're so simple these numbers
i mean they're

1014
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
i mean they're
 

1015
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,230
i mean they're
really geometric objects like we can

1016
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:56,240
really geometric objects like we can
 

1017
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,470
really geometric objects like we can
draw out one two three

1018
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:58,480
draw out one two three
 

1019
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,389
draw out one two three
it does seem like it's it should be

1020
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:00,399
it does seem like it's it should be
 

1021
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,550
it does seem like it's it should be
formalizable that's why it's so

1022
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:02,560
formalizable that's why it's so
 

1023
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,470
formalizable that's why it's so
strange you think it's formalizable when

1024
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:04,480
strange you think it's formalizable when
 

1025
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,150
strange you think it's formalizable when
something stops being a two and starts

1026
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
something stops being a two and starts
 

1027
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,509
something stops being a two and starts
being a three right you can imagine

1028
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
being a three right you can imagine
 

1029
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,110
being a three right you can imagine
something continuously deforming from

1030
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:09,120
something continuously deforming from
 

1031
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,030
something continuously deforming from
being a two to a three

1032
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
being a two to a three
 

1033
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,269
being a two to a three
yeah but that's there is a moment

1034
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:15,279
yeah but that's there is a moment
 

1035
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:17,509
yeah but that's there is a moment
i have uh myself have written programs

1036
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
i have uh myself have written programs
 

1037
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,629
i have uh myself have written programs
that literally morph

1038
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:18,639
that literally morph
 

1039
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,670
that literally morph
twos and threes and so on and you watch

1040
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
twos and threes and so on and you watch
 

1041
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,829
twos and threes and so on and you watch
and there is moments that you notice

1042
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:23,839
and there is moments that you notice
 

1043
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,829
and there is moments that you notice
depending on the trajectory of that

1044
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
depending on the trajectory of that
 

1045
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:26,790
depending on the trajectory of that
transformation

1046
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
transformation
 

1047
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,069
transformation
that morphing that

1048
00:16:30,069 --> 00:16:30,079
that morphing that
 

1049
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,629
that morphing that
it uh it is a three and a two there's a

1050
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:32,639
it uh it is a three and a two there's a
 

1051
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:33,430
it uh it is a three and a two there's a
hard line

1052
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
hard line
 

1053
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,030
hard line
wait so if you ask people if you show

1054
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:35,040
wait so if you ask people if you show
 

1055
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,030
wait so if you ask people if you show
them this morph if you ask a bunch of

1056
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:37,040
them this morph if you ask a bunch of
 

1057
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,550
them this morph if you ask a bunch of
people do they all agree about where the

1058
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:38,560
people do they all agree about where the
 

1059
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,110
people do they all agree about where the
transformation

1060
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:39,120
transformation
 

1061
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,150
transformation
i'm questioning because i would be

1062
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
i'm questioning because i would be
 

1063
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,310
i'm questioning because i would be
surprised i think so oh my god okay we

1064
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
surprised i think so oh my god okay we
 

1065
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,590
surprised i think so oh my god okay we
have an empirical but here's the problem

1066
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:43,600
have an empirical but here's the problem
 

1067
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,470
have an empirical but here's the problem
dude

1068
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
dude
 

1069
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,509
dude
here's the problem that if i just showed

1070
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:47,519
here's the problem that if i just showed
 

1071
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,550
here's the problem that if i just showed
that moment that i agreed on

1072
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
that moment that i agreed on
 

1073
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,350
that moment that i agreed on
well that's not fair no but say i said

1074
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,360
well that's not fair no but say i said
 

1075
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:53,670
well that's not fair no but say i said
so

1076
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
so
 

1077
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,949
so
i want to move away from the agreement

1078
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:54,959
i want to move away from the agreement
 

1079
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:56,790
i want to move away from the agreement
because that's a fascinating uh actually

1080
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:56,800
because that's a fascinating uh actually
 

1081
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,629
because that's a fascinating uh actually
question that i want to

1082
00:16:58,629 --> 00:16:58,639
question that i want to
 

1083
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,590
question that i want to
backtrack from because i just

1084
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:01,600
backtrack from because i just
 

1085
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,350
backtrack from because i just
dogmatically said uh because

1086
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
dogmatically said uh because
 

1087
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,390
dogmatically said uh because
i could be very very wrong but the

1088
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:06,400
i could be very very wrong but the
 

1089
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,350
i could be very very wrong but the
morphing really helps that like the

1090
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,360
morphing really helps that like the
 

1091
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:09,829
morphing really helps that like the
change

1092
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
change
 

1093
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,350
change
because i mean partially because our

1094
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
because i mean partially because our
 

1095
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,590
because i mean partially because our
perception systems see this it's all

1096
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:13,600
perception systems see this it's all
 

1097
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,029
perception systems see this it's all
probably tied in there

1098
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:15,039
probably tied in there
 

1099
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,909
probably tied in there
somehow the change from one to the other

1100
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
somehow the change from one to the other
 

1101
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,669
somehow the change from one to the other
like seeing the video of it

1102
00:17:19,669 --> 00:17:19,679
like seeing the video of it
 

1103
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,590
like seeing the video of it
allows you to pinpoint the place where

1104
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
allows you to pinpoint the place where
 

1105
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,590
allows you to pinpoint the place where
two becomes a three much better

1106
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:23,600
two becomes a three much better
 

1107
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,470
two becomes a three much better
if i just showed you one picture i think

1108
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:26,480
if i just showed you one picture i think
 

1109
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,189
if i just showed you one picture i think
uh

1110
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:27,199
uh
 

1111
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,310
uh
you you might you might really

1112
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,320
you you might you might really
 

1113
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,029
you you might you might really
really struggle you might call a seven

1114
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:33,039
really struggle you might call a seven
 

1115
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,070
really struggle you might call a seven
like

1116
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
like
 

1117
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,430
like
i i think there's something uh also that

1118
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:37,440
i i think there's something uh also that
 

1119
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,350
i i think there's something uh also that
we don't often think about which is

1120
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,360
we don't often think about which is
 

1121
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,590
we don't often think about which is
it's not just about the static image

1122
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:41,600
it's not just about the static image
 

1123
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,110
it's not just about the static image
it's the transformation

1124
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,120
it's the transformation
 

1125
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,430
it's the transformation
of the image or it's not a static shape

1126
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:45,440
of the image or it's not a static shape
 

1127
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,510
of the image or it's not a static shape
it's the transformation of the shape

1128
00:17:47,510 --> 00:17:47,520
it's the transformation of the shape
 

1129
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,310
it's the transformation of the shape
there's something in the movement that's

1130
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
there's something in the movement that's
 

1131
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,510
there's something in the movement that's
seems to be

1132
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
seems to be
 

1133
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,590
seems to be
not just about our perception system but

1134
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:53,600
not just about our perception system but
 

1135
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,430
not just about our perception system but
fundamental to our cognition like how we

1136
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
fundamental to our cognition like how we
 

1137
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,070
fundamental to our cognition like how we
think stuff

1138
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
think stuff
 

1139
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,870
think stuff
about stuff yeah and it's so and and you

1140
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
about stuff yeah and it's so and and you
 

1141
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,070
about stuff yeah and it's so and and you
know that's part of geometry

1142
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,080
know that's part of geometry
 

1143
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,390
know that's part of geometry
too and in fact again another insight of

1144
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
too and in fact again another insight of
 

1145
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,230
too and in fact again another insight of
modern geometry is this idea that

1146
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
modern geometry is this idea that
 

1147
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,990
modern geometry is this idea that
you know maybe we would naively think

1148
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
you know maybe we would naively think
 

1149
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,510
you know maybe we would naively think
we're going to study

1150
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
we're going to study
 

1151
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,390
we're going to study
i don't know let's you know like

1152
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:08,400
i don't know let's you know like
 

1153
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,510
i don't know let's you know like
poincare we're going to study the

1154
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:09,520
poincare we're going to study the
 

1155
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,950
poincare we're going to study the
three-body problem we're going to study

1156
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:10,960
three-body problem we're going to study
 

1157
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,310
three-body problem we're going to study
sort of like three

1158
00:18:12,310 --> 00:18:12,320
sort of like three
 

1159
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,390
sort of like three
objects in space moving around subject

1160
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:14,400
objects in space moving around subject
 

1161
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,750
objects in space moving around subject
only to the force of each other's

1162
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:15,760
only to the force of each other's
 

1163
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,510
only to the force of each other's
gravity which sounds very simple right

1164
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:17,520
gravity which sounds very simple right
 

1165
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,630
gravity which sounds very simple right
and if you don't know about this problem

1166
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:18,640
and if you don't know about this problem
 

1167
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,669
and if you don't know about this problem
you're probably like okay so you just

1168
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
you're probably like okay so you just
 

1169
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:20,789
you're probably like okay so you just
like put it in your computer and see

1170
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:20,799
like put it in your computer and see
 

1171
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,789
like put it in your computer and see
what they do well guess what that's like

1172
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
what they do well guess what that's like
 

1173
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,789
what they do well guess what that's like
a problem that poincare won a huge prize

1174
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:24,799
a problem that poincare won a huge prize
 

1175
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,230
a problem that poincare won a huge prize
for like making the first real progress

1176
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:26,240
for like making the first real progress
 

1177
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,350
for like making the first real progress
on in the 1880s

1178
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
on in the 1880s
 

1179
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,510
on in the 1880s
and we still don't know that much about

1180
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:29,520
and we still don't know that much about
 

1181
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,470
and we still don't know that much about
it

1182
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
it
 

1183
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,750
it
um 150 years later i mean it's a

1184
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:33,760
um 150 years later i mean it's a
 

1185
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,150
um 150 years later i mean it's a
humongous mystery you just open the door

1186
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:36,160
humongous mystery you just open the door
 

1187
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,190
humongous mystery you just open the door
and we're going to

1188
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
and we're going to
 

1189
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,669
and we're going to
walk right in before we return to uh

1190
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
walk right in before we return to uh
 

1191
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,870
walk right in before we return to uh
symmetry

1192
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:40,880
symmetry
 

1193
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,750
symmetry
what's the uh who's ponca and what's uh

1194
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:43,760
what's the uh who's ponca and what's uh
 

1195
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,430
what's the uh who's ponca and what's uh
what's this conjecture that he came up

1196
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:45,440
what's this conjecture that he came up
 

1197
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,470
what's this conjecture that he came up
with

1198
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:46,480
with
 

1199
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,870
with
oh why is this such a hard problem okay

1200
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
oh why is this such a hard problem okay
 

1201
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,470
oh why is this such a hard problem okay
so poincare

1202
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:50,480
so poincare
 

1203
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,230
so poincare
he ends up being a major figure in the

1204
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:52,240
he ends up being a major figure in the
 

1205
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,590
he ends up being a major figure in the
book and i don't i didn't even really

1206
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:53,600
book and i don't i didn't even really
 

1207
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,029
book and i don't i didn't even really
intend for him to be such a big figure

1208
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:55,039
intend for him to be such a big figure
 

1209
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,990
intend for him to be such a big figure
but he's so

1210
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,000
but he's so
 

1211
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,270
but he's so
he's um he's first and foremost a

1212
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,280
he's um he's first and foremost a
 

1213
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,190
he's um he's first and foremost a
geometer right so he's a mathematician

1214
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:01,200
geometer right so he's a mathematician
 

1215
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,549
geometer right so he's a mathematician
who kind of comes up

1216
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:02,559
who kind of comes up
 

1217
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,070
who kind of comes up
in late 19th century france

1218
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:06,080
in late 19th century france
 

1219
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,310
in late 19th century france
um at a time when french math was really

1220
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
um at a time when french math was really
 

1221
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,750
um at a time when french math was really
starting to flower actually i learned a

1222
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
starting to flower actually i learned a
 

1223
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:09,990
starting to flower actually i learned a
lot

1224
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
lot
 

1225
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,270
lot
i mean you know in math we're not really

1226
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:11,280
i mean you know in math we're not really
 

1227
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,950
i mean you know in math we're not really
trained on our own history when we get a

1228
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:12,960
trained on our own history when we get a
 

1229
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,630
trained on our own history when we get a
phd in math one about math so i learned

1230
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:14,640
phd in math one about math so i learned
 

1231
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,110
phd in math one about math so i learned
a lot

1232
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
a lot
 

1233
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,150
a lot
there's this whole kind of moment where

1234
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
there's this whole kind of moment where
 

1235
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,750
there's this whole kind of moment where
france has just been

1236
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
france has just been
 

1237
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,070
france has just been
beaten in the franco-prussian war and

1238
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,080
beaten in the franco-prussian war and
 

1239
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,430
beaten in the franco-prussian war and
they're like oh my god what did we do

1240
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
they're like oh my god what did we do
 

1241
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,470
they're like oh my god what did we do
wrong and they were like

1242
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
wrong and they were like
 

1243
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,630
wrong and they were like
we got to get strong in math like the

1244
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:26,640
we got to get strong in math like the
 

1245
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,990
we got to get strong in math like the
germans we have to be like more like the

1246
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:28,000
germans we have to be like more like the
 

1247
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,510
germans we have to be like more like the
germans so this never happens to us

1248
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
germans so this never happens to us
 

1249
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,470
germans so this never happens to us
again so it's very much

1250
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:30,480
again so it's very much
 

1251
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,830
again so it's very much
it's like the sputnik moment you know

1252
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:31,840
it's like the sputnik moment you know
 

1253
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,350
it's like the sputnik moment you know
like what happens in america in the 50s

1254
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
like what happens in america in the 50s
 

1255
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,310
like what happens in america in the 50s
and 60s

1256
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:34,320
and 60s
 

1257
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,510
and 60s
uh with the soviet union this is

1258
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:35,520
uh with the soviet union this is
 

1259
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,190
uh with the soviet union this is
happening to france and they're trying

1260
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
happening to france and they're trying
 

1261
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,470
happening to france and they're trying
to kind of like

1262
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:38,480
to kind of like
 

1263
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,710
to kind of like
instantly like modernize that that's

1264
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:40,720
instantly like modernize that that's
 

1265
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,750
instantly like modernize that that's
fascinating

1266
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:41,760
fascinating
 

1267
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,190
fascinating
the humans and mathematics are

1268
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:43,200
the humans and mathematics are
 

1269
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,510
the humans and mathematics are
intricately connected to the history

1270
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:45,520
intricately connected to the history
 

1271
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,710
intricately connected to the history
of humans the cold war is

1272
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:48,720
of humans the cold war is
 

1273
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,750
of humans the cold war is
uh i think fundamental to the way people

1274
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:51,760
uh i think fundamental to the way people
 

1275
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,070
uh i think fundamental to the way people
saw

1276
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:52,080
saw
 

1277
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,110
saw
science and math in the soviet union i

1278
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:55,120
science and math in the soviet union i
 

1279
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:55,990
science and math in the soviet union i
don't know if that was true in the

1280
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:56,000
don't know if that was true in the
 

1281
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,510
don't know if that was true in the
united states but certainly was in the

1282
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:57,520
united states but certainly was in the
 

1283
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,390
united states but certainly was in the
soviet union

1284
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
soviet union
 

1285
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,590
soviet union
it definitely was and i would love to

1286
00:19:59,590 --> 00:19:59,600
it definitely was and i would love to
 

1287
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,950
it definitely was and i would love to
hear more about how it was in the soviet

1288
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:00,960
hear more about how it was in the soviet
 

1289
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,430
hear more about how it was in the soviet
union

1290
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:01,440
union
 

1291
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,669
union
i mean there's uh and we'll talk about

1292
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
i mean there's uh and we'll talk about
 

1293
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,870
i mean there's uh and we'll talk about
the the olympia

1294
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:04,880
the the olympia
 

1295
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,830
the the olympia
i just remember that there was this

1296
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
i just remember that there was this
 

1297
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,669
i just remember that there was this
feeling

1298
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:09,679
feeling
 

1299
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:14,310
feeling
like the world hung in a balance

1300
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
like the world hung in a balance
 

1301
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,669
like the world hung in a balance
and you could save the world

1302
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
and you could save the world
 

1303
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,230
and you could save the world
with the tools of science and

1304
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:20,240
with the tools of science and
 

1305
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,270
with the tools of science and
mathematics

1306

was like the super power

1308
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
was like the super power
 

1309
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,669
was like the super power
that fuels science and so like

1310
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:27,679
that fuels science and so like
 

1311

that fuels science and so like
people were seen as you know people in

1312

they just throw a ball into a basket
 

1321
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,470
they just throw a ball into a basket
so like there's not what people really

1322
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
so like there's not what people really
 

1323
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,830
so like there's not what people really
enjoy about sports

1324
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:43,840
enjoy about sports
 

1325
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,110

the highest level
 

1329
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,149
the highest level
but when you take that with mathematics

1330
00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:50,159
but when you take that with mathematics
 

1331
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,390
but when you take that with mathematics
and science people also enjoyed

1332
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
and science people also enjoyed
 

1333
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,149
and science people also enjoyed
excellence in science and mathematics

1334

excellence in science and mathematics
 

1335
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,270
excellence in science and mathematics
and the soviet union

and the soviet union
 

1337
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,750

but there's an extra sense that that
 

1339
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,710
but there's an extra sense that that
excellence would

1340
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
excellence would
 

1341
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,470
excellence would
lead to a better world so

1342
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:02,480
lead to a better world so
 

1343

1498
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:38,400
the way people
 

1499
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,470
the way people
thought about math in those times in the

1500
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
thought about math in those times in the
 

1501
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,310
thought about math in those times in the
early 19th century

1502
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
early 19th century
 

1503
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,390
early 19th century
was wound up with as you say romanticism

1504
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
was wound up with as you say romanticism
 

1505
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,590
was wound up with as you say romanticism
i mean that's when the romantic

1506
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:45,600
i mean that's when the romantic
 

1507
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,909
i mean that's when the romantic
movement takes place and he really

1508
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:47,919
movement takes place and he really
 

1509
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:48,870
movement takes place and he really
outlines how

1510
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
outlines how
 

1511
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,430
outlines how
people were were predisposed to think

1512
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
people were were predisposed to think
 

1513
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,950
people were were predisposed to think
about mathematics in that way because

1514
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:52,960
about mathematics in that way because
 

1515
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,230
about mathematics in that way because
they thought about poetry that way and

1516
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
they thought about poetry that way and
 

1517
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,590
they thought about poetry that way and

they thought about music that way
 

1519
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,590
they thought about music that way
it was the mood of the era to think

1520
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:57,600
it was the mood of the era to think
 

1521
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,190
it was the mood of the era to think
about we're reaching for the

1522
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
about we're reaching for the
 

1523
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,789
about we're reaching for the
transcendent we're sort of reaching for

1524
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
transcendent we're sort of reaching for
 

1525
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:01,430
transcendent we're sort of reaching for
sort of direct

1526
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:01,440
sort of direct
 

1527
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,750
sort of direct
contact with the divine and so part of

1528
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:03,760
contact with the divine and so part of
 

1529
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,510
contact with the divine and so part of
the reason that we think of gawa that

1530
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:05,520
the reason that we think of gawa that
 

1531
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:05,909
the reason that we think of gawa that
way

1532
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:05,919
way
 

1533
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:07,990
way
was because gawa himself was a creature

1534
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
was because gawa himself was a creature
 

1535
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,230
was because gawa himself was a creature
of that era and he romanticized himself

the fire within him about the
 

1553
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,149
the fire within him about the
mathematics and you know so he

1554
00:24:24,149 --> 00:24:24,159
mathematics and you know so he
 

1555
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,350
mathematics and you know so he
so it's just as you say that

1556
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
so it's just as you say that
 

1557
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,510
so it's just as you say that
the math history touches human history

1558
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:29,520
the math history touches human history
 

1559
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,950
the math history touches human history
they're never separate because

1560
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
they're never separate because
 

1561
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,269
they're never separate because
math is made of people yeah i mean

1562
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
math is made of people yeah i mean
 

1563

is out like oh didn't you know about

1628
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:34,480
is out like oh didn't you know about
 

1629
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,870
is out like oh didn't you know about
this like incredibly sordid episode

1630
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
this like incredibly sordid episode
 

1631
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,269
this like incredibly sordid episode
as far as i could tell a completely

1632
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
as far as i could tell a completely
 

1633
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:39,909
as far as i could tell a completely
normal guy

1634
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:39,919
normal guy
 

1635
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,430
normal guy
but um he just kind of

1636
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:43,440
but um he just kind of
 

1637
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,390
but um he just kind of
in many ways creates uh the geometric

1638
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:46,400
in many ways creates uh the geometric
 

1639
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:46,950
in many ways creates uh the geometric
world

1640
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:46,960
world
 

1641
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,950
world
in which we live and and you know his

1642
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:48,960
in which we live and and you know his
 

1643
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,630
in which we live and and you know his
first really big success

1644
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:50,640
first really big success
 

1645
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,830
first really big success
uh is this prize paper he writes for

1646
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:53,840
uh is this prize paper he writes for
 

1647
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,110
uh is this prize paper he writes for
this prize offered by the king of sweden

1648
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
this prize offered by the king of sweden
 

1649
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,750
this prize offered by the king of sweden
for the study of the three-body problem

1650
00:25:59,750 --> 00:25:59,760
for the study of the three-body problem
 

1651
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,950
for the study of the three-body problem
um

1652
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:00,960
um
 

1653
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,230
um
the study of what we can say about yeah

1654
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
the study of what we can say about yeah
 

1655
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,029
the study of what we can say about yeah
three

1656
00:26:05,029 --> 00:26:05,039
three
 

1657
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,590
three
astronomical objects moving and what you

1658
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:07,600
astronomical objects moving and what you
 

1659
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,789
astronomical objects moving and what you
might think would be this very simple

1660
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
might think would be this very simple
 

1661
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,549
might think would be this very simple
way nothing's going on except

1662
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:10,559
way nothing's going on except
 

1663
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,190
way nothing's going on except
gravity uh releasing the three-body

1664
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:13,200
gravity uh releasing the three-body
 

1665
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,870
gravity uh releasing the three-body
problem why is it a problem

1666
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
problem why is it a problem
 

1667
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,990
problem why is it a problem
so the problem is to understand um when

1668
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:18,000
so the problem is to understand um when
 

1669
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,909
so the problem is to understand um when
this motion is stable and when it's not

1670
00:26:19,909 --> 00:26:19,919
this motion is stable and when it's not
 

1671
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,190
this motion is stable and when it's not
so stable meaning they would sort of

1672
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:21,200
so stable meaning they would sort of
 

1673
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,110
so stable meaning they would sort of
like end up in some kind of periodic

1674
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:23,120
like end up in some kind of periodic
 

1675
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,269
like end up in some kind of periodic
orbital or i guess it would mean sorry

1676
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:25,279
orbital or i guess it would mean sorry
 

1677
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,630
orbital or i guess it would mean sorry
stable would mean they never sort of fly

1678
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
stable would mean they never sort of fly
 

1679
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,070
stable would mean they never sort of fly
off far apart from each other and

1680
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,080
off far apart from each other and
 

1681
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,350
off far apart from each other and
unstable would mean like eventually they

1682
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
unstable would mean like eventually they
 

1683
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:29,990
unstable would mean like eventually they
fly apart

1684
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
fly apart
 

1685
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,990
fly apart
so understanding two bodies is much

1686
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:32,000
so understanding two bodies is much
 

1687
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,350
so understanding two bodies is much
easier yeah

1688
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:33,360
easier yeah
 

1689
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,390
easier yeah
third uh two bodies this is what

1690
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:36,400
third uh two bodies this is what
 

1691
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,909
third uh two bodies this is what
newton knew two bodies they sort of

1692
00:26:37,909 --> 00:26:37,919
newton knew two bodies they sort of
 

1693
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,830
newton knew two bodies they sort of
orbit each other and some kind of uh

1694
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
orbit each other and some kind of uh
 

1695
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,510
orbit each other and some kind of uh
uh either in an ellipse which is the

1696
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:41,520
uh either in an ellipse which is the
 

1697
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,950
uh either in an ellipse which is the
stable case you know that's what

1698
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:42,960
stable case you know that's what
 

1699
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,310
stable case you know that's what
the planets do that we know um

1700
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:46,320
the planets do that we know um
 

1701
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,950
the planets do that we know um
or uh one travels on a hyperbola around

1702
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:48,960
or uh one travels on a hyperbola around
 

1703
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,310
or uh one travels on a hyperbola around
the other that's the unstable case it

1704
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:50,320
the other that's the unstable case it
 

1705
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,990
the other that's the unstable case it
sort of like zooms in from far away sort

1706
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
sort of like zooms in from far away sort
 

1707
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,590
sort of like zooms in from far away sort
of like whips around the

1708
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:53,600
of like whips around the
 

1709
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,630
of like whips around the
heavier thing and like zooms out um

1710
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
heavier thing and like zooms out um
 

1711
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,149
heavier thing and like zooms out um
those are basically the two options so

1712
00:26:58,149 --> 00:26:58,159
those are basically the two options so
 

1713
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,990
those are basically the two options so
it's a very simple and easy to classify

1714
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,000
it's a very simple and easy to classify
 

1715
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,710
it's a very simple and easy to classify
story

1716
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
story
 

1717
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,549
story
with three bodies just the small switch

1718
00:27:02,549 --> 00:27:02,559
with three bodies just the small switch
 

1719
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,070
with three bodies just the small switch
from two to three uh

1720
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:04,080
from two to three uh
 

1721
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,750
from two to three uh
it's a complete zoo it's the first

1722
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
it's a complete zoo it's the first
 

1723
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,110
it's a complete zoo it's the first
example what we would say now is it's

1724
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
example what we would say now is it's
 

1725
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,310
example what we would say now is it's
the first example of what's called

1726
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
the first example of what's called
 

1727
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,830
the first example of what's called
chaotic dynamics

1728
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:09,840
chaotic dynamics
 

1729
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,669
chaotic dynamics
where the stable solutions and the

1730
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
where the stable solutions and the
 

1731
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,870
where the stable solutions and the
unstable solutions

1732
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:12,880
unstable solutions
 

1733
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,230
unstable solutions
they're kind of like wound in among each

1734
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:14,240
they're kind of like wound in among each
 

1735
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,549
they're kind of like wound in among each
other and a very very very tiny change

1736
00:27:16,549 --> 00:27:16,559
other and a very very very tiny change
 

1737
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,070
other and a very very very tiny change
in the initial conditions can

1738
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,080
in the initial conditions can
 

1739
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,510
in the initial conditions can
make the long-term behavior of the

1740
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:19,520
make the long-term behavior of the
 

1741
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,830
make the long-term behavior of the
system completely different so poincare

1742
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:21,840
system completely different so poincare
 

1743
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,110
system completely different so poincare
was the first to recognize that that

1744
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
was the first to recognize that that
 

1745
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,389
was the first to recognize that that
phenomenon even

1746
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:24,399
phenomenon even
 

1747
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:28,549
phenomenon even
uh even existed what about the uh

1748
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
uh even existed what about the uh
 

1749
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,430
uh even existed what about the uh
conjecture that carries his name right

1750
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:31,440
conjecture that carries his name right
 

1751
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:31,750
conjecture that carries his name right
so

1752
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
so
 

1753
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,029
so
he also um

1754
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
he also um
 

1755
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,230
he also um
was one of the pioneers of taking

1756
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
was one of the pioneers of taking
 

1757
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,350
was one of the pioneers of taking
geometry um which until that point

1758
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:41,360
geometry um which until that point
 

1759
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,149
geometry um which until that point
had been largely the study of two and

1760
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
had been largely the study of two and
 

1761
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,669
had been largely the study of two and
three-dimensional objects because that's

1762
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:45,679
three-dimensional objects because that's
 

1763
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,389
three-dimensional objects because that's
like

1764
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:46,399
like
 

1765
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,909
like
what we see right that's those are the

1766
00:27:47,909 --> 00:27:47,919
what we see right that's those are the
 

1767
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:49,590
what we see right that's those are the
objects we interact with

1768
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:49,600
objects we interact with
 

1769
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,630
objects we interact with
um he developed that subject we now

1770
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:52,640
um he developed that subject we now
 

1771
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,789
um he developed that subject we now
called topology he called it analysis

1772
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:54,799
called topology he called it analysis
 

1773
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,310
called topology he called it analysis
situs he was a very

1774
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:56,320
situs he was a very
 

1775
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,830
situs he was a very
well-spoken guy with a lot of slogans

1776
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
well-spoken guy with a lot of slogans
 

1777
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,510
well-spoken guy with a lot of slogans
but that name did not

1778
00:27:59,510 --> 00:27:59,520
but that name did not
 

1779
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,789
but that name did not
you can see why that name did not catch

1780
00:28:00,789 --> 00:28:00,799
you can see why that name did not catch
 

1781
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,669
you can see why that name did not catch
on so now it's called topology now

1782
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:03,679
on so now it's called topology now
 

1783
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,230
on so now it's called topology now
um sorry what was it called before

1784
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:06,240
um sorry what was it called before
 

1785
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,149
um sorry what was it called before
analysis situs

1786
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
analysis situs
 

1787
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,430
analysis situs
which i guess sort of roughly means like

1788
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
which i guess sort of roughly means like
 

1789
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,110
which i guess sort of roughly means like
the analysis of location or something

1790
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
the analysis of location or something
 

1791
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,710
the analysis of location or something
like that like um

1792
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:12,720
like that like um
 

1793
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,830
like that like um
it's a latin phrase

1794
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
it's a latin phrase
 

1795
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,950
it's a latin phrase
partly because he understood that even

1796
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:18,960
partly because he understood that even
 

1797
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,029
partly because he understood that even
to understand stuff that's going on

1798
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:21,039
to understand stuff that's going on
 

1799
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,110
to understand stuff that's going on
in our physical world you have to study

1800
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:23,120
in our physical world you have to study
 

1801
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,230
in our physical world you have to study
higher dimensional spaces

1802
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:24,240
higher dimensional spaces
 

1803
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,430
higher dimensional spaces
how does this how does this work and

1804
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:25,440
how does this how does this work and
 

1805
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,110
how does this how does this work and
this is kind of like where my brain went

1806
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,120
this is kind of like where my brain went
 

1807
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,630
this is kind of like where my brain went
to it because you were talking about

1808
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:28,640
to it because you were talking about
 

1809
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,549
to it because you were talking about
not just where things are but what their

1810
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
not just where things are but what their
 

1811
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,909
not just where things are but what their
path is how they're moving when we were

1812
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:31,919
path is how they're moving when we were
 

1813
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,909
path is how they're moving when we were
talking about the path from two to three

1814
00:28:33,909 --> 00:28:33,919
talking about the path from two to three
 

1815
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:35,830
talking about the path from two to three
um he understood that if you want to

1816
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:35,840
um he understood that if you want to
 

1817
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,510
um he understood that if you want to
study three the three bodies

1818
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:37,520
study three the three bodies
 

1819
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,950
study three the three bodies
moving in space well each

1820
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:40,960
moving in space well each
 

1821
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,750
moving in space well each
uh each body it has a location where it

1822
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:43,760
uh each body it has a location where it
 

1823
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,350
uh each body it has a location where it
is so it has an x coordinate a y

1824
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
is so it has an x coordinate a y
 

1825
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,710
is so it has an x coordinate a y
coordinate and a z coordinate right i

1826
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
coordinate and a z coordinate right i
 

1827
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,310
coordinate and a z coordinate right i
can specify a point in space by giving

1828
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
can specify a point in space by giving
 

1829
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,269
can specify a point in space by giving
you three numbers

1830
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:49,279
you three numbers
 

1831
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,269
you three numbers
but it also at each moment has a

1832
00:28:51,269 --> 00:28:51,279
but it also at each moment has a
 

1833
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,269
but it also at each moment has a
velocity

1834
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:53,279
velocity
 

1835
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,269
velocity
so it turns out that really to

1836
00:28:55,269 --> 00:28:55,279
so it turns out that really to
 

1837
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,389
so it turns out that really to
understand what's going on

1838
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
understand what's going on
 

1839
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,470
understand what's going on
you can't think of it as a point or you

1840
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,480
you can't think of it as a point or you
 

1841
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,510
you can't think of it as a point or you
could but it's

1842
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
could but it's
 

1843
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,029
could but it's
better not to think of it as a point in

1844
00:29:01,029 --> 00:29:01,039
better not to think of it as a point in
 

1845
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,110
better not to think of it as a point in

it's better to think of it as a point in
 

1849
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,750
it's better to think of it as a point in
six dimensional space where the

and what's its velocity right now that's
 

1855
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,870

a higher dimensional space called
 

1857
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,470
a higher dimensional space called
phase space and if you haven't thought

00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:12,480
phase space and if you haven't thought
 

1859
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,830

about this before i admit that it's a

but the physics drove him to need to

but the physics drove him to need to
think about

1920
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:05,679
think about
 

1921
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,669
think about
spaces of higher dimension and so he

1922
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
spaces of higher dimension and so he
 

1923
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,269
spaces of higher dimension and so he
needed a formalism that was rich enough

1924
00:30:09,269 --> 00:30:09,279
needed a formalism that was rich enough
 

1925
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,470
needed a formalism that was rich enough
to enable him to do that

to enable him to do that
 

1927
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,230
to enable him to do that
and once you do that that formalism is

1928
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:12,240
and once you do that that formalism is
 

1929
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,669
and once you do that that formalism is
also going to include things that are

also going to include things that are

00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:29,039
and it includes all the physical stuff
 

1949
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,389
and it includes all the physical stuff
maybe we should think about all of it

1950
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:30,399
maybe we should think about all of it
 

1951
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:31,430
maybe we should think about all of it
like maybe we should think about it

1952
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:31,440
like maybe we should think about it
 

1953
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,950
like maybe we should think about it
thinking maybe there's some gold to be

1954
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:32,960
thinking maybe there's some gold to be
 

1955
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,830
thinking maybe there's some gold to be
mined there

1956
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:33,840
mined there
 

1957
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:36,470
mined there
um and indeed like you know guess what

1958
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:36,480
um and indeed like you know guess what
 

1959
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,149
um and indeed like you know guess what
like before long there's relativity and

1960
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
like before long there's relativity and
 

1961
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,430
like before long there's relativity and
there's space time and like all of a

1962
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,440
there's space time and like all of a
 

1963
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,029
there's space time and like all of a
sudden it's like oh yeah maybe it's a

1964
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:41,039
sudden it's like oh yeah maybe it's a
 

1965
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,710
sudden it's like oh yeah maybe it's a
good idea we already have this geometric

1966
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
good idea we already have this geometric
 

1967
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,389
good idea we already have this geometric
apparatus like set up for like how to

1968
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:44,399
apparatus like set up for like how to
 

1969
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:45,350

think about

1970
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
think about
 

1971
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,669
think about
four-dimensional spaces like turns out

1972
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:47,679
four-dimensional spaces like turns out
 

1973
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,950
four-dimensional spaces like turns out
they're real after all

1974
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
they're real after all
 

1975
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,510
they're real after all
you know this is a a story much told

1976
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:51,520
you know this is a a story much told
 

1977
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,630
you know this is a a story much told
right in mathematics not just in this

1978
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
right in mathematics not just in this
 

1979
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,549
right in mathematics not just in this
context but in many i'd love to dig in a

1980
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:54,559
context but in many i'd love to dig in a
 

1981
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,230
context but in many i'd love to dig in a
little deeper on that actually because

1982
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:56,240
little deeper on that actually because
 

1983
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,710
little deeper on that actually because
i have some uh intuitions to work out

1984
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:00,720
i have some uh intuitions to work out
 

1985
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,470
i have some uh intuitions to work out
okay my brain well i'm not a

00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
okay my brain well i'm not a
 

1987
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,149
okay my brain well i'm not a
mathematical physicist so we can work

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:24,960
um the idea is that we perceive
 

2007
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,430
um the idea is that we perceive
ourselves as living in

we just say three-dimensional space you
 

2013
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,669
we just say three-dimensional space you
know you can go up and down you can go

left and right you can go forward and
 

2017
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,149
left and right you can go forward and
back there's three dimensions in which

capture our intuition a little bit more

2030
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,320
capture our intuition a little bit more
 

2031
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,590
capture our intuition a little bit more
we know there are lots of different

2032
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
we know there are lots of different
 

2033
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,590
we know there are lots of different
two-dimensional surfaces right there's

2034
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
two-dimensional surfaces right there's
 

2035
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,230
two-dimensional surfaces right there's
a balloon and that looks one way and a

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:54,240
a balloon and that looks one way and a
 

2037
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,990
a balloon and that looks one way and a
doughnut looks another way and a mobius

strip
 

2041
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,070
strip
looks a third way those are all like

2042
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:58,080
looks a third way those are all like
 

2043
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,350
looks a third way those are all like
two-dimensional surfaces that we can

2044
00:31:59,350 --> 00:31:59,360
two-dimensional surfaces that we can
 

2045
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,230
two-dimensional surfaces that we can
kind of really

2046
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:00,240
kind of really
 

2047
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,789
kind of really
uh get a global view of because we live

2048
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:02,799
uh get a global view of because we live
 

2049
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,389
uh get a global view of because we live
in three-dimensional space so we can see

2050
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:04,399
in three-dimensional space so we can see
 

2051
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,669
in three-dimensional space so we can see
a two-dimensional surface sort of

2052
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
a two-dimensional surface sort of
 

2053
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,029
a two-dimensional surface sort of
sitting in our three-dimensional space

2054
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
sitting in our three-dimensional space
 

2055
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,070
sitting in our three-dimensional space
well to see a three-dimensional space

2056
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:10,080
well to see a three-dimensional space
 

2057
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:12,070
well to see a three-dimensional space
whole we'd have to kind of have

2058
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
whole we'd have to kind of have
 

2059
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,350
whole we'd have to kind of have
four-dimensional eyes right which we

2060
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:13,360
four-dimensional eyes right which we
 

2061
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,630
four-dimensional eyes right which we
don't so we have to use our mathematical

2062
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:14,640
don't so we have to use our mathematical
 

2063
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,070
don't so we have to use our mathematical
lines we have to envision

2064
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,080
lines we have to envision
 

2065
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,909
lines we have to envision
um the poincare conjecture

2066
00:32:19,909 --> 00:32:19,919
um the poincare conjecture
 

2067
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,909
um the poincare conjecture
uh says that there's a very simple way

2068
00:32:21,909 --> 00:32:21,919
uh says that there's a very simple way
 

2069
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,750
uh says that there's a very simple way
to determine whether a three-dimensional

2070
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:23,760
to determine whether a three-dimensional
 

2071
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,710
to determine whether a three-dimensional
space

2072
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
space
 

2073
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,750
space
um is the standard one the one that

2074
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:27,760
um is the standard one the one that
 

2075
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,789
um is the standard one the one that
we're used to

2076
00:32:28,789 --> 00:32:28,799
we're used to
 

2077
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,430
we're used to
um and essentially it's that it's what's

2078
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
um and essentially it's that it's what's
 

2079
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,029
um and essentially it's that it's what's
called fundamental group

2080
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:33,039
called fundamental group
 

2081
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,710
called fundamental group
has nothing interesting in it and not

2082
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:34,720
has nothing interesting in it and not
 

2083
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,830
has nothing interesting in it and not
that i can actually say without saying

2084
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:35,840
that i can actually say without saying
 

2085
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,110
that i can actually say without saying
what the fundamental group is i can tell

2086
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,120
what the fundamental group is i can tell
 

2087
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,789
what the fundamental group is i can tell
you what the criterion is

2088
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:38,799
you what the criterion is
 

2089
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,149
you what the criterion is
this would be oh look i can even use a

2090
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:40,159
this would be oh look i can even use a
 

2091
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,509
this would be oh look i can even use a
visual aid so for the people watching

2092
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:41,519
visual aid so for the people watching
 

2093
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,029
visual aid so for the people watching

the people
uh on the podcast you'll have to

2098
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:45,360
uh on the podcast you'll have to
 

2099
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,350
uh on the podcast you'll have to
visualize it so lex has been nice enough

2100
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:47,360
visualize it so lex has been nice enough
 

2101
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,149
visualize it so lex has been nice enough
to like

2106
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:51,600
topology it's a mug right here in front
 

2107
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,230
topology it's a mug right here in front
of me

2108
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
of me
 

2109
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,630
of me
a mug yes i might say it's a genus one

2110
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:54,640
a mug yes i might say it's a genus one
 

2111
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,070
a mug yes i might say it's a genus one
surface but we could also say it's a mug

2112
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:56,080
surface but we could also say it's a mug
 

2113
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,470
surface but we could also say it's a mug
same thing

2114
00:32:58,470 --> 00:32:58,480
same thing
 

2115
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,990
same thing
so if i were to draw a little circle

2116
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:02,000
so if i were to draw a little circle
 

2117
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,590
so if i were to draw a little circle
on this mug oh which way should i draw

2118
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
on this mug oh which way should i draw
 

2119
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,750
on this mug oh which way should i draw
it so it's visible like here okay

2120
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:05,760
it so it's visible like here okay
 

2121
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,190
it so it's visible like here okay
yeah if i draw a little circle on this

2122
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:07,200
yeah if i draw a little circle on this
 

2123
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,190
yeah if i draw a little circle on this
mug imagine this to be a loop of string

2124
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:09,200
mug imagine this to be a loop of string
 

2125
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,909
mug imagine this to be a loop of string
i could pull that loop of string closed

2126
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
i could pull that loop of string closed
 

2127
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,029
i could pull that loop of string closed
on the surface of

2128
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:13,039
on the surface of
 

2129
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,870
on the surface of
the mug right that's definitely

2130
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:14,880
the mug right that's definitely
 

2131
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,310
the mug right that's definitely
something i could do i could shrink it

2132
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
something i could do i could shrink it
 

2133
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,230
something i could do i could shrink it
shrink and shrink it until it's a point

2134
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
shrink and shrink it until it's a point
 

2135
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,070
shrink and shrink it until it's a point
on the other hand if i draw a loop that

2136
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:20,080
on the other hand if i draw a loop that
 

2137
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,669
on the other hand if i draw a loop that
goes around the handle

2138
00:33:21,669 --> 00:33:21,679
goes around the handle
 

2139
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,269
goes around the handle
i can kind of judge it up here and i can

2140
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:23,279
i can kind of judge it up here and i can
 

2141
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,389
i can kind of judge it up here and i can
judge it down there and i can sort of

2142
00:33:24,389 --> 00:33:24,399
judge it down there and i can sort of
 

2143
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,750
judge it down there and i can sort of
slide it up and down the handle but i

2144
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:25,760
slide it up and down the handle but i
 

2145
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,430
slide it up and down the handle but i
can't pull it closed can't i it's

2146
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:27,440
can't pull it closed can't i it's
 

2147
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,710
can't pull it closed can't i it's
trapped

2148
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:28,720
trapped
 

2149
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,149
trapped
not without breaking the surface of the

2150
00:33:30,149 --> 00:33:30,159
not without breaking the surface of the
 

2151
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,310
not without breaking the surface of the
mug right now without like going inside

2152
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:32,320
mug right now without like going inside
 

2153
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,830
mug right now without like going inside
so um the condition of being what's

2154
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
so um the condition of being what's
 

2155
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,830
so um the condition of being what's
called simply connected this is

2156
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:37,840
called simply connected this is
 

2157
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,389
called simply connected this is
one of punk ray's inventions says that

2158
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:40,399
one of punk ray's inventions says that
 

2159
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,630
one of punk ray's inventions says that
any loop of string can be pulled shut so

2160
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
any loop of string can be pulled shut so
 

2161
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,990
any loop of string can be pulled shut so
it's a feature that the mug

2162
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:44,000
it's a feature that the mug
 

2163
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,430
it's a feature that the mug
simply does not have this is a

2164
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:45,440
simply does not have this is a
 

2165
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,990
simply does not have this is a
non-simply connected

2166
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,000
non-simply connected
 

2167
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,990
non-simply connected
mug and a simply connected mug would be

2168
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,000
mug and a simply connected mug would be
 

2169
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,590
mug and a simply connected mug would be
a cup right you would burn your hand

2170
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
a cup right you would burn your hand
 

2171
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,350
a cup right you would burn your hand
when you drank coffee out of it

2172
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:53,360
when you drank coffee out of it
 

2173
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,789
when you drank coffee out of it
so you're saying the universe is not a

2174
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:54,799
so you're saying the universe is not a
 

2175
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,549
so you're saying the universe is not a
mug

2176
00:33:56,549 --> 00:33:56,559
mug
 

2177
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,350
mug
well i can't speak to the universe but

2178
00:33:59,350 --> 00:33:59,360
well i can't speak to the universe but
 

2179
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,950
well i can't speak to the universe but
what i can say is that

2180
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:00,960
what i can say is that
 

2181
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,470
what i can say is that
um regular old space

2182
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
um regular old space
 

2183
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,070
um regular old space
is not a mug regular old space if you

2184
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:06,080
is not a mug regular old space if you
 

2185
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,669
is not a mug regular old space if you
like sort of actually physically have

2186
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
like sort of actually physically have
 

2187
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,430
like sort of actually physically have
like a loop of string

2188
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:09,440
like a loop of string
 

2189
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:11,190
like a loop of string
you can always close your shot you're

2190
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,200
you can always close your shot you're
 

2191
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,470
you can always close your shot you're
going to pull a [\h__\h]

2192
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:12,480
going to pull a [\h__\h]
 

2193
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,750
going to pull a [\h__\h]
but you know what if your piece of

2194
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:13,760
but you know what if your piece of
 

2195
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,950
but you know what if your piece of
string was the size of the universe like

2196
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
string was the size of the universe like
 

2197
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,589
string was the size of the universe like
what if your poi

2198
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
what if your poi
 

2199
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,030
what if your poi
your piece of string was like billions

2200
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
your piece of string was like billions
 

2201
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,950
your piece of string was like billions
of light years long like like how do you

2202
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:18,960
of light years long like like how do you
 

2203
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,990
of light years long like like how do you
actually know

2204
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:20,000
actually know
 

2205
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,510
actually know
i mean that's still an open question of

2206
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:21,520
i mean that's still an open question of
 

2207
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,750
i mean that's still an open question of
the shape of the universe exactly

2208
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:23,760
the shape of the universe exactly
 

2209
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,389
the shape of the universe exactly
whether it's uh i think there's a lot

2210
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
whether it's uh i think there's a lot
 

2211
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:26,869
whether it's uh i think there's a lot
there is

2212
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:26,879
there is
 

2213
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,710
there is
ideas of it being a tourist i mean

2214
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:28,720
ideas of it being a tourist i mean
 

2215
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,389
ideas of it being a tourist i mean
there's there's some trippy ideas and

2216
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:30,399
there's there's some trippy ideas and
 

2217
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:31,430
there's there's some trippy ideas and
they're not

2218
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:31,440
they're not
 

2219
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,349
they're not
like weird out there controversial

2220
00:34:33,349 --> 00:34:33,359
like weird out there controversial
 

2221
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,790
like weird out there controversial
there's a legitimate

2222
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
there's a legitimate
 

2223
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,069
there's a legitimate
at the center of uh cosmology debate

2224
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,079
at the center of uh cosmology debate
 

2225
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,589
at the center of uh cosmology debate
i mean i think i think somebody who

2226
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:39,599
i mean i think i think somebody who
 

2227
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,710
i mean i think i think somebody who
thinks that there's like some kind of

2228
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:40,720
thinks that there's like some kind of
 

2229
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,389
thinks that there's like some kind of
dodecahedral symmetry or i mean i

2230
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:42,399
dodecahedral symmetry or i mean i
 

2231
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:43,750
dodecahedral symmetry or i mean i
remember reading something crazy about

2232
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:43,760
remember reading something crazy about
 

2233
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,109
remember reading something crazy about
somebody saying that they saw the

2234
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
somebody saying that they saw the
 

2235
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,869
somebody saying that they saw the
signature of that and the

2236
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
signature of that and the
 

2237
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,829
signature of that and the
cosmic noise or what have you i mean to

2238
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:49,839
cosmic noise or what have you i mean to
 

2239
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,349
cosmic noise or what have you i mean to
make the flat earthers happy

2240
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:51,359
make the flat earthers happy
 

2241
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,909
make the flat earthers happy
i do believe that the current main

2242
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
i do believe that the current main
 

2243
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,430
i do believe that the current main
belief is

2244
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
belief is
 

2245
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,630
belief is
it's fl it's flat it's flat-ish

2246
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
it's fl it's flat it's flat-ish
 

2247
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,310
it's fl it's flat it's flat-ish
or something like that the shape of the

2248
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:00,320
or something like that the shape of the
 

2249
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,230
or something like that the shape of the
universe is flat-ish i don't know what

2250
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
universe is flat-ish i don't know what
 

2251
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,750
universe is flat-ish i don't know what
the heck that means i think that

2252
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:03,760
the heck that means i think that
 

2253
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,790
the heck that means i think that
i think that has like a very i mean how

2254
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:06,800
i think that has like a very i mean how
 

2255
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,550
i think that has like a very i mean how
are you even supposed to think about

2256
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:08,560
are you even supposed to think about
 

2257
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,670
are you even supposed to think about
the shape of a thing that doesn't have

2258
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:11,680
the shape of a thing that doesn't have
 

2259
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,990
the shape of a thing that doesn't have
anything outside of it

2260
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:14,000
anything outside of it
 

2261
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,750
anything outside of it
i mean ah but that's exactly what

2262
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:15,760
i mean ah but that's exactly what
 

2263
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,589
i mean ah but that's exactly what
topology does topology is what's called

2264
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
topology does topology is what's called
 

2265
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,190
topology does topology is what's called
an intrinsic theory

2266
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
an intrinsic theory
 

2267
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,390
an intrinsic theory
that's what's so great about it this

2268
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
that's what's so great about it this
 

2269
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,470
that's what's so great about it this
question about the mug

2270
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:22,480
question about the mug
 

2271
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,870
question about the mug
you could answer it without ever leaving

2272
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:24,880
you could answer it without ever leaving
 

2273
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,670
you could answer it without ever leaving
the mug

2274
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:25,680
the mug
 

2275
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,230
the mug
right because it's a question about a

2276
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
right because it's a question about a
 

2277
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,990
right because it's a question about a
loop drawn on the surface of the mug and

2278
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:30,000
loop drawn on the surface of the mug and
 

2279
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,349
loop drawn on the surface of the mug and
what happens if it never leaves that

2280
00:35:31,349 --> 00:35:31,359
what happens if it never leaves that
 

2281
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,310
what happens if it never leaves that
surface so it's like

2282
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:32,320
surface so it's like
 

2283
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,470
surface so it's like
always there see but that's the the

2284
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:34,480
always there see but that's the the
 

2285
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,829
always there see but that's the the
difference between

2286
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:35,839
difference between
 

2287
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,589
difference between
then topology and say if you're like uh

2288
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:39,599
then topology and say if you're like uh
 

2289
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,030
then topology and say if you're like uh
trying to visualize a mug that you can't

2290
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
trying to visualize a mug that you can't
 

2291
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,950
trying to visualize a mug that you can't
visualize a mug while living inside the

2292
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
visualize a mug while living inside the
 

2293
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,470
visualize a mug while living inside the
mug

2294
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:46,480
mug
 

2295
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,829
mug
well that's true that visualization is

2296
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:47,839
well that's true that visualization is
 

2297
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,510
well that's true that visualization is
harder but in some sense no you're right

2298
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
harder but in some sense no you're right
 

2299
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,790
harder but in some sense no you're right
but if the tools of mathematics are

2300
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:50,800
but if the tools of mathematics are
 

2301
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,829
but if the tools of mathematics are
there

2302
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:51,839
there
 

2303
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,829
there
i i i don't want to fight but i think

2304
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:53,839
i i i don't want to fight but i think
 

2305
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,190
i i i don't want to fight but i think
the tools and mathematics are exactly

2306
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:55,200
the tools and mathematics are exactly
 

2307
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,950
the tools and mathematics are exactly
there to enable you to think about what

2308
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:56,960
there to enable you to think about what
 

2309
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,990
there to enable you to think about what
you cannot visualize

2310
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:58,000
you cannot visualize
 

2311
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,829
you cannot visualize
in this way let me give let's go always

2312
00:35:59,829 --> 00:35:59,839
in this way let me give let's go always
 

2313
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,030
in this way let me give let's go always
to make things easier go downward

2314
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
to make things easier go downward
 

2315
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,990
to make things easier go downward
dimension

2316
00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:02,000
dimension
 

2317
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,790
dimension
um let's think about we live on a circle

2318
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:04,800
um let's think about we live on a circle
 

2319
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,670
um let's think about we live on a circle
okay

2320
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
okay
 

2321
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,710
okay
you can tell whether you live on a

2322
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:08,720
you can tell whether you live on a
 

2323
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,829
you can tell whether you live on a
circle

2324
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:09,839
circle
 

2325
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,750
circle
or a line segment because if you live in

2326
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:11,760
or a line segment because if you live in
 

2327
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,270
or a line segment because if you live in
a circle if you walk a long way in one

2328
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,280
a circle if you walk a long way in one
 

2329
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,630
a circle if you walk a long way in one
direction you find yourself back where

2330
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:14,640
direction you find yourself back where
 

2331
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,069
direction you find yourself back where
you started and if you live in a line

2332
00:36:16,069 --> 00:36:16,079
you started and if you live in a line
 

2333
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,190
you started and if you live in a line
segment

2334
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
segment
 

2335
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,630
segment
you walk for a long enough one direction

2336
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:18,640
you walk for a long enough one direction
 

2337
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,550
you walk for a long enough one direction
you come to the end of the world or if

2338
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:20,560
you come to the end of the world or if
 

2339
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,910
you come to the end of the world or if
you live on a line

2340
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:21,920
you live on a line
 

2341
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,510
you live on a line
like a whole line an infinite line then

2342
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
like a whole line an infinite line then
 

2343
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,190
like a whole line an infinite line then
you walk in

2344
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,200
you walk in
 

2345
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,870
you walk in
one direction for a long time and like

2346
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
one direction for a long time and like
 

2347
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,750
one direction for a long time and like
well then there's not a sort of

2348
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:27,760
well then there's not a sort of
 

2349
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,030
well then there's not a sort of
terminating algorithm to figure out

2350
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
terminating algorithm to figure out
 

2351
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,390
terminating algorithm to figure out
whether you live on a line or a circle

2352
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:30,400
whether you live on a line or a circle
 

2353
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,750
whether you live on a line or a circle
but at least you sort of

2354
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:31,760
but at least you sort of
 

2355
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,470
but at least you sort of
um at least you don't discover that you

2356
00:36:34,470 --> 00:36:34,480
um at least you don't discover that you
 

2357
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,510
um at least you don't discover that you
live on a circle

2358
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
live on a circle
 

2359
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,109
live on a circle
so all of those are intrinsic things

2360
00:36:37,109 --> 00:36:37,119
so all of those are intrinsic things
 

2361
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,870
so all of those are intrinsic things
right all of those are things that you

2362
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
right all of those are things that you
 

2363
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,990
right all of those are things that you
can figure out about your

2364
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:40,000
can figure out about your
 

2365
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,230
can figure out about your
world without leaving your world on the

2366
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
world without leaving your world on the
 

2367
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,670
world without leaving your world on the
other hand ready now we're going to go

2368
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:43,680
other hand ready now we're going to go
 

2369
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,589
other hand ready now we're going to go
from intrinsic to extrinsic why did i

2370
00:36:45,589 --> 00:36:45,599
from intrinsic to extrinsic why did i
 

2371
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,630
from intrinsic to extrinsic why did i
not know we were going to talk about

2372
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:46,640
not know we were going to talk about
 

2373
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,990
not know we were going to talk about
this but why not

2374
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:48,000
this but why not
 

2375
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,950
this but why not
why not if you can't tell whether you

2376
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:50,960
why not if you can't tell whether you
 

2377
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,390
why not if you can't tell whether you
live in a circle

2378
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:52,400
live in a circle
 

2379
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,510
live in a circle
or a not like imagine like a knot

2380
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
or a not like imagine like a knot
 

2381
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,950
or a not like imagine like a knot
floating in three-dimensional space the

2382
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:56,960
floating in three-dimensional space the
 

2383
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,470
floating in three-dimensional space the
person who lives on that knot to them

2384
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
person who lives on that knot to them
 

2385
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,190
person who lives on that knot to them
it's a circle

2386
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,200
it's a circle
 

2387
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,790
it's a circle
yeah they walk a long way they come back

2388
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:00,800
yeah they walk a long way they come back
 

2389
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,230
yeah they walk a long way they come back
to where they started now we with our

2390
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,240
to where they started now we with our
 

2391
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,069
to where they started now we with our
three-dimensional eyes can be like

2392
00:37:04,069 --> 00:37:04,079
three-dimensional eyes can be like
 

2393
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,589
three-dimensional eyes can be like
oh this one's just a plain circle and

2394
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
oh this one's just a plain circle and
 

2395
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,190
oh this one's just a plain circle and
this one's knotted up but that's an

00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,200
this one's knotted up but that's an

that's a

00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,670
that's a

2400
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:09,680
that has to do with how they sit in
 

2401
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,870
that has to do with how they sit in
three-dimensional space it doesn't have

three-dimensional space it doesn't have
 

2403
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,230
three-dimensional space it doesn't have

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,670
it make you
how does it make you feel that you don't

00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:17,680
how does it make you feel that you don't
 

2413
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,829
how does it make you feel that you don't
know if you live in a circle

2414
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:19,839
know if you live in a circle
 

2415
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:22,950
know if you live in a circle
or on a knot in a knot

2416
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:22,960
or on a knot in a knot

i'm going to even know how to say i'm
going to be honest with you i don't know

2422
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
going to be honest with you i don't know
 

2423
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,150
going to be honest with you i don't know
if like

2424
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:32,160
if like
 

2425
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,790
if like
i i fear you won't like this answer but

2426
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
i i fear you won't like this answer but
 

2427
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,270
i i fear you won't like this answer but
it

2428
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
it
 

2429
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,109
it
does not bother me at all it does i

2430
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:37,119
does not bother me at all it does i
 

2431
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,270
does not bother me at all it does i
don't lose one minute of sleep over it

2432
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
don't lose one minute of sleep over it
 

2433
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,349
don't lose one minute of sleep over it
so like does it bother you that if we

2434
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,359
so like does it bother you that if we
 

2435
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,230
so like does it bother you that if we
look at like a mobius strip

2436
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:44,240
look at like a mobius strip
 

2437
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,230
look at like a mobius strip
that you don't have an obvious way of

2438
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,240
that you don't have an obvious way of
 

2439
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,430
that you don't have an obvious way of
knowing

2440
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:47,440
knowing
 

2441
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,750
knowing
whether you are inside of cylinder if

2442
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:49,760
whether you are inside of cylinder if
 

2443
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,589
whether you are inside of cylinder if
you live on a surface of a cylinder

2444
00:37:51,589 --> 00:37:51,599
you live on a surface of a cylinder
 

2445
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,430
you live on a surface of a cylinder
or you live on the surface of a mobius

2446
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:53,440
or you live on the surface of a mobius
 

2447
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,670
or you live on the surface of a mobius
strip

2448
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:55,680
strip
 

2449
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,550
strip
no i think you can tell if you live if

2450
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:58,560
no i think you can tell if you live if
 

2451
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,069
no i think you can tell if you live if
which one because

2452
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:00,079
which one because
 

2453
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,069
which one because
if what you do is you like tell your

2454
00:38:02,069 --> 00:38:02,079
if what you do is you like tell your
 

2455
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,190
if what you do is you like tell your
friend hey stay right here i'm just

2456
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
friend hey stay right here i'm just
 

2457
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,069
friend hey stay right here i'm just
gonna go for a walk

2458
00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:04,079
gonna go for a walk
 

2459
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:05,829
gonna go for a walk
and then you like walk for a long time

2460
00:38:05,829 --> 00:38:05,839
and then you like walk for a long time
 

2461
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,190
and then you like walk for a long time
in one direction and then you come back

2462
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:07,200
in one direction and then you come back
 

2463
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,310
in one direction and then you come back
and you see your friend again and if

2464
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:08,320
and you see your friend again and if
 

2465
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,589
and you see your friend again and if
your friend is reversed then you know

2466
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:09,599
your friend is reversed then you know
 

2467
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,030
your friend is reversed then you know
you live on a mobius strip well

2468
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,040
you live on a mobius strip well
 

2469
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,030
you live on a mobius strip well
no because you won't see your friend

2470
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
no because you won't see your friend
 

2471
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,150
no because you won't see your friend
right okay

2472
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,160
right okay
 

2473
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,430
right okay
fair fair point fair point on that and

2474
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
fair fair point fair point on that and
 

2475
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,750
fair fair point fair point on that and
you have to believe the story is about

2476
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:19,760
you have to believe the story is about
 

2477
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,190
you have to believe the story is about
no i don't even know

2478
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:21,200
no i don't even know
 

2479
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,230
no i don't even know
i i i would would you even know would

2480
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
i i i would would you even know would
 

2481
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,150
i i i would would you even know would
you really oh no you're i know your

2482
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:26,160
you really oh no you're i know your
 

2483
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,589
you really oh no you're i know your
point is right let me try to think of it

2484
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:27,599
point is right let me try to think of it
 

2485
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:27,990
point is right let me try to think of it
better

2486
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,000
better
 

2487
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,829
better
let's see if i can do this may not be

2488
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:29,839
let's see if i can do this may not be
 

2489
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,470
let's see if i can do this may not be
correct to talk about

2490
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,480
correct to talk about
 

2491
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,870
correct to talk about
cognitive beings living on a mobius

cognitive beings living on a mobius
 

2493
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,069
cognitive beings living on a mobius
strip because

2494
00:38:36,069 --> 00:38:36,079
strip because
 

2495
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,349
strip because
there's a lot of things taken for

2496
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:37,359
there's a lot of things taken for
 

2497
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:38,710
there's a lot of things taken for
granted there and we're constantly

00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:38,720
granted there and we're constantly
 

2499
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,710
granted there and we're constantly
imagining actual like

00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,510
imagining actual like
three-dimensional creatures like how it

feels like to uh to live on a mobius

feels like to uh to live on a mobius
strip is tricky to

2508
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:49,280
strip is tricky to
 

2509
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,430
strip is tricky to
internalize i think that on what's

2510
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
internalize i think that on what's
 

2511
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,870
internalize i think that on what's
called the real projective plane which

2512
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:52,880
called the real projective plane which
 

2513
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,310
called the real projective plane which
is kind of even more sort of like messed

2514
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:54,320
is kind of even more sort of like messed
 

2515
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,430
is kind of even more sort of like messed
up version of the

00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:55,440
up version of the
 

2517
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,030
up version of the
mobius strip but with very similar

2518
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,040
mobius strip but with very similar

features this feature of kind of like
 

2521
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,069
features this feature of kind of like
only having one side that has the

only having one side that has the

only having one side that has the
feature that there's a loop of string

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:04,320
feature that there's a loop of string
 

2525
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,270
feature that there's a loop of string
which can't be pulled closed but if you

2526
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:07,280
which can't be pulled closed but if you
 

2527
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:07,750
which can't be pulled closed but if you
loop

loop
 

2529
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,750
loop
it around twice along the same path that

2530
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:09,760
it around twice along the same path that

you can pull closed
 

2533
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,230
you can pull closed
that's extremely weird yeah

2534
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
that's extremely weird yeah
 

2535
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,910
that's extremely weird yeah
um but that would be a way you could

2536
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:15,920
um but that would be a way you could
 

2537
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,550
um but that would be a way you could
know without leaving your world that

2538
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
know without leaving your world that
 

2539
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,310
know without leaving your world that
something very funny is going on you

2540
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,320
something very funny is going on you
 

2541
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,829
something very funny is going on you
know what's extremely weird

2542
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
know what's extremely weird
 

2543
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,589
know what's extremely weird
maybe we can comment on hopefully it's

2544
00:39:23,589 --> 00:39:23,599
maybe we can comment on hopefully it's
 

2545
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:26,630
maybe we can comment on hopefully it's
not too much of a tangent is

2546
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:26,640
not too much of a tangent is
 

2547
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,109
not too much of a tangent is
i remember thinking about this this

2548
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:29,119
i remember thinking about this this
 

2549
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,150
i remember thinking about this this
might be right

2550
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,160
might be right
 

2551
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,710
might be right
this might be wrong but if you're if we

2552
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
this might be wrong but if you're if we
 

2553
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,190
this might be wrong but if you're if we
now

2554
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
now
 

2555
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:36,310
now
talk about a sphere and you're living

2556
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
talk about a sphere and you're living
 

2557
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,550
talk about a sphere and you're living
inside a sphere

2558
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:38,560
inside a sphere
 

2559
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,430
inside a sphere
that you're going to see everywhere

2560
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:41,440
that you're going to see everywhere
 

2561
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,670
that you're going to see everywhere
around you the back of your own head

2562
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680

 

2563
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,790

that i was because like i was

2564
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:48,800
that i was because like i was
 

2565
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,030
that i was because like i was
this is very counterintuitive to me to

2566
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,040
this is very counterintuitive to me to
 

2567
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,390
this is very counterintuitive to me to
think about maybe it's wrong

2568
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:52,400
think about maybe it's wrong
 

2569
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,950
think about maybe it's wrong
but because i was thinking like earth

2570
00:39:54,950 --> 00:39:54,960
but because i was thinking like earth
 

2571
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,310
but because i was thinking like earth
you know your 3d

2572
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:56,320
you know your 3d
 

2573
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,230
you know your 3d
thing on sitting on a sphere but if

2574
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:58,240
thing on sitting on a sphere but if
 

2575
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,790
thing on sitting on a sphere but if
you're living inside the sphere

2576
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:00,800
you're living inside the sphere
 

2577
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,470
you're living inside the sphere
like you're going to see if you look

2578
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
like you're going to see if you look
 

2579
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,309
like you're going to see if you look
straight you're always going to see

2580
00:40:04,309 --> 00:40:04,319
straight you're always going to see
 

2581
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,710
straight you're always going to see
yourself all the way around so

2582
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:06,720
yourself all the way around so
 

2583
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,150
yourself all the way around so
everywhere you look there's going to be

2584
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
everywhere you look there's going to be
 

2585
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,950
everywhere you look there's going to be
the back of your

2586
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
the back of your
 

2587
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,430
the back of your
head i think somehow this depends on

2588
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
head i think somehow this depends on
 

2589
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,790
head i think somehow this depends on
something of like how the physics of

2590
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:12,800
something of like how the physics of
 

2591
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,069
something of like how the physics of
light works in this scenario which i'm

2592
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
light works in this scenario which i'm
 

2593
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,589
light works in this scenario which i'm
sort of finding it hard to bend my

2594
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
sort of finding it hard to bend my
 

2595
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:17,589
sort of finding it hard to bend my
that's true the c is doing a lot of like

2596
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
that's true the c is doing a lot of like
 

2597
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,270
that's true the c is doing a lot of like
saying you see something's doing a lot

2598
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,280
saying you see something's doing a lot
 

2599
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,309
saying you see something's doing a lot
of work

2600
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:20,319
of work
 

2601
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,670
of work
people have thought about this i mean

2602
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:21,680
people have thought about this i mean
 

2603
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,990
people have thought about this i mean
this this metaphor of like what if we're

2604
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:24,000
this this metaphor of like what if we're
 

2605
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,069
this this metaphor of like what if we're
like little creatures in some sort of

2606
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:26,079
like little creatures in some sort of
 

2607
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,349
like little creatures in some sort of
smaller world like how could we

2608
00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:27,359
smaller world like how could we
 

2609
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,030
smaller world like how could we
apprehend what's outside that metaphor

2610
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:29,040
apprehend what's outside that metaphor
 

2611
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,790
apprehend what's outside that metaphor
just comes back and back and actually i

2612
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:30,800
just comes back and back and actually i
 

2613
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,710
just comes back and back and actually i
didn't even realize like how frequent it

2614
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:32,720
didn't even realize like how frequent it
 

2615
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,309
didn't even realize like how frequent it
is it comes up in the book a lot

2616
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:34,319
is it comes up in the book a lot
 

2617
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,230
is it comes up in the book a lot
i know it from a book called flatland i

2618
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
i know it from a book called flatland i

00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:41,440
an adult you know this this uh sort of
 

2625
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,030
an adult you know this this uh sort of
sort of comic novel from the 19th

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,349
century about
an entire two-dimensional world

2630
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:47,359
an entire two-dimensional world
 

2631
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:49,109
an entire two-dimensional world
uh it's narrated by a square that's the

2632
00:40:49,109 --> 00:40:49,119
uh it's narrated by a square that's the
 

2633
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,470
uh it's narrated by a square that's the
main character

2634
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:50,480
main character
 

2635
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,430
main character
and um the kind of strangeness that

2636
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
and um the kind of strangeness that
 

2637
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,550
and um the kind of strangeness that
befalls him when

2638
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
befalls him when
 

2639
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,069
befalls him when
you know one day he's in his house and

2640
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:56,079
you know one day he's in his house and
 

2641
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:58,230
you know one day he's in his house and
suddenly there's like a little circle

2642
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:58,240
suddenly there's like a little circle
 

2643
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,670
suddenly there's like a little circle
there and there with him

2644
00:40:59,670 --> 00:40:59,680
there and there with him
 

2645
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,430
there and there with him
and then the circle but then the circle

2646
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:01,440
and then the circle but then the circle
 

2647
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,950
and then the circle but then the circle
like starts getting bigger

2648
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
like starts getting bigger
 

2649
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,270
like starts getting bigger
and bigger and bigger and he's like what

2650
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:05,280
and bigger and bigger and he's like what
 

2651
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,390
and bigger and bigger and he's like what
the hell is going on it's like a horror

2652
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:06,400
the hell is going on it's like a horror
 

2653
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,390
the hell is going on it's like a horror
movie like for two-dimensional people

2654
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:08,400
movie like for two-dimensional people
 

2655
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,230
movie like for two-dimensional people
and of course what's happening is that a

2656
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:10,240
and of course what's happening is that a
 

2657
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,390
and of course what's happening is that a
sphere is entering his world and as the

2658
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:12,400
sphere is entering his world and as the
 

2659
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,670
sphere is entering his world and as the
sphere kind of like

2660
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680
sphere kind of like
 

2661
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,670
sphere kind of like
moves farther and farther into the plane

2662
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
moves farther and farther into the plane
 

2663
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,109
moves farther and farther into the plane
it's cross-section the part of it that

2664
00:41:17,109 --> 00:41:17,119
it's cross-section the part of it that
 

2665
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:18,309
it's cross-section the part of it that
he can see

2666
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
he can see
 

2667
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:19,829
he can see
to him it looks like there's like this

2668
00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:19,839
to him it looks like there's like this
 

2669
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,510
to him it looks like there's like this
kind of bizarre being that's like

2670
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
kind of bizarre being that's like
 

2671
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,750
kind of bizarre being that's like
getting larger and larger and larger

2672
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:23,760
getting larger and larger and larger
 

2673
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,950
getting larger and larger and larger
um until it's exactly sort of halfway

2674
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:26,960
um until it's exactly sort of halfway
 

2675
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,990
um until it's exactly sort of halfway
through and then they have this kind of

2676
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,000
through and then they have this kind of
 

2677
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,190
through and then they have this kind of
like philosophical argument where the

2678
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:29,200
like philosophical argument where the
 

2679
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,309
like philosophical argument where the
sphere is like i'm a sphere i'm from the

2680
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:30,319
sphere is like i'm a sphere i'm from the
 

2681
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,589
sphere is like i'm a sphere i'm from the
third dimension the square is like what

2682
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:31,599
third dimension the square is like what
 

2683
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,630
third dimension the square is like what
are you talking about there's no such

2684
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:32,640
are you talking about there's no such
 

2685
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,190
are you talking about there's no such
thing

2686
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:33,200
thing
 

2687
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,670
thing
and they have this kind of like sterile

2688
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:35,680
and they have this kind of like sterile
 

2689
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,510
and they have this kind of like sterile
argument where the square is not

2690
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:37,520
argument where the square is not
 

2691
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,589
argument where the square is not
able to kind of like follow the

2692
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:39,599
able to kind of like follow the
 

2693
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,790
able to kind of like follow the
mathematical reasoning of the sphere

2694
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:40,800
mathematical reasoning of the sphere
 

2695
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,309
mathematical reasoning of the sphere
until the sphere just kind of grabs him

2696
00:41:42,309 --> 00:41:42,319
until the sphere just kind of grabs him
 

2697
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,230
until the sphere just kind of grabs him
and like jerks him out of the plane

2698
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:44,240
and like jerks him out of the plane
 

2699
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,550
and like jerks him out of the plane
and pulls him up and it's like now like

2700
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:46,560
and pulls him up and it's like now like
 

2701
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,589
and pulls him up and it's like now like
now do you see like now do you see your

2702
00:41:49,589 --> 00:41:49,599
now do you see like now do you see your
 

2703
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:51,510
now do you see like now do you see your
whole world that you didn't understand

2704
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:51,520
whole world that you didn't understand
 

2705
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:52,630
whole world that you didn't understand
before so do you think

2706
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:52,640
before so do you think
 

2707
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,670
before so do you think
that kind of process is possible for us

2708
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:55,680
that kind of process is possible for us
 

2709
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,470
that kind of process is possible for us
humans

2710
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:56,480
humans
 

2711
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,910
humans
so we live in the three-dimensional

2712
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:57,920
so we live in the three-dimensional
 

2713
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,589
so we live in the three-dimensional
world maybe with the time component

2714
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
world maybe with the time component
 

2715
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,349
world maybe with the time component
four-dimensional

2716
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
four-dimensional
 

2717
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,910
four-dimensional
and then math allows us to uh to go

2718
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:05,920
and then math allows us to uh to go
 

2719
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,069
and then math allows us to uh to go
high into high dimensions comfortably

2720
00:42:08,069 --> 00:42:08,079
high into high dimensions comfortably
 

2721
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,270
high into high dimensions comfortably
and explore the world from those

2722
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:09,280
and explore the world from those
 

2723
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:13,430
and explore the world from those
perspectives

2724
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:13,440

 

2725
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:17,910

like is it possible

2726
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:17,920

 

2727
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,030

that the universe is uh many more

2728
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:21,040
that the universe is uh many more
 

2729
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,309
that the universe is uh many more
dimensions

2730
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:22,319
dimensions
 

2731
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,309
dimensions
than the ones we experience as human

2732
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:24,319
than the ones we experience as human
 

2733
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:25,430
than the ones we experience as human
beings so

2734
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
beings so
 

2735
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,710
beings so
if you look at uh the you know

2736
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:28,720
if you look at uh the you know
 

2737
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,750
if you look at uh the you know
especially in physics

2738
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760

and this part now looking at it through
a christian lens that becomes

2902
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
a christian lens that becomes
 

2903
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,550
a christian lens that becomes
a bit subversive is the square is so

2904
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:12,560
a bit subversive is the square is so
 

2905
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,910
a bit subversive is the square is so
excited about

2906
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:13,920
excited about
 

2907
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,710
excited about
what he's learned from the sphere and

2908
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:16,720
what he's learned from the sphere and
 

2909
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:17,990
what he's learned from the sphere and
the sphere explains them like what a

2910
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000
the sphere explains them like what a
 

2911
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,270
the sphere explains them like what a
cube would be oh it's like you but

2912
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:19,280
cube would be oh it's like you but
 

2913
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,550
cube would be oh it's like you but
three-dimensional and the square is very

2914
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
three-dimensional and the square is very
 

2915
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:22,150
three-dimensional and the square is very
exciting and the square is like

2916
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:22,160
exciting and the square is like
 

2917
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,390
exciting and the square is like
okay i get it now so like now that you

2918
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
okay i get it now so like now that you
 

2919
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,069
okay i get it now so like now that you
explained to me how just by reason i can

2920
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:26,079
explained to me how just by reason i can
 

2921
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,270
explained to me how just by reason i can
figure out what a cube would be like

2922
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:27,280
figure out what a cube would be like
 

2923
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,950
figure out what a cube would be like
like a three-dimensional version of me

2924
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:28,960
like a three-dimensional version of me
 

2925
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,230
like a three-dimensional version of me
like let's figure out what a

2926
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:30,240
like let's figure out what a
 

2927
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,670
like let's figure out what a
four-dimensional version of me would be

2928
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
four-dimensional version of me would be
 

2929
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:32,550
four-dimensional version of me would be
like

2930
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:32,560
like
 

2931
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,150
like
and then this fear is like what the hell

2932
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:34,160
and then this fear is like what the hell
 

2933
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,270
and then this fear is like what the hell
are you talking about there's no fourth

2934
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:35,280
are you talking about there's no fourth
 

2935
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,790
are you talking about there's no fourth
dimension that's ridiculous like

2936
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:36,800
dimension that's ridiculous like
 

2937
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:37,990
dimension that's ridiculous like
there's three dimensions like that's how

2938
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
there's three dimensions like that's how
 

2939
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,750
there's three dimensions like that's how
many there are i can see like i mean so

2940
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
many there are i can see like i mean so
 

2941
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,950
many there are i can see like i mean so
it's the sort of comic moment where the

2942
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
it's the sort of comic moment where the
 

2943
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,349
it's the sort of comic moment where the
sphere is completely unable to

2944
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:43,359
sphere is completely unable to
 

2945
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,030
sphere is completely unable to
uh conceptualize that there could

2946
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:45,040
uh conceptualize that there could
 

2947
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,270
uh conceptualize that there could
actually be yet another

2948
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,280
actually be yet another
 

2949
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,030
actually be yet another
dimension so yeah that takes the

2950
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
dimension so yeah that takes the
 

2951
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,550
dimension so yeah that takes the
religious allegory to like a very weird

2952
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:50,560
religious allegory to like a very weird
 

2953
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:51,430
religious allegory to like a very weird
place that i don't really like

2954
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440
place that i don't really like
 

2955
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,030
place that i don't really like
understand theologically but

2956
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:53,040
understand theologically but
 

2957
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,510
understand theologically but
that's a nice way to talk about religion

2958
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:55,520
that's a nice way to talk about religion
 

2959
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,030
that's a nice way to talk about religion
and myth

2960
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:57,040
and myth
 

2961
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,150
and myth
in general as perhaps us trying to

2962
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:00,160
in general as perhaps us trying to
 

2963
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,750
in general as perhaps us trying to
struggle with us meaning human

2964
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:01,760
struggle with us meaning human
 

2965
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,750
struggle with us meaning human
civilization trying to struggle

2966
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:03,760
civilization trying to struggle
 

2967
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,950
civilization trying to struggle
with ideas that are beyond our cognitive

2968
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960
with ideas that are beyond our cognitive
 

2969
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,990
with ideas that are beyond our cognitive
capabilities but it's in fact not beyond

2970
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
capabilities but it's in fact not beyond
 

2971
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,510
capabilities but it's in fact not beyond
our capability it may be beyond our

2972
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:11,520
our capability it may be beyond our
 

2973
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,190
our capability it may be beyond our
cognitive capabilities

2974
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:13,200
cognitive capabilities
 

2975
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,710
cognitive capabilities
to visualize a four-dimensional cube a

2976
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:16,720
to visualize a four-dimensional cube a
 

2977
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,550
to visualize a four-dimensional cube a
tesseract as some like to call it or a

2978
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
tesseract as some like to call it or a
 

2979
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,670
tesseract as some like to call it or a
five-dimensional cube or a

2980
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
five-dimensional cube or a
 

2981
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,710
five-dimensional cube or a
six-dimensional cube

2982
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
six-dimensional cube
 

2983
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,030
six-dimensional cube
but it is not beyond our cognitive

2984
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,040
but it is not beyond our cognitive
 

2985
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,910
but it is not beyond our cognitive
capabilities

2986
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:23,920
capabilities
 

2987
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,710
capabilities
to figure out how many corners a

2988
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
to figure out how many corners a
 

2989
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,990
to figure out how many corners a
six-dimensional cube would have

2990
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
six-dimensional cube would have
 

2991
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,510
six-dimensional cube would have
that's what's so cool about us whether

2992
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:29,520
that's what's so cool about us whether
 

2993
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,510
that's what's so cool about us whether
we can visualize it or not we can still

2994
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:31,520
we can visualize it or not we can still
 

2995
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,030
we can visualize it or not we can still
talk about it we can still reason about

2996
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:33,040
talk about it we can still reason about
 

2997
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:33,270
talk about it we can still reason about
it

2998
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:33,280
it
 

2999
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,069
it
we can still figure things out about it

3000
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
we can still figure things out about it
 

3001
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,270
we can still figure things out about it
that's amazing

3002
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:37,280
that's amazing
 

3003
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,550
that's amazing
yeah if we go back to this first of all

3004
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,560
yeah if we go back to this first of all
 

3005
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,510
yeah if we go back to this first of all
to the mug

3006
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
to the mug
 

3007
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,829
to the mug
but to the example you give in the book

3008
00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:43,839
but to the example you give in the book
 

3009
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,670
but to the example you give in the book
of the straw

3010
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
of the straw
 

3011
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:49,670
of the straw
uh how many holes does a straw have

3012
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:49,680
uh how many holes does a straw have
 

3013
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,630
uh how many holes does a straw have
and you listener may uh try to answer

3014
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:52,640
and you listener may uh try to answer
 

3015
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:53,990
and you listener may uh try to answer
that in your own head

3016
00:46:53,990 --> 00:46:54,000
that in your own head
 

3017
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,270
that in your own head
yeah i'm gonna take a drink while

3018
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
yeah i'm gonna take a drink while
 

3019
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,670
yeah i'm gonna take a drink while
everybody thinks about it a slow

3020
00:46:57,670 --> 00:46:57,680
everybody thinks about it a slow
 

3021
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,790
everybody thinks about it a slow
sip is it uh

3022
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:00,800
sip is it uh
 

3023
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,829
sip is it uh
zero one or two or more

3024
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:03,839
zero one or two or more
 

3025
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:05,589
zero one or two or more
more than that maybe maybe you get very

3026
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:05,599
more than that maybe maybe you get very
 

3027
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:06,870
more than that maybe maybe you get very
creative but

3028
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:06,880
creative but
 

3029
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:10,309
creative but
uh it's kind of interesting to uh each

3030
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
uh it's kind of interesting to uh each
 

3031
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,069
uh it's kind of interesting to uh each
uh dissecting each answer as you do in

3032
00:47:12,069 --> 00:47:12,079
uh dissecting each answer as you do in
 

3033
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,309
uh dissecting each answer as you do in
the book is quite brilliant people

3034
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:14,319
the book is quite brilliant people
 

3035
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:15,510
the book is quite brilliant people
should definitely check it out

3036
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:15,520
should definitely check it out
 

3037
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,150
should definitely check it out
but if you could try to answer it now

3038
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:18,160
but if you could try to answer it now
 

3039
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:19,109
but if you could try to answer it now
like think about

3040
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
like think about
 

3041
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:22,069
like think about
all the options and why they may or may

3042
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:22,079
all the options and why they may or may
 

3043
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,270
all the options and why they may or may
not be right

3044
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:23,280
not be right
 

3045
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,710
not be right
yeah and it's one of it's one of these

3046
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:24,720
yeah and it's one of it's one of these
 

3047
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:27,030
yeah and it's one of it's one of these
questions where people on first hearing

3048
00:47:27,030 --> 00:47:27,040
questions where people on first hearing
 

3049
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:28,390
questions where people on first hearing
it think it's a triviality and they're

3050
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
it think it's a triviality and they're
 

3051
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,829
it think it's a triviality and they're
like well the answer is obvious and then

3052
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:29,839
like well the answer is obvious and then
 

3053
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:31,030
like well the answer is obvious and then
what happens if you ever ask a group of

3054
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
what happens if you ever ask a group of
 

3055
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,630
what happens if you ever ask a group of
people this something

3056
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:32,640
people this something
 

3057
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:34,230
people this something
wonderfully comic happens which is that

3058
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
wonderfully comic happens which is that
 

3059
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:35,349
wonderfully comic happens which is that
everyone's like well it's completely

3060
00:47:35,349 --> 00:47:35,359
everyone's like well it's completely
 

3061
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:36,390
everyone's like well it's completely
obvious

3062
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:36,400
obvious
 

3063
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,150
obvious
and then each person realizes that half

3064
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
and then each person realizes that half
 

3065
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,750
and then each person realizes that half
the person the other people in the room

3066
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
the person the other people in the room
 

3067
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,549
the person the other people in the room
have a different

3068
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:40,559
have a different
 

3069
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,549
have a different
obvious answer for the way that they

3070
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:42,559
obvious answer for the way that they
 

3071
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,309
obvious answer for the way that they
have and then people get really heated

3072
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:44,319
have and then people get really heated
 

3073
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,230
have and then people get really heated
people are like i can't believe that you

3074
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:46,240
people are like i can't believe that you
 

3075
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,910
people are like i can't believe that you
think it has two holes or like i can't

3076
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:47,920
think it has two holes or like i can't
 

3077
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,510
think it has two holes or like i can't
believe that you think it has one

3078
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
believe that you think it has one
 

3079
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:50,870
believe that you think it has one
and then you know you really like people

3080
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:50,880
and then you know you really like people
 

3081
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:52,390
and then you know you really like people
really learn something about each other

3082
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
really learn something about each other
 

3083
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:54,309
really learn something about each other
and people get heated

3084
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:54,319
and people get heated
 

3085
00:47:54,319 --> 00:47:56,309
and people get heated
i mean can we go through the possible

3086
00:47:56,309 --> 00:47:56,319
i mean can we go through the possible
 

3087
00:47:56,319 --> 00:47:57,670
i mean can we go through the possible
options here

3088
00:47:57,670 --> 00:47:57,680
options here
 

3089
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:01,190
options here
is it zero one two three ten

3090
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:01,200
is it zero one two three ten
 

3091
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,549
is it zero one two three ten
sure so i think you know most people

3092
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:04,559
sure so i think you know most people
 

3093
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:06,710
sure so i think you know most people
the zero holders are rare they would say

3094
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:06,720
the zero holders are rare they would say
 

3095
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,670
the zero holders are rare they would say
like well look

3096
00:48:07,670 --> 00:48:07,680
like well look
 

3097
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,870
like well look
you can make a straw by taking a

3098
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
you can make a straw by taking a
 

3099
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,549
you can make a straw by taking a
rectangular piece of plastic and closing

3100
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:10,559
rectangular piece of plastic and closing
 

3101
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,309
rectangular piece of plastic and closing
it up the rectangular piece of plastic

3102
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:12,319
it up the rectangular piece of plastic
 

3103
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:15,109
it up the rectangular piece of plastic
doesn't have a hole in it uh i didn't

3104
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
doesn't have a hole in it uh i didn't
 

3105
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:15,990
doesn't have a hole in it uh i didn't
poke a hole in it

3106
00:48:15,990 --> 00:48:16,000
poke a hole in it
 

3107
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,390
poke a hole in it
when i yeah so how can i have a hole

3108
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:18,400
when i yeah so how can i have a hole
 

3109
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,630
when i yeah so how can i have a hole
like it's just one thing okay

3110
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:20,640
like it's just one thing okay
 

3111
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:22,069
like it's just one thing okay
most people don't see it that way that's

3112
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:22,079
most people don't see it that way that's
 

3113
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,750
most people don't see it that way that's
like uh um

3114
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
like uh um
 

3115
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,270
like uh um
is there any truth to that kind of

3116
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:25,280
is there any truth to that kind of
 

3117
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,870
is there any truth to that kind of
conception yeah i think that would be

3118
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
conception yeah i think that would be
 

3119
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,390
conception yeah i think that would be
somebody whose account

3120
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:28,400
somebody whose account
 

3121
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,990
somebody whose account
i mean

3122
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
i mean
 

3123
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,069
i mean
what i would say is you could say the

3124
00:48:36,069 --> 00:48:36,079
what i would say is you could say the
 

3125
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,589
what i would say is you could say the
same thing

3126
00:48:37,589 --> 00:48:37,599
same thing
 

3127
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,870
same thing
um about a bagel you could say i can

3128
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:40,880
um about a bagel you could say i can
 

3129
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,109
um about a bagel you could say i can
make a bagel by taking like a long

3130
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
make a bagel by taking like a long
 

3131
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,630
make a bagel by taking like a long
cylinder of dough which doesn't have a

3132
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:44,640
cylinder of dough which doesn't have a
 

3133
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:46,549
cylinder of dough which doesn't have a
hole and then smooshing the ends

3134
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:46,559
hole and then smooshing the ends
 

3135
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:47,670
hole and then smooshing the ends
together

3136
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:47,680
together
 

3137
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,589
together
now it's a bagel so if you're really

3138
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
now it's a bagel so if you're really
 

3139
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:50,870
now it's a bagel so if you're really
committed you can be like okay bagel

3140
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:50,880
committed you can be like okay bagel
 

3141
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,309
committed you can be like okay bagel
doesn't have a hole either but like

3142
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:52,319
doesn't have a hole either but like
 

3143
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:53,589
doesn't have a hole either but like
who are you if you say a bagel doesn't

3144
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:53,599
who are you if you say a bagel doesn't
 

3145
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,109
who are you if you say a bagel doesn't
have a hole i mean i don't know yeah so

3146
00:48:55,109 --> 00:48:55,119
have a hole i mean i don't know yeah so
 

3147
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:56,470
have a hole i mean i don't know yeah so
that's almost like an engineering

3148
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:56,480
that's almost like an engineering
 

3149
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,910
that's almost like an engineering
definition of it

3150
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:57,920
definition of it
 

3151
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,150
definition of it
okay fair enough so what's what about

3152
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:00,160
okay fair enough so what's what about
 

3153
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:01,349
okay fair enough so what's what about
the other options

3154
00:49:01,349 --> 00:49:01,359
the other options
 

3155
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:05,430
the other options
um so you know one whole people

3156
00:49:05,430 --> 00:49:05,440
um so you know one whole people
 

3157
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,470
um so you know one whole people
would say um i like how these are like

3158
00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:08,480
would say um i like how these are like
 

3159
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,750
would say um i like how these are like
groups of people

3160
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:09,760
groups of people
 

3161
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,309
groups of people
like where we've planted our foot yes

3162
00:49:12,309 --> 00:49:12,319
like where we've planted our foot yes
 

3163
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:12,870
like where we've planted our foot yes
one hole

3164
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:12,880
one hole
 

3165
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,150
one hole
there's books written about each belief

3166
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:16,160
there's books written about each belief
 

3167
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,190
there's books written about each belief
you know would say look there's like a

3168
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:17,200
you know would say look there's like a
 

3169
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,309
you know would say look there's like a
hole and it goes all the way through the

3170
00:49:18,309 --> 00:49:18,319
hole and it goes all the way through the
 

3171
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,069
hole and it goes all the way through the
straw right there it's one region of

3172
00:49:20,069 --> 00:49:20,079
straw right there it's one region of
 

3173
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,270
straw right there it's one region of
space that's the hole

3174
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:21,280
space that's the hole
 

3175
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:23,190
space that's the hole
yeah and there's one and two whole

3176
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
yeah and there's one and two whole
 

3177
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,150
yeah and there's one and two whole
people would say like well look there's

3178
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:24,160
people would say like well look there's
 

3179
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,470
people would say like well look there's
a hole in the top in the hole

3180
00:49:26,470 --> 00:49:26,480
a hole in the top in the hole
 

3181
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,190
a hole in the top in the hole
at the bottom um i think a common thing

3182
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:29,200
at the bottom um i think a common thing
 

3183
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,390
at the bottom um i think a common thing
you see

3184
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:30,400
you see
 

3185
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,910
you see
when people um

3186
00:49:33,910 --> 00:49:33,920
when people um
 

3187
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:34,870
when people um
argue about this they would take

3188
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:34,880
argue about this they would take
 

3189
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,030
argue about this they would take
something like this a bottle of water

3190
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:37,040
something like this a bottle of water
 

3191
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,990
something like this a bottle of water
i'm holding maybe i'll open it and they

3192
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:40,000
i'm holding maybe i'll open it and they
 

3193
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,190
i'm holding maybe i'll open it and they
say well how many holes are there in

3194
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,200
say well how many holes are there in
 

3195
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,390
say well how many holes are there in
this and you say like well there's one

3196
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
this and you say like well there's one
 

3197
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,349
this and you say like well there's one
there's one hole

3198

there's one hole
 

3199
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:45,670
there's one hole
at the top okay what if i like poke a

3200
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:45,680
at the top okay what if i like poke a
 

3201
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,670
at the top okay what if i like poke a
hole here so that all the water

3202
00:49:47,670 --> 00:49:47,680
hole here so that all the water
 

3203
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,790
hole here so that all the water
spills out well now it's a straw

3204
00:49:50,790 --> 00:49:50,800
spills out well now it's a straw
 

3205
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,630
spills out well now it's a straw
yeah so if you're a one hole or i say to

3206
00:49:52,630 --> 00:49:52,640
yeah so if you're a one hole or i say to
 

3207
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,309
yeah so if you're a one hole or i say to
you like well how many holes are

3208
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
you like well how many holes are
 

3209
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,790
you like well how many holes are
in it now there was a there was one hole

3210
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:56,800
in it now there was a there was one hole
 

3211
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,309
in it now there was a there was one hole
in it before and i poked a new hole in

3212
00:49:58,309 --> 00:49:58,319
in it before and i poked a new hole in
 

3213
00:49:58,319 --> 00:49:59,109
in it before and i poked a new hole in
it

3214
00:49:59,109 --> 00:49:59,119
it
 

3215
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,190
it
and then you think there's still one

3216
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
and then you think there's still one
 

3217
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,549
and then you think there's still one
hole even though there was

3218
00:50:02,549 --> 00:50:02,559
hole even though there was
 

3219
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:05,430
hole even though there was
one hole and i made one more clearly not

3220
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
one hole and i made one more clearly not
 

3221
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:05,750
one hole and i made one more clearly not
this

3222
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,760
this
 

3223
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,030
this
is two holes yeah um and yet if you're a

3224
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:09,040
is two holes yeah um and yet if you're a
 

3225
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,230
is two holes yeah um and yet if you're a
two hole the one holder will say like

3226
00:50:10,230 --> 00:50:10,240
two hole the one holder will say like
 

3227
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,829
two hole the one holder will say like
okay where does one hole begin in the

3228
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:11,839
okay where does one hole begin in the
 

3229
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,109
okay where does one hole begin in the
other whole end

3230
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:13,119
other whole end
 

3231
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,150
other whole end
yeah like what's it like and um

3232
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:16,160
yeah like what's it like and um
 

3233
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:17,910
yeah like what's it like and um
and in the in the book i sort of you

3234
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:17,920
and in the in the book i sort of you
 

3235
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,349
and in the in the book i sort of you
know in math there's two things we do

3236
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:19,359
know in math there's two things we do
 

3237
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:20,390
know in math there's two things we do
when we're faced with a problem that's

3238
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:20,400
when we're faced with a problem that's
 

3239
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:21,510
when we're faced with a problem that's
confusing us

3240
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:21,520
confusing us
 

3241
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,309
confusing us
um we can make the problem simpler

3242
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
um we can make the problem simpler
 

3243
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:25,589
um we can make the problem simpler
that's what we were doing a minute ago

3244
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:25,599
that's what we were doing a minute ago
 

3245
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,309
that's what we were doing a minute ago
and we were talking about high

3246
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:26,319
and we were talking about high
 

3247
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,430
and we were talking about high
dimensional space and i was like let's

3248
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:27,440
dimensional space and i was like let's
 

3249
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:27,990
dimensional space and i was like let's
talk about like

3250
00:50:27,990 --> 00:50:28,000
talk about like
 

3251
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,750
talk about like
circles and line segments let's go down

3252
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:29,760
circles and line segments let's go down
 

3253
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:31,270
circles and line segments let's go down
a dimension to make it easier

3254
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:31,280
a dimension to make it easier
 

3255
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:33,270
a dimension to make it easier
uh the other big move we have is to make

3256
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,280
uh the other big move we have is to make
 

3257
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,950
uh the other big move we have is to make
the problem harder

3258
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:34,960
the problem harder
 

3259
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,470
the problem harder
and try to sort of really like face up

3260
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:36,480
and try to sort of really like face up
 

3261
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,990
and try to sort of really like face up
to what are the complications so

3262
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:38,000
to what are the complications so
 

3263
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,270
to what are the complications so
you know what i do in the book is say

3264
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:39,280
you know what i do in the book is say
 

3265
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,870
you know what i do in the book is say
like let's stop talking about straws for

3266
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:40,880
like let's stop talking about straws for
 

3267
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,710
like let's stop talking about straws for
a minute and talk about pants

3268
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:42,720
a minute and talk about pants
 

3269
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,109
a minute and talk about pants
how many holes are there in a pair of

3270
00:50:45,109 --> 00:50:45,119
how many holes are there in a pair of
 

3271
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,069
how many holes are there in a pair of
pants

3272
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
pants
 

3273
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,510
pants
so i think most people who say there's

3274
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:47,520
so i think most people who say there's
 

3275
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,270
so i think most people who say there's
two holes in the straw would say there's

3276
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:49,280
two holes in the straw would say there's
 

3277
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,829
two holes in the straw would say there's
three holes in a pair of pants

3278
00:50:51,829 --> 00:50:51,839
three holes in a pair of pants
 

3279
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,349
three holes in a pair of pants
i guess i mean i guess we're filming

3280
00:50:53,349 --> 00:50:53,359
i guess i mean i guess we're filming
 

3281
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,870
i guess i mean i guess we're filming
only from here i could take up no i'm

3282
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
only from here i could take up no i'm
 

3283
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,390
only from here i could take up no i'm
not gonna do it

3284
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:56,400
not gonna do it
 

3285
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,750
not gonna do it
you'll just have to imagine the pants

3286
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,760
you'll just have to imagine the pants
 

3287
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,510
you'll just have to imagine the pants
sorry yeah um

3288
00:50:59,510 --> 00:50:59,520
sorry yeah um
 

3289
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:02,549
sorry yeah um
lex if you want it no okay no

3290
00:51:02,549 --> 00:51:02,559
lex if you want it no okay no
 

3291
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,470
lex if you want it no okay no
uh that's gonna be in the direction

3292
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:04,480
uh that's gonna be in the direction
 

3293
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:06,230
uh that's gonna be in the direction
that's the patreon-only footage

3294
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:06,240
that's the patreon-only footage
 

3295
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,630
that's the patreon-only footage
there you go so many people would say

3296
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:08,640
there you go so many people would say
 

3297
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,069
there you go so many people would say
there's three holes in the pair of pants

3298
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
there's three holes in the pair of pants
 

3299
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,349
there's three holes in the pair of pants
but you know for instance my daughter

3300
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
but you know for instance my daughter
 

3301
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:11,829
but you know for instance my daughter
when i asked

3302
00:51:11,829 --> 00:51:11,839
when i asked
 

3303
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:13,829
when i asked
by the way talking to kids about this is

3304
00:51:13,829 --> 00:51:13,839
by the way talking to kids about this is
 

3305
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,910
by the way talking to kids about this is
super fun i highly recommend it

3306
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:15,920
super fun i highly recommend it
 

3307
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:19,670
super fun i highly recommend it
um what did she say she said well

3308
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:19,680
um what did she say she said well
 

3309
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,510
um what did she say she said well
yeah i feel a pair of pants like just

3310
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
yeah i feel a pair of pants like just
 

3311
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,190
yeah i feel a pair of pants like just
has two holes because yes there's the

3312
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:23,200
has two holes because yes there's the
 

3313
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,870
has two holes because yes there's the
waist but that's just the two leg holes

3314
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:24,880
waist but that's just the two leg holes
 

3315
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,549
waist but that's just the two leg holes
stuck together

3316
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:26,559
stuck together
 

3317
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:29,829
stuck together
whoa okay two leg holes yeah okay right

3318
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:29,839
whoa okay two leg holes yeah okay right
 

3319
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,230
whoa okay two leg holes yeah okay right
i mean that's

3320
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,240
i mean that's
 

3321
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,390
i mean that's
she's a one caller for the straw so

3322
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:32,400
she's a one caller for the straw so
 

3323
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,390
she's a one caller for the straw so
she's a one-holer for the straw too

3324
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:34,400
she's a one-holer for the straw too
 

3325
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,230
she's a one-holer for the straw too
and um and that really does

3326
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:38,240
and um and that really does
 

3327
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,510
and um and that really does
capture something it captures this fact

3328
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
capture something it captures this fact
 

3329
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,589
capture something it captures this fact
which is central to the theory of what's

3330
00:51:43,589 --> 00:51:43,599
which is central to the theory of what's
 

3331
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,030
which is central to the theory of what's
called homology which is like a central

3332
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:45,040
called homology which is like a central
 

3333
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:46,630
called homology which is like a central
part of modern topology that

3334
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:46,640
part of modern topology that
 

3335
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,589
part of modern topology that
um holes whatever we may mean by them

3336
00:51:49,589 --> 00:51:49,599
um holes whatever we may mean by them
 

3337
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,950
um holes whatever we may mean by them
there are somehow things which have an

3338
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
there are somehow things which have an
 

3339
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,390
there are somehow things which have an
arithmetic to them they're things which

3340
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
arithmetic to them they're things which
 

3341
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:52,870
arithmetic to them they're things which
can be

3342
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:52,880
can be
 

3343
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,990
can be
added like the waste like waste equals

3344
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:56,000
added like the waste like waste equals
 

3345
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,109
added like the waste like waste equals
leg plus leg

3346
00:51:57,109 --> 00:51:57,119
leg plus leg
 

3347
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,870
leg plus leg
is kind of an equation but it's not an

3348
00:51:58,870 --> 00:51:58,880
is kind of an equation but it's not an
 

3349
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:00,630
is kind of an equation but it's not an
equation about numbers it's an equation

3350
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:00,640
equation about numbers it's an equation
 

3351
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:02,069
equation about numbers it's an equation
about some kind of

3352
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:02,079
about some kind of
 

3353
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:04,309
about some kind of
geometric some kind of topological thing

3354
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:04,319
geometric some kind of topological thing
 

3355
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,750
geometric some kind of topological thing
which is very strange and so

3356
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:05,760
which is very strange and so
 

3357
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,790
which is very strange and so
you know when i come down um

3358
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:08,800
you know when i come down um
 

3359
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:10,549
you know when i come down um
you know like a rabbi i like to kind of

3360
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:10,559
you know like a rabbi i like to kind of
 

3361
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:12,150
you know like a rabbi i like to kind of
like come up with these answers and

3362
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:12,160
like come up with these answers and
 

3363
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:12,870
like come up with these answers and
somehow like

3364
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:12,880
somehow like
 

3365
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,630
somehow like
dodge the original question and say like

3366
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:14,640
dodge the original question and say like
 

3367
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,109
dodge the original question and say like
you're both right my children okay so

3368
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:17,119
you're both right my children okay so
 

3369
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:20,549
you're both right my children okay so
yeah uh so for this for the

3370
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:20,559
yeah uh so for this for the
 

3371
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,870
yeah uh so for this for the
for the straw i think what a modern

3372
00:52:22,870 --> 00:52:22,880
for the straw i think what a modern
 

3373
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,829
for the straw i think what a modern
mathematician would say is like

3374
00:52:25,829 --> 00:52:25,839
mathematician would say is like
 

3375
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,910
mathematician would say is like
the first version would be to say like

3376
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:27,920
the first version would be to say like
 

3377
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,430
the first version would be to say like
well they're two holes but they're

3378
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:29,440
well they're two holes but they're
 

3379
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:31,190
well they're two holes but they're
really both the same hole

3380
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
really both the same hole
 

3381
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,630
really both the same hole
well that's not quite right a better way

3382
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:32,640
well that's not quite right a better way
 

3383
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,630
well that's not quite right a better way
to say it is there's two holes

3384
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:34,640
to say it is there's two holes
 

3385
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,510
to say it is there's two holes
but one is the negative of the other now

3386
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:37,520
but one is the negative of the other now
 

3387
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:38,950
but one is the negative of the other now
what can that mean

3388
00:52:38,950 --> 00:52:38,960
what can that mean
 

3389
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,870
what can that mean
um one way of thinking about what it

3390
00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:40,880
um one way of thinking about what it
 

3391
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,710
um one way of thinking about what it
means is that if you sip something like

3392
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
means is that if you sip something like
 

3393
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,549
means is that if you sip something like
a milkshake through the straw

3394
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
a milkshake through the straw
 

3395
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:47,990
a milkshake through the straw
no matter what the amount of milkshake

3396
00:52:47,990 --> 00:52:48,000
no matter what the amount of milkshake
 

3397
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,750
no matter what the amount of milkshake
that's flowing in one end

3398
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:49,760
that's flowing in one end
 

3399
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,309
that's flowing in one end
that same amount is flowing out the

3400
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:52,319
that same amount is flowing out the
 

3401
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,190
that same amount is flowing out the
other end

3402
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:53,200
other end
 

3403
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,549
other end
so they're not independent from each

3404
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
so they're not independent from each
 

3405
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:57,109
so they're not independent from each
other there's some relationship

3406
00:52:57,109 --> 00:52:57,119
other there's some relationship
 

3407
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,069
other there's some relationship
between them in the same way that if you

3408
00:53:00,069 --> 00:53:00,079
between them in the same way that if you
 

3409
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,270
between them in the same way that if you
somehow could like

3410
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
somehow could like
 

3411
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,030

all those kinds of things
 

3479
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,910
all those kinds of things
but anyway so the inflow on the top of

but anyway so the inflow on the top of
 

3481

the pants
 

3483
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:13,190

00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:17,920
exactly so this idea that
 

3489
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,750
exactly so this idea that
i mean i think you know poincare really

3490

i mean i think you know poincare really
 

3491
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,670
i mean i think you know poincare really
have these i this idea this sort of

3492
00:54:21,670 --> 00:54:21,680
have these i this idea this sort of
 

3493
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,710
have these i this idea this sort of
modern idea

3494
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:22,720
modern idea
 

3495
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,470
modern idea
i mean building on stuff other people

did uh betty is an important one

3498
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:26,640
did uh betty is an important one
 

3499
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,790
did uh betty is an important one
of this kind of modern notion of

3500
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:28,800
of this kind of modern notion of
 

3501
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,230
of this kind of modern notion of
relations between holes but the idea

3502
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:30,240
relations between holes but the idea
 

3503
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,390
relations between holes but the idea
that holes really had an arithmetic

3504
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:32,400
that holes really had an arithmetic
 

3505
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,990
that holes really had an arithmetic
the really modern view was really emmy

3506
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
the really modern view was really emmy
 

3507
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,710

nerder's idea so she kind of comes in

3508
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:36,720
nerder's idea so she kind of comes in
 

3509
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,589
nerder's idea so she kind of comes in
and sort of truly puts the subject

3510
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:39,599
and sort of truly puts the subject
 

3511
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:42,470
and sort of truly puts the subject
uh on its modern footing that we have

3512
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
uh on its modern footing that we have
 

3513
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,150
uh on its modern footing that we have
that we have now so

3514

a course so that you read this chapter
 

3523
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:50,870
a course so that you read this chapter
and then you're like oh it's just like i

took like
 

3527
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,349
took like
a semester of algebraic apology it's not

3528
00:54:53,349 --> 00:54:53,359
a semester of algebraic apology it's not
 

3529
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,390
a semester of algebraic apology it's not
like this and it's always a you know

it's always a challenge
writing about math because there are

3534
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
writing about math because there are
 

3535
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,150
writing about math because there are
some things

3536
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:00,160
some things
 

3537
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,750
some things
that you can really do on the page and

3538
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:01,760
that you can really do on the page and
 

3539
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,670
that you can really do on the page and
the math is there and there's other

3540
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:03,680
the math is there and there's other
 

3541
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,190
the math is there and there's other
things which

3542
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:05,200
things which
 

3543
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:06,549
things which
it's too much in a book like this like

3544
00:55:06,549 --> 00:55:06,559
it's too much in a book like this like
 

3545
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,390
it's too much in a book like this like
do them all the page you can only

3546
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,400
do them all the page you can only
 

3547
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,549
do them all the page you can only
say something about them if that makes

3548
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:10,559
say something about them if that makes
 

3549
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,470
say something about them if that makes
sense um

3550
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
sense um
 

3551
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,910
sense um
so you know in the book i try to do some

3552
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
so you know in the book i try to do some
 

3553
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,030
so you know in the book i try to do some
of both i try to do i try to

3554
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
of both i try to do i try to
 

3555
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,589
of both i try to do i try to
topics that are you can't really

3556
00:55:19,589 --> 00:55:19,599
topics that are you can't really
 

3557
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,630
topics that are you can't really
compress

3558
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:20,640
compress
 

3559
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,950
compress
and really truly say exactly what they

3560
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:22,960
and really truly say exactly what they
 

3561
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,069
and really truly say exactly what they
are

3562
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:24,079
are
 

3563
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,270
are
in this amount of space um

3564
00:55:27,270 --> 00:55:27,280
in this amount of space um
 

3565
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:28,710
in this amount of space um
i try to say something interesting about

3566
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
i try to say something interesting about
 

3567
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,150
i try to say something interesting about
them something meaningful about them so

3568
00:55:30,150 --> 00:55:30,160
them something meaningful about them so
 

3569
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,670
them something meaningful about them so
that readers can get the flavor

3570
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
that readers can get the flavor
 

3571
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,710
that readers can get the flavor
um and then in other places i really try

3572
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
um and then in other places i really try
 

3573
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,470
um and then in other places i really try
to get up close and personal

3574
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:36,480
to get up close and personal
 

3575
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:38,390
to get up close and personal
and really do the math and have it take

3576
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:38,400
and really do the math and have it take
 

3577
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,470
and really do the math and have it take
place on the page

3578
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:40,480
place on the page
 

3579
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,990
place on the page
to some degree be able to give inklings

3580
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:44,000
to some degree be able to give inklings
 

3581
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,750
to some degree be able to give inklings
of the beauty of the subject

3582
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
of the beauty of the subject
 

3583
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,789
of the beauty of the subject
yeah i mean there's you know there's a

3584
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:46,799
yeah i mean there's you know there's a
 

3585
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,630
yeah i mean there's you know there's a
lot of books that are like i don't quite

3586
00:55:48,630 --> 00:55:48,640
lot of books that are like i don't quite
 

3587
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:50,150
lot of books that are like i don't quite
know how to express this well i'm still

3588
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:50,160
know how to express this well i'm still
 

3589
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,510
know how to express this well i'm still
laboring to do it but um there's a lot

3590
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:53,520
laboring to do it but um there's a lot
 

3591
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,230
laboring to do it but um there's a lot
of books that

3592
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
of books that
 

3593
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:57,270
of books that
are about stuff

3594
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:57,280
are about stuff
 

3595
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,630
are about stuff
but i want my books to not only be about

3596
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
but i want my books to not only be about
 

3597
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,549
but i want my books to not only be about
stuff but to actually have some stuff

3598
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
stuff but to actually have some stuff
 

3599
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:04,390
stuff but to actually have some stuff
there on the page in the book for people

3600
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:04,400
there on the page in the book for people
 

3601
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,910
there on the page in the book for people
to interact with directly and not just

3602
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:05,920
to interact with directly and not just
 

3603
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,270
to interact with directly and not just
sort of hear me talk about distant

3604
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:07,280
sort of hear me talk about distant
 

3605
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:07,990
sort of hear me talk about distant
features about

3606
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
features about
 

3607
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,470
features about
just different distant features of it

3608
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:10,480
just different distant features of it
 

3609
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,349
just different distant features of it
right so

3610
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:11,359
right so
 

3611
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:14,309
right so
not be talking just about ideas but the

3612
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:14,319
not be talking just about ideas but the
 

3613
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,109
not be talking just about ideas but the
actually be

3614
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
actually be
 

3615
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,349
actually be
expressing the idea is there you know

3616
00:56:17,349 --> 00:56:17,359
expressing the idea is there you know
 

3617
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:18,630
expressing the idea is there you know
somebody in the

3618
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:18,640
somebody in the
 

3619
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,589
somebody in the
maybe you can comment there's a guy his

3620
00:56:21,589 --> 00:56:21,599
maybe you can comment there's a guy his
 

3621
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:22,710
maybe you can comment there's a guy his
youtube channel is

3622
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:22,720
youtube channel is
 

3623
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,589
youtube channel is
three blue one brown grant sanderson he

three blue one brown grant sanderson he
 

3625
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,470
three blue one brown grant sanderson he
does that

3626
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:26,480
does that

masterfully well absolutely of uh
 

3629
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,270
masterfully well absolutely of uh
visualizing of expressing a particular

3630
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:31,280
visualizing of expressing a particular
 

3631
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,190
visualizing of expressing a particular
idea and then talking about it as well

3632
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,200
idea and then talking about it as well
 

3633
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,349
idea and then talking about it as well
back and forth uh what do you what do

3634
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:35,359
back and forth uh what do you what do
 

3635
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,950
back and forth uh what do you what do
you think about grant

3636
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:36,960
you think about grant
 

3637
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,270
you think about grant
it's fantastic i mean the flowering of

3638
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:39,280
it's fantastic i mean the flowering of
 

3639
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,190
it's fantastic i mean the flowering of
math youtube is like such a wonderful

3640
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
math youtube is like such a wonderful
 

3641
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,789
math youtube is like such a wonderful
thing because

3642
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:42,799
thing because
 

3643
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:45,430
thing because
you know math teaching there's so many

3644
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:45,440
you know math teaching there's so many
 

3645
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,950
you know math teaching there's so many
different venues

3646
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:46,960
different venues
 

3647
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,950
different venues
through which we can teach people math

3648
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:48,960
through which we can teach people math
 

3649
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:50,710
through which we can teach people math
there's the traditional one right

3650
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:50,720
there's the traditional one right
 

3651
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,230
there's the traditional one right
well where i'm in a classroom with

3652
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:54,240
well where i'm in a classroom with
 

3653
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,430
well where i'm in a classroom with
you know depending on the class it could

3654
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:55,440
you know depending on the class it could
 

3655
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:57,589
you know depending on the class it could
be 30 people it could be 100 people

3656
00:56:57,589 --> 00:56:57,599
be 30 people it could be 100 people
 

3657
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:59,430
be 30 people it could be 100 people
it could god help maybe 500 people if

3658
00:56:59,430 --> 00:56:59,440
it could god help maybe 500 people if
 

3659
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:00,630
it could god help maybe 500 people if
it's like the big calculus lecture or

3660
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:00,640
it's like the big calculus lecture or
 

3661
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:01,750
it's like the big calculus lecture or
whatever it may be

3662
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
whatever it may be
 

3663
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,630
whatever it may be
and there's sort of some but there's

3664
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
and there's sort of some but there's
 

3665
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:03,829
and there's sort of some but there's
some set of people of that order of

3666
00:57:03,829 --> 00:57:03,839
some set of people of that order of
 

3667
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:04,870
some set of people of that order of
magnitude

3668
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:04,880
magnitude
 

3669
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:06,069
magnitude
and i'm with them for we have a long

3670
00:57:06,069 --> 00:57:06,079
and i'm with them for we have a long
 

3671
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:08,230
and i'm with them for we have a long
time i'm with them for a whole semester

3672
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:08,240
time i'm with them for a whole semester
 

3673
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:09,750
time i'm with them for a whole semester
and i can ask them to do homework and we

3674
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:09,760
and i can ask them to do homework and we
 

3675
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,030
and i can ask them to do homework and we
talk together we have office hours that

3676
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:11,040
talk together we have office hours that
 

3677
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,309
talk together we have office hours that
they have one-on-one questions multiply

3678
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:12,319
they have one-on-one questions multiply
 

3679
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:13,589
they have one-on-one questions multiply
that's like a very high level of

3680
00:57:13,589 --> 00:57:13,599
that's like a very high level of
 

3681
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:14,390
that's like a very high level of
engagement

3682
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:14,400
engagement
 

3683
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,309
engagement
but how many people am i actually

3684
00:57:16,309 --> 00:57:16,319
but how many people am i actually
 

3685
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,910
but how many people am i actually
hitting at a time like not

3686
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
hitting at a time like not
 

3687
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,270
hitting at a time like not
that many right um and you can

3688
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:21,280
that many right um and you can
 

3689
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:22,230
that many right um and you can
and there's kind of an inverse

3690
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:22,240
and there's kind of an inverse
 

3691
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,030
and there's kind of an inverse
relationship where the

3692
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:25,040
relationship where the

00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:56,400
to be able to
 

3855
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:58,870
to be able to
to visualize it in that way and not just

3856
00:59:58,870 --> 00:59:58,880
to visualize it in that way and not just
 

3857
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,990
to visualize it in that way and not just
understand it but really kind of

3858
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:02,000
understand it but really kind of
 

3859
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,710
understand it but really kind of
think in a very novel way it's funny

3860
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:04,720
think in a very novel way it's funny
 

3861
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,549
think in a very novel way it's funny
because i i've spoken with him a couple

3862
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
because i i've spoken with him a couple
 

3863
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,190
because i i've spoken with him a couple
times

3864
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,200
times
 

3865
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,829
times
i've spoken to him a lot offline as well

3866
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
i've spoken to him a lot offline as well
 

3867
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,910
i've spoken to him a lot offline as well
he really doesn't think

3868
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
he really doesn't think
 

3869
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:15,589
he really doesn't think
he's doing anything new meaning like

3870
01:00:15,589 --> 01:00:15,599
he's doing anything new meaning like
 

3871
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:17,510
he's doing anything new meaning like
he sees himself as very different from

3872
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:17,520
he sees himself as very different from
 

3873
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,390
he sees himself as very different from
maybe like a researcher

3874
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:20,400
maybe like a researcher
 

3875
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,990
maybe like a researcher
but it feels to me

3876
01:00:23,990 --> 01:00:24,000
but it feels to me
 

3877
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,309
but it feels to me
like he's creating something totally new

3878
01:00:26,309 --> 01:00:26,319
like he's creating something totally new
 

3879
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,910
like he's creating something totally new
like that act of understanding

3880
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:27,920
like that act of understanding
 

3881
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,270
like that act of understanding
visualizing

3882
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:29,280
visualizing
 

3883
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,230
visualizing
is as powerful or has the same kind of

3884
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:32,240
is as powerful or has the same kind of
 

3885
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,910
is as powerful or has the same kind of
inkling of power as does

3886
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:33,920
inkling of power as does
 

3887
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,630
inkling of power as does
the process of proving something you

3888
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:36,640
the process of proving something you
 

3889
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,030
the process of proving something you
know

3890
01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:37,040
know
 

3891
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,630
know
it just it doesn't have that clear

3892
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:38,640
it just it doesn't have that clear
 

3893
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:40,390
it just it doesn't have that clear
destination but it's

3894
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:40,400
destination but it's
 

3895
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,190
destination but it's
it's pulling out an insight and creating

3896
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:43,200
it's pulling out an insight and creating
 

3897
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,870
it's pulling out an insight and creating
multiple sets of perspective

3898
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
multiple sets of perspective
 

3899
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,430
multiple sets of perspective
that arrive at that insight and to be

3900
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,440
that arrive at that insight and to be
 

3901
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,349
that arrive at that insight and to be
honest it's something that i think we

3902
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:49,359
honest it's something that i think we
 

3903
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:49,910
honest it's something that i think we
haven't

01:00:53,430 --> 01:00:53,440
quite figured out how to value
 

3907
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:55,030
quite figured out how to value
inside academic mathematics in the same

inside academic mathematics in the same
 

3909
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,470
inside academic mathematics in the same
way and this is a bit older that i think

we haven't quite
figured out how to value the development

01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,359
figured out how to value the development
 

3915
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:00,950
figured out how to value the development
of computational infrastructure you know

3916
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
of computational infrastructure you know
 

3917
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,549

we all have computers as our partners
 

3919
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:04,710
we all have computers as our partners
now and people

3920
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:04,720
now and people
 

3921
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:07,829
now and people
build computers that sort of assist and

3922
01:01:07,829 --> 01:01:07,839
build computers that sort of assist and
 

3923
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:09,349
build computers that sort of assist and
participate in our mathematics they

3924
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
participate in our mathematics they
 

3925
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,109
participate in our mathematics they
build those systems and that's

3926
01:01:11,109 --> 01:01:11,119
build those systems and that's
 

3927
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,030
build those systems and that's
a kind of mathematics too but not in the

3928
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:13,040
a kind of mathematics too but not in the
 

3929
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,549
a kind of mathematics too but not in the
traditional form of

traditional form of
 

3931
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:16,390
traditional form of
proving theorems and writing papers but

3932
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:16,400
proving theorems and writing papers but
 

3933
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,270
proving theorems and writing papers but
i think it's coming look i mean i think

3934
01:01:19,270 --> 01:01:19,280
i think it's coming look i mean i think
 

3935
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,750
i think it's coming look i mean i think
you know for example the institute for

you know it's a nsf-funded math
 

3943
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,710
you know it's a nsf-funded math
institute very much part of sort of

3944
01:01:28,710 --> 01:01:28,720
institute very much part of sort of
 

3945
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:30,230
institute very much part of sort of
traditional math academia they did an

3946
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:30,240
traditional math academia they did an
 

3947
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,470
traditional math academia they did an
entire theme semester about visualizing

3948
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:32,480
entire theme semester about visualizing
 

3949
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:33,829
entire theme semester about visualizing
mathematics looking at the same kind of

3950
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
mathematics looking at the same kind of
 

3951
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:35,109
mathematics looking at the same kind of
thing that they would do for like

3952
01:01:35,109 --> 01:01:35,119
thing that they would do for like
 

3953
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:37,750
thing that they would do for like
an up-and-coming research topic like

3954
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
an up-and-coming research topic like
 

3955
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,950
an up-and-coming research topic like
that's pretty cool so i think there

3956
01:01:38,950 --> 01:01:38,960
that's pretty cool so i think there
 

3957
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:39,589
that's pretty cool so i think there
really is

3958
01:01:39,589 --> 01:01:39,599
really is
 

3959
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:43,190
really is
buy-in from uh the mathematics community

3960
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
buy-in from uh the mathematics community
 

3961
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,789
buy-in from uh the mathematics community
to recognize that this kind of stuff is

3962
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
to recognize that this kind of stuff is
 

3963
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,789
to recognize that this kind of stuff is
important and counts as part of

3964
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:46,799
important and counts as part of
 

3965
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,950
important and counts as part of
mathematics like part of what we're

3966
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
mathematics like part of what we're
 

3967
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,390
mathematics like part of what we're
actually here to do

3968
01:01:50,390 --> 01:01:50,400
actually here to do
 

3969
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,670
actually here to do
yeah i'm hoping to see more and more of

3970
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:51,680
yeah i'm hoping to see more and more of
 

3971
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,309
yeah i'm hoping to see more and more of
that from like mit faculty from faculty

from all the
 

3975
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,589
from all the
the top universities in the world let me

3976
01:01:57,589 --> 01:01:57,599
the top universities in the world let me
 

3977
01:01:57,599 --> 01:01:59,270
the top universities in the world let me
ask you this weird question about the

3978
01:01:59,270 --> 01:01:59,280
ask you this weird question about the
 

3979
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:01,430
ask you this weird question about the
fields medal which is the nobel prize in

3980
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:01,440
fields medal which is the nobel prize in
 

3981
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:02,950
fields medal which is the nobel prize in
mathematics

3982

mathematics
 

3983
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,549
mathematics
do you think since we're talking about

3984
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
do you think since we're talking about
 

3985
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,710
do you think since we're talking about
computers there will one

3986
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
computers there will one
 

3987
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,309
computers there will one
day come a time

3988
01:02:10,309 --> 01:02:10,319
day come a time
 

3989
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:13,190
day come a time
when a computer an ai system will win a

3990
01:02:13,190 --> 01:02:13,200
when a computer an ai system will win a
 

3991
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,910
when a computer an ai system will win a
field medal

3992
01:02:15,910 --> 01:02:15,920

 

3993
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,190

no of course that's what a human would

3994
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
no of course that's what a human would
 

3995
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,870
no of course that's what a human would
say why not

3996
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:20,880
say why not
 

3997
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:22,549
say why not
it's is that like you're that that's

3998
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:22,559
it's is that like you're that that's
 

3999
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:23,829
it's is that like you're that that's
like my captcha that's like the proof

4000
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:23,839
like my captcha that's like the proof
 

4001
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:27,349
like my captcha that's like the proof
that i'm a human

4002
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,359

 

4003
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:29,109

how does he want me to answer is there

4004
01:02:29,109 --> 01:02:29,119
how does he want me to answer is there
 

4005
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,710
how does he want me to answer is there
something interesting to be said about

4006
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:30,720
something interesting to be said about
 

4007
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,910
something interesting to be said about
that

4008
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:31,920
that
 

4009
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:34,630
that
yeah i mean i am tremendously interested

01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:34,640
yeah i mean i am tremendously interested
 

4011
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,510
yeah i mean i am tremendously interested
in

4012
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:35,520
in
 

4013
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,829
in
what ai can do in pure mathematics i

4014
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:37,839
what ai can do in pure mathematics i
 

4015
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,029
what ai can do in pure mathematics i
mean it's of course

4016
01:02:39,029 --> 01:02:39,039
mean it's of course
 

4017
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:40,549
mean it's of course
it's a parochial interest right you're

4018
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:40,559
it's a parochial interest right you're
 

4019
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:41,829
it's a parochial interest right you're
like why am i interested in like how it

4020
01:02:41,829 --> 01:02:41,839
like why am i interested in like how it
 

4021
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:43,349
like why am i interested in like how it
can like help feed the world or help

4022
01:02:43,349 --> 01:02:43,359
can like help feed the world or help
 

4023
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,109
can like help feed the world or help
solve like there's problems i'm like can

4024
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
solve like there's problems i'm like can
 

4025
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:45,589
solve like there's problems i'm like can
i do

4026
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:45,599
i do
 

4027
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,829
i do
more math like what can i do we all have

4028
01:02:47,829 --> 01:02:47,839
more math like what can i do we all have
 

4029
01:02:47,839 --> 01:02:49,510
more math like what can i do we all have
our interests right um

4030
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:49,520
our interests right um
 

4031
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:51,910
our interests right um
but i think it is a really interesting

4032
01:02:51,910 --> 01:02:51,920
but i think it is a really interesting
 

4033
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:52,789
but i think it is a really interesting
conceptual

4034
01:02:52,789 --> 01:02:52,799
conceptual
 

4035
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:56,549
conceptual
question and here too i think

4036
01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:56,559
question and here too i think
 

4037
01:02:56,559 --> 01:02:59,109
question and here too i think
um it's important to be kind of

4038
01:02:59,109 --> 01:02:59,119
um it's important to be kind of
 

4039
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:00,950
um it's important to be kind of
historical because it's certainly true

4040
01:03:00,950 --> 01:03:00,960
historical because it's certainly true
 

4041
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,789
historical because it's certainly true
that there's lots of things that we used

4042
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
that there's lots of things that we used
 

4043
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:04,710
that there's lots of things that we used
to call research and mathematics

4044
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:04,720
to call research and mathematics
 

4045
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,349
to call research and mathematics
that we would now call computation yeah

4046
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:07,359
that we would now call computation yeah
 

4047
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:08,950
that we would now call computation yeah
tasks that we've now offloaded to

4048
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:08,960
tasks that we've now offloaded to
 

4049
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:09,990
tasks that we've now offloaded to
machines like

4050
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:10,000
machines like
 

4051
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,470
machines like
you know in 1890 somebody could be like

4052
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
you know in 1890 somebody could be like
 

4053
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:14,549
you know in 1890 somebody could be like
here's my phd thesis i

4054
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:14,559
here's my phd thesis i
 

4055
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:17,190
here's my phd thesis i
computed all the invariants of this

4056
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:17,200
computed all the invariants of this
 

4057
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,190
computed all the invariants of this
polynomial ring under the action of some

4058
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
polynomial ring under the action of some
 

4059
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,789
polynomial ring under the action of some
finite group doesn't matter what those

4060
01:03:20,789 --> 01:03:20,799
finite group doesn't matter what those
 

4061
01:03:20,799 --> 01:03:22,710
finite group doesn't matter what those
words mean just it's like something that

4062
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:22,720
words mean just it's like something that
 

4063
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,910
words mean just it's like something that
in 1890

4064
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:23,920
in 1890
 

4065
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,150
in 1890
would take a person a year to do and

4066
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:26,160
would take a person a year to do and
 

4067
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,430
would take a person a year to do and
would be a valuable thing that you might

4068
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:27,440
would be a valuable thing that you might
 

4069
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,870
would be a valuable thing that you might
want to know and it's still a valuable

4070
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
want to know and it's still a valuable
 

4071
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:29,990
want to know and it's still a valuable
thing that you might want to know but

4072
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:30,000
thing that you might want to know but
 

4073
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,710
thing that you might want to know but
now you type a few lines of code in

4074
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:32,720
now you type a few lines of code in
 

4075
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,789
now you type a few lines of code in
macaulay or sage

4076
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
macaulay or sage
 

4077
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:37,910
macaulay or sage
or magma and you just have it so we

4078
01:03:37,910 --> 01:03:37,920
or magma and you just have it so we
 

4079
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,589
or magma and you just have it so we
don't think of that as

4080
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
don't think of that as
 

4081
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:40,870
don't think of that as
math anymore even though it's the same

4082
01:03:40,870 --> 01:03:40,880
math anymore even though it's the same
 

4083
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:43,270
math anymore even though it's the same
thing what's macaulay sage and magma

4084
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:43,280
thing what's macaulay sage and magma
 

4085
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,870
thing what's macaulay sage and magma
oh those are computer algebra programs

4086
01:03:44,870 --> 01:03:44,880
oh those are computer algebra programs
 

4087
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,309
oh those are computer algebra programs
so those are like sort of bespoke

4088
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:46,319
so those are like sort of bespoke
 

4089
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:47,910
so those are like sort of bespoke
systems that lots of mathematicians use

4090
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:47,920
systems that lots of mathematicians use
 

4091
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,510
systems that lots of mathematicians use
that's similar to maple and

4092
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:49,520
that's similar to maple and
 

4093
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,029
that's similar to maple and
yeah oh yeah so similar to maple and

4094
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
yeah oh yeah so similar to maple and
 

4095
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,789
yeah oh yeah so similar to maple and
mathematica yeah okay but a little more

4096
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
mathematica yeah okay but a little more
 

4097
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:54,470
mathematica yeah okay but a little more
specialized but yeah

4098
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:54,480
specialized but yeah
 

4099
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,549
specialized but yeah
it's programs that work with symbols and

4100
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:56,559
it's programs that work with symbols and
 

4101
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,150
it's programs that work with symbols and
allow you to do can you do proofs can

4102
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:58,160
allow you to do can you do proofs can
 

4103
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:58,630
allow you to do can you do proofs can
you do

4104
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,640
you do
 

4105
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,470
you do
kind of kind of little little leaps and

4106
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
kind of kind of little little leaps and
 

4107
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,309
kind of kind of little little leaps and
proofs they're not really built for that

4108
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:02,319
proofs they're not really built for that
 

4109
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:03,670
proofs they're not really built for that
that's a whole other

4110
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
that's a whole other
 

4111
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,829
that's a whole other
story but these tools are part of the

4112
01:04:05,829 --> 01:04:05,839
story but these tools are part of the
 

4113
01:04:05,839 --> 01:04:07,270
story but these tools are part of the
process of mathematics now

4114
01:04:07,270 --> 01:04:07,280
process of mathematics now
 

4115
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:08,710
process of mathematics now
right they are now for most

4116
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
right they are now for most
 

4117
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:10,470
right they are now for most
mathematicians i would say part of the

4118
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:10,480
mathematicians i would say part of the
 

4119
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,470
mathematicians i would say part of the
process of mathematics and so

4120
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
process of mathematics and so
 

4121
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,309
process of mathematics and so
um you know there's a story i tell in

4122
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
um you know there's a story i tell in
 

4123
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,309
um you know there's a story i tell in
the book which i'm fascinated by which

4124
01:04:16,309 --> 01:04:16,319
the book which i'm fascinated by which
 

4125
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,349
the book which i'm fascinated by which
is

4126
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:17,359
is
 

4127
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:21,589
is
you know so far attempts

4128
01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:21,599
you know so far attempts
 

4129
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:24,470
you know so far attempts
to get ais to prove interesting theorems

4130
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:24,480
to get ais to prove interesting theorems
 

4131
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:26,069
to get ais to prove interesting theorems
have not

4132
01:04:26,069 --> 01:04:26,079
have not
 

4133
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:28,230
have not
done so well doesn't mean they can it's

4134
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:28,240
done so well doesn't mean they can it's
 

4135
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:30,069
done so well doesn't mean they can it's
actually a paper i just saw which

4136
01:04:30,069 --> 01:04:30,079
actually a paper i just saw which
 

4137
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:32,309
actually a paper i just saw which
has a very nice use of a neuron that

4138
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:32,319
has a very nice use of a neuron that
 

4139
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,470
has a very nice use of a neuron that
defined counter examples to conjecture

4140
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:34,480
defined counter examples to conjecture
 

4141
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,829
defined counter examples to conjecture
somebody said like well maybe this is

4142
01:04:35,829 --> 01:04:35,839
somebody said like well maybe this is
 

4143
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,789
somebody said like well maybe this is
always that

4144
01:04:36,789 --> 01:04:36,799
always that
 

4145
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,230
always that
yeah and you can be like well let me

4146
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
yeah and you can be like well let me
 

4147
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:39,990
yeah and you can be like well let me
sort of train an ai to sort of try

4148
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:40,000
sort of train an ai to sort of try
 

4149
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,109
sort of train an ai to sort of try
to find things where that's not true and

4150
01:04:43,109 --> 01:04:43,119
to find things where that's not true and
 

4151
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:44,789
to find things where that's not true and
it actually succeeded now in this case

4152
01:04:44,789 --> 01:04:44,799
it actually succeeded now in this case
 

4153
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,990
it actually succeeded now in this case
if you look at the things that it found

4154
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:48,000
if you look at the things that it found
 

4155
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,349
if you look at the things that it found
you say like okay i mean

4156
01:04:51,349 --> 01:04:51,359
you say like okay i mean
 

4157
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:53,029
you say like okay i mean
these are not famous conjectures yes

4158
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:53,039
these are not famous conjectures yes
 

4159
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,630
these are not famous conjectures yes
okay so like somebody wrote this down

4160
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:54,640
okay so like somebody wrote this down
 

4161
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:55,829
okay so like somebody wrote this down
maybe this is so

4162
01:04:55,829 --> 01:04:55,839
maybe this is so
 

4163
01:04:55,839 --> 01:04:59,670
maybe this is so
um looking at what the ai came up with

4164
01:04:59,670 --> 01:04:59,680
um looking at what the ai came up with
 

4165
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:00,710
um looking at what the ai came up with
you're like

4166
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:00,720
you're like
 

4167
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,190
you're like
you know i bet if like five grad

4168
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
you know i bet if like five grad
 

4169
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,470
you know i bet if like five grad
students had thought about that problem

4170
01:05:04,470 --> 01:05:04,480
students had thought about that problem
 

4171
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,430
students had thought about that problem
they wouldn't

4172
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:05,440
they wouldn't
 

4173
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,870
they wouldn't
i mean when you see it you're like okay

4174
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:06,880
i mean when you see it you're like okay
 

4175
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,230
i mean when you see it you're like okay
that is one of the things you might try

4176
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:08,240
that is one of the things you might try
 

4177
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,589
that is one of the things you might try
if you sort of like

4178
01:05:09,589 --> 01:05:09,599
if you sort of like
 

4179
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:11,910
if you sort of like
put some work into it still it's pretty

4180
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:11,920
put some work into it still it's pretty
 

4181
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,150
put some work into it still it's pretty
awesome right but the story i tell

4182
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:14,160
awesome right but the story i tell
 

4183
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,390
awesome right but the story i tell
in the book which i'm fascinated by is

4184
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:16,400
in the book which i'm fascinated by is
 

4185
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:18,069
in the book which i'm fascinated by is
um

4186
01:05:18,069 --> 01:05:18,079
um
 

4187
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,390
um
there is there's okay we're gonna go

4188
01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:20,400
there is there's okay we're gonna go
 

4189
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:21,270
there is there's okay we're gonna go
back to knots

4190
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:21,280
back to knots
 

4191
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,710
back to knots
it's cool there's a knot called the

4192
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:22,720
it's cool there's a knot called the
 

4193
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,789
it's cool there's a knot called the
conway knot after john conway maybe

4194
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
conway knot after john conway maybe
 

4195
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:25,750
conway knot after john conway maybe
we'll talk about a very interesting

4196
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:25,760
we'll talk about a very interesting
 

4197
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:27,990
we'll talk about a very interesting
character also he has a small tangent

4198
01:05:27,990 --> 01:05:28,000
character also he has a small tangent
 

4199
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,430
character also he has a small tangent
somebody i was supposed to talk to and

4200
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:29,440
somebody i was supposed to talk to and
 

4201
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:31,829
somebody i was supposed to talk to and
unfortunately he passed away and

4202
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
unfortunately he passed away and
 

4203
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,990
unfortunately he passed away and
he's he's somebody i find is an

4204
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:34,000
he's he's somebody i find is an
 

4205
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,510
he's he's somebody i find is an
incredible mathematician incredible

4206
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:35,520
incredible mathematician incredible
 

4207
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,069
incredible mathematician incredible
human being

4208
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:36,079
human being
 

4209
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:37,829
human being
oh and i am sorry that you didn't get a

4210
01:05:37,829 --> 01:05:37,839
oh and i am sorry that you didn't get a
 

4211
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,510
oh and i am sorry that you didn't get a
chance because having had the chance to

4212
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:39,520
chance because having had the chance to
 

4213
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:40,710
chance because having had the chance to
talk to him a lot when i was you know

4214
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:40,720
talk to him a lot when i was you know
 

4215
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:41,670
talk to him a lot when i was you know
when i was a postdoc

4216
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:41,680
when i was a postdoc
 

4217
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,390
when i was a postdoc
um yeah you missed out there's no way to

4218
01:05:44,390 --> 01:05:44,400
um yeah you missed out there's no way to
 

4219
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,670
um yeah you missed out there's no way to
sugarcoat it i'm sorry that you didn't

4220
01:05:45,670 --> 01:05:45,680
sugarcoat it i'm sorry that you didn't
 

4221
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,549
sugarcoat it i'm sorry that you didn't
get that chance

4222
01:05:46,549 --> 01:05:46,559
get that chance
 

4223
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:50,069
get that chance
yeah it is what it is so knots

4224
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:50,079
yeah it is what it is so knots
 

4225
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,390
yeah it is what it is so knots
yeah so there was a question and again

4226
01:05:52,390 --> 01:05:52,400
yeah so there was a question and again
 

4227
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:53,829
yeah so there was a question and again
it doesn't matter the technicalities of

4228
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:53,839
it doesn't matter the technicalities of
 

4229
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:54,950
it doesn't matter the technicalities of
the question but it's a question of

4230
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:54,960
the question but it's a question of
 

4231
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,710
the question but it's a question of
whether the knot is slice it has to do

4232
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:56,720
whether the knot is slice it has to do
 

4233
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,630
whether the knot is slice it has to do
with um

4234
01:05:58,630 --> 01:05:58,640
with um
 

4235
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,309
with um
something about what kinds of

4236
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
something about what kinds of
 

4237
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,670
something about what kinds of
three-dimensional surfaces in four

4238
01:06:01,670 --> 01:06:01,680
three-dimensional surfaces in four
 

4239
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,270
three-dimensional surfaces in four
dimensions can be bounded by this knot

4240
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:03,280
dimensions can be bounded by this knot
 

4241
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:04,710
dimensions can be bounded by this knot
but never mind what it means it's some

4242
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:04,720
but never mind what it means it's some
 

4243
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:05,589
but never mind what it means it's some
question

4244
01:06:05,589 --> 01:06:05,599
question
 

4245
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:07,750
question
uh and it's actually very hard to

4246
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
uh and it's actually very hard to
 

4247
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,870
uh and it's actually very hard to
compute whether or not

4248
01:06:08,870 --> 01:06:08,880
compute whether or not
 

4249
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:12,630
compute whether or not
is slice or not um

4250
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:12,640
is slice or not um
 

4251
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,190
is slice or not um
and in particular the question of the

4252
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:15,200
and in particular the question of the
 

4253
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:16,789
and in particular the question of the
conway knot

4254
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:16,799
conway knot
 

4255
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:19,029
conway knot
whether it was slice or not was

4256
01:06:19,029 --> 01:06:19,039
whether it was slice or not was
 

4257
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:20,470
whether it was slice or not was
particularly

4258
01:06:20,470 --> 01:06:20,480
particularly
 

4259
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,069
particularly
vexed um until it was solved just a few

4260
01:06:24,069 --> 01:06:24,079
vexed um until it was solved just a few
 

4261
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,069
vexed um until it was solved just a few
years ago by lisa picarillo who actually

4262
01:06:26,069 --> 01:06:26,079
years ago by lisa picarillo who actually
 

4263
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:27,190
years ago by lisa picarillo who actually
now that i think of it was here in

4264
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,200
now that i think of it was here in
 

4265
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,630
now that i think of it was here in
austin i believe she was a grad student

4266
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:28,640
austin i believe she was a grad student
 

4267
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,230
austin i believe she was a grad student
at ut austin at the time i didn't even

4268
01:06:30,230 --> 01:06:30,240
at ut austin at the time i didn't even
 

4269
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,349
at ut austin at the time i didn't even
realize there was an austin connection

4270
01:06:31,349 --> 01:06:31,359
realize there was an austin connection
 

4271
01:06:31,359 --> 01:06:33,109
realize there was an austin connection
to this story until i started

4272
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:33,119
to this story until i started
 

4273
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:34,870
to this story until i started
telling it she is in fact i think she's

4274
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:34,880
telling it she is in fact i think she's
 

4275
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,630
telling it she is in fact i think she's
now at mit so she's basically following

4276
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:36,640
now at mit so she's basically following
 

4277
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:37,990
now at mit so she's basically following
you around

4278
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:38,000
you around
 

4279
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,670
you around
if i remember correctly the reverse

4280
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:39,680
if i remember correctly the reverse
 

4281
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:40,789
if i remember correctly the reverse
there's a lot of really interesting

4282
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:40,799
there's a lot of really interesting
 

4283
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:41,990
there's a lot of really interesting
richness to this

4284
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:42,000
richness to this
 

4285
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,910
richness to this
story one thing about it is her paper

4286
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:43,920
story one thing about it is her paper
 

4287
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,430
story one thing about it is her paper
was rather

4288
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:45,440
was rather
 

4289
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,670
was rather
was very short it was very short and

4290
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:47,680
was very short it was very short and
 

4291
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:49,190
was very short it was very short and
simple nine pages of which two were

4292
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
simple nine pages of which two were
 

4293
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:50,630
simple nine pages of which two were
pictures

4294
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
pictures
 

4295
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,109
pictures
uh very short for like a paper solving a

4296
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:53,119
uh very short for like a paper solving a
 

4297
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,390
uh very short for like a paper solving a
major conjecture

4298
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:54,400
major conjecture
 

4299
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,510
major conjecture
and it really makes you think about what

4300
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:55,520
and it really makes you think about what
 

4301
01:06:55,520 --> 01:06:57,109
and it really makes you think about what
we mean by difficulty in mathematics

4302
01:06:57,109 --> 01:06:57,119
we mean by difficulty in mathematics
 

4303
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,630
we mean by difficulty in mathematics
like do you say oh actually the problem

4304
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
like do you say oh actually the problem
 

4305
01:06:58,640 --> 01:06:59,990
like do you say oh actually the problem
wasn't difficult because you could solve

4306
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,000
wasn't difficult because you could solve
 

4307
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,910
wasn't difficult because you could solve
it so simply or do you say like well no

4308
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:01,920
it so simply or do you say like well no
 

4309
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:03,670
it so simply or do you say like well no
evidently it was difficult because like

4310
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:03,680
evidently it was difficult because like
 

4311
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,390
evidently it was difficult because like
the world's top

4312
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
the world's top
 

4313
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:05,910
the world's top
topologist many you know worked on it

4314
01:07:05,910 --> 01:07:05,920
topologist many you know worked on it
 

4315
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,190
topologist many you know worked on it
for 20 years and nobody could solve it

4316
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
for 20 years and nobody could solve it
 

4317
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,390
for 20 years and nobody could solve it
so therefore it is difficult

4318
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:08,400
so therefore it is difficult
 

4319
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,829
so therefore it is difficult
or is it that we need sort of some new

4320
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
or is it that we need sort of some new
 

4321
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,990
or is it that we need sort of some new
category of things that about which

4322
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:12,000
category of things that about which
 

4323
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,589
category of things that about which
it's difficult to figure out that

4324
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:13,599
it's difficult to figure out that
 

4325
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,589
it's difficult to figure out that
they're not difficult

4326
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:15,599
they're not difficult
 

4327
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:17,910
they're not difficult
i mean this is the computer science

4328
01:07:17,910 --> 01:07:17,920
i mean this is the computer science
 

4329
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:19,270
i mean this is the computer science
formulation but

4330
01:07:19,270 --> 01:07:19,280
formulation but
 

4331
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,630
formulation but
the sort of the the journey to arrive

4332
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:22,640
the sort of the the journey to arrive
 

4333
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:24,549
the sort of the the journey to arrive
at the simple answer may be difficult

4334
01:07:24,549 --> 01:07:24,559
at the simple answer may be difficult
 

4335
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:26,549
at the simple answer may be difficult
but once you have the answer

4336
01:07:26,549 --> 01:07:26,559
but once you have the answer
 

4337
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:29,109
but once you have the answer
it will then appear simple and i mean

4338
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
it will then appear simple and i mean
 

4339
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:30,630
it will then appear simple and i mean
there might be a large category

4340
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:30,640
there might be a large category
 

4341
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:33,910
there might be a large category
i hope there's a large uh set

4342
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:33,920
i hope there's a large uh set
 

4343
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:37,349
i hope there's a large uh set
of such solutions

of such solutions
 

4345
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:40,549
of such solutions
because um you know

4346
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,559
because um you know
 

4347
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,230
because um you know
once we stand at the end of the

what's the meaning of life uh

4370
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:05,440
what's the meaning of life uh
 

4371
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,510
what's the meaning of life uh
are are humans special or we're just

another sort of reflection of uh
 

4375
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:13,109
another sort of reflection of uh
and all that is beautiful uh in the

4376
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
and all that is beautiful uh in the
 

4377
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,390
and all that is beautiful uh in the
universe in terms of like

4378

universe in terms of like
 

4379
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:16,550
universe in terms of like
life forms all of it is life and just

4380
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:16,560
life forms all of it is life and just
 

4381
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,229
life forms all of it is life and just
has different

4382
01:08:18,229 --> 01:08:18,239
has different
 

4383
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:19,829
has different
when taken from a different perspective

01:08:19,829 --> 01:08:19,839
when taken from a different perspective
 

4385
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,070
when taken from a different perspective
is all life can seem more valuable or

4386
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:22,080
is all life can seem more valuable or
 

4387
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,669
is all life can seem more valuable or
not but really it's all part of the same

4388
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:23,679
not but really it's all part of the same
 

4389
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,149
not but really it's all part of the same
thing

4390
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:24,159
thing
 

4391
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:25,990
thing
all those will have a nice like two

4392
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,000
all those will have a nice like two
 

4393
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,229
all those will have a nice like two
equations maybe one equation

4394
01:08:28,229 --> 01:08:28,239
equations maybe one equation
 

4395
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:30,309
equations maybe one equation
why do you think you want those

4396
01:08:30,309 --> 01:08:30,319
why do you think you want those
 

4397
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:32,630
why do you think you want those
questions to have simple answers

4398
01:08:32,630 --> 01:08:32,640
questions to have simple answers
 

4399
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,829
questions to have simple answers
i think just like symmetry and the

4400
01:08:35,829 --> 01:08:35,839
i think just like symmetry and the
 

4401
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:37,349
i think just like symmetry and the
breaking of symmetry is beautiful

4402
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
breaking of symmetry is beautiful
 

4403
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,910
breaking of symmetry is beautiful
somehow there's something beautiful

4404
01:08:39,910 --> 01:08:39,920
somehow there's something beautiful
 

4405
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,269
somehow there's something beautiful
about simplicity

4406
01:08:41,269 --> 01:08:41,279
about simplicity
 

4407
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,070
about simplicity
i think it so it's static it's aesthetic

4408
01:08:44,070 --> 01:08:44,080
i think it so it's static it's aesthetic
 

4409
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:45,030
i think it so it's static it's aesthetic
yeah i

4410
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:45,040
yeah i
 

4411
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:47,910
yeah i
or but it's aesthetic in the way that uh

4412
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:47,920
or but it's aesthetic in the way that uh
 

4413
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:50,789
or but it's aesthetic in the way that uh
happiness is an aesthetic

4414
01:08:50,789 --> 01:08:50,799
happiness is an aesthetic
 

4415
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,829
happiness is an aesthetic
like uh why is that so joyful that a

4416
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:53,839
like uh why is that so joyful that a
 

4417
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,550
like uh why is that so joyful that a
simple explanation

4418
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
simple explanation
 

4419
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,669
simple explanation
that governs a large number of cases is

4420
01:08:59,669 --> 01:08:59,679
that governs a large number of cases is
 

4421
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,149
that governs a large number of cases is
really appealing

4422
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
really appealing
 

4423
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:05,430
really appealing
even when it's not like obviously we

4424
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,440
even when it's not like obviously we
 

4425
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:07,269
even when it's not like obviously we
get a huge amount of trouble with that

4426
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:07,279
get a huge amount of trouble with that
 

4427
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:09,669
get a huge amount of trouble with that
because oftentimes

4428
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:09,679
because oftentimes
 

4429
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:11,510
because oftentimes
it doesn't have to be connected with

4430
01:09:11,510 --> 01:09:11,520
it doesn't have to be connected with
 

4431
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:13,510
it doesn't have to be connected with
reality or even that explanation could

4432
01:09:13,510 --> 01:09:13,520
reality or even that explanation could
 

4433
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,590
reality or even that explanation could
be exceptionally harmful

4434
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
be exceptionally harmful
 

4435
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,229
be exceptionally harmful
most of like the world's history that

4436
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:18,239
most of like the world's history that
 

4437
01:09:18,239 --> 01:09:18,789
most of like the world's history that
has

4438
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:18,799
has
 

4439
01:09:18,799 --> 01:09:20,950
has
that was governed by hate and violence

4440
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:20,960
that was governed by hate and violence
 

4441
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,870
that was governed by hate and violence
had a very simple explanation at the

4442
01:09:22,870 --> 01:09:22,880
had a very simple explanation at the
 

4443
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,910
had a very simple explanation at the
court

4444
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:23,920
court
 

4445
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,309
court
that was used to cause the violence and

4446
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
that was used to cause the violence and
 

4447
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:27,990
that was used to cause the violence and
the hatred so like we get into trouble

4448
01:09:27,990 --> 01:09:28,000
the hatred so like we get into trouble
 

4449
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:28,630
the hatred so like we get into trouble
with that

4450
01:09:28,630 --> 01:09:28,640
with that
 

4451
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:30,950
with that
but why is that so appealing and in this

4452
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
but why is that so appealing and in this
 

4453
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,470
but why is that so appealing and in this
nice forms

4454
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
nice forms
 

4455
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,390
nice forms
in mathematics like you look at the

4456
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
in mathematics like you look at the
 

4457
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,470
in mathematics like you look at the
einstein papers

einstein papers
 

4459
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,550
einstein papers
why are those so beautiful and why is

4460
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:38,560
why are those so beautiful and why is

not quite so beautiful like what's
beautiful about that story

4468

beautiful about that story
 

4469
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,390
beautiful about that story
is the human struggle of like the human

ups and downs and all those kinds of
 

4479
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:57,189
ups and downs and all those kinds of
things that's the interesting part but

4480

things that's the interesting part but
 

4481
01:09:57,199 --> 01:09:58,550
things that's the interesting part but
the fact that the proof is huge and

that one in particular is uh really
 

4529
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:42,390
that one in particular is uh really
simple to formulate

uh by from himself there's something
 

4539
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,910
uh by from himself there's something
interesting to be said about

to this
and then how do you go about proving

4550
01:11:03,910 --> 01:11:03,920
and then how do you go about proving
 

4551
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:06,149
and then how do you go about proving
that like how would you

4552
01:11:06,149 --> 01:11:06,159
that like how would you
 

4553
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:08,630
that like how would you
uh try to prove that and what do you

4554
01:11:08,630 --> 01:11:08,640
uh try to prove that and what do you
 

4555
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,430
uh try to prove that and what do you
learn from

4556
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:09,440
learn from
 

4557
01:11:09,440 --> 01:11:10,950
learn from

01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
maybe but i think we so but you're right
 

4669
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,510

that is unknowable but i think what we

that is unknowable but i think what we
 

4671
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:57,669
that is unknowable but i think what we
can know is that later he certainly did

4672
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
can know is that later he certainly did
 

4673
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,270
can know is that later he certainly did

was concealing from people he
 

4677
01:13:01,040 --> 01:13:03,990
was concealing from people he
yes uh he thought he didn't know how to

4678
01:13:03,990 --> 01:13:04,000
yes uh he thought he didn't know how to
 

4679
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,350
yes uh he thought he didn't know how to
prove it and i also think he didn't know

4680
01:13:05,350 --> 01:13:05,360
prove it and i also think he didn't know

times two i had to think about it right
 

4781
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,669
times two i had to think about it right

of arithmetic that we almost think of it
 

4803
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:56,870
of arithmetic that we almost think of it
like god's law you know what i mean it

undergraduate number theory it's like

4826
01:15:20,310 --> 01:15:20,320
undergraduate number theory it's like
 

4827
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:22,229

it's the first really deep theorem that
 

4829
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,430
it's the first really deep theorem that
you prove

4830
01:15:23,430 --> 01:15:23,440
you prove
 

4831
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,350
you prove
what's amazing is you know the fact that

4832
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
what's amazing is you know the fact that
 

4833
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,830
what's amazing is you know the fact that
you can factor a number into primes

01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
you can factor a number into primes
 

4835
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,149
you can factor a number into primes
is much easier essentially euclid knew

4836
01:15:30,149 --> 01:15:30,159
is much easier essentially euclid knew
 

4837
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,350
is much easier essentially euclid knew
it although he didn't quite put it in

that
 

4841
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,390
that
in that way the fact that you can do it

4842
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:34,400
in that way the fact that you can do it
 

4843
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,790
in that way the fact that you can do it
at all what's deep is the fact that

4844
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
at all what's deep is the fact that
 

4845
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,870
at all what's deep is the fact that
there's only one way to do it that or

4846
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
there's only one way to do it that or
 

4847
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,550
there's only one way to do it that or
however you sort of chop the number up

4848
01:15:40,550 --> 01:15:40,560
however you sort of chop the number up
 

4849
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,390
however you sort of chop the number up
you end up with the same set of

you end up with the same set of
 

4851
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:46,870
you end up with the same set of
prime factors um and indeed what people

a lot of different things by distance
 

5101
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:45,910
a lot of different things by distance
and just in the english language we do

5102
01:19:45,910 --> 01:19:45,920
and just in the english language we do
 

5103
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:47,189
and just in the english language we do
that all the time we talk about somebody

5104
01:19:47,189 --> 01:19:47,199
that all the time we talk about somebody

it doesn't mean they live next door to
you right it means something else

and it doesn't have anything to do with

5138
01:20:16,310 --> 01:20:16,320
and it doesn't have anything to do with
 

5139
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:17,270
and it doesn't have anything to do with
are they next to each other in the

5140
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:17,280
are they next to each other in the
 

5141
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:18,470
are they next to each other in the
dictionary right it's a different kind

5142
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:18,480
dictionary right it's a different kind
 

5143
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:19,189
dictionary right it's a different kind
of distance

5144
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:19,199
of distance
 

5145
01:20:19,199 --> 01:20:21,669
of distance
okay ready in this kind of number theory

5146
01:20:21,669 --> 01:20:21,679
okay ready in this kind of number theory
 

5147
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:22,310
okay ready in this kind of number theory
there was a

5148
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:22,320
there was a
 

5149
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,629
there was a
crazy distance called the periodic

5150
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:24,639
crazy distance called the periodic
 

5151
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:26,070
crazy distance called the periodic
distance i didn't write about this that

5152
01:20:26,070 --> 01:20:26,080
distance i didn't write about this that
 

5153
01:20:26,080 --> 01:20:27,110
distance i didn't write about this that
much in the book because even though i

5154
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
much in the book because even though i
 

5155
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,310
much in the book because even though i
love it it's a big part of my research

5156
01:20:28,310 --> 01:20:28,320
love it it's a big part of my research
 

5157
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:29,669
love it it's a big part of my research
life it gets a little bit into the weeds

5158
01:20:29,669 --> 01:20:29,679
life it gets a little bit into the weeds
 

5159
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:30,310
life it gets a little bit into the weeds
but

5160
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320

your listeners are going to hear about
 

5163
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,590
your listeners are going to hear about
it now please where

5164
01:20:33,590 --> 01:20:33,600
it now please where
 

5165
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,910
it now please where
you know what a normal person says when

5166
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:35,920
you know what a normal person says when
 

5167
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,590
you know what a normal person says when
they say two numbers are close

5168
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
they say two numbers are close
 

5169
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,270
they say two numbers are close
they say like you know their difference

5170
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,280
they say like you know their difference
 

5171
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:40,870
they say like you know their difference
is like a small number like seven and

5172
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:40,880
is like a small number like seven and
 

5173
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,390
is like a small number like seven and
eight are close because their difference

5174
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:42,400
eight are close because their difference
 

5175
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,310
eight are close because their difference
is one and one's pretty small

5176
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:44,320
is one and one's pretty small
 

5177
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:47,030
is one and one's pretty small
um if we were to be what's called a two

5178
01:20:47,030 --> 01:20:47,040
um if we were to be what's called a two
 

5179
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:48,390
um if we were to be what's called a two
attic number theorist

5180
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
attic number theorist
 

5181
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,950
attic number theorist
we'd say oh two numbers are close if

5182
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:50,960
we'd say oh two numbers are close if
 

5183
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:51,830
we'd say oh two numbers are close if
their difference

5184
01:20:51,830 --> 01:20:51,840
their difference
 

5185
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,510
their difference
is a multiple of a large power of two

5186
01:20:55,510 --> 01:20:55,520
is a multiple of a large power of two
 

5187
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,830
is a multiple of a large power of two
so like so like one and

5188
01:20:58,830 --> 01:20:58,840
so like so like one and
 

5189
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:02,310
so like so like one and
49 are close because their difference is

5190
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:02,320
49 are close because their difference is
 

5191
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:04,950
49 are close because their difference is
48 and 48 is a multiple of 16 which is a

5192
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:04,960
48 and 48 is a multiple of 16 which is a
 

5193
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:06,550
48 and 48 is a multiple of 16 which is a
pretty large power of two

5194
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:06,560
pretty large power of two
 

5195
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,629
pretty large power of two
whereas whereas one and two are pretty

5196
01:21:08,629 --> 01:21:08,639
whereas whereas one and two are pretty
 

5197
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:09,590
whereas whereas one and two are pretty
far away

5198
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
far away
 

5199
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,990
far away
because the difference between them is

5200
01:21:11,990 --> 01:21:12,000
because the difference between them is
 

5201
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,510
because the difference between them is
one which is not even a multiple of a

5202
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:13,520
one which is not even a multiple of a
 

5203
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:15,350
one which is not even a multiple of a
power of 2 at all it's odd

5204
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:15,360
power of 2 at all it's odd
 

5205
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:16,950
power of 2 at all it's odd
you want to know what's really far from

5206
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:16,960
you want to know what's really far from
 

5207
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,709
you want to know what's really far from
1 like

5208
01:21:18,709 --> 01:21:18,719
1 like
 

5209
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:22,550
1 like
1 and 1 64. because their difference is

5210
01:21:22,550 --> 01:21:22,560
1 and 1 64. because their difference is
 

5211
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:24,550
1 and 1 64. because their difference is
a negative power of 2

5212
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:24,560
a negative power of 2
 

5213
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:27,350
a negative power of 2
2 to the minus 6. so those points are

5214
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:27,360
2 to the minus 6. so those points are
 

5215
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:28,470
2 to the minus 6. so those points are
quite quite fast

5216
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:28,480
quite quite fast
 

5217
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:32,070
quite quite fast
the power of a large n would be too

5218
01:21:32,070 --> 01:21:32,080
the power of a large n would be too
 

5219
01:21:32,080 --> 01:21:35,030
the power of a large n would be too
cool if that's the difference between

5220
01:21:35,030 --> 01:21:35,040
cool if that's the difference between
 

5221
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:37,030
cool if that's the difference between
two numbers and they're close

5222
01:21:37,030 --> 01:21:37,040
two numbers and they're close
 

5223
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:39,510
two numbers and they're close
yeah so two to a large power is this

5224
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:39,520
yeah so two to a large power is this
 

5225
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:40,149
yeah so two to a large power is this
multiplication

5226
01:21:40,149 --> 01:21:40,159
multiplication
 

5227
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:42,629
multiplication
very small number and two to a negative

5228
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
very small number and two to a negative
 

5229
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:43,189
very small number and two to a negative
power

5230
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:43,199
power
 

5231
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:45,590
power
is a very big number that's two attic

5232
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
is a very big number that's two attic
 

5233
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,870
is a very big number that's two attic
okay uh

5234
01:21:46,870 --> 01:21:46,880
okay uh
 

5235
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:48,950
okay uh
i can't even visualize that it takes

5236
01:21:48,950 --> 01:21:48,960
i can't even visualize that it takes
 

5237
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,629
i can't even visualize that it takes
practice it takes practice if you've

5238
01:21:50,629 --> 01:21:50,639
practice it takes practice if you've
 

5239
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:51,990
practice it takes practice if you've
ever heard of the cantor set it looks

5240
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
ever heard of the cantor set it looks
 

5241
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,990
ever heard of the cantor set it looks
kind of like that

5242
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:54,000
kind of like that
 

5243
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,310
kind of like that
so it is crazy that this is good for

5244
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:56,320
so it is crazy that this is good for
 

5245
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,110
so it is crazy that this is good for
anything right

5246
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120
anything right
 

5247
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:58,229
anything right
i mean this just sounds like a

5248
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
i mean this just sounds like a
 

5249
01:21:58,239 --> 01:21:59,590
i mean this just sounds like a
definition that someone would make up to

5250
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,600
definition that someone would make up to
 

5251
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:00,470
definition that someone would make up to
torment you

5252
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
torment you
 

5253
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,590
torment you
but what's amazing is there's a general

5254
01:22:03,590 --> 01:22:03,600
but what's amazing is there's a general
 

5255
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:07,510
but what's amazing is there's a general
theory of distance where you say any

5256
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
theory of distance where you say any
 

5257
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:08,870
theory of distance where you say any
definition you make that satisfies

5258
01:22:08,870 --> 01:22:08,880
definition you make that satisfies
 

5259
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:10,709
definition you make that satisfies
certain axioms deserves to be called a

01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:11,910
certain axioms deserves to be called a

5262
01:22:11,910 --> 01:22:11,920
distance and this
 

5263
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:13,990

01:22:13,990 --> 01:22:14,000
see i'm starting to interrupt uh my
 

5265
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,149
see i'm starting to interrupt uh my
brain you broke my brain now awesome

5266
01:22:16,149 --> 01:22:16,159
brain you broke my brain now awesome
 

5267
01:22:16,159 --> 01:22:18,629
brain you broke my brain now awesome
uh 10 seconds ago uh because i'm also

5268
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:18,639
uh 10 seconds ago uh because i'm also
 

5269
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:20,229
uh 10 seconds ago uh because i'm also
starting to map

5270
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239
starting to map
 

5271
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:23,030
starting to map
for the two added case to binary numbers

5272
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
for the two added case to binary numbers
 

5273
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,070
for the two added case to binary numbers
and sure you know because

5274
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:24,080
and sure you know because
 

5275
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,430
and sure you know because
because we romanticized those sauce

5276
01:22:25,430 --> 01:22:25,440
because we romanticized those sauce
 

5277
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,709
because we romanticized those sauce
trunks oh that's exactly the right way

5278
01:22:26,709 --> 01:22:26,719
trunks oh that's exactly the right way
 

5279
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:27,910
trunks oh that's exactly the right way
to think of it i was trying to

5280
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:27,920
to think of it i was trying to
 

5281
01:22:27,920 --> 01:22:29,669
to think of it i was trying to
mess with number you know i was trying

5282
01:22:29,669 --> 01:22:29,679
mess with number you know i was trying
 

5283
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,750
mess with number you know i was trying
to see okay which ones are close

5284
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760
to see okay which ones are close
 

5285
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:32,950
to see okay which ones are close
and then i'm starting to visualize

5286
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:32,960
and then i'm starting to visualize
 

5287
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:35,510
and then i'm starting to visualize
different binary numbers and how they

5288
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:35,520
different binary numbers and how they
 

5289
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,430
different binary numbers and how they
which ones are close to each other and

5290
01:22:37,430 --> 01:22:37,440
which ones are close to each other and
 

5291
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,510
which ones are close to each other and
uh i'm not sure well i think there's

5292
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
uh i'm not sure well i think there's
 

5293
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,110
uh i'm not sure well i think there's
no it's very similar that's exactly the

5294
01:22:41,110 --> 01:22:41,120
no it's very similar that's exactly the
 

5295
01:22:41,120 --> 01:22:42,470
no it's very similar that's exactly the
way to think of it it's almost like

5296
01:22:42,470 --> 01:22:42,480
way to think of it it's almost like
 

5297
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:44,390
way to think of it it's almost like
binary numbers written in reverse

5298
01:22:44,390 --> 01:22:44,400
binary numbers written in reverse
 

5299
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,310
binary numbers written in reverse
right because in a in a binary expansion

5300
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:46,320
right because in a in a binary expansion
 

5301
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,750
right because in a in a binary expansion
two numbers are closed a number that's

5302
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:47,760
two numbers are closed a number that's
 

5303
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:49,669
two numbers are closed a number that's
small is like point zero zero zero zero

5304
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
small is like point zero zero zero zero
 

5305
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:50,629
small is like point zero zero zero zero
something

5306
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:50,639
something
 

5307
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:51,750
something
something that's the decimal and it

5308
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:51,760
something that's the decimal and it
 

5309
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,510
something that's the decimal and it
starts with a lot of zeros in the two

5310
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:53,520
starts with a lot of zeros in the two
 

5311
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,629
starts with a lot of zeros in the two
attic metric

5312
01:22:54,629 --> 01:22:54,639
attic metric
 

5313
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:57,830
attic metric
a binary number is very small if it

5314
01:22:57,830 --> 01:22:57,840
a binary number is very small if it
 

5315
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,470
a binary number is very small if it
ends with a lot of zeros and then the

5316
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:00,480
ends with a lot of zeros and then the
 

5317
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:01,510
ends with a lot of zeros and then the
decimal point

5318
01:23:01,510 --> 01:23:01,520
decimal point
 

5319
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:03,030
decimal point
got you so it is kind of like binary

5320
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:03,040
got you so it is kind of like binary
 

5321
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:04,470
got you so it is kind of like binary
numbers written backwards is actually i

5322
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:04,480
numbers written backwards is actually i
 

5323
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:04,950
numbers written backwards is actually i
should have

5324
01:23:04,950 --> 01:23:04,960
should have
 

5325
01:23:04,960 --> 01:23:07,270
should have
that's what i should have said lex

5326
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:07,280
that's what i should have said lex
 

5327
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,750
that's what i should have said lex
that's a very good metaphor

5328
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
that's a very good metaphor
 

5329
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:11,590
that's a very good metaphor
okay but so why is that why is that

5330
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:11,600
okay but so why is that why is that
 

5331
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,070
okay but so why is that why is that
interesting except for the fact that uh

5332
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:14,080
interesting except for the fact that uh
 

5333
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,430
interesting except for the fact that uh
it's it's it's a beautiful kind of uh

5334
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,440
it's it's it's a beautiful kind of uh
 

5335
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,590
it's it's it's a beautiful kind of uh
framework different kind of framework

5336
01:23:19,590 --> 01:23:19,600
framework different kind of framework
 

5337
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:20,870
framework different kind of framework
which you think about distances

5338
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
which you think about distances
 

5339
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,550
which you think about distances
and you're talking about not just the

5340
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:22,560
and you're talking about not just the
 

5341
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:24,390
and you're talking about not just the
two attic but the generalization of that

5342
01:23:24,390 --> 01:23:24,400
two attic but the generalization of that
 

5343
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,390
two attic but the generalization of that
yeah the mep and so so that because

5344
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
yeah the mep and so so that because
 

5345
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,669
yeah the mep and so so that because
that's the kind of deformation that

5346
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
that's the kind of deformation that
 

5347
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:29,270
that's the kind of deformation that
comes up

5348
01:23:29,270 --> 01:23:29,280
comes up
 

5349
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,070
comes up
in wiles is in wiles as proof that

5350
01:23:32,070 --> 01:23:32,080
in wiles is in wiles as proof that
 

5351

01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440
defamation we're moving something a
 

5353
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,390
defamation we're moving something a
little bit

5354
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:34,400
little bit
 

5355
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,510
little bit
means a little bit in this to addiction

5356
01:23:37,510 --> 01:23:37,520
means a little bit in this to addiction
 

5357
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:39,030
means a little bit in this to addiction
okay no i mean it's such i mean i could

5358
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
okay no i mean it's such i mean i could
 

5359
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,229
okay no i mean it's such i mean i could
just get excited to talk about it and i

5360
01:23:40,229 --> 01:23:40,239
just get excited to talk about it and i
 

5361
01:23:40,239 --> 01:23:41,990
just get excited to talk about it and i
just taught this like in the fall

5362
01:23:41,990 --> 01:23:42,000
just taught this like in the fall
 

5363
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,550
just taught this like in the fall
semester that um but it like

5364
01:23:44,550 --> 01:23:44,560
semester that um but it like
 

5365
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:45,510
semester that um but it like
reformulating

5366
01:23:45,510 --> 01:23:45,520
reformulating
 

5367
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,350
reformulating
why is uh

5368
01:23:49,350 --> 01:23:49,360
why is uh
 

5369
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,830
why is uh
so you pick a different uh measure of

5370
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:51,840
so you pick a different uh measure of
 

5371
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:53,830
so you pick a different uh measure of
distance

5372
01:23:53,830 --> 01:23:53,840
distance
 

5373
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:56,070
distance
over which you can talk about very tiny

5374
01:23:56,070 --> 01:23:56,080
over which you can talk about very tiny
 

5375
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:56,950
over which you can talk about very tiny
changes

5376
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:56,960
changes
 

5377
01:23:56,960 --> 01:23:59,669
changes
and then use that to then prove things

5378
01:23:59,669 --> 01:23:59,679
and then use that to then prove things
 

5379
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:00,229
and then use that to then prove things
about

5380
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
about
 

5381
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,350
about
the entire thing yes although you know

5382
01:24:03,350 --> 01:24:03,360
the entire thing yes although you know
 

5383
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,470
the entire thing yes although you know
honestly what i would say

5384
01:24:06,470 --> 01:24:06,480
honestly what i would say
 

5385
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:07,990
honestly what i would say
i mean it's true that we use it to prove

5386
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:08,000
i mean it's true that we use it to prove
 

5387
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,510
i mean it's true that we use it to prove
things but i would say we use it to

5388
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:09,520
things but i would say we use it to
 

5389
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:10,470
things but i would say we use it to
understand things

5390
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:10,480
understand things
 

5391
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:11,750
understand things
and then because we understand things

5392
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:11,760
and then because we understand things
 

5393
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:13,669
and then because we understand things
better then we can prove things but you

5394
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:13,679
better then we can prove things but you
 

5395
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:14,709
better then we can prove things but you
know the goal is always the

5396
01:24:14,709 --> 01:24:14,719
know the goal is always the
 

5397
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:16,390
know the goal is always the
understanding the goal is not

5398
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:16,400
understanding the goal is not
 

5399
01:24:16,400 --> 01:24:18,310
understanding the goal is not
so much to prove things the goal is not

5400
01:24:18,310 --> 01:24:18,320
so much to prove things the goal is not
 

5401
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:20,070
so much to prove things the goal is not
to know what's true or false i mean this

5402
01:24:20,070 --> 01:24:20,080
to know what's true or false i mean this
 

5403
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,110
to know what's true or false i mean this
is something i write about in the book

5404
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:21,120
is something i write about in the book
 

5405
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,550
is something i write about in the book
near the end and it's something that

01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:22,560
near the end and it's something that

mathematics and he writes very
 

5421
01:24:34,719 --> 01:24:35,990
mathematics and he writes very
wonderfully about how

wonderfully about how
you know we're not it's not a theorem

things
 

5433
01:24:44,239 --> 01:24:46,390
things
and the way we test that is that we're

5434
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
and the way we test that is that we're
 

5435
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,590
and the way we test that is that we're
proving new theorems along the way

5436
01:24:47,590 --> 01:24:47,600
proving new theorems along the way
 

5437
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,950
proving new theorems along the way
that's the benchmark but that's not the

5438
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
that's the benchmark but that's not the
 

5439
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:49,910
that's the benchmark but that's not the
goal

5440
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:49,920
goal
 

5441
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:51,669
goal
yeah but just as a as a kind of

5442
01:24:51,669 --> 01:24:51,679
yeah but just as a as a kind of
 

5443
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:53,430
yeah but just as a as a kind of
absolutely but as a tool

5444
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:53,440
absolutely but as a tool
 

5445
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,590
absolutely but as a tool
it's kind of interesting to approach a

5446
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:55,600
it's kind of interesting to approach a
 

5447
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:57,350
it's kind of interesting to approach a
problem by saying

5448
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,360
problem by saying
 

5449
01:24:57,360 --> 01:25:00,470
problem by saying
how can i change the distance function

5450
01:25:00,470 --> 01:25:00,480
how can i change the distance function
 

5451
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,590
how can i change the distance function
like what the the nature of distance

5452
01:25:03,590 --> 01:25:03,600
like what the the nature of distance
 

5453
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,510
like what the the nature of distance
because that might start to lead to

5454
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:05,520
because that might start to lead to
 

5455
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:06,950
because that might start to lead to
insights

5456
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:06,960
insights
 

5457
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:09,110
insights
for deeper understanding like if i were

5458
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:09,120
for deeper understanding like if i were
 

5459
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:11,510
for deeper understanding like if i were
to try to describe

5460
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:11,520
to try to describe
 

5461
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,790
to try to describe
human society by a distance two people

5462
01:25:14,790 --> 01:25:14,800
human society by a distance two people
 

5463
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:15,430
human society by a distance two people
are close

5464
01:25:15,430 --> 01:25:15,440
are close
 

5465
01:25:15,440 --> 01:25:17,910
are close
if they love each other right and then

5466
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:17,920
if they love each other right and then
 

5467
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:19,590
if they love each other right and then
and then start to uh

5468
01:25:19,590 --> 01:25:19,600
and then start to uh
 

5469
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,390
and then start to uh
and do a full analysis on the everybody

5470
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:22,400
and do a full analysis on the everybody
 

5471
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,229
and do a full analysis on the everybody
that lives on earth currently the seven

5472
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:24,239
that lives on earth currently the seven
 

5473
01:25:24,239 --> 01:25:26,629
that lives on earth currently the seven
billion people you know and

5474
01:25:26,629 --> 01:25:26,639
billion people you know and
 

5475
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,070
billion people you know and
from that perspective as opposed to the

5476
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:28,080
from that perspective as opposed to the
 

5477
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,790
from that perspective as opposed to the
geographic perspective of distance

5478
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
geographic perspective of distance
 

5479
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,470
geographic perspective of distance
and then maybe there could be a bunch of

5480
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:32,480
and then maybe there could be a bunch of
 

5481
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,470
and then maybe there could be a bunch of
insights about the source of

5482
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:34,480
insights about the source of
 

5483
01:25:34,480 --> 01:25:37,750
insights about the source of
uh violence the source of uh maybe

5484
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:37,760
uh violence the source of uh maybe
 

5485
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:40,390
uh violence the source of uh maybe
entrepreneurial success or invention or

5486
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:40,400
entrepreneurial success or invention or
 

5487
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,790
entrepreneurial success or invention or
economic success or different systems

5488
01:25:42,790 --> 01:25:42,800
economic success or different systems
 

5489
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,790
economic success or different systems
of communism capitalism start to i mean

5490
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:44,800
of communism capitalism start to i mean
 

5491
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,229
of communism capitalism start to i mean
that's i guess what

5492
01:25:46,229 --> 01:25:46,239
that's i guess what
 

5493
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,870
that's i guess what
economics tries to do but really saying

5494
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:48,880
economics tries to do but really saying
 

5495
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,270
economics tries to do but really saying
okay let's think outside the box about

5496
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:51,280
okay let's think outside the box about
 

5497
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,870
okay let's think outside the box about
totally new distance functions that

5498
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:52,880
totally new distance functions that
 

5499
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,430
totally new distance functions that
could unlock something

5500
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:55,440
could unlock something
 

5501
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:57,430
could unlock something
profound about the space yeah because

5502
01:25:57,430 --> 01:25:57,440
profound about the space yeah because
 

5503
01:25:57,440 --> 01:25:59,510
profound about the space yeah because
think about it okay here's

5504
01:25:59,510 --> 01:25:59,520
think about it okay here's
 

5505
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,110
think about it okay here's
i mean now we're gonna talk about ai

5506
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:01,120
i mean now we're gonna talk about ai
 

5507
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,709
i mean now we're gonna talk about ai
which you know a lot more about than i

5508
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:02,719
which you know a lot more about than i
 

5509
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:03,669
which you know a lot more about than i
do so

5510
01:26:03,669 --> 01:26:03,679
do so
 

5511
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:05,110
do so
just you know start laughing

5512
01:26:05,110 --> 01:26:05,120
just you know start laughing
 

5513
01:26:05,120 --> 01:26:06,470
just you know start laughing
uproariously if i say something that's

5514
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:06,480
uproariously if i say something that's
 

5515
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,149
uproariously if i say something that's
completely wrong we both know very

5516
01:26:08,149 --> 01:26:08,159
completely wrong we both know very
 

5517
01:26:08,159 --> 01:26:09,110
completely wrong we both know very
little

5518
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
little
 

5519
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:11,430
little
relative to what we will know centuries

5520
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:11,440
relative to what we will know centuries
 

5521
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:12,470
relative to what we will know centuries
from now

5522
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
from now
 

5523
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:15,110
from now
that is that is a really good humble way

5524
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
that is that is a really good humble way
 

5525
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,470
that is that is a really good humble way
to think about it i like it okay so

5526
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:16,480
to think about it i like it okay so
 

5527
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:17,750
to think about it i like it okay so
let's just go for it

5528
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:17,760
let's just go for it
 

5529
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,149
let's just go for it
um okay so i think you'll agree with

5530
01:26:20,149 --> 01:26:20,159
um okay so i think you'll agree with
 

5531
01:26:20,159 --> 01:26:20,870
um okay so i think you'll agree with
this that

5532
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:20,880
this that
 

5533
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,110
this that
in some sense what's good about ai is

5534
01:26:23,110 --> 01:26:23,120
in some sense what's good about ai is
 

5535
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,470
in some sense what's good about ai is
that

5536
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
that
 

5537
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,310
that
we can't test any case in advance the

5538
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
we can't test any case in advance the
 

5539
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:28,229
we can't test any case in advance the
whole point of ai is to make our one

5540
01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
whole point of ai is to make our one
 

5541
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:29,669
whole point of ai is to make our one
point of it i guess is to make

5542
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
point of it i guess is to make
 

5543
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,350
point of it i guess is to make
good predictions about cases we haven't

5544
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:31,360
good predictions about cases we haven't
 

5545
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,990
good predictions about cases we haven't
yet seen and in some sense that's always

5546
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:34,000
yet seen and in some sense that's always
 

5547
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:35,830
yet seen and in some sense that's always
going to involve some notion of distance

5548
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:35,840
going to involve some notion of distance
 

5549
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,830
going to involve some notion of distance
because it's always going to involve

5550
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:37,840
because it's always going to involve
 

5551
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,990
because it's always going to involve
somehow taking a case we haven't seen

5552
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,000
somehow taking a case we haven't seen
 

5553
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,350
somehow taking a case we haven't seen
and saying

5554
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
and saying
 

5555
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,510
and saying
what cases that we have seen is it close

5556
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,520
what cases that we have seen is it close
 

5557
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,189
what cases that we have seen is it close
to is it like is it somehow an

5558
01:26:45,189 --> 01:26:45,199
to is it like is it somehow an
 

5559
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:46,149
to is it like is it somehow an
interpolation

5560
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
interpolation
 

5561
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,430
interpolation
between now when we do that in order to

5562
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,440
between now when we do that in order to
 

5563
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,870
between now when we do that in order to
talk about things being like other

5564
01:26:50,870 --> 01:26:50,880
talk about things being like other
 

5565
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,990
talk about things being like other
things

5566
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:52,000
things
 

5567
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,070
things
implicitly or explicitly we're invoking

5568
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,080
implicitly or explicitly we're invoking
 

5569
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,990
implicitly or explicitly we're invoking
some notion of distance and boy we

5570
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,000
some notion of distance and boy we
 

5571
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:56,950
some notion of distance and boy we
better get it right

5572
01:26:56,950 --> 01:26:56,960
better get it right
 

5573
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,390
better get it right
yeah right if you try to do natural

5574
01:26:58,390 --> 01:26:58,400
yeah right if you try to do natural
 

5575
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,830
yeah right if you try to do natural
language processing and your idea about

5576
01:26:59,830 --> 01:26:59,840
language processing and your idea about
 

5577
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,750
language processing and your idea about
of distance between words is

5578
01:27:01,750 --> 01:27:01,760
of distance between words is
 

5579
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,030
of distance between words is
how close they are in the dictionary

5580
01:27:03,030 --> 01:27:03,040
how close they are in the dictionary
 

5581
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:04,149
how close they are in the dictionary
when you write them in alphabetical

5582
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:04,159
when you write them in alphabetical
 

5583
01:27:04,159 --> 01:27:05,510
when you write them in alphabetical
order you are going to get

5584
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:05,520
order you are going to get
 

5585
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:08,470
order you are going to get
pretty bad translations right no the

5586
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:08,480
pretty bad translations right no the
 

5587
01:27:08,480 --> 01:27:10,550
pretty bad translations right no the
notion of distance has to come from

5588
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
notion of distance has to come from
 

5589
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,470
notion of distance has to come from
somewhere else yeah that that's

5590
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:12,480
somewhere else yeah that that's
 

5591
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:13,750
somewhere else yeah that that's
essentially what neural networks are

5592
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:13,760
essentially what neural networks are
 

5593
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:15,189
essentially what neural networks are
doing this what word and bettings are

5594
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:15,199
doing this what word and bettings are
 

5595
01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:15,669
doing this what word and bettings are
doing is

5596
01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:15,679
doing is
 

5597
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:17,669
doing is
yes coming up with uh in the case of

5598
01:27:17,669 --> 01:27:17,679
yes coming up with uh in the case of
 

5599
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,270
yes coming up with uh in the case of
word embeddings literally like literally

5600
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
word embeddings literally like literally
 

5601
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:20,470
word embeddings literally like literally
what they are doing is learning a

5602
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
what they are doing is learning a
 

5603
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:21,830
what they are doing is learning a
distance but those are super

5604
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:21,840
distance but those are super
 

5605
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:24,629
distance but those are super
complicated distance functions and it's

5606
01:27:24,629 --> 01:27:24,639
complicated distance functions and it's
 

5607
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:26,149
complicated distance functions and it's
almost nice to think

5608
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:26,159
almost nice to think
 

5609
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:29,990
almost nice to think
maybe there's a nice transformation

5610
01:27:29,990 --> 01:27:30,000
maybe there's a nice transformation
 

5611
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,030
maybe there's a nice transformation
that's simple

5612
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
that's simple
 

5613
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,590
that's simple
uh sorry this there's a nice formulation

5614
01:27:33,590 --> 01:27:33,600
uh sorry this there's a nice formulation
 

5615
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:34,390
uh sorry this there's a nice formulation
of the distance

5616
01:27:34,390 --> 01:27:34,400

again with the simple so you don't

5618
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:38,480
again with the simple so you don't
 

5619
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:41,750
again with the simple so you don't
let me ask you about this from an

01:27:41,750 --> 01:27:41,760
let me ask you about this from an
 

5621
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,590
let me ask you about this from an
understanding perspective there's the

5622
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
understanding perspective there's the
 

5623

understanding perspective there's the
richard feynman maybe attributed to him

5624
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:45,520
richard feynman maybe attributed to him
 

5625
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,709
richard feynman maybe attributed to him
but maybe many others

5626
01:27:48,709 --> 01:27:48,719
but maybe many others
 

5627
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:51,510
but maybe many others
is this idea that if you can't explain

5628
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:51,520
is this idea that if you can't explain
 

5629
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,030
is this idea that if you can't explain
something simply that you don't

5630
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:53,040
something simply that you don't
 

5631
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:56,229
something simply that you don't
understand it

5632
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:56,239

 

5633
01:27:56,239 --> 01:27:59,270

in how many cases how often

5634
01:27:59,270 --> 01:27:59,280
in how many cases how often
 

5635
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,430
in how many cases how often
is that true do you find there's some

5636
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
is that true do you find there's some
 

5637
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:05,430
is that true do you find there's some
profound truth in that

5638
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:05,440

 

5639
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:07,270

oh okay so you were about to ask is it

5640
01:28:07,270 --> 01:28:07,280
oh okay so you were about to ask is it
 

5641
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:09,350
oh okay so you were about to ask is it
true to which i would say flatly no but

5642
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:09,360
true to which i would say flatly no but
 

5643
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:10,310
true to which i would say flatly no but
then you said

5644
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
then you said
 

5645
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,750
then you said
you followed that up with is there some

5646
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:11,760
you followed that up with is there some
 

5647
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,430
you followed that up with is there some
profound truth in it and i'm like

5648
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
profound truth in it and i'm like
 

5649
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,430
profound truth in it and i'm like
okay sure so there's some truth in it

5650
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:15,440
okay sure so there's some truth in it
 

5651
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,120
okay sure so there's some truth in it
but it's not true

5652
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:16,130
but it's not true
 

5653
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:20,870
but it's not true
[Laughter]

5654
01:28:20,870 --> 01:28:20,880
[Laughter]
 

5655
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,790
[Laughter]
this is your mathematician answer the

5656
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
this is your mathematician answer the
 

5657
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:23,990
this is your mathematician answer the
truth that is in it

5658
01:28:23,990 --> 01:28:24,000
truth that is in it
 

5659
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,470
truth that is in it
yeah is that learning to explain

5660
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
yeah is that learning to explain
 

5661
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,229
yeah is that learning to explain
something helps you

5662
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:28,239
something helps you
 

5663
01:28:28,239 --> 01:28:31,830
something helps you
understand it um but real things are not

5664
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
understand it um but real things are not
 

5665
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:32,470
understand it um but real things are not
simple

5666
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:32,480
simple
 

5667
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:36,070
simple
yeah a few things are most are not

5668
01:28:36,070 --> 01:28:36,080
yeah a few things are most are not
 

5669
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,790
yeah a few things are most are not
um and i don't to be honest i don't i

5670
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:38,800
um and i don't to be honest i don't i
 

5671
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:39,350
um and i don't to be honest i don't i
mean i don't

5672
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,360
mean i don't
 

5673
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,550
mean i don't
we don't really know whether feynman

5674
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:40,560
we don't really know whether feynman
 

5675
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:41,669
we don't really know whether feynman
really said that right or something like

5676
01:28:41,669 --> 01:28:41,679
really said that right or something like
 

5677
01:28:41,679 --> 01:28:42,470
really said that right or something like
that is sort of

5678
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
that is sort of
 

5679
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,390
that is sort of
disputed but i don't think feynman could

5680
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:44,400
disputed but i don't think feynman could
 

5681
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,070
disputed but i don't think feynman could
have literally believed that

5682
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
have literally believed that
 

5683
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,430
have literally believed that
whether or not he said it and you know

5684
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
whether or not he said it and you know
 

5685
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,510
whether or not he said it and you know
he was the kind of guy i didn't know him

5686
01:28:49,510 --> 01:28:49,520
he was the kind of guy i didn't know him
 

5687
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:49,990
he was the kind of guy i didn't know him
but i'm

5688
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:50,000
but i'm
 

5689
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,310
but i'm
reading his writing he liked to sort of

5690
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:52,320
reading his writing he liked to sort of
 

5691
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:54,790
reading his writing he liked to sort of
say stuff like stuff that sounded good

5692
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:54,800
say stuff like stuff that sounded good
 

5693
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:55,990
say stuff like stuff that sounded good
you know what i mean so it's it's

5694
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
you know what i mean so it's it's
 

5695
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,510
you know what i mean so it's it's
totally strikes me as the kind of thing

5696
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:57,520
totally strikes me as the kind of thing
 

5697
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,350
totally strikes me as the kind of thing
he could have said because he liked the

5698
01:28:59,350 --> 01:28:59,360
he could have said because he liked the
 

5699
01:28:59,360 --> 01:28:59,669
he could have said because he liked the
way

5700
01:28:59,669 --> 01:28:59,679
way
 

5701
01:28:59,679 --> 01:29:02,870
way
saying it made him feel but also knowing

5702
01:29:02,870 --> 01:29:02,880
saying it made him feel but also knowing
 

5703
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:04,390
saying it made him feel but also knowing
that he didn't like literally mean it

5704
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:04,400
that he didn't like literally mean it
 

5705
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:06,790
that he didn't like literally mean it
well i definitely have

5706
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:06,800
well i definitely have
 

5707
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,629
well i definitely have
have a lot of friends and i've talked to

5708
01:29:08,629 --> 01:29:08,639
have a lot of friends and i've talked to
 

5709
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:10,070
have a lot of friends and i've talked to
a lot of physicists and they do

5710
01:29:10,070 --> 01:29:10,080
a lot of physicists and they do
 

5711
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,110
a lot of physicists and they do
derive joy from believing that they can

5712
01:29:13,110 --> 01:29:13,120
derive joy from believing that they can
 

5713
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:14,390
derive joy from believing that they can
explain stuff simply

5714
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:14,400
explain stuff simply
 

5715
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:15,910
explain stuff simply
or believing it's possible to explain

5716
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:15,920
or believing it's possible to explain
 

5717
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:17,750
or believing it's possible to explain
style simply

5718
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:17,760
style simply
 

5719
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,189
style simply
even when the explanation is not

5720
01:29:19,189 --> 01:29:19,199
even when the explanation is not
 

5721
01:29:19,199 --> 01:29:20,950
even when the explanation is not
actually that simple like i've

5722
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:20,960
actually that simple like i've
 

5723
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,430
actually that simple like i've
heard people think that the explanation

5724
01:29:23,430 --> 01:29:23,440
heard people think that the explanation
 

5725
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,950
heard people think that the explanation
is simple and they do the explanation

5726
01:29:24,950 --> 01:29:24,960
is simple and they do the explanation
 

5727
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,070
is simple and they do the explanation
and i think

5728
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,080
and i think
 

5729
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,629
and i think
it is simple but it's not capturing the

5730
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:28,639
it is simple but it's not capturing the
 

5731
01:29:28,639 --> 01:29:30,470
it is simple but it's not capturing the
phenomena that we're discussing

5732
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
phenomena that we're discussing
 

5733
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,550
phenomena that we're discussing
it's capturing it somehow maps in their

5734
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:32,560
it's capturing it somehow maps in their
 

5735
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,030
it's capturing it somehow maps in their
mind but it's it's taking as a

5736
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
mind but it's it's taking as a
 

5737
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,709
mind but it's it's taking as a
starting point as an assumption that

5738
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
starting point as an assumption that
 

5739
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,550
starting point as an assumption that
there's a deep knowledge and a deep

5740
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
there's a deep knowledge and a deep
 

5741
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,910
there's a deep knowledge and a deep
understanding that's

5742
01:29:39,910 --> 01:29:39,920
understanding that's
 

5743
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,990
understanding that's
that's actually very complicated and the

5744
01:29:41,990 --> 01:29:42,000
that's actually very complicated and the
 

5745
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,669
that's actually very complicated and the
simplicity is almost like a

5746
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:43,679
simplicity is almost like a
 

5747
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,990
simplicity is almost like a
almost like a poem about the more

5748
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
almost like a poem about the more
 

5749
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,430
almost like a poem about the more
complicated thing as opposed to

5750
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:47,440
complicated thing as opposed to
 

5751
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,669
complicated thing as opposed to
a distillation and i love poems but a

5752
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
a distillation and i love poems but a
 

5753
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:53,430
a distillation and i love poems but a
poem is not an explanation

5754
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:53,440
poem is not an explanation
 

5755
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:55,270
poem is not an explanation
well some people might disagree with

5756
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:55,280
well some people might disagree with
 

5757
01:29:55,280 --> 01:29:56,870
well some people might disagree with
that but certainly from a mathematical

5758
01:29:56,870 --> 01:29:56,880
that but certainly from a mathematical
 

5759
01:29:56,880 --> 01:29:58,790
that but certainly from a mathematical
perspective no poet would disagree with

5760
01:29:58,790 --> 01:29:58,800
perspective no poet would disagree with
 

5761
01:29:58,800 --> 01:29:59,590
perspective no poet would disagree with
it

5762
01:29:59,590 --> 01:29:59,600
it
 

5763
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,990
it
no poet would disagree you don't think

5764
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:02,000
no poet would disagree you don't think
 

5765
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,590
no poet would disagree you don't think
there's some things that can only be

5766
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:03,600
there's some things that can only be
 

5767
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:05,270
there's some things that can only be
described

5768
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
described
 

5769
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,510
described
imprecisely i said explanation i don't

5770
01:30:07,510 --> 01:30:07,520
imprecisely i said explanation i don't
 

5771
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:08,310
imprecisely i said explanation i don't
think any poem

5772
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,320
think any poem
 

5773
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:09,350
think any poem
i don't think any poet would say their

5774
01:30:09,350 --> 01:30:09,360
i don't think any poet would say their
 

5775
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:10,870
i don't think any poet would say their
poem is an explanation they might say

5776
01:30:10,870 --> 01:30:10,880

is like they're not the most important
of god thoughts

5936
01:32:29,270 --> 01:32:29,280
of god thoughts
 

5937
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:30,470
of god thoughts
but they're the only ones that we can

5938
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
but they're the only ones that we can
 

5939
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,470
but they're the only ones that we can
know precisely

5940
01:32:32,470 --> 01:32:32,480
know precisely
 

5941
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:33,830

so she's like this is the one place

5942
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:33,840
so she's like this is the one place
 

5943
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,030
so she's like this is the one place
where we get to sort of see what god's

5944
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,040
where we get to sort of see what god's
 

5945
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:36,470
where we get to sort of see what god's
thinking when we do

5946
01:32:36,470 --> 01:32:36,480
thinking when we do
 

5947
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,709

for millennia um they are numbers
which can't be factored and then you say

which can't be factored and then you say
 

6033
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:08,629
which can't be factored and then you say
like like five and then you're like wait

i can't factor five five is
 

6037
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,510
i can't factor five five is
five times one okay not like that that

6038

is a factorization it absolutely is a
 

6041
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,110
is a factorization it absolutely is a
way of expressing five as

6042
01:34:17,110 --> 01:34:17,120
way of expressing five as
 

6043
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:18,870
way of expressing five as
a product of two things but don't you

6044
01:34:18,870 --> 01:34:18,880
a product of two things but don't you
 

6045
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:20,310
a product of two things but don't you
agree there's like something trivial

6046
01:34:20,310 --> 01:34:20,320
agree there's like something trivial
 

6047
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:21,510
agree there's like something trivial
about it it's something you can do to

6048
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:21,520
about it it's something you can do to
 

6049
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:22,149
about it it's something you can do to
any number

01:34:29,590 --> 01:34:29,600
done something to it i've broken up so

sometimes people think that

6080
01:34:49,430 --> 01:34:49,440
sometimes people think that
 

6081
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:52,149
sometimes people think that
you know these definitions are kind of

6082
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
you know these definitions are kind of
 

6083
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:53,510
you know these definitions are kind of
if we think about them hard enough we

6084
01:34:53,510 --> 01:34:53,520
if we think about them hard enough we
 

6085
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:56,629
if we think about them hard enough we
can figure out which definition is true

6086
01:34:56,629 --> 01:34:56,639
can figure out which definition is true
 

6087
01:34:56,639 --> 01:34:58,149
can figure out which definition is true
no there's just an artifact in

6088
01:34:58,149 --> 01:34:58,159
no there's just an artifact in
 

6089
01:34:58,159 --> 01:34:59,910
no there's just an artifact in
mathematics so yeah one

6090
01:34:59,910 --> 01:34:59,920
mathematics so yeah one
 

6091
01:34:59,920 --> 01:35:03,270
mathematics so yeah one
so which definition is best for us

6092
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:03,280
so which definition is best for us
 

6093
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:05,109
so which definition is best for us
for our purposes well those edge cases

6094
01:35:05,109 --> 01:35:05,119
for our purposes well those edge cases
 

6095
01:35:05,119 --> 01:35:06,709
for our purposes well those edge cases
are weird right so uh

6096
01:35:06,709 --> 01:35:06,719
are weird right so uh
 

6097
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:09,430
are weird right so uh
so so it can't you can't be it doesn't

6098
01:35:09,430 --> 01:35:09,440
so so it can't you can't be it doesn't
 

6099
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:11,510
so so it can't you can't be it doesn't
count when you use yourself

6100
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:11,520
count when you use yourself
 

6101
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,830
count when you use yourself
as a number or one as part of the

6102
01:35:13,830 --> 01:35:13,840
as a number or one as part of the
 

6103
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:14,870
as a number or one as part of the
factorization

6104
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:14,880
factorization
 

6105
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,189
factorization
or as the entirety of the factorization

6106
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:19,199

 

6107
01:35:19,199 --> 01:35:21,990

so the so you somehow get to the meat of

6108
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:22,000
so the so you somehow get to the meat of
 

6109
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:22,790
so the so you somehow get to the meat of
the number

6110
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
the number
 

6111
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,510
the number
by factorizing it and that's seems to

6112
01:35:25,510 --> 01:35:25,520
by factorizing it and that's seems to
 

6113
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:27,270
by factorizing it and that's seems to
get to the core of all of mathematics

6114
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:27,280
get to the core of all of mathematics
 

6115
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,950
get to the core of all of mathematics
yeah you take any number and you

6116
01:35:28,950 --> 01:35:28,960
yeah you take any number and you
 

6117
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:31,109
yeah you take any number and you
factorize it until you can factorize no

6118
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:31,119
factorize it until you can factorize no
 

6119
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:32,870
factorize it until you can factorize no
more and what you have left is some big

6120
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:32,880
more and what you have left is some big
 

6121
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:34,950
more and what you have left is some big
pile of primes i mean by definition when

6122
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:34,960
pile of primes i mean by definition when
 

6123
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:35,189
pile of primes i mean by definition when
you

6124
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:35,199
you
 

6125
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,950
you
can't factor anymore when you when

6126
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:36,960
can't factor anymore when you when
 

6127
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,310
can't factor anymore when you when
you're done you can't

6128
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,320
you're done you can't
 

6129
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,750
you're done you can't
break the numbers up anymore what's left

6130
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:39,760
break the numbers up anymore what's left
 

6131
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:42,149
break the numbers up anymore what's left
must be prime you know 12 breaks into

6132
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:42,159
must be prime you know 12 breaks into
 

6133
01:35:42,159 --> 01:35:42,790
must be prime you know 12 breaks into
two

6134
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:42,800
two
 

6135
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,149
two
and two and three um so these numbers

6136
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
and two and three um so these numbers
 

6137
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:48,070
and two and three um so these numbers
are the atoms the building blocks

6138
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,080
are the atoms the building blocks
 

6139
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:51,430
are the atoms the building blocks
of all numbers and there's a lot we know

6140
01:35:51,430 --> 01:35:51,440
of all numbers and there's a lot we know
 

6141
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:52,790
of all numbers and there's a lot we know
about them but there's much more we

6142
01:35:52,790 --> 01:35:52,800
about them but there's much more we
 

6143
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:53,990
about them but there's much more we
don't know them i'll tell you the first

6144
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,000
don't know them i'll tell you the first
 

6145
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:54,950
don't know them i'll tell you the first
few there's 2

6146
01:35:54,950 --> 01:35:54,960
few there's 2
 

6147
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,950
few there's 2
3 5 7 11.

6148
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
3 5 7 11.
 

6149
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,070
3 5 7 11.
by the way they're all going to be odd

6150
01:36:00,070 --> 01:36:00,080
by the way they're all going to be odd
 

6151
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,430
by the way they're all going to be odd
from the non because if they were even i

6152
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
from the non because if they were even i
 

6153
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,870
from the non because if they were even i
could factor out 2 out of them

6154
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:02,880
could factor out 2 out of them
 

6155
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,629
could factor out 2 out of them
but it's not all the odd numbers 9 isn't

6156
01:36:04,629 --> 01:36:04,639
but it's not all the odd numbers 9 isn't
 

6157
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:06,310
but it's not all the odd numbers 9 isn't
prime because it's 3 times 3

6158
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:06,320
prime because it's 3 times 3
 

6159
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,990
prime because it's 3 times 3
15 isn't prime because it's 3 times 5

6160
01:36:07,990 --> 01:36:08,000
15 isn't prime because it's 3 times 5
 

6161
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,310
15 isn't prime because it's 3 times 5
but 13 is where were we 2 3 5

6162
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:10,320
but 13 is where were we 2 3 5
 

6163
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,669
but 13 is where were we 2 3 5
7 11 13 17 19

6164
01:36:13,669 --> 01:36:13,679
7 11 13 17 19
 

6165
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:15,990
7 11 13 17 19
not 21 but 23 is etcetera etcetera okay

6166
01:36:15,990 --> 01:36:16,000
not 21 but 23 is etcetera etcetera okay
 

6167
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:16,950
not 21 but 23 is etcetera etcetera okay
so you could go on

6168
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:16,960
so you could go on
 

6169
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:18,550
so you could go on
how high could you go if we were just

6170
01:36:18,550 --> 01:36:18,560
how high could you go if we were just
 

6171
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:22,310
how high could you go if we were just
sitting here by the way your own brain

6172
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
sitting here by the way your own brain
 

6173
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:23,910
sitting here by the way your own brain
continuous without interruption would

6174
01:36:23,910 --> 01:36:23,920
continuous without interruption would
 

6175
01:36:23,920 --> 01:36:25,830

you be able to go over a hundred

6176
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:25,840
you be able to go over a hundred
 

6177
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,990
you be able to go over a hundred
i think so there's always those ones

6178
01:36:27,990 --> 01:36:28,000
i think so there's always those ones
 

6179
01:36:28,000 --> 01:36:28,950
i think so there's always those ones
that trip people up there's

01:36:28,950 --> 01:36:28,960
that trip people up there's
 

6181
01:36:28,960 --> 01:36:30,629
that trip people up there's
there's a famous one the groton deak

6182
01:36:30,629 --> 01:36:30,639
there's a famous one the groton deak

some lecture involving a choice of a
 

6191
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,390
some lecture involving a choice of a
prime in general and somebody said like

6192
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:40,400
prime in general and somebody said like
 

6193
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,590
prime in general and somebody said like
can't you just choose a problem he said

6194
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:41,600
can't you just choose a problem he said
 

6195
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:43,590
can't you just choose a problem he said
okay 57 which is in fact not prime it's

6196
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:43,600
okay 57 which is in fact not prime it's
 

6197
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,629
okay 57 which is in fact not prime it's
three times

6198
01:36:44,629 --> 01:36:44,639
three times
 

6199
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:47,910
three times
19. oh damn but it was like

6200
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:47,920
19. oh damn but it was like
 

6201
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,350
19. oh damn but it was like
i promise you in some circles it's a

6202
01:36:49,350 --> 01:36:49,360
i promise you in some circles it's a
 

6203
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:52,229
i promise you in some circles it's a
funny story okay um

6204
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:52,239
funny story okay um
 

6205
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:55,669
funny story okay um
but um there's a humor in it uh

6206
01:36:55,669 --> 01:36:55,679
but um there's a humor in it uh
 

6207
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:57,830
but um there's a humor in it uh
yes i would say over a hundred i

6208
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:57,840
yes i would say over a hundred i
 

6209
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,709
yes i would say over a hundred i
definitely don't

6210
01:36:58,709 --> 01:36:58,719
definitely don't
 

6211
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:01,990
definitely don't
remember like 107 i think i'm not sure

6212
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:02,000
remember like 107 i think i'm not sure
 

6213
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,189
remember like 107 i think i'm not sure
okay like so is there a category of uh

6214
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:07,199
okay like so is there a category of uh
 

6215
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,310
okay like so is there a category of uh
like fake primes that that

6216
01:37:10,310 --> 01:37:10,320
like fake primes that that
 

6217
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:13,669
like fake primes that that
are easily mistaken to be prime like 57

6218
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
are easily mistaken to be prime like 57
 

6219
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,870
are easily mistaken to be prime like 57
i wonder yeah so i would say

6220
01:37:16,870 --> 01:37:16,880
i wonder yeah so i would say
 

6221
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:19,990
i wonder yeah so i would say
57 and take a small 27 and 51

6222
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:20,000
57 and take a small 27 and 51
 

6223
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:21,990
57 and take a small 27 and 51
are definitely like prime offenders oh i

6224
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:22,000
are definitely like prime offenders oh i
 

6225
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:23,669
are definitely like prime offenders oh i
didn't do that on purpose

6226
01:37:23,669 --> 01:37:23,679
didn't do that on purpose
 

6227
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:25,830
didn't do that on purpose
well done didn't do it on purpose anyway

6228
01:37:25,830 --> 01:37:25,840
well done didn't do it on purpose anyway
 

6229
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,070
well done didn't do it on purpose anyway
they're definitely ones that people uh

6230
01:37:28,070 --> 01:37:28,080
they're definitely ones that people uh
 

6231
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:30,629
they're definitely ones that people uh
or 91 is another classic seven times 13.

6232
01:37:30,629 --> 01:37:30,639
or 91 is another classic seven times 13.
 

6233
01:37:30,639 --> 01:37:31,270
or 91 is another classic seven times 13.
it really

6234
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:31,280
it really
 

6235
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,189
it really
feels kind of prime doesn't it but it is

6236
01:37:33,189 --> 01:37:33,199
feels kind of prime doesn't it but it is
 

6237
01:37:33,199 --> 01:37:34,790
feels kind of prime doesn't it but it is
not yeah

6238
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
not yeah
 

6239
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:36,950
not yeah
um but there's also by the way but

6240
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:36,960
um but there's also by the way but
 

6241
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,790
um but there's also by the way but
there's also an actual notion of

6242
01:37:38,790 --> 01:37:38,800
there's also an actual notion of
 

6243
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:39,910
there's also an actual notion of
pseudoprime which is

6244
01:37:39,910 --> 01:37:39,920
pseudoprime which is
 

6245
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,950
pseudoprime which is
which is the thing with the formal

6246
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:40,960
which is the thing with the formal
 

6247
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,709
which is the thing with the formal
definition which is not a psychological

6248
01:37:42,709 --> 01:37:42,719
definition which is not a psychological
 

6249
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:43,350
definition which is not a psychological
thing

6250
01:37:43,350 --> 01:37:43,360
thing
 

6251
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,950
thing
it is a prime which passes a primality

6252
01:37:46,950 --> 01:37:46,960
it is a prime which passes a primality
 

6253
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:47,430
it is a prime which passes a primality
test

6254
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:47,440
test
 

6255
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:49,990
test
devised by fermat which is a very good

6256
01:37:49,990 --> 01:37:50,000
devised by fermat which is a very good
 

6257
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:50,629
devised by fermat which is a very good
test which

6258
01:37:50,629 --> 01:37:50,639
test which
 

6259
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:52,709
test which
if if a number fails this test it's

6260
01:37:52,709 --> 01:37:52,719
if if a number fails this test it's
 

6261
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:54,390
if if a number fails this test it's
definitely not prime

6262
01:37:54,390 --> 01:37:54,400
definitely not prime
 

6263
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:55,830
definitely not prime
and so there was some hope that oh maybe

6264
01:37:55,830 --> 01:37:55,840
and so there was some hope that oh maybe
 

6265
01:37:55,840 --> 01:37:57,430
and so there was some hope that oh maybe
if a number passes the test then it

6266
01:37:57,430 --> 01:37:57,440
if a number passes the test then it
 

6267
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:58,790
if a number passes the test then it
definitely is prime that would give a

6268
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
definitely is prime that would give a
 

6269
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,550
definitely is prime that would give a
very simple criterion for formality

6270
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:00,560
very simple criterion for formality
 

6271
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:02,390
very simple criterion for formality
unfortunately it's only perfect in one

6272
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:02,400
unfortunately it's only perfect in one
 

6273
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:03,830
unfortunately it's only perfect in one
direction

6274
01:38:03,830 --> 01:38:03,840
direction
 

6275
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,830
direction
so there are numbers i want to say 341

6276
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:07,840
so there are numbers i want to say 341
 

6277
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,430
so there are numbers i want to say 341
is the smallest

6278
01:38:09,430 --> 01:38:09,440
is the smallest
 

6279
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:11,109
is the smallest
uh which passed the test but are not

6280
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:11,119
uh which passed the test but are not
 

6281
01:38:11,119 --> 01:38:13,270
uh which passed the test but are not
prime 341 is this test easily

6282
01:38:13,270 --> 01:38:13,280
prime 341 is this test easily
 

6283
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,390
prime 341 is this test easily
explainable or no

6284
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
explainable or no
 

6285
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,350
explainable or no
uh yes actually um ready let me give you

6286
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:17,360
uh yes actually um ready let me give you
 

6287
01:38:17,360 --> 01:38:18,629
uh yes actually um ready let me give you
the simplest version of it you can dress

6288
01:38:18,629 --> 01:38:18,639
the simplest version of it you can dress
 

6289
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:19,910
the simplest version of it you can dress
it up a little bit but here's the basic

6290
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
it up a little bit but here's the basic
 

6291
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:20,790
it up a little bit but here's the basic
idea

6292
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
idea
 

6293
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,030
idea
uh i take the number the mystery number

6294
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:25,040
uh i take the number the mystery number
 

6295
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:29,350
uh i take the number the mystery number
i raised two to that power

6296
01:38:29,350 --> 01:38:29,360

 

6297
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,390

so let's say your mystery number is six

6298
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
so let's say your mystery number is six
 

6299
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,910
so let's say your mystery number is six
yeah are you sorry you asked me are you

6300
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:33,920
yeah are you sorry you asked me are you
 

6301
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,669
yeah are you sorry you asked me are you
ready no i might you're breaking my

6302
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
ready no i might you're breaking my
 

6303
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:37,030
ready no i might you're breaking my
brain again but yes

6304
01:38:37,030 --> 01:38:37,040
brain again but yes
 

6305
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,629
brain again but yes
let's let's let's do it we're gonna do a

6306
01:38:38,629 --> 01:38:38,639
let's let's let's do it we're gonna do a
 

6307
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:41,109
let's let's let's do it we're gonna do a
live demonstration um

6308
01:38:41,109 --> 01:38:41,119
live demonstration um
 

6309
01:38:41,119 --> 01:38:43,350
live demonstration um
let's say your number is six so i'm

6310
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:43,360
let's say your number is six so i'm
 

6311
01:38:43,360 --> 01:38:45,910
let's say your number is six so i'm
going to raise 2 to the sixth power

6312
01:38:45,910 --> 01:38:45,920
going to raise 2 to the sixth power
 

6313
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,030
going to raise 2 to the sixth power
okay so if i were working out i'd be

6314
01:38:47,030 --> 01:38:47,040
okay so if i were working out i'd be
 

6315
01:38:47,040 --> 01:38:49,030
okay so if i were working out i'd be
like that's 2 cubes squared so that's 8

6316
01:38:49,030 --> 01:38:49,040
like that's 2 cubes squared so that's 8
 

6317
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:51,590
like that's 2 cubes squared so that's 8
times 8 so that's 64.

6318
01:38:51,590 --> 01:38:51,600
times 8 so that's 64.
 

6319
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:53,510
times 8 so that's 64.
now we're going to divide by 6 but i

6320
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:53,520
now we're going to divide by 6 but i
 

6321
01:38:53,520 --> 01:38:54,870
now we're going to divide by 6 but i
don't actually care what the quotient is

6322
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:54,880
don't actually care what the quotient is
 

6323
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:57,109
don't actually care what the quotient is
only the remainder

6324
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:57,119
only the remainder
 

6325
01:38:57,119 --> 01:39:00,390
only the remainder
so let's see 64 divided by 6

6326
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
so let's see 64 divided by 6
 

6327
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:02,790
so let's see 64 divided by 6
is uh well it's it there's a quotient of

6328
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800
is uh well it's it there's a quotient of
 

6329
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,270
is uh well it's it there's a quotient of
10 but the remainder is 4.

6330
01:39:05,270 --> 01:39:05,280
10 but the remainder is 4.
 

6331
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,030
10 but the remainder is 4.
so you failed because the answer has to

6332
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
so you failed because the answer has to
 

6333
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,470
so you failed because the answer has to
be 2.

6334
01:39:08,470 --> 01:39:08,480
be 2.
 

6335
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:11,590
be 2.
for any prime let's do it with five

6336
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:11,600
for any prime let's do it with five
 

6337
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:13,109
for any prime let's do it with five
which is prime

6338
01:39:13,109 --> 01:39:13,119
which is prime
 

6339
01:39:13,119 --> 01:39:17,750
which is prime
two to the fifth is 32 divide 32 by five

6340
01:39:17,750 --> 01:39:17,760
two to the fifth is 32 divide 32 by five
 

6341
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,870
two to the fifth is 32 divide 32 by five
uh and you get six with a remainder of

6342
01:39:20,870 --> 01:39:20,880
uh and you get six with a remainder of
 

6343
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:22,870
uh and you get six with a remainder of
two

6344
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:22,880
two
 

6345
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,790
two
well the remainder of two here for seven

6346
01:39:24,790 --> 01:39:24,800
well the remainder of two here for seven
 

6347
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:26,629
well the remainder of two here for seven
two to the seventh is 128

6348
01:39:26,629 --> 01:39:26,639
two to the seventh is 128
 

6349
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:29,430
two to the seventh is 128
divide that by seven and let's see i

6350
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
divide that by seven and let's see i
 

6351
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:30,470
divide that by seven and let's see i
think that's seven times

6352
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
think that's seven times
 

6353
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:34,629
think that's seven times
14 is that right no

6354
01:39:34,629 --> 01:39:34,639

 

6355
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:37,910

seven times 18

6356
01:39:37,910 --> 01:39:37,920
seven times 18
 

6357
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:41,350
seven times 18
is 126 with a remainder of two right 128

6358
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:41,360
is 126 with a remainder of two right 128
 

6359
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:41,990
is 126 with a remainder of two right 128
is

6360
01:39:41,990 --> 01:39:42,000
is
 

6361
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:43,669
is
a multiple of seven plus two so if that

6362
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
a multiple of seven plus two so if that
 

6363
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:46,390
a multiple of seven plus two so if that
remainder is not two

6364
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,400
remainder is not two
 

6365
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,669
remainder is not two
then that's definitely not that it's

6366
01:39:47,669 --> 01:39:47,679
then that's definitely not that it's
 

6367
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:49,430
then that's definitely not that it's
definitely not prime

6368
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
definitely not prime
 

6369
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:52,149
definitely not prime
and then if it is it's likely a prime

6370
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:52,159
and then if it is it's likely a prime
 

6371
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:53,189
and then if it is it's likely a prime
but not for sure

6372
01:39:53,189 --> 01:39:53,199
but not for sure
 

6373
01:39:53,199 --> 01:39:54,629
but not for sure
it's likely a prime but not for sure and

6374
01:39:54,629 --> 01:39:54,639
it's likely a prime but not for sure and
 

6375
01:39:54,639 --> 01:39:55,910
it's likely a prime but not for sure and
there's actually a beautiful geometric

6376
01:39:55,910 --> 01:39:55,920
there's actually a beautiful geometric
 

6377
01:39:55,920 --> 01:39:57,109
there's actually a beautiful geometric
proof which is in the book actually

6378
01:39:57,109 --> 01:39:57,119
proof which is in the book actually
 

6379
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:58,149
proof which is in the book actually
that's like one of the most granular

6380
01:39:58,149 --> 01:39:58,159
that's like one of the most granular
 

6381
01:39:58,159 --> 01:39:59,030
that's like one of the most granular
parts of the book because it's such a

6382
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
parts of the book because it's such a
 

6383
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,310
parts of the book because it's such a
beautiful proof i couldn't not give it

6384
01:40:00,310 --> 01:40:00,320
beautiful proof i couldn't not give it
 

6385
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:03,189
beautiful proof i couldn't not give it
so you you draw a lot of like

6386
01:40:03,189 --> 01:40:03,199
so you you draw a lot of like
 

6387
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,990
so you you draw a lot of like
opal and pearl necklaces and spin them

6388
01:40:05,990 --> 01:40:06,000
opal and pearl necklaces and spin them
 

6389
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:07,430
opal and pearl necklaces and spin them
that's kind of the geometric nature of

6390
01:40:07,430 --> 01:40:07,440
that's kind of the geometric nature of
 

6391
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,070
that's kind of the geometric nature of
the

6392
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
the
 

6393
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:10,229
the
of this proof of fermat's little theorem

6394
01:40:10,229 --> 01:40:10,239
of this proof of fermat's little theorem
 

6395
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:11,910
of this proof of fermat's little theorem
um

6396
01:40:11,910 --> 01:40:11,920
um
 

6397
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:13,669
um
so yeah so with pseudo primes there are

6398
01:40:13,669 --> 01:40:13,679
so yeah so with pseudo primes there are
 

6399
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:14,790
so yeah so with pseudo primes there are
primes that are kind of faking if they

6400
01:40:14,790 --> 01:40:14,800
primes that are kind of faking if they
 

6401
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:15,910
primes that are kind of faking if they
pass that test but there

6402
01:40:15,910 --> 01:40:15,920
pass that test but there
 

6403
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,430
pass that test but there
are numbers that are faking it that pass

6404
01:40:17,430 --> 01:40:17,440
are numbers that are faking it that pass
 

6405
01:40:17,440 --> 01:40:19,189
are numbers that are faking it that pass
that test but are not actually prime

6406
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
that test but are not actually prime
 

6407
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:22,950
that test but are not actually prime
um but the point is

6408
01:40:22,950 --> 01:40:22,960
um but the point is
 

6409
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,310
um but the point is
um there are many many many

6410
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:26,320
um there are many many many
 

6411
01:40:26,320 --> 01:40:29,910
um there are many many many
theorems about prime numbers um

6412
01:40:29,910 --> 01:40:29,920
theorems about prime numbers um
 

6413
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:31,109
theorems about prime numbers um
are there like there's a bunch of

6414
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:31,119
are there like there's a bunch of
 

6415
01:40:31,119 --> 01:40:32,790
are there like there's a bunch of
questions to ask is there an infinite

6416
01:40:32,790 --> 01:40:32,800
questions to ask is there an infinite
 

6417
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:34,550
questions to ask is there an infinite
number of primes

6418
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:34,560
number of primes
 

6419
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,550
number of primes
can we say something about the gap

6420
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:36,560
can we say something about the gap
 

6421
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:37,830
can we say something about the gap
between primes as the

6422
01:40:37,830 --> 01:40:37,840
between primes as the
 

6423
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:39,270
between primes as the
numbers grow larger and larger and

6424
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
numbers grow larger and larger and
 

6425
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,870
numbers grow larger and larger and
larger and so on

6426
01:40:40,870 --> 01:40:40,880
larger and so on
 

6427
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:42,709
larger and so on
yeah it's a perfect example of your

6428
01:40:42,709 --> 01:40:42,719
yeah it's a perfect example of your
 

6429
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:44,629
yeah it's a perfect example of your
desire for simplicity in all things you

6430
01:40:44,629 --> 01:40:44,639
desire for simplicity in all things you
 

6431
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,149
desire for simplicity in all things you
know it would be really simple

6432
01:40:46,149 --> 01:40:46,159
know it would be really simple
 

6433
01:40:46,159 --> 01:40:48,310
know it would be really simple
if there was only finitely many primes

6434
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:48,320
if there was only finitely many primes
 

6435
01:40:48,320 --> 01:40:50,310
if there was only finitely many primes
yes and then there would be this sim

6436
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
yes and then there would be this sim
 

6437
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,310
yes and then there would be this sim
finite set of atoms that all numbers

6438
01:40:52,310 --> 01:40:52,320
finite set of atoms that all numbers
 

6439
01:40:52,320 --> 01:40:53,830
finite set of atoms that all numbers
would be built up right

6440
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,840
would be built up right
 

6441
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,310
would be built up right
that would be very simple and good in

6442
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:56,320
that would be very simple and good in
 

6443
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,709
that would be very simple and good in
certain ways but it's completely false

6444
01:40:58,709 --> 01:40:58,719
certain ways but it's completely false
 

6445
01:40:58,719 --> 01:40:59,830
certain ways but it's completely false
and number theory would be totally

6446
01:40:59,830 --> 01:40:59,840
and number theory would be totally
 

6447
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:00,950
and number theory would be totally
different if that were the case it's

6448
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:00,960
different if that were the case it's
 

6449
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:01,830
different if that were the case it's
just not true

6450
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:01,840
just not true
 

6451
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,990
just not true
um in fact this is something else that

6452
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:04,000
um in fact this is something else that
 

6453
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,030
um in fact this is something else that
euclid knew so this is a very very old

6454
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:07,040
euclid knew so this is a very very old
 

6455
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,910
euclid knew so this is a very very old
fact like much before long before we had

6456
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:09,920
fact like much before long before we had
 

6457
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,270
fact like much before long before we had
anything like modern numbers that primes

6458
01:41:11,270 --> 01:41:11,280
anything like modern numbers that primes
 

6459
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:11,990
anything like modern numbers that primes
are infinite

6460
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:12,000
are infinite
 

6461
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,910
are infinite
the primes that there are that write the

6462
01:41:13,910 --> 01:41:13,920
the primes that there are that write the
 

6463
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:15,350
the primes that there are that write the
there's an infinite number of primes

6464
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
there's an infinite number of primes
 

6465
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,790
there's an infinite number of primes
so what about the gaps between the

6466
01:41:16,790 --> 01:41:16,800
so what about the gaps between the
 

6467
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:19,189
so what about the gaps between the
primes right so so one thing that people

6468
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
primes right so so one thing that people
 

6469
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:20,310
primes right so so one thing that people
recognized

6470
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:20,320
recognized
 

6471
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:21,510
recognized
and really thought about a lot is that

6472
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:21,520
and really thought about a lot is that
 

6473
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:23,910
and really thought about a lot is that
the primes on average

6474
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
the primes on average
 

6475
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,830
the primes on average
seem to get farther and farther apart as

6476
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:25,840
seem to get farther and farther apart as
 

6477
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,109
seem to get farther and farther apart as
they get bigger and bigger in other

6478
01:41:27,109 --> 01:41:27,119
they get bigger and bigger in other
 

6479
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:28,950
they get bigger and bigger in other
words it's less and less common

6480
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:28,960
words it's less and less common
 

6481
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,629
words it's less and less common
like i already told you of the first 10

6482
01:41:30,629 --> 01:41:30,639
like i already told you of the first 10
 

6483
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:32,310
like i already told you of the first 10
numbers two three five seven four of

6484
01:41:32,310 --> 01:41:32,320
numbers two three five seven four of
 

6485
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:33,430
numbers two three five seven four of
them are prime that's a lot forty

6486
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:33,440
them are prime that's a lot forty
 

6487
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:34,629
them are prime that's a lot forty
percent

6488
01:41:34,629 --> 01:41:34,639
percent
 

6489
01:41:34,639 --> 01:41:37,030
percent
if i looked at you know ten digit

6490
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:37,040
if i looked at you know ten digit
 

6491
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,390
if i looked at you know ten digit
numbers

6492
01:41:38,390 --> 01:41:38,400
numbers
 

6493
01:41:38,400 --> 01:41:39,990
numbers
no way would forty percent of those be

6494
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:40,000
no way would forty percent of those be
 

6495
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,910
no way would forty percent of those be
prime being prime would be a lot rarer

6496
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:41,920
prime being prime would be a lot rarer
 

6497
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:43,510
prime being prime would be a lot rarer
in some sense because there's a lot more

6498
01:41:43,510 --> 01:41:43,520
in some sense because there's a lot more
 

6499
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:45,669
in some sense because there's a lot more
things for them to be divisible by

6500
01:41:45,669 --> 01:41:45,679
things for them to be divisible by
 

6501
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:47,030
things for them to be divisible by
that's one way of thinking of it it's

6502
01:41:47,030 --> 01:41:47,040
that's one way of thinking of it it's
 

6503
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,550
that's one way of thinking of it it's
it's a lot more possible for there to be

6504
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:48,560
it's a lot more possible for there to be
 

6505
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:49,990
it's a lot more possible for there to be
a factorization because there's a lot of

6506
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:50,000
a factorization because there's a lot of
 

6507
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,910
a factorization because there's a lot of
things you can try to factor out of it

6508
01:41:51,910 --> 01:41:51,920
things you can try to factor out of it
 

6509
01:41:51,920 --> 01:41:53,350
things you can try to factor out of it
as the numbers get bigger and bigger

6510
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:53,360
as the numbers get bigger and bigger
 

6511
01:41:53,360 --> 01:41:57,510
as the numbers get bigger and bigger
primarily gets rarer and rarer

6512
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:57,520

 

6513
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,229

and the extent to which that's the case

6514
01:42:00,229 --> 01:42:00,239
and the extent to which that's the case
 

6515
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:01,830
and the extent to which that's the case
that's pretty well understood but then

6516
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:01,840
that's pretty well understood but then
 

6517
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,669
that's pretty well understood but then
you can ask more fine-grained questions

6518
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
you can ask more fine-grained questions
 

6519
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,109
you can ask more fine-grained questions
and here is one

6520
01:42:05,109 --> 01:42:05,119
and here is one
 

6521
01:42:05,119 --> 01:42:08,629
and here is one
um a

6522
01:42:08,629 --> 01:42:08,639
um a
 

6523
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:10,470
um a
twin prime is a pair of primes that are

6524
01:42:10,470 --> 01:42:10,480
twin prime is a pair of primes that are
 

6525
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,669
twin prime is a pair of primes that are
two apart

6526
01:42:11,669 --> 01:42:11,679
two apart
 

6527
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:14,790
two apart
like three and five or like 11 and 13

6528
01:42:14,790 --> 01:42:14,800
like three and five or like 11 and 13
 

6529
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:17,910
like three and five or like 11 and 13
or like 17 and 19. and one thing we

6530
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:17,920
or like 17 and 19. and one thing we
 

6531
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:19,109
or like 17 and 19. and one thing we
still don't know is

6532
01:42:19,109 --> 01:42:19,119
still don't know is
 

6533
01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:21,910
still don't know is
are there infinitely many of those we

6534
01:42:21,910 --> 01:42:21,920
are there infinitely many of those we
 

6535
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:23,350
are there infinitely many of those we
know on average they get farther and

6536
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:23,360
know on average they get farther and
 

6537
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,629
know on average they get farther and
farther apart but that doesn't mean

6538
01:42:24,629 --> 01:42:24,639
farther apart but that doesn't mean
 

6539
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:27,669
farther apart but that doesn't mean
there couldn't be like occasional

6540
01:42:27,669 --> 01:42:27,679
there couldn't be like occasional
 

6541
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,229
there couldn't be like occasional
folks that come close together and

6542
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
folks that come close together and
 

6543
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,030
folks that come close together and
indeed

6544
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:31,040
indeed
 

6545
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,070
indeed
uh we think that there are and one

6546
01:42:34,070 --> 01:42:34,080
uh we think that there are and one
 

6547
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:34,950
uh we think that there are and one
interesting question

6548
01:42:34,950 --> 01:42:34,960
interesting question
 

6549
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:37,669
interesting question
i mean this is because i think you might

6550
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:37,679
i mean this is because i think you might
 

6551
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:38,629
i mean this is because i think you might
say like well

6552
01:42:38,629 --> 01:42:38,639
say like well
 

6553
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:40,870
say like well
why how could one possibly have a right

6554
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:40,880
why how could one possibly have a right
 

6555
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:42,310
why how could one possibly have a right
to have an opinion about something like

6556
01:42:42,310 --> 01:42:42,320
to have an opinion about something like
 

6557
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:43,350
to have an opinion about something like
that

6558
01:42:43,350 --> 01:42:43,360
that
 

6559
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,030
that
like what you know we don't have any way

6560
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
like what you know we don't have any way
 

6561
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,590
like what you know we don't have any way
of describing a process that makes

if the behavior is roughly the same

if the behavior is roughly the same
 

6633
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:49,189
if the behavior is roughly the same
and if it's not maybe change the random

6634
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:49,199
and if it's not maybe change the random
 

6635
01:43:49,199 --> 01:43:50,390
and if it's not maybe change the random
process maybe make the randomness a

6636
01:43:50,390 --> 01:43:50,400
process maybe make the randomness a
 

6637
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,750
process maybe make the randomness a
little bit different and tweak it and

6638
01:43:51,750 --> 01:43:51,760
little bit different and tweak it and
 

6639
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:53,669
little bit different and tweak it and
see if you can find a random process

6640
01:43:53,669 --> 01:43:53,679
see if you can find a random process
 

6641
01:43:53,679 --> 01:43:55,590
see if you can find a random process
that matches the behavior we see and

01:43:55,590 --> 01:43:55,600
that matches the behavior we see and
 

6643
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:57,189
that matches the behavior we see and
then maybe you predict that

6644
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:57,199
then maybe you predict that
 

6645
01:43:57,199 --> 01:44:00,790
then maybe you predict that
other behaviors um of the system are

6646
01:44:00,790 --> 01:44:00,800
other behaviors um of the system are
 

6647
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:02,790
other behaviors um of the system are
like that of the random process

6648
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:02,800
like that of the random process
 

6649
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:03,990
like that of the random process
and so that's kind of like it's funny

and so that's kind of like it's funny

discovery and that might feel like a new

6722
01:45:10,709 --> 01:45:10,719
discovery and that might feel like a new
 

6723
01:45:10,719 --> 01:45:12,070
discovery and that might feel like a new
experience but it's not

6724
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:12,080
experience but it's not
 

6725
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:14,470
experience but it's not
it was always written in the cards but

6726
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:14,480
it was always written in the cards but
 

6727
01:45:14,480 --> 01:45:15,910
it was always written in the cards but
it's funny that you say that because a

6728
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:15,920
it's funny that you say that because a
 

6729
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,270
it's funny that you say that because a
lot of people think of like

6730
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:17,280
lot of people think of like
 

6731
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:20,790
lot of people think of like
randomness uh the fundamental

6732
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
randomness uh the fundamental
 

6733
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:23,350
randomness uh the fundamental
randomness within the nature of reality

6734
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:23,360
randomness within the nature of reality
 

6735
01:45:23,360 --> 01:45:25,030
randomness within the nature of reality
might be the source

6736
01:45:25,030 --> 01:45:25,040
might be the source
 

6737
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,030
might be the source
of something that we experience as free

6738
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:27,040
of something that we experience as free
 

6739
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,030
of something that we experience as free
will and you're saying it's like useful

6740
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:29,040
will and you're saying it's like useful
 

6741
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,390
will and you're saying it's like useful
to look at prime numbers as

6742
01:45:30,390 --> 01:45:30,400
to look at prime numbers as
 

6743
01:45:30,400 --> 01:45:33,669
to look at prime numbers as
um as a random process

6744
01:45:33,669 --> 01:45:33,679
um as a random process
 

6745
01:45:33,679 --> 01:45:36,070
um as a random process
in order to prove stuff about them but

6746
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
in order to prove stuff about them but
 

6747
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:37,510
in order to prove stuff about them but
fundamentally of course it's not a

6748
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:37,520
fundamentally of course it's not a
 

6749
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:38,709
fundamentally of course it's not a
random process

6750
01:45:38,709 --> 01:45:38,719
random process
 

6751
01:45:38,719 --> 01:45:40,470
random process
well not in order to prove some stuff

6752
01:45:40,470 --> 01:45:40,480
well not in order to prove some stuff
 

6753
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:42,470
well not in order to prove some stuff
about them so much as to figure out

6754
01:45:42,470 --> 01:45:42,480
about them so much as to figure out
 

6755
01:45:42,480 --> 01:45:44,070
about them so much as to figure out
what we expect to be true and then try

6756
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,080
what we expect to be true and then try
 

6757
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,510
what we expect to be true and then try
to prove that here's what you don't want

6758
01:45:45,510 --> 01:45:45,520
to prove that here's what you don't want
 

6759
01:45:45,520 --> 01:45:47,350
to prove that here's what you don't want
to do try really hard to prove something

6760
01:45:47,350 --> 01:45:47,360
to do try really hard to prove something
 

6761
01:45:47,360 --> 01:45:49,109
to do try really hard to prove something
that's false that makes it really hard

6762
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:49,119
that's false that makes it really hard
 

6763
01:45:49,119 --> 01:45:50,950
that's false that makes it really hard
to prove the thing if it's false

6764
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:50,960
to prove the thing if it's false
 

6765
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:52,149
to prove the thing if it's false
so you certainly want to have some

6766
01:45:52,149 --> 01:45:52,159
so you certainly want to have some
 

6767
01:45:52,159 --> 01:45:54,149
so you certainly want to have some
heuristic ways of guessing making good

6768
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:54,159
heuristic ways of guessing making good
 

6769
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,510
heuristic ways of guessing making good
guesses about what's true so yeah

6770
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
guesses about what's true so yeah
 

6771
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:56,709
guesses about what's true so yeah
here's what i would say let's you're

6772
01:45:56,709 --> 01:45:56,719
here's what i would say let's you're
 

6773
01:45:56,719 --> 01:45:58,629
here's what i would say let's you're
going to be imaginary sam harris now yes

6774
01:45:58,629 --> 01:45:58,639
going to be imaginary sam harris now yes
 

6775
01:45:58,639 --> 01:45:59,669
going to be imaginary sam harris now yes
like

6776
01:45:59,669 --> 01:45:59,679
like
 

6777
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:01,030
like
you are talking about prime numbers and

6778
01:46:01,030 --> 01:46:01,040
you are talking about prime numbers and
 

6779
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:02,470
you are talking about prime numbers and
you are like but prime numbers are

6780
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:02,480
you are like but prime numbers are
 

6781
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:03,830
you are like but prime numbers are
completely deterministic

6782
01:46:03,830 --> 01:46:03,840
completely deterministic
 

6783
01:46:03,840 --> 01:46:05,350
completely deterministic
and i'm saying like well but let's treat

6784
01:46:05,350 --> 01:46:05,360
and i'm saying like well but let's treat
 

6785
01:46:05,360 --> 01:46:06,870
and i'm saying like well but let's treat
them like a random process

6786
01:46:06,870 --> 01:46:06,880
them like a random process
 

6787
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:08,709
them like a random process
and then you say but you're just saying

6788
01:46:08,709 --> 01:46:08,719
and then you say but you're just saying
 

6789
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:09,750
and then you say but you're just saying
something that's not true they're not a

6790
01:46:09,750 --> 01:46:09,760
something that's not true they're not a
 

6791
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:10,950
something that's not true they're not a
random process or deterministic and i'm

6792
01:46:10,950 --> 01:46:10,960
random process or deterministic and i'm
 

6793
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:12,550
random process or deterministic and i'm
like okay great you hold to your

6794
01:46:12,550 --> 01:46:12,560
like okay great you hold to your
 

6795
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,830
like okay great you hold to your
insistence that is honoring the process

6796
01:46:13,830 --> 01:46:13,840
insistence that is honoring the process
 

6797
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:15,350
insistence that is honoring the process
meanwhile i'm generating insight about

6798
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:15,360
meanwhile i'm generating insight about
 

6799
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,709
meanwhile i'm generating insight about
the primes that you're not because i'm

6800
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
the primes that you're not because i'm
 

6801
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:17,910
the primes that you're not because i'm
willing to sort of pretend that there's

6802
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:17,920
willing to sort of pretend that there's
 

6803
01:46:17,920 --> 01:46:19,109
willing to sort of pretend that there's
something that they're not in order to

6804
01:46:19,109 --> 01:46:19,119
something that they're not in order to
 

6805
01:46:19,119 --> 01:46:20,950
something that they're not in order to
understand what's going on yeah so it

6806
01:46:20,950 --> 01:46:20,960
understand what's going on yeah so it
 

6807
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,030
understand what's going on yeah so it
doesn't matter what the reality is what

6808
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,040
doesn't matter what the reality is what
 

6809
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:23,750
doesn't matter what the reality is what
matters is

6810
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:23,760
matters is
 

6811
01:46:23,760 --> 01:46:27,430
matters is
what's uh what framework

6812
01:46:27,430 --> 01:46:27,440
what's uh what framework
 

6813
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:29,830
what's uh what framework
of thought results in the maximum number

6814
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:29,840
of thought results in the maximum number
 

6815
01:46:29,840 --> 01:46:30,709
of thought results in the maximum number
of insights

6816
01:46:30,709 --> 01:46:30,719
of insights
 

6817
01:46:30,719 --> 01:46:32,470
of insights
yeah because i feel look i'm sorry but i

6818
01:46:32,470 --> 01:46:32,480
yeah because i feel look i'm sorry but i
 

6819
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:33,750
yeah because i feel look i'm sorry but i
feel like you have more insights about

6820
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:33,760
feel like you have more insights about
 

6821
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:35,189
feel like you have more insights about
people if you

6822
01:46:35,189 --> 01:46:35,199
people if you
 

6823
01:46:35,199 --> 01:46:37,590
people if you
think of them as like beings that have

6824
01:46:37,590 --> 01:46:37,600
think of them as like beings that have
 

6825
01:46:37,600 --> 01:46:39,510
think of them as like beings that have
wants and needs and desires and do stuff

6826
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:39,520
wants and needs and desires and do stuff
 

6827
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:39,990
wants and needs and desires and do stuff
on

purpose even if that's not true you
 

6831
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,350
purpose even if that's not true you
still understand better what's going on

6832
01:46:43,350 --> 01:46:43,360
still understand better what's going on
 

6833
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:44,790
still understand better what's going on
by treating them in that way don't you

6834
01:46:44,790 --> 01:46:44,800
by treating them in that way don't you
 

6835
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:45,910
by treating them in that way don't you
find look when you work on machine

6836
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:45,920
find look when you work on machine
 

6837
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:46,390
find look when you work on machine
learning

learning
 

6839
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,910

don't you find yourself sort of talking

6840
01:46:47,910 --> 01:46:47,920
don't you find yourself sort of talking
 

6841
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:49,590
don't you find yourself sort of talking
about what the machine is what the

about what the machine is what the

machine is trying to do
in a certain instance do you not find

6846
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,199
in a certain instance do you not find
 

6847
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:54,870
in a certain instance do you not find
yourself drawn to that language

6848
01:46:54,870 --> 01:46:54,880
yourself drawn to that language
 

6849
01:46:54,880 --> 01:46:57,189
yourself drawn to that language
well oh it knows this it's trying to do

6850
01:46:57,189 --> 01:46:57,199
well oh it knows this it's trying to do
 

6851
01:46:57,199 --> 01:46:58,870
well oh it knows this it's trying to do
that it's learning that

6852
01:46:58,870 --> 01:46:58,880
that it's learning that
 

6853
01:46:58,880 --> 01:47:01,030
that it's learning that
i'm certainly drawn to that language to

6854
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,040
i'm certainly drawn to that language to
 

6855
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:01,910
i'm certainly drawn to that language to
the point where i

6856
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:01,920
the point where i
 

6857
01:47:01,920 --> 01:47:03,510
the point where i
received quite a bit of criticisms for

6858
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:03,520
received quite a bit of criticisms for
 

6859
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:05,270
received quite a bit of criticisms for
it because i you know like

6860
01:47:05,270 --> 01:47:05,280
it because i you know like
 

6861
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:07,510
it because i you know like
oh i'm on your side man so especially in

6862
01:47:07,510 --> 01:47:07,520
oh i'm on your side man so especially in
 

6863
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:08,629
oh i'm on your side man so especially in
robotics

6864
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:08,639
robotics
 

6865
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:10,790
robotics
i don't know why but robotics people

6866
01:47:10,790 --> 01:47:10,800
i don't know why but robotics people
 

6867
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,390
i don't know why but robotics people
don't like to

6868
01:47:12,390 --> 01:47:12,400
don't like to
 

6869
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:15,189
don't like to
name their robots or they they certainly

6870
01:47:15,189 --> 01:47:15,199
name their robots or they they certainly
 

6871
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:16,950
name their robots or they they certainly
don't like to gender their robots

6872
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:16,960
don't like to gender their robots
 

6873
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,629
don't like to gender their robots
because the moment you gender a robot

6874
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:18,639
because the moment you gender a robot
 

6875
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:20,550
because the moment you gender a robot
you start to anthropomorphize

6876
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:20,560
you start to anthropomorphize
 

6877
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,510
you start to anthropomorphize
if you say he or she you start to you in

6878
01:47:23,510 --> 01:47:23,520
if you say he or she you start to you in
 

6879
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,109
if you say he or she you start to you in
your mind construct like a

6880
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:25,119
your mind construct like a
 

6881
01:47:25,119 --> 01:47:27,750
your mind construct like a
um like a life story in your mind you

6882
01:47:27,750 --> 01:47:27,760
um like a life story in your mind you
 

6883
01:47:27,760 --> 01:47:28,870
um like a life story in your mind you
can't help it

6884
01:47:28,870 --> 01:47:28,880
can't help it
 

6885
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,030
can't help it
this like you create like a humorous

6886
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:31,040
this like you create like a humorous
 

6887
01:47:31,040 --> 01:47:32,790
this like you create like a humorous
story to this person you start to

6888
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:32,800
story to this person you start to
 

6889
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:35,669
story to this person you start to
understand this person this robot you

6890
01:47:35,669 --> 01:47:35,679
understand this person this robot you
 

6891
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:37,189
understand this person this robot you
start to project your own

6892
01:47:37,189 --> 01:47:37,199
start to project your own
 

6893
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,470
start to project your own
but i think that's what we do to each

6894
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:38,480
but i think that's what we do to each
 

6895
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:39,990
but i think that's what we do to each
other and i think that's actually really

6896
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
other and i think that's actually really
 

6897
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,430
other and i think that's actually really
useful from the engineering

it's almost like asking this question

6910
01:47:52,950 --> 01:47:52,960
it's almost like asking this question
 

6911
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,510
it's almost like asking this question
you know when a machine learning system

like asking like almost like when you're
 

6921
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,470
like asking like almost like when you're
talking about to a child

6922
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:04,480
talking about to a child
 

6923

who just does something bad you're
 

6925
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:10,629
who just does something bad you're
you want to understand like what was um

6926
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
you want to understand like what was um
 

6927
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,390
you want to understand like what was um
how did they see the world maybe there's

6928
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:12,400
how did they see the world maybe there's
 

6929
01:48:12,400 --> 01:48:13,830
how did they see the world maybe there's
a totally new maybe you're the one

6930
01:48:13,830 --> 01:48:13,840
a totally new maybe you're the one
 

6931
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:15,669
a totally new maybe you're the one
that's thinking about the world

6932
01:48:15,669 --> 01:48:15,679
that's thinking about the world
 

6933
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,350
that's thinking about the world
incorrectly and uh yeah that

6934
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:18,360
incorrectly and uh yeah that
 

6935
01:48:18,360 --> 01:48:20,229
incorrectly and uh yeah that
anthropomorphization process i think is

6936
01:48:20,229 --> 01:48:20,239
anthropomorphization process i think is
 

6937
01:48:20,239 --> 01:48:21,669
anthropomorphization process i think is
ultimately good for insight and the same

6938
01:48:21,669 --> 01:48:21,679
ultimately good for insight and the same
 

6939
01:48:21,679 --> 01:48:21,990
ultimately good for insight and the same
is

6940
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,000
is
 

6941
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,229
is
i i i agree with you i tend to believe

6943
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,669
i i i agree with you i tend to believe
about free will

6944

as well let me ask you a ridiculous
 

6947
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:28,790
as well let me ask you a ridiculous
question if it's okay

to actually like look into

6974
01:48:58,310 --> 01:48:58,320
to actually like look into
 

6975
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:00,390

01:49:03,669 --> 01:49:03,679
trying to argue for this
 

6981
01:49:03,679 --> 01:49:06,629
trying to argue for this
but the belief there i think let's say

01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:06,639
but the belief there i think let's say
 

6983
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:08,149
but the belief there i think let's say
find nitism that

6984
01:49:08,149 --> 01:49:08,159
find nitism that
 

6985
01:49:08,159 --> 01:49:11,830
find nitism that
infinity is is fake

6986
01:49:11,830 --> 01:49:11,840

 

6987
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:15,350

meaning um infinity might be like a

6988
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:15,360
meaning um infinity might be like a
 

6989
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,629
meaning um infinity might be like a
useful hack

useful hack
 

6991
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:18,070

for certain like a useful tool in

01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,080
for certain like a useful tool in
 

6993
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,629
for certain like a useful tool in
mathematics but it really

6994
01:49:20,629 --> 01:49:20,639
mathematics but it really
 

6995
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,430
mathematics but it really
gets us into trouble because there's no

in the real world maybe i'm sort of
 

7001
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:30,870

not expressing that uh fully correctly

01:49:30,870 --> 01:49:30,880
not expressing that uh fully correctly
 

7003
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:32,709
not expressing that uh fully correctly
but basically saying like there's things

the difference in ultra like the

01:50:08,310 --> 01:50:08,320
the difference in ultra like the
 

7045
01:50:08,320 --> 01:50:10,550
the difference in ultra like the
ultimate sentence of the modern age can

7046

finitism

7054
01:50:19,669 --> 01:50:19,679
finitism
 

7055
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:22,229
finitism
so financialism says that the only

7056
01:50:22,229 --> 01:50:22,239
so financialism says that the only
 

7057
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,070
so financialism says that the only
infinity you're allowed to have is that

7058
01:50:24,070 --> 01:50:24,080
infinity you're allowed to have is that
 

7059
01:50:24,080 --> 01:50:25,350
infinity you're allowed to have is that
the natural numbers are

7060
01:50:25,350 --> 01:50:25,360
the natural numbers are
 

7061
01:50:25,360 --> 01:50:28,229
the natural numbers are
infinite so like those numbers are

7062
01:50:28,229 --> 01:50:28,239
infinite so like those numbers are
 

7063
01:50:28,239 --> 01:50:29,189
infinite so like those numbers are
infinite

7064
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:29,199
infinite
 

7065
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:32,229
infinite
so like one two three four five the

7066
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:32,239
so like one two three four five the
 

7067
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:33,430
so like one two three four five the
integers

7068
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:33,440
integers
 

7069
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:37,430
integers
are internet the ultra financialism says

7070
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:37,440
are internet the ultra financialism says
 

7071
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:40,709
are internet the ultra financialism says
nope even that infinity's fake that's

7072
01:50:40,709 --> 01:50:40,719
nope even that infinity's fake that's
 

7073
01:50:40,719 --> 01:50:41,350
nope even that infinity's fake that's
fine

7074
01:50:41,350 --> 01:50:41,360
fine
 

7075
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:43,270
fine
i bet ultra fanatism came second i bet

7076
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:43,280
i bet ultra fanatism came second i bet
 

7077
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:44,470
i bet ultra fanatism came second i bet
it's like when there's like a hardcore

7078
01:50:44,470 --> 01:50:44,480
it's like when there's like a hardcore
 

7079
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:46,070
it's like when there's like a hardcore
scene and then one guy is like

7080
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:46,080
scene and then one guy is like
 

7081
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:47,270
scene and then one guy is like
oh now there's a lot of people in the

7082
01:50:47,270 --> 01:50:47,280
oh now there's a lot of people in the
 

7083
01:50:47,280 --> 01:50:48,550
oh now there's a lot of people in the
scene i have to find a way to be more

7084
01:50:48,550 --> 01:50:48,560
scene i have to find a way to be more
 

7085
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:50,149
scene i have to find a way to be more
hardcore than the hardcore people

7086
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:50,159
hardcore than the hardcore people
 

7087
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:53,030
hardcore than the hardcore people
go back to the emo doc yeah okay so is

7088
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:53,040
go back to the emo doc yeah okay so is
 

7089
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:53,990
go back to the emo doc yeah okay so is
there any uh

7090
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
there any uh
 

7091
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,910
there any uh
are you ever because i'm not often

7092
01:50:55,910 --> 01:50:55,920
are you ever because i'm not often
 

7093
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:57,990
are you ever because i'm not often
uncomfortable with infinity

7094
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:58,000
uncomfortable with infinity
 

7095
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,950
uncomfortable with infinity
like psychologically i i you know i have

7096
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
like psychologically i i you know i have
 

7097
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:01,350
like psychologically i i you know i have
i have

7098
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
i have
 

7099
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:04,709
i have
trouble when that sneaks in there

7100
01:51:04,709 --> 01:51:04,719
trouble when that sneaks in there
 

7101
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:07,109
trouble when that sneaks in there
it's because it works so damn well i get

7102
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
it's because it works so damn well i get
 

7103
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:08,950
it's because it works so damn well i get
a little suspicious

7104
01:51:08,950 --> 01:51:08,960
a little suspicious
 

7105
01:51:08,960 --> 01:51:11,750
a little suspicious
um because it could be almost like a

7106
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:11,760
um because it could be almost like a
 

7107
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:12,550
um because it could be almost like a
crutch

7108
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:12,560
crutch
 

7109
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:14,550
crutch
or an oversimplification that's missing

7110
01:51:14,550 --> 01:51:14,560
or an oversimplification that's missing
 

7111
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,430
or an oversimplification that's missing
something profound about reality

7112
01:51:17,430 --> 01:51:17,440
something profound about reality
 

7113
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:19,750
something profound about reality
well so first of all okay if you say

7114
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:19,760
well so first of all okay if you say
 

7115
01:51:19,760 --> 01:51:20,709
well so first of all okay if you say
like

7116
01:51:20,709 --> 01:51:20,719
like
 

7117
01:51:20,719 --> 01:51:24,149
like
is there like a serious way of doing

7118
01:51:24,149 --> 01:51:24,159
is there like a serious way of doing
 

7119
01:51:24,159 --> 01:51:25,510
is there like a serious way of doing
mathematics that doesn't

7120
01:51:25,510 --> 01:51:25,520
mathematics that doesn't
 

7121
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:28,870
mathematics that doesn't
really treat infinity as a real

7122
01:51:28,870 --> 01:51:28,880
really treat infinity as a real
 

7123
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,550
really treat infinity as a real
thing or maybe it's kind of agnostic and

7124
01:51:30,550 --> 01:51:30,560
thing or maybe it's kind of agnostic and
 

7125
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,589
thing or maybe it's kind of agnostic and
it's like i'm not really gonna make a

7126
01:51:31,589 --> 01:51:31,599
it's like i'm not really gonna make a
 

7127
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:33,189
it's like i'm not really gonna make a
firm statement about whether it's a real

7128
01:51:33,189 --> 01:51:33,199
firm statement about whether it's a real
 

7129
01:51:33,199 --> 01:51:34,870
firm statement about whether it's a real
thing or not yeah that's called most of

7130
01:51:34,870 --> 01:51:34,880
thing or not yeah that's called most of
 

7131
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:36,229
thing or not yeah that's called most of
the history of mathematics

7132
01:51:36,229 --> 01:51:36,239
the history of mathematics
 

7133
01:51:36,239 --> 01:51:38,310
the history of mathematics
right so it's only after cantor right

7134
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:38,320
right so it's only after cantor right
 

7135
01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:40,070
right so it's only after cantor right
that we really are

7136
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:40,080
that we really are
 

7137
01:51:40,080 --> 01:51:43,350
that we really are
sort of okay we're gonna like have a

7138
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:43,360
sort of okay we're gonna like have a
 

7139
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,870
sort of okay we're gonna like have a
notion of like the cardinality of an

7140
01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:44,880
notion of like the cardinality of an
 

7141
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:45,589
notion of like the cardinality of an
infinite set

7142
01:51:45,589 --> 01:51:45,599
infinite set
 

7143
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:48,709
infinite set
and like um do something that you might

7144
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
and like um do something that you might
 

7145
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,950
and like um do something that you might
call like the modern theory of infinity

7146
01:51:50,950 --> 01:51:50,960
call like the modern theory of infinity
 

7147
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:53,030
call like the modern theory of infinity
um that said obviously everybody was

7148
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:53,040
um that said obviously everybody was
 

7149
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:54,629
um that said obviously everybody was
drawn to this notion and no not

7150
01:51:54,629 --> 01:51:54,639
drawn to this notion and no not
 

7151
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:55,910
drawn to this notion and no not
everybody was comfortable with it look i

7152
01:51:55,910 --> 01:51:55,920
everybody was comfortable with it look i
 

7153
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:57,350
everybody was comfortable with it look i
mean this is what happens with newton

7154
01:51:57,350 --> 01:51:57,360
mean this is what happens with newton
 

7155
01:51:57,360 --> 01:51:59,030
mean this is what happens with newton
right i mean so

7156
01:51:59,030 --> 01:51:59,040
right i mean so
 

7157
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:00,709
right i mean so
newton understands that to talk about

7158
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:00,719
newton understands that to talk about
 

7159
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,470
newton understands that to talk about
tangents and to talk about instantaneous

7160
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:02,480
tangents and to talk about instantaneous
 

7161
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:03,510
tangents and to talk about instantaneous
velocity

7162
01:52:03,510 --> 01:52:03,520
velocity
 

7163
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:05,830
velocity
um he has to do something that we would

7164
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:05,840
um he has to do something that we would
 

7165
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,229
um he has to do something that we would
now call taking a limit

7166
01:52:08,229 --> 01:52:08,239
now call taking a limit
 

7167
01:52:08,239 --> 01:52:10,629
now call taking a limit
right the fabled dy for dx if you sort

7168
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639
right the fabled dy for dx if you sort
 

7169
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:12,070
right the fabled dy for dx if you sort
of go back to your calculus class for

7170
01:52:12,070 --> 01:52:12,080
of go back to your calculus class for
 

7171
01:52:12,080 --> 01:52:13,270
of go back to your calculus class for
those who have taken calculus remember

7172
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:13,280
those who have taken calculus remember
 

7173
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,709
those who have taken calculus remember
this mysterious thing

7174
01:52:14,709 --> 01:52:14,719
this mysterious thing
 

7175
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:17,910
this mysterious thing
and you know what is it what is it well

7176
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:17,920
and you know what is it what is it well
 

7177
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,790
and you know what is it what is it well
he'd say like

7178
01:52:18,790 --> 01:52:18,800
he'd say like
 

7179
01:52:18,800 --> 01:52:22,229
he'd say like
well it's like you sort of um divide the

7180
01:52:22,229 --> 01:52:22,239
well it's like you sort of um divide the
 

7181
01:52:22,239 --> 01:52:23,830
well it's like you sort of um divide the
length of this line segment

7182
01:52:23,830 --> 01:52:23,840
length of this line segment
 

7183
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:25,109
length of this line segment
by the length of this other line segment

7184
01:52:25,109 --> 01:52:25,119
by the length of this other line segment
 

7185
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:26,149
by the length of this other line segment
and then you make them a little shorter

7186
01:52:26,149 --> 01:52:26,159
and then you make them a little shorter
 

7187
01:52:26,159 --> 01:52:27,350
and then you make them a little shorter
and you divide again and then you make

7188
01:52:27,350 --> 01:52:27,360
and you divide again and then you make
 

7189
01:52:27,360 --> 01:52:28,390
and you divide again and then you make
them a little shorter and you divide

7190
01:52:28,390 --> 01:52:28,400
them a little shorter and you divide
 

7191
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:29,430
them a little shorter and you divide
again and then you just keep on doing

7192
01:52:29,430 --> 01:52:29,440
again and then you just keep on doing
 

7193
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,629
again and then you just keep on doing
that until they're like infinitely short

7194
01:52:30,629 --> 01:52:30,639
that until they're like infinitely short
 

7195
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:32,390
that until they're like infinitely short
and then you divide them again

7196
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:32,400
and then you divide them again
 

7197
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,629
and then you divide them again
these quantities that are like they're

7198
01:52:34,629 --> 01:52:34,639
these quantities that are like they're
 

7199
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:36,229
these quantities that are like they're
not zero

7200
01:52:36,229 --> 01:52:36,239
not zero

01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:21,350
of life stephen wolfram's work
that i've been a big fan of for a while

7364
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:21,360
that i've been a big fan of for a while
 

7365
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:22,629
that i've been a big fan of for a while
of cellular autonomy i was i was

01:55:22,629 --> 01:55:22,639
of cellular autonomy i was i was

wondering if you have

7368
01:55:23,669 --> 01:55:23,679
wondering if you have
 

7369
01:55:23,679 --> 01:55:25,350
wondering if you have
if you have ever encountered these kinds

7370
01:55:25,350 --> 01:55:25,360
if you have ever encountered these kinds
 

7371
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:26,709
if you have ever encountered these kinds
of objects

7372
01:55:26,709 --> 01:55:26,719
of objects
 

7373
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:27,910
of objects
you ever looked at them as a

01:55:27,910 --> 01:55:27,920
you ever looked at them as a
 

7375
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:30,830
you ever looked at them as a
mathematician where you have very simple

7376
01:55:30,830 --> 01:55:30,840
mathematician where you have very simple
 

7377
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:32,070

one part it's like what you're saying

7392
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
one part it's like what you're saying
 

7393
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:47,430
one part it's like what you're saying
about andrew wiles like you

01:55:47,430 --> 01:55:47,440
about andrew wiles like you
 

7395
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:48,870
about andrew wiles like you
you can look at the deformation of a

7396
01:55:48,870 --> 01:55:48,880
you can look at the deformation of a
 

7397
01:55:48,880 --> 01:55:51,270
you can look at the deformation of a
small piece to tell you about the hole

7398
01:55:51,270 --> 01:55:51,280
small piece to tell you about the hole
 

7399
01:55:51,280 --> 01:55:54,310
small piece to tell you about the hole
it feels like with cellular automata

7400
01:55:54,310 --> 01:55:54,320
it feels like with cellular automata
 

7401
01:55:54,320 --> 01:55:57,910
it feels like with cellular automata
or any kind of complex systems it's

01:55:57,920 --> 01:55:59,430
or any kind of complex systems it's
it's often very difficult to say

7404
01:55:59,430 --> 01:55:59,440
it's often very difficult to say
 

7405
01:55:59,440 --> 01:56:01,910
it's often very difficult to say
something about the whole thing

7406
01:56:01,910 --> 01:56:01,920
something about the whole thing
 

7407
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:04,310
something about the whole thing
even when you can precisely describe the

7408
01:56:04,310 --> 01:56:04,320
even when you can precisely describe the
 

7409
01:56:04,320 --> 01:56:05,030

yeah i mean i love that subject i
haven't really done research in it

7416
01:56:12,149 --> 01:56:12,159
haven't really done research in it
 

7417
01:56:12,159 --> 01:56:13,510
haven't really done research in it
myself i've played around with it i'll

myself i've played around with it i'll
 

7419
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:15,109
myself i've played around with it i'll
send you a fun blog post i wrote where i

7420
01:56:15,109 --> 01:56:15,119
send you a fun blog post i wrote where i
 

7421
01:56:15,119 --> 01:56:16,470
send you a fun blog post i wrote where i
made some cool

7422
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:16,480
made some cool
 

7423
01:56:16,480 --> 01:56:17,669
made some cool
texture patterns from cellular

7424
01:56:17,669 --> 01:56:17,679
texture patterns from cellular
 

7425
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:19,830
texture patterns from cellular
autonomous um but

7426
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:19,840
autonomous um but
 

7427
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,830
autonomous um but
um and those are really always

7428
01:56:21,830 --> 01:56:21,840
um and those are really always
 

7429
01:56:21,840 --> 01:56:22,950
um and those are really always
compelling it's like

7430
01:56:22,950 --> 01:56:22,960
compelling it's like
 

7431
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,470
compelling it's like
you create simple rules and they create

7432
01:56:24,470 --> 01:56:24,480
you create simple rules and they create
 

7433
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:26,070
you create simple rules and they create
some beautiful textures it doesn't make

7434
01:56:26,070 --> 01:56:26,080
some beautiful textures it doesn't make
 

7435
01:56:26,080 --> 01:56:26,390
some beautiful textures it doesn't make
any

7436
01:56:26,390 --> 01:56:26,400
any
 

7437
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:27,589
any
actually did you see there was a great

7438
01:56:27,589 --> 01:56:27,599
actually did you see there was a great
 

7439
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:29,030
actually did you see there was a great
paper i don't know if you saw this like

7440
01:56:29,030 --> 01:56:29,040
paper i don't know if you saw this like
 

7441
01:56:29,040 --> 01:56:30,470
paper i don't know if you saw this like
a machine learning paper

7442
01:56:30,470 --> 01:56:30,480
a machine learning paper
 

7443
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,669
a machine learning paper
yes i don't know if you want to talk

7444
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:31,679
yes i don't know if you want to talk
 

7445
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:32,790
yes i don't know if you want to talk
about where they were like learning the

7446
01:56:32,790 --> 01:56:32,800
about where they were like learning the
 

7447
01:56:32,800 --> 01:56:34,629
about where they were like learning the
texture is like let's try to like

7448
01:56:34,629 --> 01:56:34,639
texture is like let's try to like
 

7449
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:36,310
texture is like let's try to like
reverse engineer and like learn a

7450
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:36,320
reverse engineer and like learn a
 

7451
01:56:36,320 --> 01:56:37,750
reverse engineer and like learn a
cellular automaton that can reduce

7452
01:56:37,750 --> 01:56:37,760
cellular automaton that can reduce
 

7453
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,270
cellular automaton that can reduce
texture that looks like this

7454
01:56:39,270 --> 01:56:39,280
texture that looks like this
 

7455
01:56:39,280 --> 01:56:42,950
texture that looks like this
from the images very cool and as you say

7456
01:56:42,950 --> 01:56:42,960
from the images very cool and as you say
 

7457
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:44,470
from the images very cool and as you say
the thing you said is i feel the same

7458
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:44,480
the thing you said is i feel the same
 

7459
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:45,830
the thing you said is i feel the same
way when i read machine learning paper

7460
01:56:45,830 --> 01:56:45,840
way when i read machine learning paper
 

7461
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,669
way when i read machine learning paper
is that what's especially interesting is

7462
01:56:47,669 --> 01:56:47,679
is that what's especially interesting is
 

7463
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,350
is that what's especially interesting is
the cases where it doesn't work

7464
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
the cases where it doesn't work
 

7465
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,790
the cases where it doesn't work
like what does it do when it doesn't do

7466
01:56:50,790 --> 01:56:50,800
like what does it do when it doesn't do
 

7467
01:56:50,800 --> 01:56:52,550
like what does it do when it doesn't do
the thing that you tried to train it

7468
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
the thing that you tried to train it
 

7469
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,310
the thing that you tried to train it
yeah to do that's extremely interesting

7470
01:56:54,310 --> 01:56:54,320
yeah to do that's extremely interesting
 

7471
01:56:54,320 --> 01:56:55,990
yeah to do that's extremely interesting
yeah yeah that was a cool paper

7472
01:56:55,990 --> 01:56:56,000
yeah yeah that was a cool paper
 

7473
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,990
yeah yeah that was a cool paper
so yeah so let's start with the game of

7474
01:56:57,990 --> 01:56:58,000
so yeah so let's start with the game of
 

7475
01:56:58,000 --> 01:56:59,430
so yeah so let's start with the game of
life let's start with

7476
01:56:59,430 --> 01:56:59,440
life let's start with
 

7477
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:02,310
life let's start with
um or let's start with john conway so

7478
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:02,320
um or let's start with john conway so
 

7479
01:57:02,320 --> 01:57:03,510
um or let's start with john conway so
conway

7480
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:03,520
conway
 

7481
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:05,510
conway
so yeah so let's start with john conway

7482
01:57:05,510 --> 01:57:05,520
so yeah so let's start with john conway
 

7483
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:07,109
so yeah so let's start with john conway
again just i don't know

7484
01:57:07,109 --> 01:57:07,119
again just i don't know
 

7485
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:08,709
again just i don't know
from my outsider's perspective there's

7486
01:57:08,709 --> 01:57:08,719
from my outsider's perspective there's
 

7487
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:10,629
from my outsider's perspective there's
not many mathematicians

7488
01:57:10,629 --> 01:57:10,639
not many mathematicians
 

7489
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:12,229
not many mathematicians
that stand out throughout the history of

7490
01:57:12,229 --> 01:57:12,239
that stand out throughout the history of
 

7491
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:13,669
that stand out throughout the history of
the 20th century

7492
01:57:13,669 --> 01:57:13,679
the 20th century
 

7493
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:16,310
the 20th century
he's one of them i feel like he's not

7494
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:16,320
he's one of them i feel like he's not
 

7495
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,990
he's one of them i feel like he's not
sufficiently recognized

7496
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:18,000
sufficiently recognized
 

7497
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,950
sufficiently recognized
i think he's pretty recognized okay well

7498
01:57:20,950 --> 01:57:20,960
i think he's pretty recognized okay well
 

7499
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:22,950
i think he's pretty recognized okay well
i mean

7500
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:22,960
i mean
 

7501
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:24,310
i mean
he was a full professor of princeton for

7502
01:57:24,310 --> 01:57:24,320
he was a full professor of princeton for
 

7503
01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:25,430
he was a full professor of princeton for
most of his life he was sort of

7504
01:57:25,430 --> 01:57:25,440
most of his life he was sort of
 

7505
01:57:25,440 --> 01:57:27,030
most of his life he was sort of
certainly at the pinnacle of

7506
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,040
certainly at the pinnacle of
 

7507
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:29,030
certainly at the pinnacle of
yeah but i found myself every time i

7508
01:57:29,030 --> 01:57:29,040
yeah but i found myself every time i
 

7509
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:30,950
yeah but i found myself every time i
talk about conway and how excited

7510
01:57:30,950 --> 01:57:30,960
talk about conway and how excited
 

7511
01:57:30,960 --> 01:57:33,990
talk about conway and how excited
i am about him i have to constantly

7512
01:57:33,990 --> 01:57:34,000
i am about him i have to constantly
 

7513
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:34,709
i am about him i have to constantly
explain to

7514
01:57:34,709 --> 01:57:34,719
explain to
 

7515
01:57:34,719 --> 01:57:37,430
explain to
people who he is and that's that's

7516
01:57:37,430 --> 01:57:37,440
people who he is and that's that's
 

7517
01:57:37,440 --> 01:57:38,070
people who he is and that's that's
always a

7518
01:57:38,070 --> 01:57:38,080
always a
 

7519
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:40,229
always a
sad sign to me but that's probably true

7520
01:57:40,229 --> 01:57:40,239
sad sign to me but that's probably true
 

7521
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:41,430
sad sign to me but that's probably true
for a lot of mathematicians

7522
01:57:41,430 --> 01:57:41,440
for a lot of mathematicians
 

7523
01:57:41,440 --> 01:57:42,950
for a lot of mathematicians
i was about to say like i feel like you

7524
01:57:42,950 --> 01:57:42,960
i was about to say like i feel like you
 

7525
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,470
i was about to say like i feel like you
have a very elevated idea of how famous

7526
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:44,480
have a very elevated idea of how famous
 

7527
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:44,950
have a very elevated idea of how famous
but

7528
01:57:44,950 --> 01:57:44,960
but
 

7529
01:57:44,960 --> 01:57:45,990
but
this is what happens when you grow up in

7530
01:57:45,990 --> 01:57:46,000
this is what happens when you grow up in
 

7531
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:47,030
this is what happens when you grow up in
the soviet union you know you think the

7532
01:57:47,030 --> 01:57:47,040
the soviet union you know you think the
 

7533
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,750
the soviet union you know you think the
mathematicians are like very very famous

7534
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:49,760
mathematicians are like very very famous
 

7535
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:51,990
mathematicians are like very very famous
yeah but i'm not actually so convinced

7536
01:57:51,990 --> 01:57:52,000
yeah but i'm not actually so convinced
 

7537
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,270
yeah but i'm not actually so convinced
at a tiny tangent that

7538
01:57:53,270 --> 01:57:53,280
at a tiny tangent that
 

7539
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:56,550
at a tiny tangent that
that shouldn't be so i mean there's uh

7540
01:57:56,550 --> 01:57:56,560
that shouldn't be so i mean there's uh
 

7541
01:57:56,560 --> 01:57:58,070
that shouldn't be so i mean there's uh
it's not obvious to me that that's one

7542
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,080
it's not obvious to me that that's one
 

7543
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,550
it's not obvious to me that that's one
of the like if if i were to analyze

7544
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:00,560
of the like if if i were to analyze
 

7545
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,229
of the like if if i were to analyze
american society that uh

7546
01:58:02,229 --> 01:58:02,239
american society that uh
 

7547
01:58:02,239 --> 01:58:04,070
american society that uh
perhaps elevating mathematical and

7548
01:58:04,070 --> 01:58:04,080
perhaps elevating mathematical and
 

7549
01:58:04,080 --> 01:58:05,589
perhaps elevating mathematical and
scientific thinking to a little bit

7550
01:58:05,589 --> 01:58:05,599
scientific thinking to a little bit
 

7551
01:58:05,599 --> 01:58:05,990
scientific thinking to a little bit
higher

7552
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:06,000
higher
 

7553
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,030
higher
level would benefit the society well

7554
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,040
level would benefit the society well
 

7555
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:10,709
level would benefit the society well
both in discovering the beauty of what

is such a perfect example of somebody

7566
01:58:20,229 --> 01:58:20,239
is such a perfect example of somebody
 

7567
01:58:20,239 --> 01:58:21,830
is such a perfect example of somebody
whose humanity was

whose humanity was
 

7569
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:23,830
whose humanity was
and his personality was like wound up

7570
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:23,840
and his personality was like wound up
 

7571
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:25,270
and his personality was like wound up
with his mathematics right so it's not

7572
01:58:25,270 --> 01:58:25,280
with his mathematics right so it's not
 

7573
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,629
with his mathematics right so it's not
sometimes i think people

7574
01:58:26,629 --> 01:58:26,639
sometimes i think people
 

7575
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:27,990
sometimes i think people
who are outside the field think of

7576
01:58:27,990 --> 01:58:28,000
who are outside the field think of
 

7577
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:29,910
who are outside the field think of
mathematics as this kind of like

7578
01:58:29,910 --> 01:58:29,920
mathematics as this kind of like
 

7579
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:31,669
mathematics as this kind of like
cold thing that you do separate from

7580
01:58:31,669 --> 01:58:31,679
cold thing that you do separate from
 

7581
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:33,350
cold thing that you do separate from
your existence as a human being no way

7582
01:58:33,350 --> 01:58:33,360
your existence as a human being no way
 

7583
01:58:33,360 --> 01:58:35,189
your existence as a human being no way
your personality is in there just as it

7584
01:58:35,189 --> 01:58:35,199
your personality is in there just as it
 

7585
01:58:35,199 --> 01:58:37,189
your personality is in there just as it
would be in like a novel you wrote or a

7586
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
would be in like a novel you wrote or a
 

7587
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:38,709
would be in like a novel you wrote or a
painting you painted or just like the

7588
01:58:38,709 --> 01:58:38,719
painting you painted or just like the
 

7589
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:40,390

way you walk down the street like it's
 

7591
01:58:40,400 --> 01:58:41,990
way you walk down the street like it's
in there it's you doing it

7592
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:42,000
in there it's you doing it
 

7593
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:43,589
in there it's you doing it
and conway was certainly a singular

7594
01:58:43,589 --> 01:58:43,599
and conway was certainly a singular
 

7595
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:46,070
and conway was certainly a singular
personality um

7596

personality um
 

7597
01:58:46,080 --> 01:58:49,910
personality um
i think anybody would say that

7598
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:49,920
i think anybody would say that
 

7599
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:52,550
i think anybody would say that
he was playful like everything was a

7600
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
he was playful like everything was a
 

7601
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,149
he was playful like everything was a
game to him

7602
01:58:54,149 --> 01:58:54,159
game to him
 

7603
01:58:54,159 --> 01:58:56,229
game to him
now what you might think i'm going to

7604
01:58:56,229 --> 01:58:56,239
now what you might think i'm going to
 

7605
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:57,990
now what you might think i'm going to
say and it's true is that he sort of

7606
01:58:57,990 --> 01:58:58,000
say and it's true is that he sort of
 

7607
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:00,790
say and it's true is that he sort of
was very playful in his way of doing

7608
01:59:00,790 --> 01:59:00,800
was very playful in his way of doing
 

7609
01:59:00,800 --> 01:59:01,669
was very playful in his way of doing
mathematics

7610
01:59:01,669 --> 01:59:01,679
mathematics
 

7611
01:59:01,679 --> 01:59:03,669
mathematics
but it's also true it went both ways he

7612
01:59:03,669 --> 01:59:03,679
but it's also true it went both ways he
 

7613
01:59:03,679 --> 01:59:05,350
but it's also true it went both ways he
also sort of made mathematics

7614
01:59:05,350 --> 01:59:05,360
also sort of made mathematics
 

7615
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:07,109
also sort of made mathematics
out of games he like looked like he was

7616
01:59:07,109 --> 01:59:07,119
out of games he like looked like he was
 

7617
01:59:07,119 --> 01:59:09,030
out of games he like looked like he was
a constant inventor of games with like

7618
01:59:09,030 --> 01:59:09,040
a constant inventor of games with like
 

7619
01:59:09,040 --> 01:59:10,390
a constant inventor of games with like
crazy names and

7620
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:10,400
crazy names and
 

7621
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:11,990
crazy names and
then he would sort of analyze those

7622
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:12,000
then he would sort of analyze those
 

7623
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:15,030
then he would sort of analyze those
games mathematically um

7624
01:59:15,030 --> 01:59:15,040
games mathematically um
 

7625
01:59:15,040 --> 01:59:16,709
games mathematically um
to the point that he and then later

7626
01:59:16,709 --> 01:59:16,719
to the point that he and then later
 

7627
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:18,629
to the point that he and then later
collaborating with knuth like

7628
01:59:18,629 --> 01:59:18,639
collaborating with knuth like
 

7629
01:59:18,639 --> 01:59:20,709
collaborating with knuth like
you know created this number system the

7630
01:59:20,709 --> 01:59:20,719
you know created this number system the
 

7631
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:22,229
you know created this number system the
surreal numbers

7632
01:59:22,229 --> 01:59:22,239
surreal numbers
 

7633
01:59:22,239 --> 01:59:25,030
surreal numbers
in which actually each number is a game

7634
01:59:25,030 --> 01:59:25,040
in which actually each number is a game
 

7635
01:59:25,040 --> 01:59:26,229
in which actually each number is a game
there's a wonderful book about this

7636
01:59:26,229 --> 01:59:26,239
there's a wonderful book about this
 

7637
01:59:26,239 --> 01:59:27,430
there's a wonderful book about this
called i mean there are his own books

7638
01:59:27,430 --> 01:59:27,440
called i mean there are his own books
 

7639
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,470
called i mean there are his own books
and then there's like a book that he

7640
01:59:28,470 --> 01:59:28,480
and then there's like a book that he
 

7641
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:29,910
and then there's like a book that he
wrote with burleigh camping guy called

7642
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:29,920
wrote with burleigh camping guy called
 

7643
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:31,109
wrote with burleigh camping guy called
winning ways

7644
01:59:31,109 --> 01:59:31,119
winning ways
 

7645
01:59:31,119 --> 01:59:35,750
winning ways
which is such a rich source of ideas

7646
01:59:35,750 --> 01:59:35,760
which is such a rich source of ideas
 

7647
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:38,950
which is such a rich source of ideas
um and he

7648
01:59:38,950 --> 01:59:38,960
um and he
 

7649
01:59:38,960 --> 01:59:41,270
um and he
too kind of has his own crazy number

7650
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:41,280
too kind of has his own crazy number
 

7651
01:59:41,280 --> 01:59:42,790
too kind of has his own crazy number
system in which by the way there are

7652
01:59:42,790 --> 01:59:42,800
system in which by the way there are
 

7653
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:43,350
system in which by the way there are
these

7654
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:43,360
these
 

7655
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,030
these
infinitesimals the ghosts of departed

7656
01:59:45,030 --> 01:59:45,040
infinitesimals the ghosts of departed
 

7657
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:46,629
infinitesimals the ghosts of departed
quantities they're in there

7658
01:59:46,629 --> 01:59:46,639
quantities they're in there
 

7659
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,470
quantities they're in there
now not as ghosts but as like certain

7660
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:48,480
now not as ghosts but as like certain
 

7661
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,709
now not as ghosts but as like certain
kind of two-player games

7662
01:59:50,709 --> 01:59:50,719
kind of two-player games
 

7663
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:55,750
kind of two-player games
um so

7664
01:59:55,750 --> 01:59:55,760
um so
 

7665
01:59:55,760 --> 01:59:57,669
um so
you know he was a guy so i knew him when

7666
01:59:57,669 --> 01:59:57,679
you know he was a guy so i knew him when
 

7667
01:59:57,679 --> 01:59:58,950
you know he was a guy so i knew him when
i was a postdoc

7668
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
i was a postdoc
 

7669
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:02,070
i was a postdoc
um and i knew him at princeton and our

7670
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:02,080
um and i knew him at princeton and our
 

7671
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,669
um and i knew him at princeton and our
research overlapped in some ways now it

7672
02:00:03,669 --> 02:00:03,679
research overlapped in some ways now it
 

7673
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:05,109
research overlapped in some ways now it
was on stuff that he had worked on many

7674
02:00:05,109 --> 02:00:05,119
was on stuff that he had worked on many
 

7675
02:00:05,119 --> 02:00:06,629
was on stuff that he had worked on many
years before the stuff i was working on

7676
02:00:06,629 --> 02:00:06,639
years before the stuff i was working on
 

7677
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:07,830
years before the stuff i was working on
kind of connected with stuff in group

7678
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
kind of connected with stuff in group
 

7679
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:08,550
kind of connected with stuff in group
theory which

7680
02:00:08,550 --> 02:00:08,560
theory which
 

7681
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:13,830
theory which
somehow seems to keep coming up um

him a question about something
and just any time you turned him on you

7692
02:00:23,189 --> 02:00:23,199
and just any time you turned him on you

question
 

7697
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:27,270
question
it was just like turning a knob and

7698
02:00:27,270 --> 02:00:27,280
it was just like turning a knob and
 

7699
02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:28,070
it was just like turning a knob and
winding him up

7700
02:00:28,070 --> 02:00:28,080
winding him up
 

7701
02:00:28,080 --> 02:00:30,310
winding him up
and he would just go and you would get a

7702
02:00:30,310 --> 02:00:30,320
and he would just go and you would get a
 

7703
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,629
and he would just go and you would get a
response that was like

7704
02:00:32,629 --> 02:00:32,639
response that was like
 

7705
02:00:32,639 --> 02:00:35,350
response that was like
so rich and went so many places and

7706
02:00:35,350 --> 02:00:35,360
so rich and went so many places and
 

7707
02:00:35,360 --> 02:00:37,189
so rich and went so many places and
taught you so much

the questions
 

7719
02:00:44,719 --> 02:00:47,270
the questions
brilliant curious minds even at that age

7720
02:00:47,270 --> 02:00:47,280
brilliant curious minds even at that age
 

7721
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:48,870
brilliant curious minds even at that age
yeah it was

7722
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880
yeah it was
 

7723
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,229
yeah it was
definitely a huge loss uh but

7724
02:00:52,229 --> 02:00:52,239
definitely a huge loss uh but
 

7725
02:00:52,239 --> 02:00:55,350
definitely a huge loss uh but
on his game of life which was i think he

7726
02:00:55,350 --> 02:00:55,360
on his game of life which was i think he
 

7727
02:00:55,360 --> 02:00:56,790
on his game of life which was i think he
developed in the 70s

7728
02:00:56,790 --> 02:00:56,800
developed in the 70s
 

7729
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:59,189
developed in the 70s
as almost like a side thing a fun little

experience
 

7733
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:04,229
experience
of life is this um it's a very simple

7734
02:01:04,229 --> 02:01:04,239
of life is this um it's a very simple
 

7735
02:01:04,239 --> 02:01:07,669
of life is this um it's a very simple
algorithm it's not really a game per se

7736
02:01:07,669 --> 02:01:07,679
algorithm it's not really a game per se
 

7737
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:08,950
algorithm it's not really a game per se
in the sense of the kinds of games that

7738
02:01:08,950 --> 02:01:08,960
in the sense of the kinds of games that
 

7739
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,310
in the sense of the kinds of games that
he liked whereas people played against

7740
02:01:10,310 --> 02:01:10,320
he liked whereas people played against
 

7741
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:11,510
he liked whereas people played against
each other and

7742
02:01:11,510 --> 02:01:11,520
each other and
 

7743
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,629
each other and
um but

7744
02:01:14,629 --> 02:01:14,639
um but
 

7745
02:01:14,639 --> 02:01:16,470
um but
essentially it's a game that you play

7746
02:01:16,470 --> 02:01:16,480
essentially it's a game that you play
 

7747
02:01:16,480 --> 02:01:18,629
essentially it's a game that you play
with marking

7748
02:01:18,629 --> 02:01:18,639
with marking
 

7749
02:01:18,639 --> 02:01:19,910
with marking
little squares on the sheet of graph

7750
02:01:19,910 --> 02:01:19,920
little squares on the sheet of graph
 

7751
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:21,430
little squares on the sheet of graph
paper and in the 70s i think he was like

7752
02:01:21,430 --> 02:01:21,440
paper and in the 70s i think he was like
 

7753
02:01:21,440 --> 02:01:23,189
paper and in the 70s i think he was like
literally doing it with like a pen

7754
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:23,199
literally doing it with like a pen
 

7755
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:24,629
literally doing it with like a pen
on graph paper you have some

7756
02:01:24,629 --> 02:01:24,639
on graph paper you have some
 

7757
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:26,149
on graph paper you have some
configuration of squares some of the

7758
02:01:26,149 --> 02:01:26,159
configuration of squares some of the
 

7759
02:01:26,159 --> 02:01:27,350
configuration of squares some of the
squares in the graphic

7760
02:01:27,350 --> 02:01:27,360
squares in the graphic
 

7761
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:29,030
squares in the graphic
are filled in some are not and then

7762
02:01:29,030 --> 02:01:29,040
are filled in some are not and then
 

7763
02:01:29,040 --> 02:01:31,189
are filled in some are not and then
there's a rule a single rule

7764
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
there's a rule a single rule
 

7765
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:34,629
there's a rule a single rule
that tells you um at the next stage

7766
02:01:34,629 --> 02:01:34,639
that tells you um at the next stage
 

7767
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:36,870
that tells you um at the next stage
which squares are filled in and which

7768
02:01:36,870 --> 02:01:36,880
which squares are filled in and which
 

7769
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:37,990
which squares are filled in and which
squares are not

7770
02:01:37,990 --> 02:01:38,000
squares are not
 

7771
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:39,589
squares are not
sometimes an empty square gets filled in

7772
02:01:39,589 --> 02:01:39,599
sometimes an empty square gets filled in
 

7773
02:01:39,599 --> 02:01:41,270
sometimes an empty square gets filled in
that's called birth sometimes a

7774
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:41,280
that's called birth sometimes a
 

7775
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:42,870
that's called birth sometimes a
square that's filled in gets erased

7776
02:01:42,870 --> 02:01:42,880
square that's filled in gets erased
 

7777
02:01:42,880 --> 02:01:44,629
square that's filled in gets erased
that's called death and there's rules

7778
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
that's called death and there's rules
 

7779
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:46,390
that's called death and there's rules
for which squares are born which squares

7780
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:46,400
for which squares are born which squares
 

7781
02:01:46,400 --> 02:01:47,189
for which squares are born which squares
die

7782
02:01:47,189 --> 02:01:47,199
die
 

7783
02:01:47,199 --> 02:01:50,790
die
um it's um

7784
02:01:50,790 --> 02:01:50,800
um it's um
 

7785
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:52,390
um it's um
the rule is very simple you can write it

7786
02:01:52,390 --> 02:01:52,400
the rule is very simple you can write it
 

7787
02:01:52,400 --> 02:01:54,709
the rule is very simple you can write it
on one line and then the great miracle

7788
02:01:54,709 --> 02:01:54,719
on one line and then the great miracle
 

7789
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:55,109
on one line and then the great miracle
is

7790
02:01:55,109 --> 02:01:55,119
is
 

7791
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:56,790
is
that you can start from some very

7792
02:01:56,790 --> 02:01:56,800
that you can start from some very
 

7793
02:01:56,800 --> 02:01:58,229
that you can start from some very
innocent looking

7794
02:01:58,229 --> 02:01:58,239
innocent looking
 

7795
02:01:58,239 --> 02:02:01,750
innocent looking
little small set of boxes and

7796
02:02:01,750 --> 02:02:01,760
little small set of boxes and
 

7797
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:03,990
little small set of boxes and
get these results of incredible richness

7798
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
get these results of incredible richness
 

7799
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,109
get these results of incredible richness
and of course nowadays you don't do it

7800
02:02:05,109 --> 02:02:05,119
and of course nowadays you don't do it
 

7801
02:02:05,119 --> 02:02:06,390
and of course nowadays you don't do it
on paper nowadays you're doing a

7802
02:02:06,390 --> 02:02:06,400
on paper nowadays you're doing a
 

7803
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,830
on paper nowadays you're doing a
computer there's actually a great

7804
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:07,840
computer there's actually a great
 

7805

02:02:43,350 --> 02:02:43,360
organisms that spring up
 

7843
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:44,470
organisms that spring up
because there's different kinds of

7844
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:44,480
because there's different kinds of
 

7845
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:46,149
because there's different kinds of
organisms like you can think of them as

7846
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,159
organisms like you can think of them as
 

7847
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:47,830
organisms like you can think of them as
species and they interact with each

7848
02:02:47,830 --> 02:02:47,840
species and they interact with each
 

7849
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:48,550
species and they interact with each
other

7850
02:02:48,550 --> 02:02:48,560
other
 

7851
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:50,629
other
they can uh there's gliders they shoot

7852
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:50,639
they can uh there's gliders they shoot
 

7853
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:51,990
they can uh there's gliders they shoot
different there's like

7854
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,000
different there's like
 

7855
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,629
different there's like
things that can travel around there's

7856
02:02:54,629 --> 02:02:54,639
things that can travel around there's
 

7857
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:55,830
things that can travel around there's
things that can

7858
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:55,840
things that can
 

7859
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,750
things that can
glider guns that can generate those

7860
02:02:57,750 --> 02:02:57,760
glider guns that can generate those
 

7861
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:00,070
glider guns that can generate those
gliders they they're

7862
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:00,080
gliders they they're
 

7863
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:01,910
gliders they they're
you can use the same kind of language as

7864
02:03:01,910 --> 02:03:01,920
you can use the same kind of language as
 

7865
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:03,830
you can use the same kind of language as
you would about describing a biological

7866
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:03,840
you would about describing a biological
 

7867
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:04,470
you would about describing a biological
system

7868
02:03:04,470 --> 02:03:04,480
system
 

7869
02:03:04,480 --> 02:03:06,390
system
so it's a wonderful laboratory and it's

7870
02:03:06,390 --> 02:03:06,400
so it's a wonderful laboratory and it's
 

7871
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,149
so it's a wonderful laboratory and it's
kind of a rebuke to someone who

7872
02:03:08,149 --> 02:03:08,159
kind of a rebuke to someone who
 

7873
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:10,870
kind of a rebuke to someone who
doesn't think that like very very rich

7874
02:03:10,870 --> 02:03:10,880
doesn't think that like very very rich
 

7875
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:12,390
doesn't think that like very very rich
complex structure can

7876
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:12,400
complex structure can
 

7877
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:16,390
complex structure can
come from very simple underlying laws

7878
02:03:16,390 --> 02:03:16,400
come from very simple underlying laws
 

7879
02:03:16,400 --> 02:03:19,589
come from very simple underlying laws
like it definitely can now

7880
02:03:19,589 --> 02:03:19,599
like it definitely can now
 

7881
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:20,950
like it definitely can now
here's what's interesting if you just

7882
02:03:20,950 --> 02:03:20,960
here's what's interesting if you just
 

7883
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:24,470
here's what's interesting if you just
picked like some random rule

7884
02:03:24,470 --> 02:03:24,480
picked like some random rule
 

7885
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,070
picked like some random rule
you wouldn't get interesting complexity

7886
02:03:26,070 --> 02:03:26,080
you wouldn't get interesting complexity
 

7887
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,870
you wouldn't get interesting complexity
i think that's one of the most

7888
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:26,880
i think that's one of the most
 

7889
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:29,350
i think that's one of the most
interesting things of these uh

7890
02:03:29,350 --> 02:03:29,360
interesting things of these uh
 

7891
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:31,270
interesting things of these uh
one of these most interesting features

7892
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:31,280
one of these most interesting features
 

7893
02:03:31,280 --> 02:03:32,629
one of these most interesting features
of this whole subject that the rules

7894
02:03:32,629 --> 02:03:32,639
of this whole subject that the rules
 

7895
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:33,750
of this whole subject that the rules
have to be tuned just

7896
02:03:33,750 --> 02:03:33,760
have to be tuned just
 

7897
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,990
have to be tuned just
right like a sort of typical rule set

7898
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,000
right like a sort of typical rule set
 

7899
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,350
right like a sort of typical rule set
doesn't generate any kind of interesting

7900
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:37,360
doesn't generate any kind of interesting
 

7901
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:38,390
doesn't generate any kind of interesting
behavior

7902
02:03:38,390 --> 02:03:38,400
behavior
 

7903
02:03:38,400 --> 02:03:41,589
behavior
yeah but some do i don't

7904
02:03:41,589 --> 02:03:41,599
yeah but some do i don't
 

7905
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:43,910
yeah but some do i don't
think we have a clear way of

7906
02:03:43,910 --> 02:03:43,920
think we have a clear way of
 

7907
02:03:43,920 --> 02:03:45,189
think we have a clear way of
understanding what's doing which don't i

7908
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:45,199
understanding what's doing which don't i
 

7909
02:03:45,199 --> 02:03:46,229
understanding what's doing which don't i
don't know maybe stephen thinks he does

7910
02:03:46,229 --> 02:03:46,239
don't know maybe stephen thinks he does
 

7911
02:03:46,239 --> 02:03:46,950
don't know maybe stephen thinks he does
i don't know

7912
02:03:46,950 --> 02:03:46,960
i don't know
 

7913
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:48,870
i don't know
but no no it's a giant mystery what

7914
02:03:48,870 --> 02:03:48,880
but no no it's a giant mystery what
 

7915
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:51,189
but no no it's a giant mystery what
stephen what stephen wolfram did

7916
02:03:51,189 --> 02:03:51,199
stephen what stephen wolfram did
 

7917
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:55,030
stephen what stephen wolfram did
is um now there's a whole interesting

7918
02:03:55,030 --> 02:03:55,040
is um now there's a whole interesting
 

7919
02:03:55,040 --> 02:03:56,470
is um now there's a whole interesting
aspect of the fact that he's

7920
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:56,480
aspect of the fact that he's
 

7921
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:57,669
aspect of the fact that he's
a little bit of an outcast in the

7922
02:03:57,669 --> 02:03:57,679
a little bit of an outcast in the
 

7923
02:03:57,679 --> 02:03:59,830
a little bit of an outcast in the
mathematics and physics community

7924
02:03:59,830 --> 02:03:59,840
mathematics and physics community
 

7925
02:03:59,840 --> 02:04:02,470
mathematics and physics community
because he's so focused on a particular

7926
02:04:02,470 --> 02:04:02,480
because he's so focused on a particular
 

7927
02:04:02,480 --> 02:04:03,830
because he's so focused on a particular
his particular work

7928
02:04:03,830 --> 02:04:03,840
his particular work
 

7929
02:04:03,840 --> 02:04:05,990
his particular work
i think if you put ego aside which i

7930
02:04:05,990 --> 02:04:06,000
i think if you put ego aside which i
 

7931
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:07,589
i think if you put ego aside which i
think

7932
02:04:07,589 --> 02:04:07,599
think
 

7933
02:04:07,599 --> 02:04:09,189
think
unfairly some people are not able to

7934
02:04:09,189 --> 02:04:09,199
unfairly some people are not able to
 

7935
02:04:09,199 --> 02:04:10,790
unfairly some people are not able to
look beyond i think his work is actually

7936
02:04:10,790 --> 02:04:10,800
look beyond i think his work is actually
 

7937
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:11,750
look beyond i think his work is actually
quite brilliant

7938
02:04:11,750 --> 02:04:11,760
quite brilliant
 

7939
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:13,750
quite brilliant
but what he did is exactly this process

7940
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:13,760
but what he did is exactly this process
 

7941
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:15,750
but what he did is exactly this process
of darwin-like exploration

7942
02:04:15,750 --> 02:04:15,760
of darwin-like exploration
 

7943
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:18,069
of darwin-like exploration
is taking these very simple ideas and

7944
02:04:18,069 --> 02:04:18,079
is taking these very simple ideas and
 

7945
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:19,830
is taking these very simple ideas and
writing a thousand page book on them

7946
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:19,840
writing a thousand page book on them
 

7947
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,910
writing a thousand page book on them
meaning like let's play around with this

7948
02:04:21,910 --> 02:04:21,920
meaning like let's play around with this
 

7949
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:23,350
meaning like let's play around with this
thing let's see

02:04:23,350 --> 02:04:23,360
thing let's see
 

7951
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:25,910
thing let's see
and can we figure anything out spoiler

7952
02:04:25,910 --> 02:04:25,920

7957
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,830
no we can't in fact he does uh
he does a challenge uh i think it's like

7958
02:04:31,830 --> 02:04:31,840
he does a challenge uh i think it's like
 

7959
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:33,669
he does a challenge uh i think it's like
a rule 30 challenge which is quite

7960
02:04:33,669 --> 02:04:33,679
a rule 30 challenge which is quite
 

7961
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:34,629
a rule 30 challenge which is quite
interesting just

7962
02:04:34,629 --> 02:04:34,639
interesting just
 

7963
02:04:34,639 --> 02:04:37,270
interesting just
simply for machine learning people for

just in the future uh very simple
 

7985
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,229
just in the future uh very simple
just look at one particular part of the

7986
02:04:58,229 --> 02:04:58,239
just look at one particular part of the
 

7987
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:01,589
just look at one particular part of the
world just zooming in on that part

world just zooming in on that part
 

7989
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:03,669
world just zooming in on that part
you know 100 steps ahead can you predict

7990
02:05:03,669 --> 02:05:03,679
you know 100 steps ahead can you predict
 

7991
02:05:03,679 --> 02:05:04,709
you know 100 steps ahead can you predict
something

7992
02:05:04,709 --> 02:05:04,719
something
 

7993
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:07,589
something
and uh the the the challenge is to do

7994
02:05:07,589 --> 02:05:07,599
and uh the the the challenge is to do
 

7995
02:05:07,599 --> 02:05:08,709
and uh the the the challenge is to do
that kind of prediction

7996
02:05:08,709 --> 02:05:08,719
that kind of prediction
 

7997
02:05:08,719 --> 02:05:09,990
that kind of prediction
so far as nobody's come up with an

7998
02:05:09,990 --> 02:05:10,000
so far as nobody's come up with an
 

7999
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,629
so far as nobody's come up with an
answer but the point is like

8000
02:05:12,629 --> 02:05:12,639
answer but the point is like
 

8001
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:15,030
answer but the point is like
we can't we don't have tools or maybe

8002
02:05:15,030 --> 02:05:15,040
we can't we don't have tools or maybe
 

8003
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:16,709
we can't we don't have tools or maybe
it's impossible or

8004
02:05:16,709 --> 02:05:16,719
it's impossible or
 

8005
02:05:16,719 --> 02:05:18,830
it's impossible or
i mean he has these kind of laws of

8006
02:05:18,830 --> 02:05:18,840
i mean he has these kind of laws of
 

8007
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:20,790
i mean he has these kind of laws of
irreducibility they hear firstly but

8008
02:05:20,790 --> 02:05:20,800
irreducibility they hear firstly but
 

8009
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:22,390
irreducibility they hear firstly but
it's poetry it's like we can't prove

8010
02:05:22,390 --> 02:05:22,400
it's poetry it's like we can't prove
 

8011
02:05:22,400 --> 02:05:24,310
it's poetry it's like we can't prove
these things it seems like we can't

8012
02:05:24,310 --> 02:05:24,320
these things it seems like we can't
 

8013
02:05:24,320 --> 02:05:25,669
these things it seems like we can't
that's the basic

8014
02:05:25,669 --> 02:05:25,679
that's the basic
 

8015
02:05:25,679 --> 02:05:27,750
that's the basic
uh it almost sounds like ancient

8016
02:05:27,750 --> 02:05:27,760
uh it almost sounds like ancient
 

8017
02:05:27,760 --> 02:05:29,270
uh it almost sounds like ancient
mathematics or something like that where

8018
02:05:29,270 --> 02:05:29,280
mathematics or something like that where
 

8019
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:29,589
mathematics or something like that where
you

8020
02:05:29,589 --> 02:05:29,599
you
 

8021
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:32,149
you
like the gods will not allow us to

8022
02:05:32,149 --> 02:05:32,159
like the gods will not allow us to
 

8023
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:34,310
like the gods will not allow us to
predict the cellular automata

8024
02:05:34,310 --> 02:05:34,320
predict the cellular automata
 

8025
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:37,669
predict the cellular automata
but uh that's fascinating that we can't

8026
02:05:37,669 --> 02:05:37,679
but uh that's fascinating that we can't
 

8027
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,669
but uh that's fascinating that we can't
i'm not sure what to make of it and

8028
02:05:39,669 --> 02:05:39,679
i'm not sure what to make of it and
 

8029
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:41,350
i'm not sure what to make of it and
there is power to calling this

8030
02:05:41,350 --> 02:05:41,360
there is power to calling this
 

8031
02:05:41,360 --> 02:05:42,229
there is power to calling this

8036
02:05:48,390 --> 02:05:48,400
because not actually exactly sure but i
 

8037
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,990

think he had a sense that there's

8038
02:05:49,990 --> 02:05:50,000
think he had a sense that there's
 

8039
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:51,669
think he had a sense that there's
some core ideas here that are

02:05:51,669 --> 02:05:51,679
some core ideas here that are
 

8041
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:53,189
some core ideas here that are
fundamental

02:05:53,189 --> 02:05:53,199
fundamental

8046
02:05:59,189 --> 02:05:59,199
life emerged on earth

i'm not sure i think conway thought that

8048
02:06:01,589 --> 02:06:01,599
i'm not sure i think conway thought that
 

8049
02:06:01,599 --> 02:06:02,950
i'm not sure i think conway thought that
it's something that i mean conway always

8050
02:06:02,950 --> 02:06:02,960
it's something that i mean conway always
 

8051
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,390
it's something that i mean conway always
had a rather ambivalent

8052
02:06:04,390 --> 02:06:04,400
had a rather ambivalent
 

8053
02:06:04,400 --> 02:06:05,830
had a rather ambivalent
relationship with the game of life

8054
02:06:05,830 --> 02:06:05,840
relationship with the game of life
 

8055
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:08,629
relationship with the game of life
because i think he

8056
02:06:08,629 --> 02:06:08,639
because i think he
 

8057
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:11,910
because i think he
saw it as it was certainly the thing he

8058
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:11,920
saw it as it was certainly the thing he
 

8059
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:14,550
saw it as it was certainly the thing he
was most famous for in the outside world

8060
02:06:14,550 --> 02:06:14,560
was most famous for in the outside world
 

8061
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:17,270
was most famous for in the outside world
and i think that he his view which is

8062
02:06:17,270 --> 02:06:17,280
and i think that he his view which is
 

8063
02:06:17,280 --> 02:06:18,550
and i think that he his view which is
correct

8064
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:18,560
correct
 

8065
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:19,750
correct
is that he had done things that were

8066
02:06:19,750 --> 02:06:19,760
is that he had done things that were
 

8067
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:21,430
is that he had done things that were
much deeper mathematically than that you

8068
02:06:21,430 --> 02:06:21,440
much deeper mathematically than that you
 

8069
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:21,990
much deeper mathematically than that you
know

8070
02:06:21,990 --> 02:06:22,000
know
 

8071
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:23,830
know
and i think it always like grieved him a

8072
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:23,840
and i think it always like grieved him a
 

8073
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,510
and i think it always like grieved him a
bit that he was like the game of life

8074
02:06:25,510 --> 02:06:25,520
bit that he was like the game of life
 

8075
02:06:25,520 --> 02:06:26,149
bit that he was like the game of life
guy

8076
02:06:26,149 --> 02:06:26,159
guy
 

8077
02:06:26,159 --> 02:06:27,589
guy
when you know he proved all these

8078
02:06:27,589 --> 02:06:27,599
when you know he proved all these
 

8079
02:06:27,599 --> 02:06:30,390
when you know he proved all these
wonderful theorems and like did i mean

8080
02:06:30,390 --> 02:06:30,400
wonderful theorems and like did i mean
 

8081
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:31,990
wonderful theorems and like did i mean
created all these wonderful games like

8082
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:32,000
created all these wonderful games like
 

8083
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,510
created all these wonderful games like
created the serial numbers like i mean

8084
02:06:33,510 --> 02:06:33,520
created the serial numbers like i mean
 

8085
02:06:33,520 --> 02:06:35,030
created the serial numbers like i mean
he did i mean

8086
02:06:35,030 --> 02:06:35,040
he did i mean
 

8087
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,950
he did i mean
he was a very tireless guy who like just

8088
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:36,960
he was a very tireless guy who like just
 

8089
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:38,390
he was a very tireless guy who like just
like did like an incredibly

8090
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:38,400
like did like an incredibly
 

8091
02:06:38,400 --> 02:06:41,189
like did like an incredibly
variegated array of stuff so he was

8092
02:06:41,189 --> 02:06:41,199
variegated array of stuff so he was
 

8093
02:06:41,199 --> 02:06:43,270
variegated array of stuff so he was
exactly the kind of person who

8094
02:06:43,270 --> 02:06:43,280
exactly the kind of person who
 

8095
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:44,629
exactly the kind of person who
you would never want to like reduce to

8096
02:06:44,629 --> 02:06:44,639
you would never want to like reduce to
 

8097
02:06:44,639 --> 02:06:45,830
you would never want to like reduce to
like one achievement you know what i

8098
02:06:45,830 --> 02:06:45,840
like one achievement you know what i
 

8099
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:46,709
like one achievement you know what i
mean

8100
02:06:46,709 --> 02:06:46,719
mean
 

8101
02:06:46,719 --> 02:06:50,229
mean
let me ask about group theory

8102
02:06:50,229 --> 02:06:50,239
let me ask about group theory
 

8103
02:06:50,239 --> 02:06:52,310
let me ask about group theory
you mentioned a few times what is group

8104
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:52,320
you mentioned a few times what is group
 

8105
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:53,350
you mentioned a few times what is group
theory

8106
02:06:53,350 --> 02:06:53,360
theory
 

8107
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,310
theory
what is an idea from group theory that

8108
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
what is an idea from group theory that
 

8109
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,470
what is an idea from group theory that
you find beautiful

8110
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
you find beautiful
 

8111
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:00,709
you find beautiful
well so i would say group theory sort of

8112
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719
well so i would say group theory sort of
 

8113
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:01,830
well so i would say group theory sort of
starts

8114
02:07:01,830 --> 02:07:01,840
starts
 

8115
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:04,550
starts
as the general theory of symmetry is

8116
02:07:04,550 --> 02:07:04,560
as the general theory of symmetry is
 

8117
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:05,189
as the general theory of symmetry is
that

8118
02:07:05,189 --> 02:07:05,199
that
 

8119
02:07:05,199 --> 02:07:07,109
that
you know people looked at different

8120
02:07:07,109 --> 02:07:07,119
you know people looked at different
 

8121
02:07:07,119 --> 02:07:09,910
you know people looked at different
kinds of things and said like

8122
02:07:09,910 --> 02:07:09,920
kinds of things and said like
 

8123
02:07:09,920 --> 02:07:13,270
kinds of things and said like
as we said like oh it could have maybe

8124
02:07:13,270 --> 02:07:13,280
as we said like oh it could have maybe
 

8125
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,589
as we said like oh it could have maybe
all there is is the symmetry from left

8126
02:07:15,589 --> 02:07:15,599
all there is is the symmetry from left
 

8127
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:17,589
all there is is the symmetry from left
to right like a human being right or

8128
02:07:17,589 --> 02:07:17,599
to right like a human being right or
 

8129
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:19,669
to right like a human being right or
that's roughly bilateral bilaterally

8130
02:07:19,669 --> 02:07:19,679
that's roughly bilateral bilaterally
 

8131
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:21,189
that's roughly bilateral bilaterally
symmetric as we say

8132
02:07:21,189 --> 02:07:21,199
symmetric as we say
 

8133
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:23,830
symmetric as we say
so um so there's two symmetries and then

8134
02:07:23,830 --> 02:07:23,840
so um so there's two symmetries and then
 

8135
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:24,790
so um so there's two symmetries and then
you're like well wait didn't i say

8136
02:07:24,790 --> 02:07:24,800
you're like well wait didn't i say
 

8137
02:07:24,800 --> 02:07:25,990
you're like well wait didn't i say
there's just one there's just left

8138
02:07:25,990 --> 02:07:26,000
there's just one there's just left
 

8139
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:28,310
there's just one there's just left
to right well we always count the

8140
02:07:28,310 --> 02:07:28,320
to right well we always count the
 

8141
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,910
to right well we always count the
symmetry of doing nothing

8142
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:29,920
symmetry of doing nothing
 

8143
02:07:29,920 --> 02:07:31,669
symmetry of doing nothing
we always count the symmetry that's like

8144
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:31,679
we always count the symmetry that's like
 

8145
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:33,189
we always count the symmetry that's like
there's flip and don't flip those are

8146
02:07:33,189 --> 02:07:33,199
there's flip and don't flip those are
 

8147
02:07:33,199 --> 02:07:34,950
there's flip and don't flip those are
the two configurations that you can be

8148
02:07:34,950 --> 02:07:34,960
the two configurations that you can be
 

8149
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:36,229
the two configurations that you can be
in so there's two

8150
02:07:36,229 --> 02:07:36,239
in so there's two
 

8151
02:07:36,239 --> 02:07:40,149
in so there's two
um you know something like a rectangle

8152
02:07:40,149 --> 02:07:40,159
um you know something like a rectangle
 

8153
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:41,910
um you know something like a rectangle
is bilaterally symmetric you can flip it

8154
02:07:41,910 --> 02:07:41,920
is bilaterally symmetric you can flip it
 

8155
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:43,350
is bilaterally symmetric you can flip it
left to right but you can also flip it

8156
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:43,360
left to right but you can also flip it
 

8157
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:45,669
left to right but you can also flip it
top to bottom

8158
02:07:45,669 --> 02:07:45,679
top to bottom
 

8159
02:07:45,679 --> 02:07:47,510
top to bottom
so there's actually four symmetries

8160
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
so there's actually four symmetries
 

8161
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:48,790
so there's actually four symmetries
there's do nothing

8162
02:07:48,790 --> 02:07:48,800
there's do nothing
 

8163
02:07:48,800 --> 02:07:50,870
there's do nothing
flip it left to right and flip it top to

8164
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
flip it left to right and flip it top to
 

8165
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,430
flip it left to right and flip it top to
bottom or do both of those things

8166
02:07:53,430 --> 02:07:53,440
bottom or do both of those things
 

8167
02:07:53,440 --> 02:07:57,350
bottom or do both of those things
um a square

8168
02:07:57,350 --> 02:07:57,360
um a square
 

8169
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:00,390
um a square
um there's even more because now you can

8170
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:00,400
um there's even more because now you can
 

8171
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:01,510
um there's even more because now you can
rotate it

8172
02:08:01,510 --> 02:08:01,520
rotate it
 

8173
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:03,109
rotate it
you can rotate it by 90 degrees so you

8174
02:08:03,109 --> 02:08:03,119
you can rotate it by 90 degrees so you
 

8175
02:08:03,119 --> 02:08:04,310
you can rotate it by 90 degrees so you
can't do that that's not a symmetry of

8176
02:08:04,310 --> 02:08:04,320
can't do that that's not a symmetry of
 

8177
02:08:04,320 --> 02:08:05,750
can't do that that's not a symmetry of
the rectangle if you try to rotate it 90

8178
02:08:05,750 --> 02:08:05,760
the rectangle if you try to rotate it 90
 

8179
02:08:05,760 --> 02:08:07,350
the rectangle if you try to rotate it 90
degrees you get a rectangle oriented in

8180
02:08:07,350 --> 02:08:07,360
degrees you get a rectangle oriented in
 

8181
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:08,790
degrees you get a rectangle oriented in
a different way

8182
02:08:08,790 --> 02:08:08,800
a different way
 

8183
02:08:08,800 --> 02:08:11,830
a different way
so um a person has two symmetries a

8184
02:08:11,830 --> 02:08:11,840
so um a person has two symmetries a
 

8185
02:08:11,840 --> 02:08:13,030
so um a person has two symmetries a
rectangle four

8186
02:08:13,030 --> 02:08:13,040
rectangle four
 

8187
02:08:13,040 --> 02:08:15,270
rectangle four
a square eight different kinds of shapes

8188
02:08:15,270 --> 02:08:15,280
a square eight different kinds of shapes
 

8189
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:17,589
a square eight different kinds of shapes
have different numbers of symmetries

8190
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
have different numbers of symmetries
 

8191
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:19,830
have different numbers of symmetries
um and the real observation is that

8192
02:08:19,830 --> 02:08:19,840
um and the real observation is that
 

8193
02:08:19,840 --> 02:08:23,750
um and the real observation is that
that's just not like a set of things

8194
02:08:23,750 --> 02:08:23,760
that's just not like a set of things
 

8195
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:25,910
that's just not like a set of things
they can be combined you do one symmetry

8196
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:25,920
they can be combined you do one symmetry
 

8197
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,510
they can be combined you do one symmetry
then you do another

8198
02:08:27,510 --> 02:08:27,520
then you do another
 

8199
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:29,990
then you do another
the result of that is some third

8200
02:08:29,990 --> 02:08:30,000
the result of that is some third
 

8201
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:30,950
the result of that is some third
symmetry

8202
02:08:30,950 --> 02:08:30,960
symmetry
 

8203
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,750
symmetry
so a group really abstracts away this

8204
02:08:33,750 --> 02:08:33,760
so a group really abstracts away this
 

8205
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:35,430
so a group really abstracts away this
notion of saying

8206
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:35,440
notion of saying
 

8207
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:38,709
notion of saying
um

8208
02:08:38,709 --> 02:08:38,719

 

8209
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:40,310

it's just some collection of

8210
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,320
it's just some collection of
 

8211
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:41,910
it's just some collection of
transformations you can do to a thing

8212
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:41,920
transformations you can do to a thing
 

8213
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,390
transformations you can do to a thing
where you

8214
02:08:42,390 --> 02:08:42,400
where you
 

8215
02:08:42,400 --> 02:08:44,310
where you
combine any two of them to get a third

8216
02:08:44,310 --> 02:08:44,320
combine any two of them to get a third
 

8217
02:08:44,320 --> 02:08:45,430
combine any two of them to get a third
so you know a place where this comes up

8218
02:08:45,430 --> 02:08:45,440
so you know a place where this comes up
 

8219
02:08:45,440 --> 02:08:47,270
so you know a place where this comes up
in computer sciences and

8220
02:08:47,270 --> 02:08:47,280
in computer sciences and
 

8221
02:08:47,280 --> 02:08:48,790
in computer sciences and
is in sorting because the ways of

02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:48,800
is in sorting because the ways of
 

8223
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,310
is in sorting because the ways of
permuting a set

8224
02:08:50,310 --> 02:08:50,320
permuting a set
 

8225
02:08:50,320 --> 02:08:52,069

02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
the ways of taking sort of some set of
 

8227
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,030
the ways of taking sort of some set of
things you have on the table and putting

8228
02:08:53,030 --> 02:08:53,040
things you have on the table and putting
 

8229
02:08:53,040 --> 02:08:54,149
things you have on the table and putting
them in a different order

shuffling a deck of cards for instance

8232
02:08:55,990 --> 02:08:56,000
shuffling a deck of cards for instance
 

8233
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:57,510
shuffling a deck of cards for instance
those are the symmetries of the deck and

8234
02:08:57,510 --> 02:08:57,520
those are the symmetries of the deck and
 

8235
02:08:57,520 --> 02:08:58,790
those are the symmetries of the deck and
there's a lot of them there's not two

8236
02:08:58,790 --> 02:08:58,800
there's a lot of them there's not two
 

8237
02:08:58,800 --> 02:09:00,149
there's a lot of them there's not two
there's not four there's not eight think

8238
02:09:00,149 --> 02:09:00,159
there's not four there's not eight think
 

8239
02:09:00,159 --> 02:09:01,750
there's not four there's not eight think
about how many different orders the deck

about how many different orders the deck
 

8241
02:09:01,760 --> 02:09:04,069
about how many different orders the deck
of card can be in each one of those is

8242
02:09:04,069 --> 02:09:04,079
of card can be in each one of those is
 

8243
02:09:04,079 --> 02:09:06,310
of card can be in each one of those is
the result of applying a symmetry

8244
02:09:06,310 --> 02:09:06,320
the result of applying a symmetry
 

8245
02:09:06,320 --> 02:09:08,229
the result of applying a symmetry
uh to the original deck so a shuffle is

8246
02:09:08,229 --> 02:09:08,239
uh to the original deck so a shuffle is
 

8247
02:09:08,239 --> 02:09:09,669
uh to the original deck so a shuffle is
a symmetry right you're reordering the

8248
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
a symmetry right you're reordering the
 

8249
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:10,470
a symmetry right you're reordering the
cards

cards
 

8251
02:09:10,480 --> 02:09:12,950
cards
if if i shuffle and then you shuffle the

8252
02:09:12,950 --> 02:09:12,960
if if i shuffle and then you shuffle the
 

8253
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,510
if if i shuffle and then you shuffle the

result
 

8255
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:16,149
result
is some other kind of thing you might

8256
02:09:16,149 --> 02:09:16,159
is some other kind of thing you might
 

8257
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:16,870
is some other kind of thing you might
call it duffel

8258
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:16,880
call it duffel
 

8259
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:18,229
call it duffel
a double shuffle which is a more

8260
02:09:18,229 --> 02:09:18,239
a double shuffle which is a more
 

8261
02:09:18,239 --> 02:09:20,790
a double shuffle which is a more
complicated symmetry so group theory is

8262
02:09:20,790 --> 02:09:20,800
complicated symmetry so group theory is
 

8263
02:09:20,800 --> 02:09:21,510
complicated symmetry so group theory is
kind of

8264
02:09:21,510 --> 02:09:21,520
kind of

02:09:27,189 --> 02:09:27,199
all these kinds of things but then of
 

8271
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:29,510
all these kinds of things but then of
course like lots of things that are way

more complicated than that

8274
02:09:31,589 --> 02:09:31,599
more complicated than that
 

8275
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:33,109
more complicated than that
like infinite groups of symmetries for

02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:45,350
okay i can
reflect it left to right you know around

8286
02:09:45,350 --> 02:09:45,360
reflect it left to right you know around
 

8287

the origin
 

8289
02:09:46,719 --> 02:09:48,390
the origin
okay but i could also reflect it left to

8290
02:09:48,390 --> 02:09:48,400
okay but i could also reflect it left to
 

8291
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:50,149
okay but i could also reflect it left to
right grabbing

8292
02:09:50,149 --> 02:09:50,159
right grabbing
 

8293
02:09:50,159 --> 02:09:53,109
right grabbing
somewhere else like at one or two or pi

8294
02:09:53,109 --> 02:09:53,119
somewhere else like at one or two or pi
 

8295
02:09:53,119 --> 02:09:54,470

02:09:54,470 --> 02:09:54,480
or anywhere
 

8297
02:09:54,480 --> 02:09:56,310
or anywhere
or i could just slide it some distance

8298
02:09:56,310 --> 02:09:56,320
or i could just slide it some distance
 

8299
02:09:56,320 --> 02:09:58,229
or i could just slide it some distance
that's a symmetry slide it five units

8300

that's a symmetry slide it five units
 

8301
02:09:58,239 --> 02:09:59,750
that's a symmetry slide it five units
over so there's clearly infinitely many

02:10:19,360 --> 02:10:20,470
heck it is is that something that comes
up

8326
02:10:20,470 --> 02:10:20,480
up
 

8327
02:10:20,480 --> 02:10:22,149
up
on your mind at all well i'm not a

8328
02:10:22,149 --> 02:10:22,159
on your mind at all well i'm not a
 

8329
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:23,910
on your mind at all well i'm not a
mathematical physicist but i can say

8330
02:10:23,910 --> 02:10:23,920
mathematical physicist but i can say
 

8331
02:10:23,920 --> 02:10:24,310
mathematical physicist but i can say
this

8332
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:24,320
this
 

8333
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:27,589
this
it is certainly true that has been a

8334
02:10:27,589 --> 02:10:27,599
it is certainly true that has been a
 

8335
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:28,229
it is certainly true that has been a
very

8336
02:10:28,229 --> 02:10:28,239
very
 

8337
02:10:28,239 --> 02:10:31,030
very
useful notion in physics to try to say

8338
02:10:31,030 --> 02:10:31,040
useful notion in physics to try to say
 

8339
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,990
useful notion in physics to try to say
like

8340
02:10:31,990 --> 02:10:32,000
like
 

8341
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,990
like
what are the symmetry groups like of the

8342
02:10:33,990 --> 02:10:34,000
what are the symmetry groups like of the
 

8343
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:35,830
what are the symmetry groups like of the
world like what are the symmetries under

8344
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:35,840
world like what are the symmetries under
 

8345
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,189
world like what are the symmetries under
which things don't change right so

8346
02:10:37,189 --> 02:10:37,199
which things don't change right so
 

8347
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:38,790
which things don't change right so
we just i think we talked a little bit

8348
02:10:38,790 --> 02:10:38,800
we just i think we talked a little bit
 

8349
02:10:38,800 --> 02:10:40,310
we just i think we talked a little bit
earlier about it should be a basic

8350
02:10:40,310 --> 02:10:40,320
earlier about it should be a basic
 

8351
02:10:40,320 --> 02:10:41,589
earlier about it should be a basic
principle that a theorem that's true

8352
02:10:41,589 --> 02:10:41,599
principle that a theorem that's true
 

8353
02:10:41,599 --> 02:10:42,470
principle that a theorem that's true
here

8354
02:10:42,470 --> 02:10:42,480
here
 

8355
02:10:42,480 --> 02:10:44,629
here
is also true over there yes and same for

8356
02:10:44,629 --> 02:10:44,639
is also true over there yes and same for
 

8357
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:46,229
is also true over there yes and same for
a physical law right i mean

8358
02:10:46,229 --> 02:10:46,239
a physical law right i mean
 

8359
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:47,589
a physical law right i mean
if gravity is like this over here it

8360
02:10:47,589 --> 02:10:47,599
if gravity is like this over here it
 

8361
02:10:47,599 --> 02:10:49,510
if gravity is like this over here it
should also be like this over there okay

8362
02:10:49,510 --> 02:10:49,520
should also be like this over there okay
 

8363
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:50,709
should also be like this over there okay
what that's saying is we think

8364
02:10:50,709 --> 02:10:50,719
what that's saying is we think
 

8365
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:52,550
what that's saying is we think
translation in space

8366
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:52,560
translation in space
 

8367
02:10:52,560 --> 02:10:54,550
translation in space
should be a symmetry all the laws of

8368
02:10:54,550 --> 02:10:54,560
should be a symmetry all the laws of
 

8369
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:56,390
should be a symmetry all the laws of
physics should be unchanged

8370
02:10:56,390 --> 02:10:56,400
physics should be unchanged
 

8371
02:10:56,400 --> 02:10:57,910
physics should be unchanged
if the symmetry we have in mind is a

8372
02:10:57,910 --> 02:10:57,920
if the symmetry we have in mind is a
 

8373
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,589
if the symmetry we have in mind is a
very simple one like translation

8374
02:10:59,589 --> 02:10:59,599
very simple one like translation
 

8375
02:10:59,599 --> 02:11:03,669
very simple one like translation
and so then um there becomes a question

8376
02:11:03,669 --> 02:11:03,679
and so then um there becomes a question
 

8377
02:11:03,679 --> 02:11:05,910
and so then um there becomes a question
like what are the symmetries

8378
02:11:05,910 --> 02:11:05,920
like what are the symmetries
 

8379
02:11:05,920 --> 02:11:08,790
like what are the symmetries
of the actual world with its physical

8380
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:08,800
of the actual world with its physical
 

8381
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:09,669
of the actual world with its physical
laws

8382
02:11:09,669 --> 02:11:09,679
laws
 

8383
02:11:09,679 --> 02:11:11,910
laws
and one way of thinking isn't

8384
02:11:11,910 --> 02:11:11,920
and one way of thinking isn't
 

8385
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:13,990
and one way of thinking isn't
oversimplification but like one way of

8386
02:11:13,990 --> 02:11:14,000
oversimplification but like one way of
 

8387
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:15,430
oversimplification but like one way of
thinking of this big

8388
02:11:15,430 --> 02:11:15,440
thinking of this big
 

8389
02:11:15,440 --> 02:11:19,750
thinking of this big
um shift from

8390
02:11:19,750 --> 02:11:19,760
um shift from
 

8391
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:23,270
um shift from
uh before einstein to after is that we

8392
02:11:23,270 --> 02:11:23,280
uh before einstein to after is that we
 

8393
02:11:23,280 --> 02:11:25,589
uh before einstein to after is that we
just changed our idea about what the

8394
02:11:25,589 --> 02:11:25,599
just changed our idea about what the
 

8395
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:27,270
just changed our idea about what the
fundamental group of

8396
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:27,280
fundamental group of
 

8397
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:30,709
fundamental group of
symmetries were so that things like the

8398
02:11:30,709 --> 02:11:30,719
symmetries were so that things like the
 

8399
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:32,229
symmetries were so that things like the
lorenz contraction things like these

8400
02:11:32,229 --> 02:11:32,239
lorenz contraction things like these
 

8401
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:33,030
lorenz contraction things like these
bizarre

8402
02:11:33,030 --> 02:11:33,040
bizarre
 

8403
02:11:33,040 --> 02:11:35,189
bizarre
relativistic phenomena or lorenz would

8404
02:11:35,189 --> 02:11:35,199
relativistic phenomena or lorenz would
 

8405
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:36,550
relativistic phenomena or lorenz would
have said

8406
02:11:36,550 --> 02:11:36,560
have said
 

8407
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:39,669
have said
oh to make this work we need a thing to

8408
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
oh to make this work we need a thing to
 

8409
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:41,669
oh to make this work we need a thing to
um

8410
02:11:41,669 --> 02:11:41,679
um
 

8411
02:11:41,679 --> 02:11:46,069
um
to change its shape if it's moving

8412
02:11:46,069 --> 02:11:46,079
to change its shape if it's moving
 

8413
02:11:46,079 --> 02:11:47,510
to change its shape if it's moving
yeah nearly the speed of light well

8414
02:11:47,510 --> 02:11:47,520
yeah nearly the speed of light well
 

8415
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:49,589
yeah nearly the speed of light well
under the new frame of framework

8416
02:11:49,589 --> 02:11:49,599
under the new frame of framework
 

8417
02:11:49,599 --> 02:11:50,709
under the new frame of framework
it's much better you feel like oh no it

8418
02:11:50,709 --> 02:11:50,719
it's much better you feel like oh no it
 

8419
02:11:50,719 --> 02:11:52,069
it's much better you feel like oh no it
wasn't changing its jeep you were just

8420
02:11:52,069 --> 02:11:52,079
wasn't changing its jeep you were just
 

8421
02:11:52,079 --> 02:11:54,310
wasn't changing its jeep you were just
wrong about what counted as a symmetry

8422
02:11:54,310 --> 02:11:54,320
wrong about what counted as a symmetry
 

8423
02:11:54,320 --> 02:11:55,350
wrong about what counted as a symmetry
now that we have this new group the

8424
02:11:55,350 --> 02:11:55,360
now that we have this new group the
 

8425
02:11:55,360 --> 02:11:57,589
now that we have this new group the
so-called lorenz group now that we

8426
02:11:57,589 --> 02:11:57,599
so-called lorenz group now that we
 

8427
02:11:57,599 --> 02:11:58,790
so-called lorenz group now that we
understand what the symmetries really

8428
02:11:58,790 --> 02:11:58,800
understand what the symmetries really
 

8429
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:00,310
understand what the symmetries really
are we see it was just an illusion that

8430
02:12:00,310 --> 02:12:00,320
are we see it was just an illusion that
 

8431
02:12:00,320 --> 02:12:02,790
are we see it was just an illusion that
the the thing was changing its shape

8432
02:12:02,790 --> 02:12:02,800
the the thing was changing its shape
 

8433
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:04,310
the the thing was changing its shape
yeah so you can then describe the

8434
02:12:04,310 --> 02:12:04,320
yeah so you can then describe the
 

8435
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:05,990
yeah so you can then describe the
sameness of things under

8436
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,000
sameness of things under
 

8437
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,830
sameness of things under
this weirdness that exactly that is

8438
02:12:07,830 --> 02:12:07,840
this weirdness that exactly that is
 

8439
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:10,870
this weirdness that exactly that is
general relativity for example

8440
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:10,880
general relativity for example
 

8441
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,229
general relativity for example
yeah yeah still um

8442
02:12:14,229 --> 02:12:14,239
yeah yeah still um
 

8443
02:12:14,239 --> 02:12:15,910
yeah yeah still um
i wish there was a simpler explanation

8444
02:12:15,910 --> 02:12:15,920
i wish there was a simpler explanation
 

8445
02:12:15,920 --> 02:12:17,270
i wish there was a simpler explanation
of like exactly i mean

8446
02:12:17,270 --> 02:12:17,280
of like exactly i mean
 

8447
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:19,990
of like exactly i mean
get you know gauge symmetry is a pretty

8448
02:12:19,990 --> 02:12:20,000
get you know gauge symmetry is a pretty
 

8449
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:20,709
get you know gauge symmetry is a pretty
simple

8450
02:12:20,709 --> 02:12:20,719
simple
 

8451
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:23,430
simple
general concept about rulers being

02:12:30,069 --> 02:12:30,079
personally been
 

8459
02:12:30,079 --> 02:12:33,510
personally been
on a search not a very uh rigorous

8460
02:12:33,510 --> 02:12:33,520
on a search not a very uh rigorous
 

8461
02:12:33,520 --> 02:12:36,629
on a search not a very uh rigorous
or aggressive search but for uh

8462
02:12:36,629 --> 02:12:36,639
or aggressive search but for uh
 

8463
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:38,310
or aggressive search but for uh
something i personally enjoy which is

8464
02:12:38,310 --> 02:12:38,320
something i personally enjoy which is
 

8465
02:12:38,320 --> 02:12:40,069
something i personally enjoy which is
taking complicated

8466
02:12:40,069 --> 02:12:40,079
taking complicated
 

8467
02:12:40,079 --> 02:12:43,109
taking complicated
concepts and finding the sort of minimal

example

8470
02:12:44,629 --> 02:12:44,639
example
 

8471
02:12:44,639 --> 02:12:46,550
example
that i can play around with especially

8472
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:46,560
that i can play around with especially
 

8473
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:48,069
that i can play around with especially
programmatically that's great i mean

8474
02:12:48,069 --> 02:12:48,079
programmatically that's great i mean
 

8475
02:12:48,079 --> 02:12:49,350
programmatically that's great i mean
that this is what we try to train our

8476
02:12:49,350 --> 02:12:49,360
that this is what we try to train our
 

8477
02:12:49,360 --> 02:12:50,790
that this is what we try to train our
students to do right i mean in class

8478
02:12:50,790 --> 02:12:50,800
students to do right i mean in class
 

8479
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:52,470
students to do right i mean in class
this is exactly what

8480
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:52,480
this is exactly what
 

8481
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,629
this is exactly what
this is like best pedagogical practice i

8482
02:12:54,629 --> 02:12:54,639
this is like best pedagogical practice i
 

8483
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:55,510
this is like best pedagogical practice i
do

8484
02:12:55,510 --> 02:12:55,520
do
 

8485
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:57,189
do
hope there's simple explanation

8486
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
hope there's simple explanation
 

8487
02:12:57,199 --> 02:12:58,870
hope there's simple explanation

topology

8498
02:13:10,149 --> 02:13:10,159
topology
 

8499
02:13:10,159 --> 02:13:12,069

and like quickly like you know when you

8500
02:13:12,069 --> 02:13:12,079
and like quickly like you know when you
 

8501
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:13,750
and like quickly like you know when you
like go to a party and you realize this

8502
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:13,760
like go to a party and you realize this
 

8503
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,950
like go to a party and you realize this
is not the right

8504
02:13:14,950 --> 02:13:14,960
is not the right
 

8505
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:18,149
is not the right
party for me so whenever i go into

8506
02:13:18,149 --> 02:13:18,159
party for me so whenever i go into
 

8507
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:19,109
party for me so whenever i go into
topology it's like

8508
02:13:19,109 --> 02:13:19,119
topology it's like
 

8509
02:13:19,119 --> 02:13:22,629
topology it's like
so much math everywhere i don't even

8510
02:13:22,629 --> 02:13:22,639
so much math everywhere i don't even
 

8511
02:13:22,639 --> 02:13:24,310
so much math everywhere i don't even
know what it feels like

8512
02:13:24,310 --> 02:13:24,320
know what it feels like
 

8513
02:13:24,320 --> 02:13:26,470
know what it feels like
this is me like being a hater is i think

8514
02:13:26,470 --> 02:13:26,480
this is me like being a hater is i think
 

8515
02:13:26,480 --> 02:13:27,910
this is me like being a hater is i think
there's way too much math like

8516
02:13:27,910 --> 02:13:27,920
there's way too much math like
 

8517
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:29,990
there's way too much math like
they're two the cool kids who just want

8518
02:13:29,990 --> 02:13:30,000
they're two the cool kids who just want
 

8519
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,069
they're two the cool kids who just want
to have like everything is expressed

8520
02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:32,079
to have like everything is expressed
 

8521
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:33,109
to have like everything is expressed
through math

8522
02:13:33,109 --> 02:13:33,119
through math
 

8523
02:13:33,119 --> 02:13:34,390
through math
because they're actually afraid to

8524
02:13:34,390 --> 02:13:34,400
because they're actually afraid to
 

8525
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,709
because they're actually afraid to
express stuff simply through language

8526
02:13:36,709 --> 02:13:36,719
express stuff simply through language
 

8527
02:13:36,719 --> 02:13:38,550
express stuff simply through language
that's that's my hater formulation of

8528
02:13:38,550 --> 02:13:38,560
that's that's my hater formulation of
 

8529
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:40,550
that's that's my hater formulation of
topology but at the same time i'm sure

8530
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:40,560
topology but at the same time i'm sure
 

8531
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:42,149
topology but at the same time i'm sure
that's very necessary to do sort of

8532
02:13:42,149 --> 02:13:42,159
that's very necessary to do sort of
 

8533
02:13:42,159 --> 02:13:42,709
that's very necessary to do sort of

8537
02:13:44,880 --> 02:13:46,229

think that's what gauge symmetry is like

8538
02:13:46,229 --> 02:13:46,239
think that's what gauge symmetry is like
 

8539
02:13:46,239 --> 02:13:47,510
think that's what gauge symmetry is like
i mean it's not a field i know well but

8540
02:13:47,510 --> 02:13:47,520
i mean it's not a field i know well but
 

8541
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:49,189
i mean it's not a field i know well but
it certainly seems like yes it is like

02:13:49,189 --> 02:13:49,199
it certainly seems like yes it is like
 

8543
02:13:49,199 --> 02:13:50,229
it certainly seems like yes it is like
that okay but

8544
02:13:50,229 --> 02:13:50,239
that okay but
 

8545
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:53,270
that okay but
my problem with topology okay and even

8546
02:13:53,270 --> 02:13:53,280
my problem with topology okay and even
 

8547
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,350
my problem with topology okay and even
like differential geom and differential

like if you look at the papers that are
 

8573

wrote a program in fortran to visualize

8602
02:14:48,709 --> 02:14:48,719
wrote a program in fortran to visualize
 

8603
02:14:48,719 --> 02:14:50,069
wrote a program in fortran to visualize
it and that's it

8604
02:14:50,069 --> 02:14:50,079
it and that's it
 

8605
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:52,550
it and that's it
and it's just you know it makes me sad

8606
02:14:52,550 --> 02:14:52,560
and it's just you know it makes me sad
 

8607
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:53,589
and it's just you know it makes me sad
because

those are visual disciplines just like

02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:57,830
those are visual disciplines just like
computer vision is a visual discipline

8612

computer vision is a visual discipline
 

8613
02:14:57,840 --> 02:14:59,109
computer vision is a visual discipline
so you can provide a lot of visual

8620
02:15:07,030 --> 02:15:07,040
visualizing some of the ideas
 

8621
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:08,310
visualizing some of the ideas
i mean you could say that but i would

8622
02:15:08,310 --> 02:15:08,320
i mean you could say that but i would
 

8623
02:15:08,320 --> 02:15:09,669
i mean you could say that but i would
say for me a picture of the hop

8624
02:15:09,669 --> 02:15:09,679
say for me a picture of the hop
 

8625
02:15:09,679 --> 02:15:11,750
say for me a picture of the hop
vibration does nothing for me

8626
02:15:11,750 --> 02:15:11,760
vibration does nothing for me
 

8627
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:13,510
vibration does nothing for me
whereas like when you're like oh it's

8628
02:15:13,510 --> 02:15:13,520
whereas like when you're like oh it's
 

8629
02:15:13,520 --> 02:15:14,870
whereas like when you're like oh it's
like about the quaternions it's like a

8630
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:14,880
like about the quaternions it's like a
 

8631
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:16,470
like about the quaternions it's like a
subgroup of the quaternions i'm like oh

8632
02:15:16,470 --> 02:15:16,480
subgroup of the quaternions i'm like oh
 

8633
02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:17,990
subgroup of the quaternions i'm like oh
so now i see what's going on like why

8634
02:15:17,990 --> 02:15:18,000
so now i see what's going on like why
 

8635
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,189
so now i see what's going on like why
didn't you just say that why were you

8636
02:15:19,189 --> 02:15:19,199
didn't you just say that why were you
 

8637
02:15:19,199 --> 02:15:20,470
didn't you just say that why were you
like showing me this stupid picture

8638
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:20,480
like showing me this stupid picture
 

8639
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:21,430
like showing me this stupid picture
instead of telling me what you were

talking about
 

8643
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:25,910
talking about
oh yeah yeah i'm just saying no but it

8644
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:25,920
oh yeah yeah i'm just saying no but it
 

8645
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:26,950
oh yeah yeah i'm just saying no but it
goes back to what you're saying about

8646
02:15:26,950 --> 02:15:26,960
goes back to what you're saying about
 

8647
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:28,470
goes back to what you're saying about
teaching that like people are different

8648
02:15:28,470 --> 02:15:28,480
teaching that like people are different
 

8649
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:30,149
teaching that like people are different
in what they'll respond to so i think

8650
02:15:30,149 --> 02:15:30,159
in what they'll respond to so i think
 

8651
02:15:30,159 --> 02:15:31,109
in what they'll respond to so i think
there's no i mean

8652
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:31,119
there's no i mean
 

8653
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:32,470
there's no i mean
i'm very opposed to the idea that

8654
02:15:32,470 --> 02:15:32,480
i'm very opposed to the idea that
 

8655
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,310
i'm very opposed to the idea that
there's one right way to explain things

8656
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:34,320
there's one right way to explain things
 

8657
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:36,870
there's one right way to explain things
i think there's a huge variation in like

8658
02:15:36,870 --> 02:15:36,880
i think there's a huge variation in like
 

8659
02:15:36,880 --> 02:15:38,310
i think there's a huge variation in like
you know our brains like have all these

8660
02:15:38,310 --> 02:15:38,320
you know our brains like have all these
 

8661
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:41,030
you know our brains like have all these
like weird like hooks and loops and it's

8662
02:15:41,030 --> 02:15:41,040
like weird like hooks and loops and it's
 

8663
02:15:41,040 --> 02:15:42,470
like weird like hooks and loops and it's
like very hard to know like what's going

8664
02:15:42,470 --> 02:15:42,480
like very hard to know like what's going
 

8665
02:15:42,480 --> 02:15:43,910
like very hard to know like what's going
to latch on and it's not going to be the

8666
02:15:43,910 --> 02:15:43,920
to latch on and it's not going to be the
 

8667
02:15:43,920 --> 02:15:45,430
to latch on and it's not going to be the
same thing

8668
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:45,440
same thing
 

8669
02:15:45,440 --> 02:15:48,069
same thing
for everybody so well i think

8670
02:15:48,069 --> 02:15:48,079
for everybody so well i think
 

8671
02:15:48,079 --> 02:15:49,910
for everybody so well i think
monoculture is bad right i think that's

8672
02:15:49,910 --> 02:15:49,920
monoculture is bad right i think that's
 

8673
02:15:49,920 --> 02:15:51,430
monoculture is bad right i think that's
and i think we're agreeing on that point

8674
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,440
and i think we're agreeing on that point
 

8675
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,069
and i think we're agreeing on that point
that like

8676
02:15:52,069 --> 02:15:52,079
that like
 

8677
02:15:52,079 --> 02:15:53,669
that like
it's good that there's like a lot of

8678
02:15:53,669 --> 02:15:53,679
it's good that there's like a lot of
 

8679
02:15:53,679 --> 02:15:55,109
it's good that there's like a lot of
different ways in and a lot of different

8680
02:15:55,109 --> 02:15:55,119
different ways in and a lot of different
 

8681
02:15:55,119 --> 02:15:56,790
different ways in and a lot of different
ways to describe these ideas because

8682
02:15:56,790 --> 02:15:56,800
ways to describe these ideas because
 

8683
02:15:56,800 --> 02:15:57,990
ways to describe these ideas because
different people are going to find

8684
02:15:57,990 --> 02:15:58,000
different people are going to find
 

8685
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,229
different people are going to find
different things illuminating but

8686
02:16:00,229 --> 02:16:00,239
different things illuminating but
 

8687
02:16:00,239 --> 02:16:03,510
different things illuminating but
that said i think there's a lot to be

8688
02:16:03,510 --> 02:16:03,520
that said i think there's a lot to be
 

8689
02:16:03,520 --> 02:16:04,390
that said i think there's a lot to be
discovered

8690
02:16:04,390 --> 02:16:04,400
discovered
 

8691
02:16:04,400 --> 02:16:07,750
discovered
when you

8692
02:16:07,750 --> 02:16:07,760

 

8693
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:10,310

force little like silos of brilliant

8694
02:16:10,310 --> 02:16:10,320
force little like silos of brilliant
 

8695
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:10,950
force little like silos of brilliant
people

8696
02:16:10,950 --> 02:16:10,960
people
 

8697
02:16:10,960 --> 02:16:15,189
people
to kind of find a middle ground

8698
02:16:15,189 --> 02:16:15,199
to kind of find a middle ground
 

8699
02:16:15,199 --> 02:16:18,870
to kind of find a middle ground
or like uh aggregate or

8700
02:16:18,870 --> 02:16:18,880
or like uh aggregate or
 

8701
02:16:18,880 --> 02:16:21,350
or like uh aggregate or
come together in a way so there's like

8702
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
come together in a way so there's like
 

8703
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,430
come together in a way so there's like
people that do love visual things

8704
02:16:23,430 --> 02:16:23,440
people that do love visual things
 

8705
02:16:23,440 --> 02:16:25,589
people that do love visual things
i mean there's a lot of disciplines

8706
02:16:25,589 --> 02:16:25,599
i mean there's a lot of disciplines
 

8707
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:26,950
i mean there's a lot of disciplines
especially in computer science

8708
02:16:26,950 --> 02:16:26,960
especially in computer science
 

8709
02:16:26,960 --> 02:16:28,790
especially in computer science
that they're obsessed with visualizing

8710
02:16:28,790 --> 02:16:28,800
that they're obsessed with visualizing
 

8711
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:29,990
that they're obsessed with visualizing
visualizing data

8712
02:16:29,990 --> 02:16:30,000
visualizing data
 

8713
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:31,510
visualizing data
visualizing neural networks i mean

8714
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:31,520
visualizing neural networks i mean
 

8715
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:32,950
visualizing neural networks i mean
neural networks themselves are

8716
02:16:32,950 --> 02:16:32,960
neural networks themselves are
 

8717
02:16:32,960 --> 02:16:34,469
neural networks themselves are
fundamentally visual there's a lot of

8718
02:16:34,469 --> 02:16:34,479
fundamentally visual there's a lot of
 

8719
02:16:34,479 --> 02:16:35,830
fundamentally visual there's a lot of
work in computer vision that's very

8720
02:16:35,830 --> 02:16:35,840
work in computer vision that's very
 

8721
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:36,709
work in computer vision that's very
visual

8722
02:16:36,709 --> 02:16:36,719
visual
 

8723
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:38,709
visual
and then coming together with some some

8724
02:16:38,709 --> 02:16:38,719
and then coming together with some some
 

8725
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:41,030
and then coming together with some some
folks that were like deeply rigorous

8726
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,040
folks that were like deeply rigorous
 

8727
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,469
folks that were like deeply rigorous
and are like totally lost in

8728
02:16:42,469 --> 02:16:42,479
and are like totally lost in
 

8729
02:16:42,479 --> 02:16:44,230
and are like totally lost in
multi-dimensional space where it's hard

8730
02:16:44,230 --> 02:16:44,240
multi-dimensional space where it's hard
 

8731
02:16:44,240 --> 02:16:46,070
multi-dimensional space where it's hard
to even bring them back down to 3d

8732
02:16:46,070 --> 02:16:46,080
to even bring them back down to 3d
 

8733
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,070
to even bring them back down to 3d
[Laughter]

8734
02:16:48,070 --> 02:16:48,080
[Laughter]
 

8735
02:16:48,080 --> 02:16:49,190
[Laughter]
they're very comfortable in this

8736
02:16:49,190 --> 02:16:49,200
they're very comfortable in this
 

8737
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,110
they're very comfortable in this
multi-dimensional space so forcing them

8738
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:51,120
multi-dimensional space so forcing them
 

8739
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,349
multi-dimensional space so forcing them
to kind of work together to communicate

8740
02:16:53,349 --> 02:16:53,359
to kind of work together to communicate
 

8741
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:55,110
to kind of work together to communicate
because it's not just about public

8742
02:16:55,110 --> 02:16:55,120
because it's not just about public
 

8743
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:57,190
because it's not just about public
communication of ideas

8744
02:16:57,190 --> 02:16:57,200
communication of ideas
 

8745
02:16:57,200 --> 02:16:59,030
communication of ideas
it's also i feel like when you're forced

8746
02:16:59,030 --> 02:16:59,040
it's also i feel like when you're forced
 

8747
02:16:59,040 --> 02:17:00,709
it's also i feel like when you're forced
to do that public communication like you

8748
02:17:00,709 --> 02:17:00,719
to do that public communication like you
 

8749
02:17:00,719 --> 02:17:01,990
to do that public communication like you
did with your book

8750
02:17:01,990 --> 02:17:02,000
did with your book
 

8751
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,110
did with your book
i think deep profound ideas can be

8752
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:05,120
i think deep profound ideas can be
 

8753
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,870
i think deep profound ideas can be
discovered that's like applicable for

8754
02:17:06,870 --> 02:17:06,880
discovered that's like applicable for
 

8755
02:17:06,880 --> 02:17:08,629
discovered that's like applicable for
research and for science

8756
02:17:08,629 --> 02:17:08,639
research and for science
 

8757
02:17:08,639 --> 02:17:09,910
research and for science
like there's something about that

8758
02:17:09,910 --> 02:17:09,920
like there's something about that
 

8759
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:13,349
like there's something about that
simplification or not simplification but

8760
02:17:13,349 --> 02:17:13,359
simplification or not simplification but
 

8761
02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:15,429
simplification or not simplification but
this distillation or condensation or

8762
02:17:15,429 --> 02:17:15,439
this distillation or condensation or
 

8763
02:17:15,439 --> 02:17:16,950
this distillation or condensation or
whatever the hell you call it

8764
02:17:16,950 --> 02:17:16,960
whatever the hell you call it
 

8765
02:17:16,960 --> 02:17:18,230
whatever the hell you call it
compression

8766
02:17:18,230 --> 02:17:18,240
compression
 

8767
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,070
compression
of ideas that somehow actually

8768
02:17:20,070 --> 02:17:20,080
of ideas that somehow actually
 

8769
02:17:20,080 --> 02:17:22,070
of ideas that somehow actually
stimulates creativity

8770
02:17:22,070 --> 02:17:22,080
stimulates creativity
 

8771
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,950
stimulates creativity
and uh i'd be excited to see more of

8772
02:17:24,950 --> 02:17:24,960
and uh i'd be excited to see more of
 

8773
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:26,150
and uh i'd be excited to see more of
that in the

8774
02:17:26,150 --> 02:17:26,160
that in the
 

8775
02:17:26,160 --> 02:17:28,150
that in the
in in the mathematics community can you

8776
02:17:28,150 --> 02:17:28,160
in in the mathematics community can you
 

8777
02:17:28,160 --> 02:17:29,429
in in the mathematics community can you
let me make a crazy metaphor

8778
02:17:29,429 --> 02:17:29,439
let me make a crazy metaphor
 

8779
02:17:29,439 --> 02:17:30,629
let me make a crazy metaphor
maybe it's a little bit like the

8780
02:17:30,629 --> 02:17:30,639
maybe it's a little bit like the
 

8781
02:17:30,639 --> 02:17:32,469
maybe it's a little bit like the
relation between prose and poetry right

8782
02:17:32,469 --> 02:17:32,479
relation between prose and poetry right
 

8783
02:17:32,479 --> 02:17:33,830
relation between prose and poetry right
i mean if you you might say like why do

8784
02:17:33,830 --> 02:17:33,840
i mean if you you might say like why do
 

8785
02:17:33,840 --> 02:17:35,030
i mean if you you might say like why do
we need anything more than prose you're

8786
02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:35,040
we need anything more than prose you're
 

8787
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:36,629
we need anything more than prose you're
trying to convey some information so you

8788
02:17:36,629 --> 02:17:36,639
trying to convey some information so you
 

8789
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:37,669
trying to convey some information so you
just like say it

8790
02:17:37,669 --> 02:17:37,679
just like say it
 

8791
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:40,469
just like say it
um well poetry does something right it's

8792
02:17:40,469 --> 02:17:40,479
um well poetry does something right it's
 

8793
02:17:40,479 --> 02:17:41,030
um well poetry does something right it's
sort of

8794
02:17:41,030 --> 02:17:41,040
sort of
 

8795
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:42,709
sort of
you might think of it as a kind of

8796
02:17:42,709 --> 02:17:42,719
you might think of it as a kind of
 

8797
02:17:42,719 --> 02:17:44,309
you might think of it as a kind of
compression of course not all poetry is

8798
02:17:44,309 --> 02:17:44,319
compression of course not all poetry is
 

8799
02:17:44,319 --> 02:17:45,589
compression of course not all poetry is
compressed like not awesome

8800
02:17:45,589 --> 02:17:45,599
compressed like not awesome
 

8801
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:48,709
compressed like not awesome
some of it is quite baggy but like

8802
02:17:48,709 --> 02:17:48,719
some of it is quite baggy but like
 

8803
02:17:48,719 --> 02:17:51,830
some of it is quite baggy but like
um you are kind of

8804
02:17:51,830 --> 02:17:51,840
um you are kind of
 

8805
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:54,070
um you are kind of
often it's compressed right a lyric poem

8806
02:17:54,070 --> 02:17:54,080
often it's compressed right a lyric poem
 

8807
02:17:54,080 --> 02:17:55,589
often it's compressed right a lyric poem
is often sort of like a compression of

8808
02:17:55,589 --> 02:17:55,599

02:18:38,070 --> 02:18:38,080
or about the man yeah i mean one thing
 

8843
02:18:38,080 --> 02:18:40,950
or about the man yeah i mean one thing
i really like about the proof and partly

02:18:40,950 --> 02:18:40,960
i really like about the proof and partly
 

8845
02:18:40,960 --> 02:18:42,549
i really like about the proof and partly
that's because it's sort of a

8846
02:18:42,549 --> 02:18:42,559
that's because it's sort of a
 

8847
02:18:42,559 --> 02:18:44,549
that's because it's sort of a
thing that happens again and again in

02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:44,559
thing that happens again and again in
 

8849
02:18:44,559 --> 02:18:45,830
thing that happens again and again in
this book i mean i'm writing about

8850
02:18:45,830 --> 02:18:45,840
this book i mean i'm writing about
 

8851
02:18:45,840 --> 02:18:47,589
this book i mean i'm writing about
geometry and the way it sort of appears

8852
02:18:47,589 --> 02:18:47,599
geometry and the way it sort of appears
 

8853
02:18:47,599 --> 02:18:49,270
geometry and the way it sort of appears
in all these kind of real world problems

8854
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:49,280
in all these kind of real world problems
 

8855
02:18:49,280 --> 02:18:50,150
in all these kind of real world problems
and

8856
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:50,160
and
 

8857
02:18:50,160 --> 02:18:51,990
and
but it happens so often that the

8858
02:18:51,990 --> 02:18:52,000
but it happens so often that the
 

8859
02:18:52,000 --> 02:18:55,030
but it happens so often that the
geometry you think you're studying

8860
02:18:55,030 --> 02:18:55,040
geometry you think you're studying
 

8861
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:57,669
geometry you think you're studying
is somehow not enough you have to go one

8862
02:18:57,669 --> 02:18:57,679
is somehow not enough you have to go one
 

8863
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:59,190
is somehow not enough you have to go one
level higher in abstraction

8864
02:18:59,190 --> 02:18:59,200
level higher in abstraction
 

8865
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,589
level higher in abstraction
and study a higher level of geometry and

8866
02:19:01,589 --> 02:19:01,599
and study a higher level of geometry and
 

8867
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:03,030
and study a higher level of geometry and
the way that plays out

8868
02:19:03,030 --> 02:19:03,040
the way that plays out
 

8869
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:04,950
the way that plays out
is that you know poincare asks a

8870
02:19:04,950 --> 02:19:04,960
is that you know poincare asks a
 

8871
02:19:04,960 --> 02:19:06,389
is that you know poincare asks a
question about a certain kind of

8872
02:19:06,389 --> 02:19:06,399
question about a certain kind of
 

8873
02:19:06,399 --> 02:19:07,830
question about a certain kind of
three-dimensional object

8874
02:19:07,830 --> 02:19:07,840
three-dimensional object
 

8875
02:19:07,840 --> 02:19:09,589
three-dimensional object
is it the usual three-dimensional space

8876
02:19:09,589 --> 02:19:09,599
is it the usual three-dimensional space
 

8877
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:11,910
is it the usual three-dimensional space
that we know or is it some kind of

8878
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:11,920
that we know or is it some kind of
 

8879
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:13,910
that we know or is it some kind of
exotic thing and so of course this

8880
02:19:13,910 --> 02:19:13,920
exotic thing and so of course this
 

8881
02:19:13,920 --> 02:19:15,349
exotic thing and so of course this
sounds like it's a question about the

8882
02:19:15,349 --> 02:19:15,359
sounds like it's a question about the
 

8883
02:19:15,359 --> 02:19:17,589
sounds like it's a question about the
geometry of the three-dimensional space

8884
02:19:17,589 --> 02:19:17,599
geometry of the three-dimensional space
 

8885

8925
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:56,790

so what is this idea the idea is that

8926
02:19:56,790 --> 02:19:56,800
so what is this idea the idea is that
 

8927
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:58,070
so what is this idea the idea is that
well of course the geometry of the

8928
02:19:58,070 --> 02:19:58,080
well of course the geometry of the
 

8929
02:19:58,080 --> 02:19:59,110
well of course the geometry of the
three-dimensional

8930

three-dimensional
 

8931
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:01,110
three-dimensional
object itself is relevant but the real

8932
02:20:01,110 --> 02:20:01,120
object itself is relevant but the real
 

8933
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:02,870
object itself is relevant but the real
geometry you have to understand is

8934
02:20:02,870 --> 02:20:02,880
geometry you have to understand is
 

8935
02:20:02,880 --> 02:20:05,429
geometry you have to understand is
the geometry of the space of all

02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:07,429
the geometry of the space of all
three-dimensional geometries

8938
02:20:07,429 --> 02:20:07,439

whoa you're going up a higher level

8940
02:20:10,309 --> 02:20:10,319
whoa you're going up a higher level
 

8941
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:11,990
whoa you're going up a higher level
because when you do that you can say

8942
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:12,000
because when you do that you can say
 

8943
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,230
because when you do that you can say
now let's trace out a path

8944
02:20:16,230 --> 02:20:16,240
now let's trace out a path
 

8945
02:20:16,240 --> 02:20:18,790
now let's trace out a path
in that space yes there's a mechanism

8946
02:20:18,790 --> 02:20:18,800
in that space yes there's a mechanism
 

8947
02:20:18,800 --> 02:20:20,070
in that space yes there's a mechanism
called reachy flow and again we're

8948
02:20:20,070 --> 02:20:20,080
called reachy flow and again we're
 

8949
02:20:20,080 --> 02:20:22,469
called reachy flow and again we're
outside my research area so for all the

02:20:22,469 --> 02:20:22,479
outside my research area so for all the
 

8951
02:20:22,479 --> 02:20:23,590
outside my research area so for all the

if i please i'm doing my best and i'm
roughly saying

8958
02:20:29,349 --> 02:20:29,359
roughly saying
 

8959
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:31,670
roughly saying
so this the ritchie flow allows you to

8960
02:20:31,670 --> 02:20:31,680
so this the ritchie flow allows you to
 

8961
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:33,190
so this the ritchie flow allows you to
say like okay let's start from some

8962
02:20:33,190 --> 02:20:33,200
say like okay let's start from some
 

8963
02:20:33,200 --> 02:20:35,190
say like okay let's start from some

which poincare would conjecture is
 

8967
02:20:37,120 --> 02:20:38,230
which poincare would conjecture is
essentially the same thing as our

02:20:38,230 --> 02:20:38,240
essentially the same thing as our
 

8969
02:20:38,240 --> 02:20:39,590
essentially the same thing as our
familiar three-dimensional space but we

8970
02:20:39,590 --> 02:20:39,600
familiar three-dimensional space but we
 

8971
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:41,110
familiar three-dimensional space but we
don't know that

8972
02:20:41,110 --> 02:20:41,120
don't know that
 

8973
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,309
don't know that
and now you let it flow you

8974
02:20:44,309 --> 02:20:44,319
and now you let it flow you
 

8975
02:20:44,319 --> 02:20:46,950
and now you let it flow you
sort of like let it move in its natural

8976
02:20:46,950 --> 02:20:46,960
sort of like let it move in its natural
 

8977
02:20:46,960 --> 02:20:47,349
sort of like let it move in its natural
path

8978
02:20:47,349 --> 02:20:47,359
path
 

8979
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:48,630
path
according to some almost physical

8980
02:20:48,630 --> 02:20:48,640
according to some almost physical
 

8981
02:20:48,640 --> 02:20:50,469
according to some almost physical
process and ask

8982
02:20:50,469 --> 02:20:50,479
process and ask
 

8983
02:20:50,479 --> 02:20:52,070
process and ask
where it winds up and what you find is

8984
02:20:52,070 --> 02:20:52,080
where it winds up and what you find is
 

8985
02:20:52,080 --> 02:20:54,150
where it winds up and what you find is
that it always winds up

8986
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:54,160
that it always winds up
 

8987
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:55,830
that it always winds up
you've continuously deformed it there's

8988
02:20:55,830 --> 02:20:55,840
you've continuously deformed it there's
 

8989
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:58,150
you've continuously deformed it there's
that word deformation again

8990
02:20:58,150 --> 02:20:58,160
that word deformation again
 

8991
02:20:58,160 --> 02:20:59,190
that word deformation again
and what you can prove is that the

8992
02:20:59,190 --> 02:20:59,200
and what you can prove is that the
 

8993
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:00,630
and what you can prove is that the
process doesn't stop until you get to

8994
02:21:00,630 --> 02:21:00,640
process doesn't stop until you get to
 

8995
02:21:00,640 --> 02:21:02,150
process doesn't stop until you get to
the usual three-dimensional space and

8996
02:21:02,150 --> 02:21:02,160
the usual three-dimensional space and
 

8997
02:21:02,160 --> 02:21:04,550
the usual three-dimensional space and
since you can get from the mystery thing

8998
02:21:04,550 --> 02:21:04,560
since you can get from the mystery thing
 

8999
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:06,790
since you can get from the mystery thing
to the standard space by this process of

9000
02:21:06,790 --> 02:21:06,800
to the standard space by this process of
 

9001
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:07,670
to the standard space by this process of
continually

9002
02:21:07,670 --> 02:21:07,680
continually
 

9003
02:21:07,680 --> 02:21:11,110
continually
changing and never kind of having any

9004
02:21:11,110 --> 02:21:11,120
changing and never kind of having any
 

9005
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:12,950
changing and never kind of having any
sharp transitions

9006
02:21:12,950 --> 02:21:12,960
sharp transitions
 

9007
02:21:12,960 --> 02:21:15,830
sharp transitions
then the original shape must have been

9008
02:21:15,830 --> 02:21:15,840
then the original shape must have been
 

9009
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:17,110
then the original shape must have been
the same as the standard

9010
02:21:17,110 --> 02:21:17,120
the same as the standard
 

9011
02:21:17,120 --> 02:21:18,790
the same as the standard
shape that's the nature of the proof now

9012
02:21:18,790 --> 02:21:18,800
shape that's the nature of the proof now
 

9013
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,469
shape that's the nature of the proof now
of course it's incredibly technical i

9014
02:21:20,469 --> 02:21:20,479
of course it's incredibly technical i
 

9015
02:21:20,479 --> 02:21:20,710
of course it's incredibly technical i
think

9016
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:20,720
think
 

9017
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,469
think
as i understand it i think the hard part

9018
02:21:22,469 --> 02:21:22,479
as i understand it i think the hard part
 

9019
02:21:22,479 --> 02:21:24,230
as i understand it i think the hard part
is proving that

9020
02:21:24,230 --> 02:21:24,240
is proving that
 

9021
02:21:24,240 --> 02:21:25,750
is proving that
the favorite word of ai people you don't

9022
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:25,760
the favorite word of ai people you don't
 

9023
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:28,469
the favorite word of ai people you don't
get any singularities along the way

9024
02:21:28,469 --> 02:21:28,479
get any singularities along the way
 

9025
02:21:28,479 --> 02:21:30,309
get any singularities along the way
um but of course in this context

9026
02:21:30,309 --> 02:21:30,319
um but of course in this context
 

9027
02:21:30,319 --> 02:21:31,910
um but of course in this context
singularity just means

9028
02:21:31,910 --> 02:21:31,920
singularity just means
 

9029
02:21:31,920 --> 02:21:35,270
singularity just means
acquiring a sharp kink it just means uh

9030
02:21:35,270 --> 02:21:35,280
acquiring a sharp kink it just means uh
 

9031
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:37,670
acquiring a sharp kink it just means uh
becoming non-smooth at some point so

9032
02:21:37,670 --> 02:21:37,680
becoming non-smooth at some point so
 

9033
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:39,349
becoming non-smooth at some point so
just saying something interesting about

9034
02:21:39,349 --> 02:21:39,359
just saying something interesting about
 

9035
02:21:39,359 --> 02:21:40,389
just saying something interesting about
uh

9036
02:21:40,389 --> 02:21:40,399
uh
 

9037
02:21:40,399 --> 02:21:42,630
uh
formal about the smooth trajectory

9038
02:21:42,630 --> 02:21:42,640
formal about the smooth trajectory
 

9039
02:21:42,640 --> 02:21:44,389
formal about the smooth trajectory
through this weird space

9040
02:21:44,389 --> 02:21:44,399
through this weird space
 

9041
02:21:44,399 --> 02:21:46,710
through this weird space
yeah but yeah so what i like about it is

9042
02:21:46,710 --> 02:21:46,720
yeah but yeah so what i like about it is
 

9043
02:21:46,720 --> 02:21:48,309
yeah but yeah so what i like about it is
that it's just one of many examples of

9044
02:21:48,309 --> 02:21:48,319
that it's just one of many examples of
 

9045
02:21:48,319 --> 02:21:49,510
that it's just one of many examples of
where

9046
02:21:49,510 --> 02:21:49,520
where
 

9047
02:21:49,520 --> 02:21:51,110
where
it's not about the geometry you think

9048
02:21:51,110 --> 02:21:51,120
it's not about the geometry you think
 

9049
02:21:51,120 --> 02:21:53,110
it's not about the geometry you think
it's about it's about the geometry of

9050
02:21:53,110 --> 02:21:53,120
it's about it's about the geometry of
 

9051
02:21:53,120 --> 02:21:56,469
it's about it's about the geometry of
all geometries so to speak and it's only

9052
02:21:56,469 --> 02:21:56,479
all geometries so to speak and it's only
 

9053

kind of like kind of like being jerked

9056
02:21:58,630 --> 02:21:58,640
kind of like kind of like being jerked
 

9057
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:00,309
kind of like kind of like being jerked
out of flat land right same idea it's

9058
02:22:00,309 --> 02:22:00,319
out of flat land right same idea it's
 

9059
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:02,309
out of flat land right same idea it's
only by sort of

only by sort of
 

9061
02:22:02,319 --> 02:22:03,990
only by sort of
seeing the whole thing globally at once

9062
02:22:03,990 --> 02:22:04,000
seeing the whole thing globally at once
 

9063
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,190
seeing the whole thing globally at once
that you can really make progress on

9064
02:22:05,190 --> 02:22:05,200
that you can really make progress on
 

9065
02:22:05,200 --> 02:22:06,309
that you can really make progress on
understanding like the one thing you

9066
02:22:06,309 --> 02:22:06,319
understanding like the one thing you
 

9067
02:22:06,319 --> 02:22:08,309
understanding like the one thing you
thought you were looking at

9068
02:22:08,309 --> 02:22:08,319
thought you were looking at
 

9069
02:22:08,319 --> 02:22:09,750
thought you were looking at
it's a romantic question but what do

9070
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:09,760
it's a romantic question but what do
 

9071
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:11,270
it's a romantic question but what do
what what do you think about him turning

9072
02:22:11,270 --> 02:22:11,280
what what do you think about him turning
 

9073
02:22:11,280 --> 02:22:12,870
what what do you think about him turning
down the fields medal

9074
02:22:12,870 --> 02:22:12,880
down the fields medal
 

9075
02:22:12,880 --> 02:22:16,150
down the fields medal
is uh is that just our nobel prizes and

9076
02:22:16,150 --> 02:22:16,160
is uh is that just our nobel prizes and
 

9077
02:22:16,160 --> 02:22:18,150
is uh is that just our nobel prizes and
feelings medals just

9078
02:22:18,150 --> 02:22:18,160
feelings medals just
 

9079
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:19,990
feelings medals just
just the cherry on top of the cake and

9080
02:22:19,990 --> 02:22:20,000
just the cherry on top of the cake and
 

9081
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:21,830
just the cherry on top of the cake and
really math itself

9082
02:22:21,830 --> 02:22:21,840
really math itself
 

9083
02:22:21,840 --> 02:22:25,510
really math itself
the process of uh curiosity of pulling

9084
02:22:25,510 --> 02:22:25,520
the process of uh curiosity of pulling
 

9085
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,030
the process of uh curiosity of pulling
at the string of

9086
02:22:27,030 --> 02:22:27,040
at the string of
 

9087
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:29,429
at the string of
the mystery before us that's the cake

9088
02:22:29,429 --> 02:22:29,439
the mystery before us that's the cake
 

9089
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:30,150
the mystery before us that's the cake
and then

9090
02:22:30,150 --> 02:22:30,160
and then
 

9091
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:34,950
and then
the awards are just icing and

9092
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:34,960
the awards are just icing and
 

9093
02:22:34,960 --> 02:22:36,550
the awards are just icing and
uh clearly i've been fasting and i'm

9094
02:22:36,550 --> 02:22:36,560
uh clearly i've been fasting and i'm
 

9095
02:22:36,560 --> 02:22:38,790
uh clearly i've been fasting and i'm
hungry but uh

9096
02:22:38,790 --> 02:22:38,800
hungry but uh
 

9097
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:41,990
hungry but uh
but do you think it's um it's it's

9098
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:42,000
but do you think it's um it's it's
 

9099
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:43,190
but do you think it's um it's it's
tragic or just

9100
02:22:43,190 --> 02:22:43,200
tragic or just
 

9101
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:45,030
tragic or just
just a little curiosity that he turned

9102
02:22:45,030 --> 02:22:45,040
just a little curiosity that he turned
 

9103
02:22:45,040 --> 02:22:46,230
just a little curiosity that he turned
on the metal

9104
02:22:46,230 --> 02:22:46,240
on the metal
 

9105
02:22:46,240 --> 02:22:47,750
on the metal
well it's interesting because on the one

9106
02:22:47,750 --> 02:22:47,760
well it's interesting because on the one
 

9107
02:22:47,760 --> 02:22:50,070
well it's interesting because on the one
hand i think it's absolutely true

9108
02:22:50,070 --> 02:22:50,080
hand i think it's absolutely true
 

9109
02:22:50,080 --> 02:22:54,309
hand i think it's absolutely true
that right in some kind of like vast

9110
02:22:54,309 --> 02:22:54,319
that right in some kind of like vast
 

9111
02:22:54,319 --> 02:22:56,469
that right in some kind of like vast
spiritual sense like awards are not

9112
02:22:56,469 --> 02:22:56,479
spiritual sense like awards are not
 

9113
02:22:56,479 --> 02:22:58,230
spiritual sense like awards are not
important like not important the way

9114
02:22:58,230 --> 02:22:58,240
important like not important the way
 

9115
02:22:58,240 --> 02:22:59,110
important like not important the way
that sort of like

9116
02:22:59,110 --> 02:22:59,120
that sort of like
 

9117
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,110
that sort of like
understanding the universe is important

9118
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:01,120
understanding the universe is important
 

9119
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,309
understanding the universe is important
um

9120
02:23:02,309 --> 02:23:02,319
um
 

9121
02:23:02,319 --> 02:23:03,750
um
on the other hand most people who are

9122
02:23:03,750 --> 02:23:03,760
on the other hand most people who are
 

9123
02:23:03,760 --> 02:23:05,510
on the other hand most people who are
offered that prize accept it you know

9124
02:23:05,510 --> 02:23:05,520
offered that prize accept it you know
 

9125
02:23:05,520 --> 02:23:07,590
offered that prize accept it you know
it's it is so there's something unusual

9126
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:07,600
it's it is so there's something unusual
 

9127
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:09,830
it's it is so there's something unusual
about his uh

9128
02:23:09,830 --> 02:23:09,840
about his uh
 

9129
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:12,710

turning down the prize
 

9189
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,950
turning down the prize
serves for me it's not that there's

9190
02:24:00,950 --> 02:24:00,960
serves for me it's not that there's
 

9191

the nobel prize is trickier because so

9198
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:07,920
the nobel prize is trickier because so
 

9199
02:24:07,920 --> 02:24:10,230
the nobel prize is trickier because so
many nobel prizes are given

9200
02:24:10,230 --> 02:24:10,240
many nobel prizes are given
 

9201
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,590
many nobel prizes are given
first of all the nobel prize often

9202
02:24:11,590 --> 02:24:11,600
first of all the nobel prize often
 

9203
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:13,990
first of all the nobel prize often
forgets many many of the

9204
02:24:13,990 --> 02:24:14,000
forgets many many of the
 

9205
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:15,590
forgets many many of the
important people throughout history

9206

important people throughout history
 

9207
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,990
important people throughout history
second of all there's like these weird

9208
02:24:17,990 --> 02:24:18,000
second of all there's like these weird
 

9209
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:20,150
second of all there's like these weird
rules to it there's only three people

9210
02:24:20,150 --> 02:24:20,160
rules to it there's only three people
 

9211
02:24:20,160 --> 02:24:22,070
rules to it there's only three people
and some projects have a huge number of

9212
02:24:22,070 --> 02:24:22,080
and some projects have a huge number of
 

9213
02:24:22,080 --> 02:24:23,990
and some projects have a huge number of
people and it's like this

9214
02:24:23,990 --> 02:24:24,000
people and it's like this
 

9215
02:24:24,000 --> 02:24:27,349
people and it's like this
it um i don't know it it doesn't

9216
02:24:27,349 --> 02:24:27,359
it um i don't know it it doesn't
 

9217
02:24:27,359 --> 02:24:30,389
it um i don't know it it doesn't
kind of highlight the way

02:24:30,389 --> 02:24:30,399
kind of highlight the way
 

9219
02:24:30,399 --> 02:24:31,750
kind of highlight the way
science is done on some of these

9220
02:24:31,750 --> 02:24:31,760
science is done on some of these
 

9221
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:33,510
science is done on some of these
projects in the best possible way

9222
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:33,520
projects in the best possible way
 

9223
02:24:33,520 --> 02:24:35,030
projects in the best possible way
but in general the prizes are great but

9224
02:24:35,030 --> 02:24:35,040
but in general the prizes are great but
 

9225
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:37,110
but in general the prizes are great but
what this kind of teaches me and reminds

what this kind of teaches me and reminds
 

9227
02:24:37,120 --> 02:24:37,590
what this kind of teaches me and reminds
me is

sometimes in your life there'll be

9230
02:24:39,110 --> 02:24:39,120
sometimes in your life there'll be
 

9231
02:24:39,120 --> 02:24:41,270
sometimes in your life there'll be
moments

9232
02:24:41,270 --> 02:24:41,280
moments
 

9233
02:24:41,280 --> 02:24:46,150
moments
when the thing that you

9234
02:24:46,150 --> 02:24:46,160
when the thing that you
 

9235
02:24:46,160 --> 02:24:48,070
when the thing that you
you would really like to do society

9236
02:24:48,070 --> 02:24:48,080
you would really like to do society
 

9237
02:24:48,080 --> 02:24:50,630
you would really like to do society
would really like you to do

9238
02:24:50,630 --> 02:24:50,640
would really like you to do
 

9239
02:24:50,640 --> 02:24:53,030
would really like you to do
is the thing that goes against something

9240
02:24:53,030 --> 02:24:53,040
is the thing that goes against something
 

9241
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:53,830
is the thing that goes against something
you believe in

9242
02:24:53,830 --> 02:24:53,840
you believe in
 

9243
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:55,910
you believe in
whatever that is some kind of principle

9244
02:24:55,910 --> 02:24:55,920
whatever that is some kind of principle
 

9245
02:24:55,920 --> 02:24:58,309
whatever that is some kind of principle
and stand your ground

9246
02:24:58,309 --> 02:24:58,319
and stand your ground
 

9247
02:24:58,319 --> 02:25:01,510
and stand your ground
in the face of that it's something um

9248
02:25:01,510 --> 02:25:01,520
in the face of that it's something um
 

9249
02:25:01,520 --> 02:25:03,270
in the face of that it's something um
i believe most people will have a few

9250
02:25:03,270 --> 02:25:03,280
i believe most people will have a few
 

9251
02:25:03,280 --> 02:25:05,030
i believe most people will have a few
moments like that in their life

9252
02:25:05,030 --> 02:25:05,040
moments like that in their life
 

9253
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:06,790
moments like that in their life
maybe one moment like that and you have

9254
02:25:06,790 --> 02:25:06,800
maybe one moment like that and you have
 

9255
02:25:06,800 --> 02:25:08,950
maybe one moment like that and you have
to do it that's what integrity is

9256
02:25:08,950 --> 02:25:08,960
to do it that's what integrity is
 

9257
02:25:08,960 --> 02:25:10,389
to do it that's what integrity is
so like it doesn't have to make sense to

9258
02:25:10,389 --> 02:25:10,399
so like it doesn't have to make sense to
 

9259
02:25:10,399 --> 02:25:11,990
so like it doesn't have to make sense to
the rest of the world but to stand on

9260
02:25:11,990 --> 02:25:12,000
the rest of the world but to stand on
 

9261
02:25:12,000 --> 02:25:13,110
the rest of the world but to stand on
that like

9262
02:25:13,110 --> 02:25:13,120
that like
 

9263
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:15,670
that like
to say no it's interesting because i

9264
02:25:15,670 --> 02:25:15,680
to say no it's interesting because i
 

9265
02:25:15,680 --> 02:25:17,030
to say no it's interesting because i
think do you know that he turned down

9266
02:25:17,030 --> 02:25:17,040
think do you know that he turned down
 

9267
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:17,670
think do you know that he turned down
the prize

9268
02:25:17,670 --> 02:25:17,680
the prize
 

9269
02:25:17,680 --> 02:25:20,150
the prize
in service of some principle because i

9270
02:25:20,150 --> 02:25:20,160
in service of some principle because i
 

9271
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:20,870
in service of some principle because i
don't know that

9272
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:20,880
don't know that
 

9273
02:25:20,880 --> 02:25:22,630
don't know that
well yes that seems to be the inkling

9274
02:25:22,630 --> 02:25:22,640
well yes that seems to be the inkling
 

9275
02:25:22,640 --> 02:25:24,550
well yes that seems to be the inkling
but he has never made it super clear but

9276
02:25:24,550 --> 02:25:24,560
but he has never made it super clear but
 

9277
02:25:24,560 --> 02:25:26,070
but he has never made it super clear but
the the inkling is that there he had

9278
02:25:26,070 --> 02:25:26,080
the the inkling is that there he had
 

9279
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:27,910
the the inkling is that there he had
some problems with the whole process of

9280
02:25:27,910 --> 02:25:27,920
some problems with the whole process of
 

9281
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:29,030
some problems with the whole process of
mathematics that

9282
02:25:29,030 --> 02:25:29,040
mathematics that
 

9283
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:31,910
mathematics that
includes awards like this hierarchies

9284
02:25:31,910 --> 02:25:31,920
includes awards like this hierarchies
 

9285
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:32,630

let's posit that that's his reasoning
because i truly don't know

because i truly don't know
 

9361
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:43,510
because i truly don't know
um it's an interesting opportunity to go

9362
02:26:43,510 --> 02:26:43,520
um it's an interesting opportunity to go
 

9363
02:26:43,520 --> 02:26:45,670
um it's an interesting opportunity to go
back to almost the very first thing we

9364
02:26:45,670 --> 02:26:45,680
back to almost the very first thing we
 

9365
02:26:45,680 --> 02:26:46,870
back to almost the very first thing we
talked about the idea of the

9366
02:26:46,870 --> 02:26:46,880
talked about the idea of the
 

9367
02:26:46,880 --> 02:26:49,110
talked about the idea of the
mathematical olympiad because of course

9368
02:26:49,110 --> 02:26:49,120
mathematical olympiad because of course
 

9369
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:51,110
mathematical olympiad because of course
that is so the international

9370
02:26:51,110 --> 02:26:51,120
that is so the international
 

9371
02:26:51,120 --> 02:26:52,309
that is so the international
mathematical olympiad is like a

9372
02:26:52,309 --> 02:26:52,319
mathematical olympiad is like a
 

9373
02:26:52,319 --> 02:26:53,110
mathematical olympiad is like a
competition

9374
02:26:53,110 --> 02:26:53,120
competition
 

9375
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:55,349
competition
for high school students solving math

9376
02:26:55,349 --> 02:26:55,359
for high school students solving math
 

9377
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:57,110

problems and
 

9379
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:59,270
problems and
in some sense it's absolutely false to

02:26:59,270 --> 02:26:59,280
in some sense it's absolutely false to
 

9381
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:00,790
in some sense it's absolutely false to
the reality of mathematics because just

9382
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:00,800
the reality of mathematics because just
 

9383
02:27:00,800 --> 02:27:01,990
the reality of mathematics because just
as you say

9384
02:27:01,990 --> 02:27:02,000
as you say
 

9385
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:05,510
as you say
it is a contest where you win prizes

it is a contest where you win prizes
 

9387
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:09,270
it is a contest where you win prizes
um the aim is to sort of be faster than

other people
uh and you're working on sort of canned

uh and you're working on sort of canned
 

9393
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:15,110
uh and you're working on sort of canned
problems that someone already knows the

like very motivated by those
 

9405
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:25,190
like very motivated by those
competitions and like i went to the math

9406
02:27:25,190 --> 02:27:25,200
competitions and like i went to the math
 

9407
02:27:25,200 --> 02:27:26,150
competitions and like i went to the math
olympiad and

9408
02:27:26,150 --> 02:27:26,160
olympiad and
 

9409
02:27:26,160 --> 02:27:28,790
olympiad and
you won it twice and got i mean well

9410
02:27:28,790 --> 02:27:28,800
you won it twice and got i mean well
 

9411

there's something i have to explain to
 

9413
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:31,510
there's something i have to explain to
people because it says i think it says

people because it says i think it says
 

9415
02:27:31,520 --> 02:27:32,710
people because it says i think it says
on wikipedia that i won

on wikipedia that i won
 

9417
02:27:32,720 --> 02:27:35,110
on wikipedia that i won
a gold medal and in the real olympics

9418
02:27:35,110 --> 02:27:35,120
a gold medal and in the real olympics
 

9419
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:36,710
a gold medal and in the real olympics
they only give one gold medal

9420
02:27:36,710 --> 02:27:36,720
they only give one gold medal
 

9421
02:27:36,720 --> 02:27:38,389
they only give one gold medal
in each event i just have to emphasize

9422
02:27:38,389 --> 02:27:38,399
in each event i just have to emphasize
 

9423
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:39,830
in each event i just have to emphasize
that the international math olympiad

9424
02:27:39,830 --> 02:27:39,840
that the international math olympiad
 

9425
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:41,429
that the international math olympiad
is not like that the gold medal gold

9426
02:27:41,429 --> 02:27:41,439
is not like that the gold medal gold
 

9427
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:43,349
is not like that the gold medal gold

performer in terms of
 

9437
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:51,750
performer in terms of
uh achieving high scores on the problems

9438
02:27:51,750 --> 02:27:51,760
uh achieving high scores on the problems
 

9439
02:27:51,760 --> 02:27:53,110
uh achieving high scores on the problems
and they're very difficult

9440
02:27:53,110 --> 02:27:53,120
and they're very difficult
 

9441
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:54,630
and they're very difficult
so you've achieved a high level of

in this very specialized skill and by
 

9447
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:59,830
in this very specialized skill and by
the way it was very it was a very cold

the way it was very it was a very cold
 

9449
02:27:59,840 --> 02:28:02,070
the way it was very it was a very cold
war activity you know when in 1987 the

to get there
 

9459
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:10,150
to get there

or somebody my age or somebody older
 

9475
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:29,990
or somebody my age or somebody older
who've taken a bunch of math but wants

9476
02:28:29,990 --> 02:28:30,000
who've taken a bunch of math but wants
 

9477
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:31,990
who've taken a bunch of math but wants
to rediscover the beauty of math

idea
 

9635
02:30:49,439 --> 02:30:50,710
idea
and i was like why is that a stupid idea

9636
02:30:50,710 --> 02:30:50,720
and i was like why is that a stupid idea
 

9637
02:30:50,720 --> 02:30:52,230
and i was like why is that a stupid idea
then i would know more algebraic

9638
02:30:52,230 --> 02:30:52,240
then i would know more algebraic
 

9639
02:30:52,240 --> 02:30:53,190
then i would know more algebraic
geometries like because you're not

9640
02:30:53,190 --> 02:30:53,200
geometries like because you're not
 

9641
02:30:53,200 --> 02:30:55,750
geometries like because you're not
actually gonna do it like you learn

9642
02:30:55,750 --> 02:30:55,760
actually gonna do it like you learn
 

9643
02:30:55,760 --> 02:30:56,950
actually gonna do it like you learn
i mean he knew me well enough to say

9644
02:30:56,950 --> 02:30:56,960
i mean he knew me well enough to say
 

9645
02:30:56,960 --> 02:30:58,150
i mean he knew me well enough to say
like you're gonna learn because you're

9646
02:30:58,150 --> 02:30:58,160
like you're gonna learn because you're
 

9647
02:30:58,160 --> 02:30:59,510
like you're gonna learn because you're
gonna be working on a problem and then

9648
02:30:59,510 --> 02:30:59,520
gonna be working on a problem and then
 

9649
02:30:59,520 --> 02:31:01,190
gonna be working on a problem and then
there's going to be a fact from ega you

9650
02:31:01,190 --> 02:31:01,200
there's going to be a fact from ega you
 

9651
02:31:01,200 --> 02:31:03,030
there's going to be a fact from ega you
need in order to solve your problem that

9652
02:31:03,030 --> 02:31:03,040
need in order to solve your problem that
 

9653
02:31:03,040 --> 02:31:04,309
need in order to solve your problem that
you want to solve and that's how you're

9654
02:31:04,309 --> 02:31:04,319
you want to solve and that's how you're
 

9655
02:31:04,319 --> 02:31:05,110
you want to solve and that's how you're
going to learn it

9656
02:31:05,110 --> 02:31:05,120
going to learn it
 

9657
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:06,309
going to learn it
you're not going to learn it without a

9658
02:31:06,309 --> 02:31:06,319
you're not going to learn it without a
 

9659
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:08,309
you're not going to learn it without a
problem to bring you into it and so for

9660
02:31:08,309 --> 02:31:08,319
problem to bring you into it and so for
 

9661
02:31:08,319 --> 02:31:09,270
problem to bring you into it and so for
a lot of people

9662
02:31:09,270 --> 02:31:09,280
a lot of people
 

9663
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:11,190
a lot of people
i think if you're like i'm trying to

9664
02:31:11,190 --> 02:31:11,200
i think if you're like i'm trying to
 

9665
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:13,190
i think if you're like i'm trying to
understand machine learning and i'm like

9666
02:31:13,190 --> 02:31:13,200
understand machine learning and i'm like
 

9667
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:14,630
understand machine learning and i'm like
i can see that there's sort of some

9668
02:31:14,630 --> 02:31:14,640
i can see that there's sort of some
 

9669
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:16,950
i can see that there's sort of some
mathematical technology that i

9670
02:31:16,950 --> 02:31:16,960
mathematical technology that i
 

9671
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:21,590
mathematical technology that i
don't have i think you like let

9672
02:31:21,590 --> 02:31:21,600
don't have i think you like let
 

9673
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:23,429
don't have i think you like let
that problem that you actually care

9674
02:31:23,429 --> 02:31:23,439
that problem that you actually care
 

9675
02:31:23,439 --> 02:31:24,710
that problem that you actually care
about

9676
02:31:24,710 --> 02:31:24,720
about
 

9677
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:26,469
about
drive your learning i mean one thing

9678
02:31:26,469 --> 02:31:26,479
drive your learning i mean one thing
 

9679
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:27,910
drive your learning i mean one thing
i've learned from advising students you

9680
02:31:27,910 --> 02:31:27,920
i've learned from advising students you
 

9681
02:31:27,920 --> 02:31:29,830
i've learned from advising students you
know

9682
02:31:29,830 --> 02:31:29,840
know
 

9683
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:32,950
know
math is really hard in fact anything

9684
02:31:32,950 --> 02:31:32,960
math is really hard in fact anything
 

9685
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:34,070
math is really hard in fact anything
that you do

9686
02:31:34,070 --> 02:31:34,080
that you do
 

9687
02:31:34,080 --> 02:31:37,990
that you do
right is hard um

9688
02:31:37,990 --> 02:31:38,000
right is hard um
 

9689
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:40,309
right is hard um
and because it's hard like you might

9690
02:31:40,309 --> 02:31:40,319
and because it's hard like you might
 

9691
02:31:40,319 --> 02:31:41,670
and because it's hard like you might
sort of have some idea that somebody

9692
02:31:41,670 --> 02:31:41,680
sort of have some idea that somebody
 

9693
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:43,349
sort of have some idea that somebody
else gives you oh i should learn

9694
02:31:43,349 --> 02:31:43,359
else gives you oh i should learn
 

9695
02:31:43,359 --> 02:31:45,270
else gives you oh i should learn
x y and z well if you don't actually

9696
02:31:45,270 --> 02:31:45,280
x y and z well if you don't actually
 

9697
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:46,550
x y and z well if you don't actually
care you're not going to do it you might

9698
02:31:46,550 --> 02:31:46,560
care you're not going to do it you might
 

9699
02:31:46,560 --> 02:31:48,070
care you're not going to do it you might
feel like you should maybe somebody told

9700
02:31:48,070 --> 02:31:48,080
feel like you should maybe somebody told
 

9701
02:31:48,080 --> 02:31:48,870
feel like you should maybe somebody told
you you should

9702
02:31:48,870 --> 02:31:48,880
you you should
 

9703
02:31:48,880 --> 02:31:51,429
you you should
but i think you have to hook it to

9704
02:31:51,429 --> 02:31:51,439
but i think you have to hook it to
 

9705
02:31:51,439 --> 02:31:52,630
but i think you have to hook it to
something that you actually care about

9706
02:31:52,630 --> 02:31:52,640
something that you actually care about
 

9707
02:31:52,640 --> 02:31:54,389
something that you actually care about
so for a lot of people that's the way in

9708
02:31:54,389 --> 02:31:54,399
so for a lot of people that's the way in
 

9709
02:31:54,399 --> 02:31:55,670
so for a lot of people that's the way in
you have an engineering problem you're

9710
02:31:55,670 --> 02:31:55,680
you have an engineering problem you're
 

9711
02:31:55,680 --> 02:31:55,990
you have an engineering problem you're
trying

9712

the curriculum is

9724
02:32:06,550 --> 02:32:06,560
the curriculum is
 

9725
02:32:06,560 --> 02:32:08,389
the curriculum is
drive your mathematical learning and

9726
02:32:08,389 --> 02:32:08,399
drive your mathematical learning and
 

9727
02:32:08,399 --> 02:32:10,790
drive your mathematical learning and
also just as a brief comment

9728
02:32:10,790 --> 02:32:10,800
also just as a brief comment
 

9729
02:32:10,800 --> 02:32:12,950
also just as a brief comment
that math is hard there's a sense to

9730
02:32:12,950 --> 02:32:12,960
that math is hard there's a sense to
 

9731
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:15,110
that math is hard there's a sense to
which heart is a feature not a bug

9732
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:15,120
which heart is a feature not a bug
 

9733
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:17,349
which heart is a feature not a bug
in the sense that again this maybe this

9734
02:32:17,349 --> 02:32:17,359
in the sense that again this maybe this
 

9735
02:32:17,359 --> 02:32:19,110
in the sense that again this maybe this
is my own learning

9736
02:32:19,110 --> 02:32:19,120
is my own learning
 

9737
02:32:19,120 --> 02:32:22,950
is my own learning
preference but i think it's a value to

9738
02:32:22,950 --> 02:32:22,960
preference but i think it's a value to
 

9739
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:24,950
preference but i think it's a value to
fall in love with the process of doing

9740
02:32:24,950 --> 02:32:24,960
fall in love with the process of doing

i hate exercise to bring it down to like
 

9749
02:32:33,120 --> 02:32:35,670
i hate exercise to bring it down to like
the simplest hard

the simplest hard
 

9751
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:39,670
the simplest hard
and i enjoy the part once it's done

9752
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:39,680
and i enjoy the part once it's done
 

9753

actually do have to give
advice to two young people all the time

9930
02:35:48,309 --> 02:35:48,319
advice to two young people all the time
 

9931
02:35:48,319 --> 02:35:50,469
advice to two young people all the time
they don't listen but i still give it

9932
02:35:50,469 --> 02:35:50,479
they don't listen but i still give it

students i don't think i've actually
said this to my kids yet but i say

9938
02:35:57,429 --> 02:35:57,439
said this to my kids yet but i say
 

9939
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:00,230
said this to my kids yet but i say
to students a lot is you know you come

9940
02:36:00,230 --> 02:36:00,240
to students a lot is you know you come
 

9941
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:02,950
to students a lot is you know you come
to these decision points

9942
02:36:02,950 --> 02:36:02,960
to these decision points
 

9943
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:06,150
to these decision points
and everybody is beset by self-doubt

9944

they're capable of
like not sure what they're what they

like not sure what they're what they
 

9951
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:14,630
like not sure what they're what they
really want to do

9952
02:36:14,630 --> 02:36:14,640
really want to do
 

9953
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,469
really want to do
i always i sort of tell people like

9954
02:36:16,469 --> 02:36:16,479
i always i sort of tell people like
 

9955
02:36:16,479 --> 02:36:18,469
i always i sort of tell people like
often when you have a decision to make

9956
02:36:18,469 --> 02:36:18,479
often when you have a decision to make
 

9957
02:36:18,479 --> 02:36:21,429
often when you have a decision to make
um one of the choices is the high

9958
02:36:21,429 --> 02:36:21,439
um one of the choices is the high
 

9959
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:22,070
um one of the choices is the high
self-esteem

9960
02:36:22,070 --> 02:36:22,080
self-esteem
 

9961
02:36:22,080 --> 02:36:23,349
self-esteem
choice and i always thought make the

9962
02:36:23,349 --> 02:36:23,359
choice and i always thought make the
 

9963
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:25,429
choice and i always thought make the
high self-esteem choice make the choice

9964
02:36:25,429 --> 02:36:25,439
high self-esteem choice make the choice
 

9965
02:36:25,439 --> 02:36:28,389
high self-esteem choice make the choice
sort of take yourself out of it and like

9966
02:36:28,389 --> 02:36:28,399
sort of take yourself out of it and like
 

9967
02:36:28,399 --> 02:36:29,510
sort of take yourself out of it and like
if you didn't have those

9968
02:36:29,510 --> 02:36:29,520
if you didn't have those
 

9969
02:36:29,520 --> 02:36:31,190
if you didn't have those
you can probably figure out what the

9970
02:36:31,190 --> 02:36:31,200
you can probably figure out what the
 

9971
02:36:31,200 --> 02:36:32,710
you can probably figure out what the
version of you feels completely

9972
02:36:32,710 --> 02:36:32,720
version of you feels completely
 

9973
02:36:32,720 --> 02:36:34,870
version of you feels completely
confident would do

9974
02:36:34,870 --> 02:36:34,880
confident would do
 

9975
02:36:34,880 --> 02:36:36,469
confident would do
and do that and see what happens and i

9976
02:36:36,469 --> 02:36:36,479
and do that and see what happens and i
 

9977
02:36:36,479 --> 02:36:39,190
and do that and see what happens and i
think that's often like pretty good

9978
02:36:39,190 --> 02:36:39,200
think that's often like pretty good
 

9979
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:41,349
think that's often like pretty good
advice that's interesting sort of like

9980
02:36:41,349 --> 02:36:41,359
advice that's interesting sort of like
 

9981
02:36:41,359 --> 02:36:42,950
advice that's interesting sort of like
uh

9982
02:36:42,950 --> 02:36:42,960
uh
 

9983
02:36:42,960 --> 02:36:44,389
uh
you know like with sims you can create

9984
02:36:44,389 --> 02:36:44,399
you know like with sims you can create
 

9985
02:36:44,399 --> 02:36:46,389
you know like with sims you can create
characters like create

9986
02:36:46,389 --> 02:36:46,399
characters like create
 

9987
02:36:46,399 --> 02:36:48,550
characters like create
a character of yourself that lacks all

9988
02:36:48,550 --> 02:36:48,560
a character of yourself that lacks all
 

9989
02:36:48,560 --> 02:36:50,070
a character of yourself that lacks all
the self-doubt

9990
02:36:50,070 --> 02:36:50,080
the self-doubt
 

9991
02:36:50,080 --> 02:36:51,670
the self-doubt
right but it doesn't mean i would never

9992
02:36:51,670 --> 02:36:51,680
right but it doesn't mean i would never
 

9993
02:36:51,680 --> 02:36:54,469
right but it doesn't mean i would never
say to somebody you should just go have

9994
02:36:54,469 --> 02:36:54,479
say to somebody you should just go have
 

9995
02:36:54,479 --> 02:36:56,710
say to somebody you should just go have
high self-esteem yeah you shouldn't have

9996
02:36:56,710 --> 02:36:56,720
high self-esteem yeah you shouldn't have
 

9997
02:36:56,720 --> 02:36:57,830
high self-esteem yeah you shouldn't have
doubts no you probably should have

9998
02:36:57,830 --> 02:36:57,840
doubts no you probably should have
 

9999
02:36:57,840 --> 02:36:59,190
doubts no you probably should have
doubts it's okay to have them

10000
02:36:59,190 --> 02:36:59,200
doubts it's okay to have them
 

10001
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:01,349
doubts it's okay to have them
but sometimes it's good to act in the

10002
02:37:01,349 --> 02:37:01,359
but sometimes it's good to act in the
 

10003
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:03,270
but sometimes it's good to act in the
way that the person who didn't have them

10004
02:37:03,270 --> 02:37:03,280
way that the person who didn't have them
 

10005
02:37:03,280 --> 02:37:07,030
way that the person who didn't have them
would act um that's a really nice way to

10006
02:37:07,030 --> 02:37:07,040
would act um that's a really nice way to
 

10007
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:08,389
would act um that's a really nice way to
put it

10008
02:37:08,389 --> 02:37:08,399
put it
 

10009
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:11,270
put it
yeah that's a that's a like from a third

10010
02:37:11,270 --> 02:37:11,280
yeah that's a that's a like from a third
 

10011
02:37:11,280 --> 02:37:12,950
yeah that's a that's a like from a third
person perspective

10012
02:37:12,950 --> 02:37:12,960
person perspective
 

10013
02:37:12,960 --> 02:37:15,429
person perspective
take the part of your brain that wants

10014
02:37:15,429 --> 02:37:15,439
take the part of your brain that wants
 

10015
02:37:15,439 --> 02:37:17,990
take the part of your brain that wants
to do big things what would they do

10016
02:37:17,990 --> 02:37:18,000
to do big things what would they do
 

10017
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:19,830
to do big things what would they do
that's not afraid to do those things

10018
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:19,840
that's not afraid to do those things
 

10019
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,429
that's not afraid to do those things
what would they do

10020
02:37:21,429 --> 02:37:21,439
what would they do
 

10021
02:37:21,439 --> 02:37:24,469
what would they do
yeah that's that's really nice that's

10022
02:37:24,469 --> 02:37:24,479
yeah that's that's really nice that's
 

10023
02:37:24,479 --> 02:37:25,910
yeah that's that's really nice that's
actually a really nice way to formulate

10024
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:25,920
actually a really nice way to formulate
 

10025
02:37:25,920 --> 02:37:27,510
actually a really nice way to formulate
it that's very practical advice you

10026
02:37:27,510 --> 02:37:27,520
it that's very practical advice you
 

10027
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:31,030
it that's very practical advice you
should give it to your kids

10028
02:37:31,030 --> 02:37:31,040

 

10029
02:37:31,040 --> 02:37:32,469

do you think there's meaning to any of

10030
02:37:32,469 --> 02:37:32,479
do you think there's meaning to any of
 

10031
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:34,790
do you think there's meaning to any of
it from a mathematical perspective

10032
02:37:34,790 --> 02:37:34,800
it from a mathematical perspective
 

10033
02:37:34,800 --> 02:37:38,950
it from a mathematical perspective
this life if i were to ask you

10034
02:37:38,950 --> 02:37:38,960
this life if i were to ask you
 

10035
02:37:38,960 --> 02:37:41,270
this life if i were to ask you
we're talking about primes talking about

10036
02:37:41,270 --> 02:37:41,280
we're talking about primes talking about
 

10037
02:37:41,280 --> 02:37:43,429
we're talking about primes talking about
proving stuff

10038
02:37:43,429 --> 02:37:43,439
proving stuff
 

10039
02:37:43,439 --> 02:37:46,230
proving stuff
can we say and then the book that god

10040
02:37:46,230 --> 02:37:46,240
can we say and then the book that god
 

10041
02:37:46,240 --> 02:37:47,270
can we say and then the book that god
has

10042
02:37:47,270 --> 02:37:47,280
has
 

10043
02:37:47,280 --> 02:37:49,590
has
that mathematics allows us to arrive at

10044
02:37:49,590 --> 02:37:49,600
that mathematics allows us to arrive at
 

10045
02:37:49,600 --> 02:37:50,469
that mathematics allows us to arrive at
something about

10046
02:37:50,469 --> 02:37:50,479
something about
 

10047
02:37:50,479 --> 02:37:52,710
something about
in that book there's certainly a chapter

10048
02:37:52,710 --> 02:37:52,720
in that book there's certainly a chapter
 

10049
02:37:52,720 --> 02:37:54,870
in that book there's certainly a chapter
on the meaning of life in that book

10050
02:37:54,870 --> 02:37:54,880
on the meaning of life in that book
 

10051
02:37:54,880 --> 02:37:57,429
on the meaning of life in that book
do you think we humans can get to it and

10052
02:37:57,429 --> 02:37:57,439
do you think we humans can get to it and
 

10053
02:37:57,439 --> 02:37:58,150
do you think we humans can get to it and
maybe

10054
02:37:58,150 --> 02:37:58,160
maybe
 

10055
02:37:58,160 --> 02:37:59,590
maybe
if you were to write cliff notes what do

10056
02:37:59,590 --> 02:37:59,600
if you were to write cliff notes what do
 

10057
02:37:59,600 --> 02:38:01,429
if you were to write cliff notes what do
you suspect those cliff notes would say

10058
02:38:01,429 --> 02:38:01,439
you suspect those cliff notes would say
 

10059
02:38:01,439 --> 02:38:03,349
you suspect those cliff notes would say
i mean look the way i feel is that you

10060
02:38:03,349 --> 02:38:03,359
i mean look the way i feel is that you
 

10061
02:38:03,359 --> 02:38:04,790
i mean look the way i feel is that you
know mathematics

10062
02:38:04,790 --> 02:38:04,800
know mathematics
 

10063
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:07,110
know mathematics
as we've discussed like it underlies the

10064
02:38:07,110 --> 02:38:07,120
as we've discussed like it underlies the
 

10065
02:38:07,120 --> 02:38:07,830
as we've discussed like it underlies the
way we think about

10066
02:38:07,830 --> 02:38:07,840
way we think about
 

10067
02:38:07,840 --> 02:38:09,270
way we think about
constructing learning machines and

10068
02:38:09,270 --> 02:38:09,280
constructing learning machines and
 

10069
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:11,030
constructing learning machines and
underlies physics

10070
02:38:11,030 --> 02:38:11,040
underlies physics
 

10071
02:38:11,040 --> 02:38:13,670
underlies physics
um it can be used i mean it does all

10072
02:38:13,670 --> 02:38:13,680
um it can be used i mean it does all
 

10073
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,590
um it can be used i mean it does all
this stuff

10074
02:38:15,590 --> 02:38:15,600
this stuff
 

10075
02:38:15,600 --> 02:38:17,110
this stuff
and also you want the meaning of life i

10076
02:38:17,110 --> 02:38:17,120
and also you want the meaning of life i
 

10077
02:38:17,120 --> 02:38:18,550
and also you want the meaning of life i
mean it's like we already did a lot for

10078
02:38:18,550 --> 02:38:18,560
mean it's like we already did a lot for
 

10079
02:38:18,560 --> 02:38:19,990
mean it's like we already did a lot for
you like ask a rabbi

10080
02:38:19,990 --> 02:38:20,000
you like ask a rabbi
 

10081
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:22,469
you like ask a rabbi
[Laughter]

10082
02:38:22,469 --> 02:38:22,479
[Laughter]
 

10083
02:38:22,479 --> 02:38:24,630
[Laughter]
no i mean yeah you know i wrote a lot in

02:38:39,349 --> 02:38:39,359
pascal's wager i mean he's probably
 

10103
02:38:39,359 --> 02:38:40,550
pascal's wager i mean he's probably
among all mathematicians he's the ones

10104
02:38:40,550 --> 02:38:40,560
among all mathematicians he's the ones
 

10105

can you actually like apply mathematics

10108
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:44,000
can you actually like apply mathematics
 

10109
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:45,349
can you actually like apply mathematics
to kind of

10110
02:38:45,349 --> 02:38:45,359
to kind of
 

10111
02:38:45,359 --> 02:38:49,030
to kind of
these transcendent questions

10112
02:38:49,030 --> 02:38:49,040
these transcendent questions
 

10113
02:38:49,040 --> 02:38:51,030
these transcendent questions
um but what's interesting when i really

10114
02:38:51,030 --> 02:38:51,040
um but what's interesting when i really
 

10115
02:38:51,040 --> 02:38:52,950
um but what's interesting when i really
read pascal

10116
02:38:52,950 --> 02:38:52,960
read pascal
 

10117
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,630
read pascal
about what he wrote about this you know

10118
02:38:54,630 --> 02:38:54,640
about what he wrote about this you know
 

10119
02:38:54,640 --> 02:38:56,150
about what he wrote about this you know
i started to see that people often think

10120
02:38:56,150 --> 02:38:56,160
i started to see that people often think
 

10121
02:38:56,160 --> 02:38:57,990
i started to see that people often think
oh this is him saying i'm gonna use

10122
02:38:57,990 --> 02:38:58,000
oh this is him saying i'm gonna use
 

10123
02:38:58,000 --> 02:38:59,910
oh this is him saying i'm gonna use
mathematics

10124
02:38:59,910 --> 02:38:59,920
mathematics
 

10125
02:38:59,920 --> 02:39:02,150
mathematics
to sort of show you why you should

10126
02:39:02,150 --> 02:39:02,160
to sort of show you why you should
 

10127
02:39:02,160 --> 02:39:03,190
to sort of show you why you should
believe in god

10128
02:39:03,190 --> 02:39:03,200
believe in god
 

10129
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:04,790
believe in god
you know to really that's this

10130
02:39:04,790 --> 02:39:04,800
you know to really that's this
 

10131
02:39:04,800 --> 02:39:05,990
you know to really that's this
mathematics has the answer to this

10132
02:39:05,990 --> 02:39:06,000
mathematics has the answer to this
 

10133
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:06,710
mathematics has the answer to this
question

10134
02:39:06,710 --> 02:39:06,720
question
 

10135
02:39:06,720 --> 02:39:08,950
question
um but he really doesn't say that he

10136
02:39:08,950 --> 02:39:08,960
um but he really doesn't say that he
 

10137
02:39:08,960 --> 02:39:11,030
um but he really doesn't say that he
almost kind of says

10138
02:39:11,030 --> 02:39:11,040
almost kind of says
 

10139
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:13,030
almost kind of says
the opposite if you ask blaise pascal

10140
02:39:13,030 --> 02:39:13,040
the opposite if you ask blaise pascal
 

10141
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:14,469
the opposite if you ask blaise pascal
like why do you believe in god

10142
02:39:14,469 --> 02:39:14,479
like why do you believe in god
 

10143
02:39:14,479 --> 02:39:16,389
like why do you believe in god
it's he'd be like oh because i met god

10144
02:39:16,389 --> 02:39:16,399
it's he'd be like oh because i met god
 

10145
02:39:16,399 --> 02:39:18,550
it's he'd be like oh because i met god
you know he had this kind of like

10146
02:39:18,550 --> 02:39:18,560
you know he had this kind of like
 

10147
02:39:18,560 --> 02:39:20,469
you know he had this kind of like
psychedelic experience it's like a

10148
02:39:20,469 --> 02:39:20,479
psychedelic experience it's like a
 

10149
02:39:20,479 --> 02:39:22,389
psychedelic experience it's like a
mystical experience where

10150
02:39:22,389 --> 02:39:22,399
mystical experience where
 

10151
02:39:22,399 --> 02:39:24,150
mystical experience where
as he tells it he just like directly

10152
02:39:24,150 --> 02:39:24,160
as he tells it he just like directly
 

10153
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,270
as he tells it he just like directly
encountered god and he's like okay i

10154
02:39:25,270 --> 02:39:25,280
encountered god and he's like okay i
 

10155
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:26,710
encountered god and he's like okay i
guess there's a god i met him last night

10156
02:39:26,710 --> 02:39:26,720
guess there's a god i met him last night
 

10157
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:27,429
guess there's a god i met him last night
so that's

10158
02:39:27,429 --> 02:39:27,439
so that's
 

10159
02:39:27,439 --> 02:39:29,030
so that's
that's it that's why he believed it

10160
02:39:29,030 --> 02:39:29,040
that's it that's why he believed it
 

10161
02:39:29,040 --> 02:39:30,389
that's it that's why he believed it
didn't have to do with any kind you know

10162
02:39:30,389 --> 02:39:30,399
didn't have to do with any kind you know
 

10163
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:32,469
didn't have to do with any kind you know
the mathematical argument was like

10164
02:39:32,469 --> 02:39:32,479
the mathematical argument was like
 

10165
02:39:32,479 --> 02:39:36,070
the mathematical argument was like
um about certain reasons for behaving in

10166
02:39:36,070 --> 02:39:36,080
um about certain reasons for behaving in
 

10167
02:39:36,080 --> 02:39:37,910
um about certain reasons for behaving in
a certain way but he basically said like

10168
02:39:37,910 --> 02:39:37,920
a certain way but he basically said like
 

10169
02:39:37,920 --> 02:39:40,070
a certain way but he basically said like
look like math doesn't tell you that

10170
02:39:40,070 --> 02:39:40,080
look like math doesn't tell you that
 

10171
02:39:40,080 --> 02:39:42,389
look like math doesn't tell you that
god's there or not like if god's there

10172
02:39:42,389 --> 02:39:42,399
god's there or not like if god's there
 

10173

the way you explore math in your writing

10202
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:14,080
the way you explore math in your writing
 

10203
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,590
the way you explore math in your writing
the the willingness to be specific

10204
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:17,600
the the willingness to be specific
 

10205
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,630

stepping outside and figuring out
 

10211
02:40:24,319 --> 02:40:26,630
stepping outside and figuring out
beautiful stuff and i love the chart

10212

at the opening of uh your new book

10214
02:40:30,230 --> 02:40:30,240
at the opening of uh your new book
 

10215
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,309
at the opening of uh your new book
that shows the chaos the mess that is

10216

your mind yes this is what i was trying

10218
02:40:34,389 --> 02:40:34,399
your mind yes this is what i was trying
 

10219
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:35,510
your mind yes this is what i was trying
to keep in my head

10220
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:35,520
to keep in my head
 

10221
02:40:35,520 --> 02:40:38,870
to keep in my head
all at once while i was writing and um

10222
02:40:38,870 --> 02:40:38,880
all at once while i was writing and um
 

10223
02:40:38,880 --> 02:40:39,830
all at once while i was writing and um
i probably should have drawn this

10224
02:40:39,830 --> 02:40:39,840
i probably should have drawn this
 

10225
02:40:39,840 --> 02:40:41,349
i probably should have drawn this
picture earlier in the process maybe it

10226
02:40:41,349 --> 02:40:41,359
picture earlier in the process maybe it
 

10227
02:40:41,359 --> 02:40:43,110
picture earlier in the process maybe it
would have made my organization easier i

10228
02:40:43,110 --> 02:40:43,120
would have made my organization easier i
 

10229
02:40:43,120 --> 02:40:45,269
would have made my organization easier i
actually drew it only at the end

10230
02:40:45,269 --> 02:40:45,279
actually drew it only at the end
 

10231
02:40:45,279 --> 02:40:47,349
actually drew it only at the end
and many of the things we talked about

10232
02:40:47,349 --> 02:40:47,359
and many of the things we talked about
 

10233
02:40:47,359 --> 02:40:48,550
and many of the things we talked about
are on this map

10234
02:40:48,550 --> 02:40:48,560
are on this map
 

10235
02:40:48,560 --> 02:40:51,110
are on this map
the connections are yet to be fully

10236
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:51,120
the connections are yet to be fully
 

10237
02:40:51,120 --> 02:40:54,630
the connections are yet to be fully
dissected and investigated and yes

10238
02:40:54,630 --> 02:40:54,640
dissected and investigated and yes
 

10239
02:40:54,640 --> 02:40:57,429
dissected and investigated and yes
