because in my opinion
there's so much development to have

506
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:51,279
there's so much development to have
 

507
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,470
there's so much development to have
happen

508
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:52,480
happen
 

509
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,870
happen
i mean when when you need to learn

510
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:54,880
i mean when when you need to learn

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,750
i mean when when you need to learn
wrestling you need to be wrestling

wrestling you need to be wrestling
and as you get older um you your body

514
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
and as you get older um you your body
 

515
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,269
and as you get older um you your body
won't do it anymore

516
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:03,279
won't do it anymore
 

517
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,910

00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:08,640
probably a relaxed approach so if you
 

521
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,750
probably a relaxed approach so if you
have to choose between two athletes

522
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
have to choose between two athletes
 

523
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,710
have to choose between two athletes

541
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,150
but where i got really really good was a
repetition

542
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,160
repetition
 

543
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,630
repetition
and i was disciplined enough to know

544
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
and i was disciplined enough to know
 

545
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,190
and i was disciplined enough to know
that the things that you hate

546
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:39,200
that the things that you hate
 

547
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,870
that the things that you hate
to do in this sport are the things that

548
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:40,880
to do in this sport are the things that

make you the very best
 

551
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,550
make you the very best
and that is a rare ingredient as i've

552
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
and that is a rare ingredient as i've
 

553
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,110
and that is a rare ingredient as i've
gotten older and you spend a lot of time

554
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:47,120
gotten older and you spend a lot of time
 

555
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,150
gotten older and you spend a lot of time
communicating that to younger athletes

556
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:50,160
communicating that to younger athletes
 

557
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,590
communicating that to younger athletes
so the thing

558
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:51,600

and the conversation starts like this i
 

857
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:43,990
and the conversation starts like this i
don't have time to waste it neither do

858
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
don't have time to waste it neither do
 

859
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,949
don't have time to waste it neither do
you

accountable then we are we aren't taking
the time to go through this

874
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,199
the time to go through this
 

875
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,949
the time to go through this
we're already on our way to solving the

876
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
we're already on our way to solving the
 

877
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,110
we're already on our way to solving the
problem problem can't be solved without

878
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:03,120
problem problem can't be solved without
 

879
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,030
problem problem can't be solved without
that understanding

880
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,040
that understanding
 

881
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,150
that understanding
and that's

882
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
and that's
 

883
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,750
and that's
has to do with symptoms that you see in

905
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,430
think anybody could be better than him
and then all of a sudden this gene

906
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
and then all of a sudden this gene
 

907
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,269
and then all of a sudden this gene
taylor guy came in and i didn't and then

you know was just like fred and maybe
even a little bit more current and then

916
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
even a little bit more current and then
 

917
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,670
even a little bit more current and then
he ended up taking a job at kansas state

918
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:37,680
he ended up taking a job at kansas state

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,509
and then this this lady barbara burke
comes in

924
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
comes in
 

925
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,949
comes in
and i didn't think anybody could be

926
00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:44,959
and i didn't think anybody could be
 

927
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,949
and i didn't think anybody could be
better than gene taylor or fred mims and

928
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
better than gene taylor or fred mims and
 

929
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,030

this barbara burke she's better than
 

931
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,150
this barbara burke she's better than
both of them

932
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:50,160
both of them
 

933
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,749
both of them
and the reason why is because she's a

934
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:51,759
and the reason why is because she's a
 

935
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,069
and the reason why is because she's a
problem solver she doesn't waste time

936
00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:54,079
problem solver she doesn't waste time
 

937
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,310
problem solver she doesn't waste time
she's direct and she's a problem solver

938
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
she's direct and she's a problem solver
 

939
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,310
she's direct and she's a problem solver
and that's what we need you need problem

940
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,320
and that's what we need you need problem
 

941
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,110
and that's what we need you need problem
solvers

942
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120

 

943
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,189

so on the flip side

944
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:03,199
so on the flip side
 

945
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,230
so on the flip side
of

946
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
of
 

947
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,870
of
problems and technique and repetition

948
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:06,880
problems and technique and repetition
 

949
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,670
problems and technique and repetition
here's a a thing called toughness mental

950
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
here's a a thing called toughness mental

953
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,350
toughness
something that maybe you or maybe even

954
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:13,360
something that maybe you or maybe even
 

955
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,030
something that maybe you or maybe even
iowa in general is a little bit known

956
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,040
iowa in general is a little bit known
 

957
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,910

for so how do you train mental toughness

958
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:17,920
for so how do you train mental toughness
 

959
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,509
for so how do you train mental toughness
as a coach you train metal toughness by

as a coach you train metal toughness by
putting them in situations that

962
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:24,560
putting them in situations that
 

963
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,389
putting them in situations that
they're

964
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
they're
 

965
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,910
they're
willing to go through but don't think

willing to go through but don't think
 

967
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,189
willing to go through but don't think
they can make it and then they go

968
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
they can make it and then they go
 

969
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:29,990
they can make it and then they go
through it and then all of a sudden

970
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:30,000
through it and then all of a sudden
 

971
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,749
through it and then all of a sudden
those marries are down

972
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
those marries are down
 

973
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,749
those marries are down
does that have to do

974
00:16:33,749 --> 00:16:33,759
does that have to do
 

975
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,550
does that have to do
with physical usually exhaustion

976
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:36,560
with physical usually exhaustion
 

977
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,230
with physical usually exhaustion
the reps on the ropes it has to do with

978
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:40,240

flinch on that starter block
 

3079
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,190
flinch on that starter block
it's a false start you can't twitch a

3080
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
it's a false start you can't twitch a
 

3081

was already in the water and so he took

3102
00:52:56,950 --> 00:52:56,960
was already in the water and so he took
 

3103
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,190
was already in the water and so he took
off like a bat out of you nowhere

3104
00:52:59,190 --> 00:52:59,200
off like a bat out of you nowhere
 

3105
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,950
off like a bat out of you nowhere
for the end of the pool and couldn't

3106
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:00,960
for the end of the pool and couldn't
 

3107
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,470
for the end of the pool and couldn't
hear me and got to the end of the pool

3108
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
hear me and got to the end of the pool
 

3109
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,470
hear me and got to the end of the pool
and it was a down and back

3110
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:04,480
and it was a down and back
 

3111
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:06,549
and it was a down and back
well that's a hard thing to do with a

3112
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:06,559
well that's a hard thing to do with a
 

3113
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:09,030
well that's a hard thing to do with a
guy with no body fat and so he burned a

3114
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:09,040
guy with no body fat and so he burned a
 

3115
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,430
guy with no body fat and so he burned a
lot of energy and he come up on that end

3116
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
lot of energy and he come up on that end
 

3117
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,630
lot of energy and he come up on that end
of the pool and he was like where's

3118
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:12,640
of the pool and he was like where's
 

3119
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,710
of the pool and he was like where's
where's he actually didn't see me

3120
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
where's he actually didn't see me
 

3121
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,309
where's he actually didn't see me
and so we stopped him and then he came

3122
00:53:16,309 --> 00:53:16,319
and so we stopped him and then he came
 

3123
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:17,990
and so we stopped him and then he came
back and then we went another one and i

3124
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
back and then we went another one and i
 

3125
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,750
back and then we went another one and i
beat him

3126
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:19,760
beat him
 

3127
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,990
beat him
but it's the only time that

3128
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,000
but it's the only time that
 

3129
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,910
but it's the only time that
you know i wouldn't say that he was

3130
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:23,920
you know i wouldn't say that he was
 

3131
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,069
you know i wouldn't say that he was
tuckered out and that's a reason why

3132
00:53:26,069 --> 00:53:26,079
tuckered out and that's a reason why
 

3133
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,589
tuckered out and that's a reason why
and i'll also say this we did a time

3134
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
and i'll also say this we did a time
 

3135

wall
 

3143
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,190

and then we timed his the actual race

3144
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:41,200
and then we timed his the actual race
 

3145
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,630
and then we timed his the actual race
where once he hit the wall we timed him

3146
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:42,640
where once he hit the wall we timed him
