Magellan's crew was first to
circumnavigate the globe but he died I

166
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
circumnavigate the globe but he died I
 

167
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,100
circumnavigate the globe but he died I
think people don't know like halfway

168
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,110
think people don't know like halfway
 

169
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,330
think people don't know like halfway
through and so did 242 of the 260

170
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:32,340
through and so did 242 of the 260
 

171
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:33,949
through and so did 242 of the 260
sailors that took that three-year

172
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:33,959
sailors that took that three-year
 

173
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:36,590
sailors that took that three-year
journey what do you think it was like

174
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:36,600
journey what do you think it was like
 

175
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,840
journey what do you think it was like
for that crew at that time heading out

176
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:38,850
for that crew at that time heading out
 

177
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,720
for that crew at that time heading out
into the unknown to face probably likely

178
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:41,730
into the unknown to face probably likely
 

179
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:44,900
into the unknown to face probably likely
death do you think they were filled with

180
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:44,910
death do you think they were filled with
 

181
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,280
death do you think they were filled with
fear with excitement

182
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,290
fear with excitement
 

183
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,920
fear with excitement
probably not fear I think in all of

184
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:48,930
probably not fear I think in all of
 

185
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,900
probably not fear I think in all of
exploration is the challenge and the

186
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:50,910
exploration is the challenge and the
 

187
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,530
exploration is the challenge and the
unknown

188
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:51,540
unknown
 

189
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,380
unknown
so probably wonderment and then just the

190
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:54,390
so probably wonderment and then just the
 

191
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:56,390
so probably wonderment and then just the
when you really are sailing the world's

192
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:56,400
when you really are sailing the world's
 

193
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,440
when you really are sailing the world's
oceans you have extreme weather of all

194
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:00,450
oceans you have extreme weather of all
 

195
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,840
oceans you have extreme weather of all
kinds when we were circumnavigating it

196
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:02,850
kinds when we were circumnavigating it
 

197
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,360
kinds when we were circumnavigating it
was challenging a new dynamic you really

198
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:05,370
was challenging a new dynamic you really
 

199
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,820
was challenging a new dynamic you really
appreciate Mother Earth you appreciate

200
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:07,830
appreciate Mother Earth you appreciate
 

201
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,990
appreciate Mother Earth you appreciate
the winds of the ways so back to

202
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:09,000
the winds of the ways so back to
 

203
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,070
the winds of the ways so back to
Magellan his crew since they really

204
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:12,080
Magellan his crew since they really
 

205
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,110
Magellan his crew since they really
didn't have you know a three-dimensional

206
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
didn't have you know a three-dimensional
 

207
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,719
didn't have you know a three-dimensional
of the globe of the earth when they went

208
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:17,729
of the globe of the earth when they went
 

209
00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:19,759
of the globe of the earth when they went
out just probably looking over the

210
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:19,769
out just probably looking over the
 

211
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:21,080
out just probably looking over the
horizon thinking what's there what's

212
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,090
horizon thinking what's there what's
 

213
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,879
horizon thinking what's there what's
there so I would say the challenge that

214
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:22,889
there so I would say the challenge that
 

215
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,129
there so I would say the challenge that
had to be really important in terms of

216
00:04:25,129 --> 00:04:25,139
had to be really important in terms of
 

217
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,930
had to be really important in terms of
the team dynamics on that leadership had

218
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:26,940
the team dynamics on that leadership had
 

219
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,570
the team dynamics on that leadership had
to be incredibly important team dynamics

220
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:29,580
to be incredibly important team dynamics
 

221
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,430
to be incredibly important team dynamics
too how do you keep people focused on

that's interesting that's probably
 

227
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,350
that's interesting that's probably
echoes of that and the space exploration

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:36,360
echoes of that and the space exploration
 

229
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,300

when we first captivated by the idea

300
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:00,840
when we first captivated by the idea
 

301
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,740
when we first captivated by the idea
that we little humans couldn't venture

324
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:27,960
Michael Collins in orbit no those three
 

325
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,779
Michael Collins in orbit no those three
man

326
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:29,789
man
 

327
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,730
man
you know doing something that just

328
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:31,740
you know doing something that just
 

329
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,820
you know doing something that just
seemed impossible seemed impossible a

330
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:33,830
seemed impossible seemed impossible a
 

331
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,679
seemed impossible seemed impossible a
decade earlier even a year earlier but

332
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:36,689
decade earlier even a year earlier but
 

333
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:39,529
decade earlier even a year earlier but
the Apollo program really inspired me

334
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:39,539
the Apollo program really inspired me
 

335
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:41,809
the Apollo program really inspired me
and then I think it actually just taught

336
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:41,819
and then I think it actually just taught
 

337
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,260
and then I think it actually just taught
me to dream to any impossible mission

338
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,270
me to dream to any impossible mission
 

339
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,110
me to dream to any impossible mission
could be possible with enough focus yeah

340
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,120
could be possible with enough focus yeah
 

341
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,369
could be possible with enough focus yeah
I'm sure you need some luck but you

342
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:49,379
I'm sure you need some luck but you
 

343
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:51,019
I'm sure you need some luck but you
definitely need the leadership you need

344
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:51,029
definitely need the leadership you need
 

345
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:53,809
definitely need the leadership you need
the the focus of the mission so since an

346
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:53,819
the the focus of the mission so since an
 

347
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:55,939
the the focus of the mission so since an
early age I thought of course people

348
00:06:55,939 --> 00:06:55,949
early age I thought of course people
 

349
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,379
early age I thought of course people
should be interplanetary of course

350
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:57,389
should be interplanetary of course
 

351
00:06:57,389 --> 00:06:58,640
should be interplanetary of course
people we need people on earth and we're

352
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:58,650
people we need people on earth and we're
 

353
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:00,200
people we need people on earth and we're
gonna have people exploring space as

354
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,210
gonna have people exploring space as
 

355
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,480
gonna have people exploring space as
well that seemed obvious you know at

356
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:02,490
well that seemed obvious you know at
 

357
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,779
well that seemed obvious you know at
that age it opened it up before we saw

358
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:05,789
that age it opened it up before we saw
 

359
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:07,820
that age it opened it up before we saw
men on the moon it was not obvious to me

360
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:07,830
men on the moon it was not obvious to me
 

361
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:10,550
men on the moon it was not obvious to me
at all but once we understood that yes

362
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
at all but once we understood that yes
 

363
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,390
at all but once we understood that yes
absolutely

364
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:11,400
absolutely
 

365
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,830
absolutely
astronauts that's what they do they

366
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:12,840
astronauts that's what they do they
 

367
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,689
astronauts that's what they do they
explore they go into space and they land

368
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:14,699
explore they go into space and they land
 

369
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,170
explore they go into space and they land
on other planets or moons so again maybe

370
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,180
on other planets or moons so again maybe
 

371
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,629
on other planets or moons so again maybe
a romanticized philosophical question

372
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:20,639
a romanticized philosophical question
 

373
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,469
a romanticized philosophical question
but when you look up at the stars

374
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:23,479
but when you look up at the stars
 

375
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,379
but when you look up at the stars
knowing that you know there's at least a

376
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:27,389
knowing that you know there's at least a
 

377
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,300

00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:29,310
hundred billion of them in the Milky Way
 

379
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,029
hundred billion of them in the Milky Way
galaxy right so we're really a small

380
00:07:32,029 --> 00:07:32,039
galaxy right so we're really a small
 

381
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,089
galaxy right so we're really a small
speck in this giant thing that's the

382
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:35,099
speck in this giant thing that's the
 

383
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,459
speck in this giant thing that's the
visible universe how does that make you

384
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:37,469
visible universe how does that make you
 

385
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:40,790
visible universe how does that make you
feel about our efforts here I love the

until you mentioned just now the solar

394
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:48,599
until you mentioned just now the solar
 

395
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,209
until you mentioned just now the solar
system the Milky Way because I really

396
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:50,219
system the Milky Way because I really
 

397
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,159
system the Milky Way because I really
think it's really important to know that

398
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:52,169
think it's really important to know that
 

399
00:07:52,169 --> 00:07:53,990
think it's really important to know that
we're just a small pill blue dot we're

we're just a small pill blue dot we're
 

401
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,639
we're just a small pill blue dot we're
really fortunate we're on the best

planet by far life is fantastic that we

404
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,500
planet by far life is fantastic that we
 

405
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,379
planet by far life is fantastic that we
know of you're confident this is the

406

know of you're confident this is the
 

407
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:04,159
know of you're confident this is the
best planet that we know of I mean I

408
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:04,169
best planet that we know of I mean I
 

409
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:05,689
best planet that we know of I mean I
searched my research as you know in

410
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:05,699
searched my research as you know in
 

411
00:08:05,699 --> 00:08:07,100
searched my research as you know in
mission worlds and when will we find

412
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:07,110
mission worlds and when will we find
 

413
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:09,110
mission worlds and when will we find
life I think actually in probably the

414
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:09,120
life I think actually in probably the
 

415
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,659
life I think actually in probably the
next decade we find probably past life

416
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:11,669
next decade we find probably past life
 

417
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:13,399
next decade we find probably past life
probably the evidence of past life on

418
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:13,409
probably the evidence of past life on
 

419
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,320
probably the evidence of past life on
Mars let's say you think there was

420
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,330
Mars let's say you think there was
 

421
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:18,230
Mars let's say you think there was
pretty like once life on Mars or do you

422
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,240
pretty like once life on Mars or do you
 

423
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,209
pretty like once life on Mars or do you
think there's currently I'm more

424
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:20,219
think there's currently I'm more
 

425
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:21,889
think there's currently I'm more
comfortable saying about 3.5 billion

426
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:21,899
comfortable saying about 3.5 billion
 

427
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:24,110
comfortable saying about 3.5 billion
years ago feel pretty confident there

428
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:24,120
years ago feel pretty confident there
 

429
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,850
years ago feel pretty confident there
was life on Mars just because then it

430
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:25,860
was life on Mars just because then it
 

431
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,309
was life on Mars just because then it
had an electromagnetic shield it had an

432
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
had an electromagnetic shield it had an
 

433
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,800
had an electromagnetic shield it had an
atmosphere has wonderful gravity level

434
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:30,810
atmosphere has wonderful gravity level
 

435
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,839
atmosphere has wonderful gravity level
three 3s jeez fantastic you know you're

436
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:32,849
three 3s jeez fantastic you know you're
 

437
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,269
three 3s jeez fantastic you know you're
all super human we can all slam dunk a

438
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
all super human we can all slam dunk a
 

439
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,469
all super human we can all slam dunk a
basketball I mean it's gonna be fun to

440
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
basketball I mean it's gonna be fun to
 

441
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,019
basketball I mean it's gonna be fun to
play sports on Mars but so I think we'll

442
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:39,029
play sports on Mars but so I think we'll
 

443
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:41,089
play sports on Mars but so I think we'll
find past that no fossilize probably the

444
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:41,099
find past that no fossilize probably the
 

445
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,759
find past that no fossilize probably the
evidence of past life on Mars

446
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:42,769
evidence of past life on Mars
 

447
00:08:42,769 --> 00:08:44,960
evidence of past life on Mars
currently that's again we need the next

448
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:44,970
currently that's again we need the next
 

449
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,970
currently that's again we need the next
decade but the evidence is mounting for

450
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:46,980
decade but the evidence is mounting for
 

451
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,069
decade but the evidence is mounting for
sure we do have the organics we're

452
00:08:49,069 --> 00:08:49,079
sure we do have the organics we're
 

453
00:08:49,079 --> 00:08:50,990
sure we do have the organics we're
finding organics we have water seasonal

454
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,000
finding organics we have water seasonal
 

455
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,360
finding organics we have water seasonal
water on Mars we used to just know about

456
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,370
water on Mars we used to just know about
 

457
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,280
water on Mars we used to just know about
the ice caps you know north and south

458
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:55,290
the ice caps you know north and south
 

459
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,499
the ice caps you know north and south
pole now we have seasonal water we do

460
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:57,509
pole now we have seasonal water we do
 

461
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:59,420
pole now we have seasonal water we do
have the building blocks for life on

462
00:08:59,420 --> 00:08:59,430
have the building blocks for life on
 

463
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,210
have the building blocks for life on
Mars we really need to dig down into the

464
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:02,220
Mars we really need to dig down into the
 

465
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,350
Mars we really need to dig down into the
soil because everything on the top

466
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:03,360
soil because everything on the top
 

467
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,569
soil because everything on the top
surface is radiated but once we find

468
00:09:05,569 --> 00:09:05,579
surface is radiated but once we find
 

469
00:09:05,579 --> 00:09:08,150
surface is radiated but once we find
down will we see any any life form so we

470
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
down will we see any any life form so we
 

471
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,720
down will we see any any life form so we
see any bugs

472
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:08,730
see any bugs
 

473
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:11,600
see any bugs
I leave it open as a possibility but I

474
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:11,610
I leave it open as a possibility but I
 

475
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,249
I leave it open as a possibility but I
feel pretty certain that past life or

476
00:09:13,249 --> 00:09:13,259
feel pretty certain that past life or
 

477
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,470
feel pretty certain that past life or
you know fossilized life forms will find

478
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:15,480
you know fossilized life forms will find
 

479
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,540
you know fossilized life forms will find
and then we have to get to all these

480
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:17,550
and then we have to get to all these
 

481
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:20,119
and then we have to get to all these
ocean worlds these these beautiful moons

of other other planets since we know
 

485
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,139
of other other planets since we know
they have water and we're looking for

486
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:24,149
they have water and we're looking for
 

487
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:27,079
they have water and we're looking for
since simple search for life or follow

488
00:09:27,079 --> 00:09:27,089
since simple search for life or follow
 

489
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:27,559
since simple search for life or follow
the water

490
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:27,569
the water
 

491
00:09:27,569 --> 00:09:28,850
the water
you know carbon-based life that's the

492
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:28,860
you know carbon-based life that's the
 

493
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,439
you know carbon-based life that's the
only life we know there could be other

494
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:30,449
only life we know there could be other
 

495
00:09:30,449 --> 00:09:31,759
only life we know there could be other
life forms that we don't know about but

496
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:31,769
life forms that we don't know about but
 

497
00:09:31,769 --> 00:09:33,139
life forms that we don't know about but
it was hard to search for them because

498
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:33,149
it was hard to search for them because
 

499
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:35,059
it was hard to search for them because
we don't know so in our search for life

500
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:35,069
we don't know so in our search for life
 

501
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:37,160
we don't know so in our search for life
in the solar system it's definitely you

502
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:37,170
in the solar system it's definitely you
 

503
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,569
in the solar system it's definitely you
know search you know let's follow the

504
00:09:38,569 --> 00:09:38,579
know search you know let's follow the
 

505
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,400
know search you know let's follow the
water and look for the building blocks

506
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:40,410
water and look for the building blocks
 

507
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,319
water and look for the building blocks
of life do you think in the next decade

508
00:09:42,319 --> 00:09:42,329
of life do you think in the next decade
 

509
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:44,840
of life do you think in the next decade
we might see hints of past life or even

510
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:44,850
we might see hints of past life or even
 

511
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,319
we might see hints of past life or even
currently I think so I'm pretty active

512
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:48,329
currently I think so I'm pretty active
 

513
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:50,329
currently I think so I'm pretty active
you humans have to be involved or can

514
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:50,339
you humans have to be involved or can
 

515
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,850
you humans have to be involved or can
this be robots and Rovers and probably

516
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:52,860
this be robots and Rovers and probably
 

517
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,679
this be robots and Rovers and probably
teams I mean we've been at it on Mars in

518
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:54,689
teams I mean we've been at it on Mars in
 

519
00:09:54,689 --> 00:09:56,090
teams I mean we've been at it on Mars in
particularly 50 years we've been

520
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:56,100
particularly 50 years we've been
 

521
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,249
particularly 50 years we've been
exploring Mars for 50 years great day

522
00:09:58,249 --> 00:09:58,259
exploring Mars for 50 years great day
 

523
00:09:58,259 --> 00:09:59,990
exploring Mars for 50 years great day
that right our images of Mars today are

524
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:00,000
that right our images of Mars today are
 

525
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,540
that right our images of Mars today are
phenomenal now we know how Mars lost its

526
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:02,550
phenomenal now we know how Mars lost its
 

527
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,889
phenomenal now we know how Mars lost its
atmosphere you know we're starting to

528
00:10:03,889 --> 00:10:03,899
atmosphere you know we're starting to
 

529
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,689
atmosphere you know we're starting to
know because of the lack of the

530
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:05,699
know because of the lack of the
 

531
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:07,610
know because of the lack of the
electromagnetic shield we know about the

532
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:07,620
electromagnetic shield we know about the
 

533
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,170
electromagnetic shield we know about the
water in Mars so we've been studying 50

534
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:09,180
water in Mars so we've been studying 50
 

535
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,210
water in Mars so we've been studying 50
years with our robots we still haven't

536
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:11,220
years with our robots we still haven't
 

537
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,069
years with our robots we still haven't
found it so I think once we have a human

538
00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:13,079
found it so I think once we have a human
 

539
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,809
found it so I think once we have a human
mission there we just accelerate things

540
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:14,819
mission there we just accelerate things
 

541
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:16,699
mission there we just accelerate things
it's always humans and our Rovers and

542
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:16,709
it's always humans and our Rovers and
 

543
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:19,040
it's always humans and our Rovers and
robots together but we just have to

544
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,050
robots together but we just have to
 

545
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:20,540
robots together but we just have to
think that 50 years we've been looking

546
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:20,550
think that 50 years we've been looking
 

547
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:23,299
think that 50 years we've been looking
at Mars Mars and taking images and doing

548
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:23,309
at Mars Mars and taking images and doing
 

549
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:25,460
at Mars Mars and taking images and doing
the best science that we can people need

550
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:25,470
the best science that we can people need
 

551
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,230
the best science that we can people need
to realise Mars this really far away

552
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:27,240
to realise Mars this really far away
 

553
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,879
to realise Mars this really far away
it's really hard to get to you know this

554
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:28,889
it's really hard to get to you know this
 

555
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,189
it's really hard to get to you know this
is extreme extreme exploration we

556
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:31,199
is extreme extreme exploration we
 

557
00:10:31,199 --> 00:10:33,199
is extreme extreme exploration we
mentioned Magellan first or all of the

558
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:33,209
mentioned Magellan first or all of the
 

559
00:10:33,209 --> 00:10:35,030
mentioned Magellan first or all of the
wonderful explorers and sailors of the

560
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
wonderful explorers and sailors of the
 

561
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,980
wonderful explorers and sailors of the
past which kind of are lots of my

562
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:36,990
past which kind of are lots of my
 

563
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:39,499
past which kind of are lots of my
inspiration for exploration Mars is a

564
00:10:39,499 --> 00:10:39,509
inspiration for exploration Mars is a
 

565
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,389
inspiration for exploration Mars is a
different ballgame I mean no sir eight

566
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:41,399
different ballgame I mean no sir eight
 

567
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,220
different ballgame I mean no sir eight
months to get there year and a half to

568
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:43,230
months to get there year and a half to
 

569
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,559
months to get there year and a half to
get home I mean it's really extreme

570
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:45,569
get home I mean it's really extreme
 

571
00:10:45,569 --> 00:10:48,470
get home I mean it's really extreme
environment in all kinds of ways but the

572
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
environment in all kinds of ways but the
 

573
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,809
environment in all kinds of ways but the
kind of organism might be able to see

574
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:50,819
kind of organism might be able to see
 

575
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:52,389
kind of organism might be able to see
himself on Mars or kind of

576
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:52,399
himself on Mars or kind of
 

577
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,210
himself on Mars or kind of
microorganisms perhaps

578
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,220
microorganisms perhaps
 

579
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,880
microorganisms perhaps
yeah I remember that humans were canal

580
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:56,890
yeah I remember that humans were canal
 

581
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,200
yeah I remember that humans were canal
you know we're hosts right we're hosts

582
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:58,210
you know we're hosts right we're hosts
 

583
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,930
you know we're hosts right we're hosts
all of our bacteria and viruses right do

584
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:00,940
all of our bacteria and viruses right do
 

585
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,390
all of our bacteria and viruses right do
you think it's a big leap from the

586
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:03,400
you think it's a big leap from the
 

587
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,170
you think it's a big leap from the
viruses in the bacteria to us humans

588
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:06,180
viruses in the bacteria to us humans
 

589
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:09,240
viruses in the bacteria to us humans
put another way do you think on all

590
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,250
put another way do you think on all
 

591
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,630
put another way do you think on all
those moons beautiful wet moons that you

592
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
those moons beautiful wet moons that you
 

593
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,520
those moons beautiful wet moons that you
mentioned you think there's intelligent

594
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:14,530
mentioned you think there's intelligent
 

595
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:16,830
mentioned you think there's intelligent
life out there I hope so I mean that's

596
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:16,840
life out there I hope so I mean that's
 

597
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,840
life out there I hope so I mean that's
that's the hope but you know we don't

598
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:18,850
that's the hope but you know we don't
 

599
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,190
that's the hope but you know we don't
have the scientific evidence for that

600
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,200
have the scientific evidence for that
 

601
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,800
have the scientific evidence for that
now I think all the evidence we have in

602
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:22,810
now I think all the evidence we have in
 

603
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,200
now I think all the evidence we have in
terms of life existing is much more

604
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,210
terms of life existing is much more
 

605
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,490
terms of life existing is much more
compelling again because we have the

606
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:26,500
compelling again because we have the
 

607
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,800
compelling again because we have the
building blocks of life now when that

608
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:28,810
building blocks of life now when that
 

609
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:31,620
building blocks of life now when that
life turns into intelligence that's a

610
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:31,630
life turns into intelligence that's a
 

611
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,290
life turns into intelligence that's a
big unknown if we ever meet do you think

612
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:34,300
big unknown if we ever meet do you think
 

613
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,430
big unknown if we ever meet do you think
we would be able to find a common

614
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
we would be able to find a common
 

615
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,490
we would be able to find a common
language I hope so we haven't met yet

616
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:38,500
language I hope so we haven't met yet
 

617
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,040
language I hope so we haven't met yet
it's just so far I mean do physics just

618
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,050
it's just so far I mean do physics just
 

619
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:42,390
it's just so far I mean do physics just
play a role here look at all these

620
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:42,400
play a role here look at all these
 

621
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:45,120
play a role here look at all these
exoplanets 6000 exoplanets I mean even

622
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,130
exoplanets 6000 exoplanets I mean even
 

623
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,920
exoplanets 6000 exoplanets I mean even
the couple dozen earth-like planets or

624
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:46,930
the couple dozen earth-like planets or
 

625
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,780
the couple dozen earth-like planets or
exoplanets that really look like

626
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:48,790
exoplanets that really look like
 

627
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,940
exoplanets that really look like
habitable planets these are very

628
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:50,950
habitable planets these are very
 

629
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,470
habitable planets these are very
earth-like they look like they have all

630
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
earth-like they look like they have all
 

631
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,600
earth-like they look like they have all
the building blocks I can't wait to get

632
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,610
the building blocks I can't wait to get
 

633
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:56,100
the building blocks I can't wait to get
there the only thing is they're 10 to

634
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:56,110
there the only thing is they're 10 to
 

635
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,980
there the only thing is they're 10 to
100 light years away so scientifically

636
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:58,990
100 light years away so scientifically
 

637
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,810
100 light years away so scientifically

think of getting to the moon of landing

744
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:52,140
think of getting to the moon of landing
 

745
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,890
think of getting to the moon of landing
to the moon once again and then the big

746
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:54,900
to the moon once again and then the big
 

747
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:59,000
to the moon once again and then the big
step to Mars well I love you know the

748
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,010
step to Mars well I love you know the
 

749
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,830
step to Mars well I love you know the
moon program now Artemis we it is

750
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:00,840
moon program now Artemis we it is
 

751
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,480
moon program now Artemis we it is
definitely we've been in low-earth orbit

752
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:02,490
definitely we've been in low-earth orbit
 

753
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,010
definitely we've been in low-earth orbit
I love low Earth orbit too but I just

754
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:04,020
I love low Earth orbit too but I just
 

755
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,050
I love low Earth orbit too but I just
always look at those three phases so

756
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:06,060
always look at those three phases so
 

757
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,610
always look at those three phases so
Laura Thoren where we've been 40 years

758
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:07,620
Laura Thoren where we've been 40 years
 

759
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,470
Laura Thoren where we've been 40 years
so definitely time to get back to deep

760
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:09,480
so definitely time to get back to deep
 

761
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,450
so definitely time to get back to deep
space time to get to the moon there's so

762
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:11,460
space time to get to the moon there's so
 

763
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,030
space time to get to the moon there's so
much to do on the moon I hope we don't

764
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,040
much to do on the moon I hope we don't
 

765
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,010
much to do on the moon I hope we don't
get stuck on the moon for 50 years I

766
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:16,020
get stuck on the moon for 50 years I
 

767
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,720
get stuck on the moon for 50 years I
really want to get to the moon spent the

768
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:17,730
really want to get to the moon spent the
 

769
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,000
really want to get to the moon spent the
next decade first with the lander then

770
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,010
next decade first with the lander then
 

771
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,070
next decade first with the lander then
humans there's just a lot to explore but

772
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,080
humans there's just a lot to explore but
 

773
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,620
humans there's just a lot to explore but
to me is a big technology push it's only

774
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:24,630
to me is a big technology push it's only
 

775
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,060
to me is a big technology push it's only
three days away so the moon is

776
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:26,070
three days away so the moon is
 

777
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:28,370
three days away so the moon is
definitely the right place so we kind of

778
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:28,380
definitely the right place so we kind of
 

779
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,200
definitely the right place so we kind of
buy down our technology we invest in

780
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,210
buy down our technology we invest in
 

781
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:33,260
buy down our technology we invest in
specifically habitats life support

782
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,270
specifically habitats life support
 

783
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,330
specifically habitats life support
systems so we need suits we really need

784
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:35,340
systems so we need suits we really need
 

785
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,250
systems so we need suits we really need
to understand really how to live off

786
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:37,260
to understand really how to live off
 

787
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,990
to understand really how to live off
planet we've been off planet and low

788
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,000

789
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,430
planet we've been off planet and low
Earth orbit but still that's only you

790
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:40,440
Earth orbit but still that's only you
 

791
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,530
Earth orbit but still that's only you
know 400 kilometers up 20 or 50 miles

792
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:42,540
know 400 kilometers up 20 or 50 miles
 

793
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,360
know 400 kilometers up 20 or 50 miles
right so we get to the moon is really is

794
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:44,370
right so we get to the moon is really is
 

795
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,920
right so we get to the moon is really is
a great proving ground for the

796
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:45,930
a great proving ground for the
 

797
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,050
a great proving ground for the
technologies and now we're in deep space

798
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,060
technologies and now we're in deep space
 

799
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,079
technologies and now we're in deep space
radiation becomes a huge issue can to

800
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:51,089
radiation becomes a huge issue can to
 

801
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:52,850
radiation becomes a huge issue can to
keep our astronauts well alive and I

802
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:52,860
keep our astronauts well alive and I
 

803
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,700
keep our astronauts well alive and I
look at all of that investment for moon

804
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:55,710
look at all of that investment for moon
 

805
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:59,030
look at all of that investment for moon
moon exploration to the ultimate goal

806
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
moon exploration to the ultimate goal
 

807
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,770
moon exploration to the ultimate goal
you know the horizon goals we call it to

808
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:00,780
you know the horizon goals we call it to
 

809
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,670
you know the horizon goals we call it to
get people to Mars

810
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:01,680
get people to Mars
 

811
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
get people to Mars
but we just don't go to Mars tomorrow

812
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,450
but we just don't go to Mars tomorrow
 

813
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,820
but we just don't go to Mars tomorrow
right we really need a decade on the

814
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:04,830
right we really need a decade on the
 

815
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,350
right we really need a decade on the
moon I think investing in the

816
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:06,360
moon I think investing in the
 

817
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,210
moon I think investing in the
technologies learning making sure the

818
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:08,220
technologies learning making sure the
 

819
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,980
technologies learning making sure the
astronauts are their health you know

820
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:09,990
astronauts are their health you know
 

821
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,490
astronauts are their health you know
they're safe and well and also learning

822
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:12,500
they're safe and well and also learning
 

823
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,079
they're safe and well and also learning
so much institute research you know

824
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:15,089
so much institute research you know
 

825
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:17,540
so much institute research you know
utilization is are you in situ resource

826
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:17,550
utilization is are you in situ resource
 

827
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,550
utilization is are you in situ resource
utilization is huge when it comes to

828
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:19,560
utilization is huge when it comes to
 

829
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,809
utilization is huge when it comes to
exploration for the moon

830
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:20,819
exploration for the moon
 

831
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:23,650
exploration for the moon
and Marceau was need a testbed and to me

832
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:23,660
and Marceau was need a testbed and to me
 

833
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,529
and Marceau was need a testbed and to me
it really is a lunar testbed and then we

834
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:27,539
it really is a lunar testbed and then we
 

835
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:29,869
it really is a lunar testbed and then we
use those same investments to think

836
00:15:29,869 --> 00:15:29,879
use those same investments to think
 

837
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:31,460
use those same investments to think
about getting people to Mars in the

838
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:31,470
about getting people to Mars in the
 

839
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,979
about getting people to Mars in the
2030s so developing sort of a platform

840
00:15:33,979 --> 00:15:33,989
2030s so developing sort of a platform
 

841
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:35,629
2030s so developing sort of a platform
of all the kind of research tools of all

842
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:35,639
of all the kind of research tools of all
 

843
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,419
of all the kind of research tools of all
the what's the resource you know the can

844
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:38,429
the what's the resource you know the can
 

845
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:40,429
the what's the resource you know the can
you speak to that yeah so is are you for

846
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:40,439
you speak to that yeah so is are you for
 

847
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,889
you speak to that yeah so is are you for
the moon it's will go to the South Pole

848
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:42,899
the moon it's will go to the South Pole
 

849
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,759
the moon it's will go to the South Pole
and fascinating we have images of it of

850
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:46,769
and fascinating we have images of it of
 

851
00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:48,049
and fascinating we have images of it of
course we know there's permanently

852
00:15:48,049 --> 00:15:48,059
course we know there's permanently
 

853
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,479
course we know there's permanently
shaded areas and Shackleton crater and

854
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:50,489
shaded areas and Shackleton crater and
 

855
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:52,429
shaded areas and Shackleton crater and
there's areas that are permanently in

856
00:15:52,429 --> 00:15:52,439
there's areas that are permanently in
 

857
00:15:52,439 --> 00:15:55,039
there's areas that are permanently in
the Sun well it seems that there's a lot

858
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:55,049
the Sun well it seems that there's a lot
 

859
00:15:55,049 --> 00:15:57,349
the Sun well it seems that there's a lot
of water ice you know water that's in

860
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:57,359
of water ice you know water that's in
 

861
00:15:57,359 --> 00:15:59,599
of water ice you know water that's in
trapped in ice and the lunar craters

862
00:15:59,599 --> 00:15:59,609
trapped in ice and the lunar craters
 

863
00:15:59,609 --> 00:16:01,460
trapped in ice and the lunar craters
that's the first place you go why

864
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:01,470
that's the first place you go why
 

865
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,169
that's the first place you go why
because it's water and when you want to

866
00:16:03,169 --> 00:16:03,179
because it's water and when you want to
 

867
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,969
because it's water and when you want to
try to it could be fuel you know

868
00:16:04,969 --> 00:16:04,979
try to it could be fuel you know
 

869
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:07,069
try to it could be fuel you know
life-support systems so you kind of get

870
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:07,079
life-support systems so you kind of get
 

871
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,039
life-support systems so you kind of get
in you go where the water is and so when

872
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:10,049
in you go where the water is and so when
 

873
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:11,689
in you go where the water is and so when
the moon is kind of for resources

874
00:16:11,689 --> 00:16:11,699
the moon is kind of for resources
 

875
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,729
the moon is kind of for resources
utilization but to learn how to it can

876
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:13,739
utilization but to learn how to it can
 

877
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,859
utilization but to learn how to it can
we make the fuels out of the resources

878
00:16:15,859 --> 00:16:15,869
we make the fuels out of the resources
 

879
00:16:15,869 --> 00:16:17,299
we make the fuels out of the resources
that are on the moon we have to think

880
00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:17,309
that are on the moon we have to think
 

881
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,619
that are on the moon we have to think
about 3d printing right you don't get to

882
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:18,629
about 3d printing right you don't get to
 

883
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:20,479
about 3d printing right you don't get to
bring all this mass with you you have to

884
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,489
bring all this mass with you you have to
 

885
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:22,369
bring all this mass with you you have to
learn how to literally live off the land

886
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:22,379
learn how to literally live off the land
 

887
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:25,159
learn how to literally live off the land
we need a pressure shell we need to have

888
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:25,169
we need a pressure shell we need to have
 

889
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:27,769
we need a pressure shell we need to have
an atmosphere for people to to live in

890
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:27,779
an atmosphere for people to to live in
 

891
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:30,349
an atmosphere for people to to live in
so all of that is going to bind down the

892
00:16:30,349 --> 00:16:30,359
so all of that is going to bind down the
 

893
00:16:30,359 --> 00:16:32,359
so all of that is going to bind down the
technology doing the investigation doing

894
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:32,369
technology doing the investigation doing
 

895
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:34,249
technology doing the investigation doing
the science what are the basically the

896
00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:34,259
the science what are the basically the
 

897
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,279
the science what are the basically the
lunar volatiles you know what is that

898
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:36,289
lunar volatiles you know what is that
 

899
00:16:36,289 --> 00:16:39,529
lunar volatiles you know what is that
ice on the moon how much of it is there

900
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:39,539
ice on the moon how much of it is there
 

901
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:42,439
ice on the moon how much of it is there
what are the resources look like to me

902
00:16:42,439 --> 00:16:42,449
what are the resources look like to me
 

903
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:44,179
what are the resources look like to me
that helps us that's just the next step

904
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:44,189
that helps us that's just the next step
 

905
00:16:44,189 --> 00:16:46,699
that helps us that's just the next step
in getting humans to Mars and it's

906
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:46,709
in getting humans to Mars and it's
 

907
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:48,169
in getting humans to Mars and it's
cheaper and more effective to sort of

908
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:48,179
cheaper and more effective to sort of
 

909
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,669
cheaper and more effective to sort of
develop some of these difficult

910
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:49,679
develop some of these difficult
 

911
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:50,960
develop some of these difficult
challenges like solve some of these

912
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:50,970
challenges like solve some of these
 

913
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:53,149
challenges like solve some of these
challenges practice develop test and so

914
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:53,159
challenges practice develop test and so
 

915
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:53,960
challenges practice develop test and so
on on the moon

916
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:53,970
on on the moon
 

917
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,789
on on the moon
absolutely so Mars absolutely people are

918
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:55,799
absolutely so Mars absolutely people are
 

919
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:57,469
absolutely so Mars absolutely people are
gonna love to get to the moon you get to

920
00:16:57,469 --> 00:16:57,479
gonna love to get to the moon you get to
 

921
00:16:57,479 --> 00:16:59,029
gonna love to get to the moon you get to
you have a beautiful earth rise I mean

922
00:16:59,029 --> 00:16:59,039
you have a beautiful earth rise I mean
 

923
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,409
you have a beautiful earth rise I mean
you have the most magnificent view of

924
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:00,419
you have the most magnificent view of
 

925
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,289
you have the most magnificent view of
Earth being off planet so it just makes

926
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:03,299
Earth being off planet so it just makes
 

927
00:17:03,299 --> 00:17:04,699
Earth being off planet so it just makes
sense I think we're gonna have thousands

928
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:04,709
sense I think we're gonna have thousands
 

929
00:17:04,709 --> 00:17:05,840
sense I think we're gonna have thousands
lots of people hopefully tens of

930
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:05,850
lots of people hopefully tens of
 

931
00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:06,980
lots of people hopefully tens of
thousands in low-earth orbit because

932
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:06,990
thousands in low-earth orbit because
 

933
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:08,600
thousands in low-earth orbit because
Laura Thoren it's a beautiful place to

934
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:08,610
Laura Thoren it's a beautiful place to
 

935
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,069
Laura Thoren it's a beautiful place to
go and look down on the earth but people

936
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
go and look down on the earth but people
 

937
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,720
go and look down on the earth but people
want to return home I think that the

938
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:11,730
want to return home I think that the
 

939
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:13,970
want to return home I think that the
lunar explorers will also want to do

940
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:13,980
lunar explorers will also want to do
 

941
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,340
lunar explorers will also want to do
round trips and you know beyond beyond

942
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:16,350
round trips and you know beyond beyond
 

943
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,470
round trips and you know beyond beyond
the moon three-day trip explore do

944
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:18,480
the moon three-day trip explore do
 

945
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,289
the moon three-day trip explore do
science also because the lunar day is 14

946
00:17:21,289 --> 00:17:21,299
science also because the lunar day is 14
 

947
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,600
science also because the lunar day is 14
days in a lunar Nights also 14 days so

948
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:23,610
days in a lunar Nights also 14 days so
 

949
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:26,869
days in a lunar Nights also 14 days so
in that 28-day cycle half of it is in

950
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:26,879
in that 28-day cycle half of it is in
 

951
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:30,139
in that 28-day cycle half of it is in
light half of us in dark so people would

952
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:30,149
light half of us in dark so people would
 

953
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,000
light half of us in dark so people would
probably want to do you know a couple

954
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:32,010
probably want to do you know a couple
 

955
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,129
probably want to do you know a couple
week trips month long trips not longer

956
00:17:34,129 --> 00:17:34,139
week trips month long trips not longer
 

957
00:17:34,139 --> 00:17:34,640
week trips month long trips not longer
than that

958
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:34,650
than that
 

959
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,500
than that
what I mean by people what do you think

960
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:36,510
what I mean by people what do you think
 

961
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:39,790
what I mean by people what do you think
explorers yeah astronauts are gonna be

962
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:39,800
explorers yeah astronauts are gonna be
 

963
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,200
explorers yeah astronauts are gonna be
civilians in the future too not all not

964

civilians in the future too not all not
 

965
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,490
civilians in the future too not all not
all astronauts are gonna be government

966
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:43,500
all astronauts are gonna be government
 

967
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,020
all astronauts are gonna be government
astronauts actually when I was at NASA

968
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:45,030
astronauts actually when I was at NASA
 

969
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,250
astronauts actually when I was at NASA
we changed we actually got the law

970
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:46,260
we changed we actually got the law
 

971
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,950
we changed we actually got the law
changed to recognize astronauts that are

972
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:48,960
changed to recognize astronauts that are
 

973
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,480
changed to recognize astronauts that are
not only government employees you know

974
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,490
not only government employees you know
 

975
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,370
not only government employees you know
NASA astronauts or European Space Agency

976
00:17:52,370 --> 00:17:52,380
NASA astronauts or European Space Agency
 

977
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
NASA astronauts or European Space Agency
astronaut or Russian space agency that

978
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:54,390
astronaut or Russian space agency that
 

979
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,780
astronaut or Russian space agency that
astronauts because of the big push we

980
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:56,790
astronauts because of the big push we
 

981
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,370
astronauts because of the big push we
put in the private sector that

982
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,380
put in the private sector that
 

983
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,600
put in the private sector that
astronauts essentially you're gonna be

984
00:17:59,600 --> 00:17:59,610
astronauts essentially you're gonna be
 

985
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,160
astronauts essentially you're gonna be
astronauts you get over a hundred

986
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:01,170
astronauts you get over a hundred
 

987
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,980
astronauts you get over a hundred
kilometres up and I think once you've

988
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:03,990
kilometres up and I think once you've
 

989
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,950
kilometres up and I think once you've
done orbital orbital flight then you're

990
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:06,960
done orbital orbital flight then you're
 

991
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,240
done orbital orbital flight then you're
an astronaut so a lot of private

992
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:08,250
an astronaut so a lot of private
 

993
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,710
an astronaut so a lot of private
citizens are going to become astronauts

994
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:09,720
citizens are going to become astronauts
 

995
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,650
citizens are going to become astronauts
do you think one day you might step foot

996
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:12,660
do you think one day you might step foot
 

997
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,480
do you think one day you might step foot
on the moon Mars I'm gonna it's my

998
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:17,490
on the moon Mars I'm gonna it's my
 

999

life's work to get the next generation
 

1001
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,010
life's work to get the next generation
to Mars that's that's that's you are

1002
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,020
to Mars that's that's that's you are
 

1003
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,299
to Mars that's that's that's you are
even younger than you you know my

1004
00:18:23,299 --> 00:18:23,309
even younger than you you know my
 

1005
00:18:23,309 --> 00:18:25,250
even younger than you you know my
students generation yes will be the

1006
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:25,260
students generation yes will be the
 

1007
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,390

Martian explorers

1008
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
Martian explorers
 

1009
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,880
Martian explorers
I'm just working to facilitate that but

1010
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:28,890
I'm just working to facilitate that but
 

1011
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm just working to facilitate that but
that's not gonna be me

1012
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:30,090
that's not gonna be me
 

1013
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,090
that's not gonna be me
hey the moon is pretty good and it's a

1014
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:32,100
hey the moon is pretty good and it's a
 

1015
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,640
hey the moon is pretty good and it's a
lot tough I mean it's still a really

1016
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:34,650
lot tough I mean it's still a really
 

1017
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,860
lot tough I mean it's still a really
tough mission it is an extreme mission

1018
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:36,870
tough mission it is an extreme mission
 

1019
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,990
tough mission it is an extreme mission
exactly it's great for exploration but

1020
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:39,000
exactly it's great for exploration but
 

1021
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,480
exactly it's great for exploration but
doable but again before Apollo we didn't

1022
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:41,490
doable but again before Apollo we didn't
 

1023
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,430
doable but again before Apollo we didn't
think getting humans to the moon was

1024
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:43,440
think getting humans to the moon was
 

1025
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,630
think getting humans to the moon was
even possible so we kind of made that

1026
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:44,640
even possible so we kind of made that
 

1027
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,549
even possible so we kind of made that
possible but we need to go back we

1028
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
possible but we need to go back we
 

1029
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,080
possible but we need to go back we
absolutely need to go back we're

1030
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,090
absolutely need to go back we're
 

1031
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,299
absolutely need to go back we're
investing in the heavy lift launch

1032
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:49,309
investing in the heavy lift launch
 

1033
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,140
investing in the heavy lift launch
capabilities that we need to get there

1034
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,150
capabilities that we need to get there
 

1035
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,370
capabilities that we need to get there
we haven't had that you know since the

1036
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:52,380
we haven't had that you know since the
 

1037
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,140
we haven't had that you know since the
Apollo days since since Saturn five so

1038
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:54,150
Apollo days since since Saturn five so
 

1039
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,390
Apollo days since since Saturn five so
now we have three options on the board

1040
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:56,400
now we have three options on the board
 

1041
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,100
now we have three options on the board
that's what's so fantastic NASA has its

1042
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,110
that's what's so fantastic NASA has its
 

1043
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,320
that's what's so fantastic NASA has its
you know Space Launch System SpaceX is

1044
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:00,330
you know Space Launch System SpaceX is
 

1045
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:02,390
you know Space Launch System SpaceX is
gonna have its it's heavy capability and

1046
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
gonna have its it's heavy capability and
 

1047
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,790
gonna have its it's heavy capability and
Blue Origin is coming along too with

1048
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:04,800
Blue Origin is coming along too with
 

1049
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,830
Blue Origin is coming along too with
heavy lifts so that's pretty fantastic

1050
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:06,840
heavy lifts so that's pretty fantastic
 

1051
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,750
heavy lifts so that's pretty fantastic
from where I said I'm the Apollo program

1052
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:08,760
from where I said I'm the Apollo program
 

1053
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,060
from where I said I'm the Apollo program
professor today I have zero heavy lift

1054
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,070
professor today I have zero heavy lift
 

1055
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:11,900
professor today I have zero heavy lift
launch capability

1056
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:11,910
launch capability
 

1057
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,790
launch capability
I can't wait just in a few years we'll

1058
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:13,800
I can't wait just in a few years we'll
 

1059
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,169
I can't wait just in a few years we'll
have three different heavy lift launch

1060
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:15,179
have three different heavy lift launch
 

1061
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,169
have three different heavy lift launch
capabilities so that's pretty exciting

1062
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:17,179
capabilities so that's pretty exciting
 

1063
00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,120
capabilities so that's pretty exciting
you know your heart is perhaps with NASA

1064
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:20,130
you know your heart is perhaps with NASA
 

1065
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,720
you know your heart is perhaps with NASA
but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin

1066
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:22,730
but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin
 

1067
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,690
but you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin
what are your what are your thoughts of

1068
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:25,700
what are your what are your thoughts of
 

1069

what are your what are your thoughts of
SpaceX and the innovative efforts

1070
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:27,870
SpaceX and the innovative efforts
 

1071
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:30,380
SpaceX and the innovative efforts
they're from the sort of private company

1072
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,390
they're from the sort of private company
 

1073
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,960

remember that the investments in SpaceX

1076
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,280
remember that the investments in SpaceX
 

1077
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280

is government funding it's NASA funding

1078
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:37,290
is government funding it's NASA funding
 

1079
00:19:37,290 --> 00:19:39,740
is government funding it's NASA funding
is US Air Force funding just as it

1080

00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:41,700
should be because you're bettin on a
 

1083
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,020
should be because you're bettin on a
company who is moving fast has some new

1084
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,030
company who is moving fast has some new
 

1085
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,030

technology development so I love it so

1086
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,040
technology development so I love it so
 

1087
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:47,830
technology development so I love it so
when as

1088
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:47,840
when as
 

1089
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,450
when as
it really was under our public-private

1090
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:49,460
it really was under our public-private
 

1091
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,970
it really was under our public-private
partnerships so necessarily the

1092
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:51,980
partnerships so necessarily the
 

1093
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,860
partnerships so necessarily the
government needs to fund these these

1094
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:53,870
government needs to fund these these
 

1095
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,750
government needs to fund these these
startups now SpaceX is no longer a

1096
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:55,760
startups now SpaceX is no longer a
 

1097
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,039
startups now SpaceX is no longer a
start-up but you know it's been at it

1098
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:57,049
start-up but you know it's been at it
 

1099
00:19:57,049 --> 00:19:58,990
start-up but you know it's been at it
for for ten years this has some axis

1100
00:19:58,990 --> 00:19:59,000
for for ten years this has some axis
 

1101
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,539
for for ten years this has some axis
learned a lot of lessons but it's great

1102
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:01,549
learned a lot of lessons but it's great
 

1103
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:03,399
learned a lot of lessons but it's great
because it's the way you move faster and

1104
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:03,409
because it's the way you move faster and
 

1105
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:06,370
because it's the way you move faster and
also some private industry folks and

1106
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:06,380
also some private industry folks and
 

1107
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,960
also some private industry folks and
businesses will take a lot more risk

1108
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:07,970
businesses will take a lot more risk
 

1109
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,360
businesses will take a lot more risk
that's also really important for the

1110
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:10,370
that's also really important for the
 

1111
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,980
that's also really important for the
government what do you think about that

1112
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:11,990
government what do you think about that
 

1113
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,740
government what do you think about that
culture of risk I mean sort of NASA and

1114
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:14,750
culture of risk I mean sort of NASA and
 

1115
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,260
culture of risk I mean sort of NASA and
the government are exceptionally good at

1116
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:16,270
the government are exceptionally good at
 

1117
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,549
the government are exceptionally good at
delivering sort of safe like there's a

1118
00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:18,559
delivering sort of safe like there's a
 

1119
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,889
delivering sort of safe like there's a
little bit more of a culture of caution

1120
00:20:20,889 --> 00:20:20,899
little bit more of a culture of caution
 

1121
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:22,539
little bit more of a culture of caution
and safety and sort of this kind of

1122
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:22,549
and safety and sort of this kind of
 

1123
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:24,549
and safety and sort of this kind of
solid engineering and I think SpaceX

1124
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:24,559
solid engineering and I think SpaceX
 

1125
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,350
solid engineering and I think SpaceX
wall has the same kind of stuff it has a

1126
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,360
wall has the same kind of stuff it has a
 

1127
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,060
wall has the same kind of stuff it has a
little bit more of that startup feel

1128
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,070
little bit more of that startup feel
 

1129
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,950
little bit more of that startup feel
where they take the bigger risk is that

1130
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:29,960
where they take the bigger risk is that
 

1131
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,289
where they take the bigger risk is that
exciting for you to see seeing bigger

1132
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:32,299
exciting for you to see seeing bigger
 

1133
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:35,769
exciting for you to see seeing bigger
risks in this case absolutely and the

1134
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:35,779
risks in this case absolutely and the
 

1135
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:37,810
risks in this case absolutely and the
best scenario is both of them working

1136
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:37,820
best scenario is both of them working
 

1137
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,159
best scenario is both of them working
together because there's really

1138
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:39,169
together because there's really
 

1139
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:40,180
together because there's really
important lessons learned especially

1140
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,190
important lessons learned especially
 

1141
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,370
important lessons learned especially
when you talk about human spaceflight

1142
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:41,380
when you talk about human spaceflight
 

1143
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,260
when you talk about human spaceflight
safety quality assurance these things

1144
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,270
safety quality assurance these things
 

1145
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,240
safety quality assurance these things
are the utmost importance but both

1146
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:46,250
are the utmost importance but both
 

1147
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,250
are the utmost importance but both
aviation and space you know when human

1148
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:48,260
aviation and space you know when human
 

1149
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,110
aviation and space you know when human
lives are at stake on the other hand

1150
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:50,120
lives are at stake on the other hand
 

1151
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,510
lives are at stake on the other hand
government agencies NASA it can be

1152
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:52,520
government agencies NASA it can be
 

1153
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,950
government agencies NASA it can be
European Space Agency you name it they

1154
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:53,960
European Space Agency you name it they
 

1155
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,720
European Space Agency you name it they
become very bureaucratic pretty

1156
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:55,730
become very bureaucratic pretty
 

1157
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:58,539
become very bureaucratic pretty
risk-averse move pretty slowly so I

1158
00:20:58,539 --> 00:20:58,549
risk-averse move pretty slowly so I
 

1159
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,669
risk-averse move pretty slowly so I
think the best is when you you combine

1160
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:00,679
think the best is when you you combine
 

1161
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:02,820
think the best is when you you combine
the partnerships from both sides

1162
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:02,830
the partnerships from both sides
 

1163
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,990
the partnerships from both sides
industry necessarily has to push the

1164
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,000
industry necessarily has to push the
 

1165
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,190
industry necessarily has to push the
government take some more risks you know

1166
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:06,200
government take some more risks you know
 

1167
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,779
government take some more risks you know
I got me they're smart risk or actually

1168
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:07,789
I got me they're smart risk or actually
 

1169
00:21:07,789 --> 00:21:10,740
I got me they're smart risk or actually
gave an award at NASA for failing smart

1170
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:10,750
gave an award at NASA for failing smart
 

1171
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,269
gave an award at NASA for failing smart
I love that you've seen kind of break up

1172
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:13,279
I love that you've seen kind of break up
 

1173
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,769
I love that you've seen kind of break up
when the cultures say no that they don't

1174
00:21:14,769 --> 00:21:14,779
when the cultures say no that they don't
 

1175
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,510
when the cultures say no that they don't
look Apollo that was a huge risk it was

1176
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:16,520
look Apollo that was a huge risk it was
 

1177
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,279
look Apollo that was a huge risk it was
done well yeah so there's always a

1178
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:18,289
done well yeah so there's always a
 

1179
00:21:18,289 --> 00:21:20,620
done well yeah so there's always a
culture of safety quality assurance you

1180
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:20,630
culture of safety quality assurance you
 

1181
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,600
culture of safety quality assurance you
know engineering you know edit at its

1182
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:22,610
know engineering you know edit at its
 

1183
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:25,120
know engineering you know edit at its
best but on the other hand you want to

1184
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,130
best but on the other hand you want to
 

1185
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:27,340
best but on the other hand you want to
get things done and you have to also get

1186
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,350
get things done and you have to also get
 

1187
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:29,049
get things done and you have to also get
them you have to bring the cost down you

1188
00:21:29,049 --> 00:21:29,059
them you have to bring the cost down you
 

1189
00:21:29,059 --> 00:21:30,070
them you have to bring the cost down you
know for when it comes to launch we

1190
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
know for when it comes to launch we
 

1191
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,210
know for when it comes to launch we
really have to bring the cost down and

1192
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:31,220
really have to bring the cost down and
 

1193
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,130
really have to bring the cost down and
get the frequency up and so that's what

1194
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:33,140
get the frequency up and so that's what
 

1195
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,630
get the frequency up and so that's what
the newcomers are doing they're really

1196
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
the newcomers are doing they're really
 

1197
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,149
the newcomers are doing they're really
pushing that so it's about the most

1198
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:37,159
pushing that so it's about the most
 

1199
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:39,159
pushing that so it's about the most
exciting time I can imagine for for

1200
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:39,169
exciting time I can imagine for for
 

1201
00:21:39,169 --> 00:21:40,630
exciting time I can imagine for for
spaceflight again a little bit it really

1202
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:40,640
spaceflight again a little bit it really
 

1203
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,159
spaceflight again a little bit it really
is the democratization of spaceflight

1204
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:42,169
is the democratization of spaceflight
 

1205
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,200
is the democratization of spaceflight
opening it up not just because the

1206
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,210
opening it up not just because the
 

1207
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,180
opening it up not just because the
launch capability but the science we can

1208
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,190
launch capability but the science we can
 

1209
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:49,180
launch capability but the science we can
do on a CubeSat what you can do now for

1210
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,190
do on a CubeSat what you can do now for
 

1211
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,399
do on a CubeSat what you can do now for
very those used to be you know student

1212
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:51,409
very those used to be you know student
 

1213
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:52,450
very those used to be you know student
projects that we would go through

1214
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:52,460
projects that we would go through
 

1215
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,399
projects that we would go through
conceive design implement and think

1216
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:54,409
conceive design implement and think
 

1217
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:56,049
conceive design implement and think
about what a small satellite would be

1218
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:56,059
about what a small satellite would be
 

1219
00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:58,360
about what a small satellite would be
now they're the most you know there's a

1220
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:58,370
now they're the most you know there's a
 

1221
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,159
now they're the most you know there's a
really advanced instrument science

1222
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:00,169
really advanced instrument science
 

1223
00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:01,690
really advanced instrument science
instruments are flying on little team

1224
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:01,700
instruments are flying on little team
 

1225
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,730
instruments are flying on little team
cube sets that pretty much anyone can

1226
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:03,740
cube sets that pretty much anyone can
 

1227
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,399
cube sets that pretty much anyone can
afford so there's not a there's every

1228
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:06,409
afford so there's not a there's every
 

1229
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:08,379
afford so there's not a there's every
nation you know every place in the world

1230
00:22:08,379 --> 00:22:08,389
nation you know every place in the world
 

1231
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:11,320
nation you know every place in the world
can fly a cube set and so that's cube

1232
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,330
can fly a cube set and so that's cube
 

1233
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,680
can fly a cube set and so that's cube
set Oh CubeSat is a this is called one

1234
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:14,690
set Oh CubeSat is a this is called one
 

1235
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:16,600
set Oh CubeSat is a this is called one
YouYube says we measure in terms of

1236
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:16,610
YouYube says we measure in terms of
 

1237
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:19,240
YouYube says we measure in terms of
units so you know just in terms of I put

1238
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:19,250
units so you know just in terms of I put
 

1239
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,350
units so you know just in terms of I put
my both my hands together that's one

1240
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:20,360
my both my hands together that's one
 

1241
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,299
my both my hands together that's one
unit two units trees so little small

1242
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:22,309
unit two units trees so little small
 

1243
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:24,549
unit two units trees so little small
satellites so cube sets are for small

1244
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:24,559
satellites so cube sets are for small
 

1245
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,769
satellites so cube sets are for small
satellites and we actually go by mass as

1246
00:22:26,769 --> 00:22:26,779
satellites and we actually go by mass as
 

1247
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,149
satellites and we actually go by mass as
well you know small satellite might be

1248
00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:28,159
well you know small satellite might be
 

1249
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,210
well you know small satellite might be
100 kilos 200 kilos all well under a

1250
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:31,220
100 kilos 200 kilos all well under a
 

1251
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,549
100 kilos 200 kilos all well under a
thousand kilos cube sets then our the

1252
00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:33,559
thousand kilos cube sets then our the
 

1253
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,200
thousand kilos cube sets then our the
next thing down from small sets you know

1254
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,210
next thing down from small sets you know
 

1255
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,649
next thing down from small sets you know
basically you know kilos a tens of kilos

1256
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:38,659
basically you know kilos a tens of kilos
 

1257
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,509
basically you know kilos a tens of kilos
things like that but kind of the

1258
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:40,519
things like that but kind of the
 

1259
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,340
things like that but kind of the
building blocks cube sets are fantastic

1260
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:42,350
building blocks cube sets are fantastic
 

1261
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:44,470
building blocks cube sets are fantastic
designs kind of modular design so I can

1262
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:44,480
designs kind of modular design so I can
 

1263
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,680
designs kind of modular design so I can
take a1 u1 1 unit of CubeSat and you

1264
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:47,690
take a1 u1 1 unit of CubeSat and you
 

1265
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,909
take a1 u1 1 unit of CubeSat and you
know but what if I have a little bit

1266
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:48,919
know but what if I have a little bit
 

1267
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,159
know but what if I have a little bit
more money and payload I can fly three

1268
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:51,169
more money and payload I can fly three
 

1269
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,019
more money and payload I can fly three
of them and just basically put a lot

1270
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:53,029
of them and just basically put a lot
 

1271
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:54,669
of them and just basically put a lot
more instruments on it but essentially

1272
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:54,679
more instruments on it but essentially
 

1273
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:56,049
more instruments on it but essentially
think about something the size of a

1274
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:56,059
think about something the size of a
 

1275
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,240
think about something the size of a
shoebox if you will you know that would

1276
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:58,250
shoebox if you will you know that would
 

1277
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,789
shoebox if you will you know that would
be a cube set and those how do those

1278
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:00,799
be a cube set and those how do those
 

1279
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:02,680
be a cube set and those how do those
help empower you in terms of doing size

1280
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:02,690
help empower you in terms of doing size
 

1281

but the reusability of it was really
 

1351
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,300
but the reusability of it was really
critical because we flew it up it did

pressure to pressurize right directly on
 

1419
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,890
pressure to pressurize right directly on
the skin seems that it's technically

1420
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:41,900
the skin seems that it's technically
 

1421
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,780
the skin seems that it's technically
feasible we're still at the research and

1422
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:43,790
feasible we're still at the research and
 

1423
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:44,950
feasible we're still at the research and
development stage we don't have a flight

1424
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
development stage we don't have a flight
 

1425
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,170
development stage we don't have a flight
system but technically is feasible so we

1426
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:47,180
system but technically is feasible so we
 

1427
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,820
system but technically is feasible so we
do a lot of work in the materials you

1428
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:48,830
do a lot of work in the materials you
 

1429
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,020
do a lot of work in the materials you
know what materials do we need to

1430
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:50,030
know what materials do we need to
 

1431
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:52,390
know what materials do we need to
pressurize someone what's the patterning

1432
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
pressurize someone what's the patterning
 

1433
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,680
pressurize someone what's the patterning
we need that's what our patents are in

1434
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:53,690
we need that's what our patents are in
 

1435
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,510
we need that's what our patents are in
the patterning kind of how we apply this

1436
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:55,520
the patterning kind of how we apply this
 

1437
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,880
the patterning kind of how we apply this
is a third of an atmosphere just to sort

1438
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:57,890
is a third of an atmosphere just to sort
 

1439
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,440
is a third of an atmosphere just to sort
of take a step back you have this

1440
00:25:59,440 --> 00:25:59,450
of take a step back you have this
 

1441
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:01,780
of take a step back you have this
incredible bio suit wear them it's tight

1442
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:01,790
incredible bio suit wear them it's tight
 

1443
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,730
incredible bio suit wear them it's tight
fitting so it allows more mobility and

1444
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:03,740
fitting so it allows more mobility and
 

1445
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,710
fitting so it allows more mobility and
so on so maybe even to take a bigger

1446
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:05,720
so on so maybe even to take a bigger
 

1447
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,750
so on so maybe even to take a bigger
step back like what are the functions

1448
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
step back like what are the functions
 

1449
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,120
step back like what are the functions
that a space it should perform here so

1450
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:10,130
that a space it should perform here so
 

1451
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,310
that a space it should perform here so
start from the beginning a spacesuit is

1452
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:12,320
start from the beginning a spacesuit is
 

1453
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,440
start from the beginning a spacesuit is
the world's smallest spacecraft so I

1454
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:14,450
the world's smallest spacecraft so I
 

1455
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,790
the world's smallest spacecraft so I
really that's the best definition I can

1456
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:15,800
really that's the best definition I can
 

1457
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,320
really that's the best definition I can
give you right now we fly gas

1458
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:17,330
give you right now we fly gas
 

1459
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,790
give you right now we fly gas
pressurized suits but think of

1460
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:18,800
pressurized suits but think of
 

1461
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,620
pressurized suits but think of
developing and designing an entire

1462
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:20,630
developing and designing an entire
 

1463
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:23,230
developing and designing an entire
spacecraft so then you take all those

1464
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,240
spacecraft so then you take all those
 

1465
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,670
spacecraft so then you take all those
systems and you shrink them around a

1466
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:24,680
systems and you shrink them around a
 

1467
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
systems and you shrink them around a
person provide them with oxygen to

1468
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:26,690
person provide them with oxygen to
 

1469
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:28,300
person provide them with oxygen to
breathe scrub out their carbon

1470
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:28,310
breathe scrub out their carbon
 

1471
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:30,190
breathe scrub out their carbon
I know make sure they have pressure they

1472
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:30,200
I know make sure they have pressure they
 

1473
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,450
I know make sure they have pressure they
need a pressure environment to live on

1474
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:31,460
need a pressure environment to live on
 

1475
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,050
need a pressure environment to live on
so really a spacesuit is a shrunken you

1476
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,060
so really a spacesuit is a shrunken you
 

1477
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:39,210
so really a spacesuit is a shrunken you
know spacecraft in its entirety has

1478
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:39,220

 

1479
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,070

communications exactly so you really

1480
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:42,080
communications exactly so you really
 

1481
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,440
communications exactly so you really
thermal control a little bit of

1482
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,450
thermal control a little bit of
 

1483
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,580
thermal control a little bit of
radiation not so much radiation

1484
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:45,590
radiation not so much radiation
 

1485
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:47,020
radiation not so much radiation
protection but thermal control humidity

1486
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,030
protection but thermal control humidity
 

1487
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:48,790
protection but thermal control humidity
you know oxygen breeze so all those life

1488
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:48,800
you know oxygen breeze so all those life
 

1489
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,380
you know oxygen breeze so all those life
support systems as well as the pressure

1490
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:50,390
support systems as well as the pressure
 

1491
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:53,230
support systems as well as the pressure
production so it's an engineering marvel

1492
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:53,240
production so it's an engineering marvel
 

1493
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,430
production so it's an engineering marvel
you know the spacesuits that have flown

1494
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:54,440
you know the spacesuits that have flown
 

1495
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,600
you know the spacesuits that have flown
because they really are entire

1496
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,610
because they really are entire
 

1497
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,550
because they really are entire
spacecraft that a small spacecraft that

1498
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:57,560
spacecraft that a small spacecraft that
 

1499
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,860
spacecraft that a small spacecraft that
we have around a person but they're very

1500
00:26:59,860 --> 00:26:59,870
we have around a person but they're very
 

1501
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,380
we have around a person but they're very
massive but 140 kilo is the current suit

1502
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:02,390
massive but 140 kilo is the current suit
 

1503
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,720
massive but 140 kilo is the current suit
and they're not mobility suits so since

1504
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:04,730
and they're not mobility suits so since
 

1505
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:06,130
and they're not mobility suits so since
we're going back to the Moon and Mars we

1506
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:06,140
we're going back to the Moon and Mars we
 

1507
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,750
we're going back to the Moon and Mars we
need a planetary suit we need a mobility

1508
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:07,760
need a planetary suit we need a mobility
 

1509
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,370
need a planetary suit we need a mobility
suit so that's where we've kind of

1510
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:09,380
suit so that's where we've kind of
 

1511
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:12,040
suit so that's where we've kind of
flipped the design paradigm I study

1512
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,050
flipped the design paradigm I study
 

1513
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,380
flipped the design paradigm I study
astronauts I study humans in motion and

1514
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:14,390
astronauts I study humans in motion and
 

1515
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,570
astronauts I study humans in motion and
if we can map that motion I want to give

1516
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:16,580
if we can map that motion I want to give
 

1517
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,860
if we can map that motion I want to give
you a full flexibility you know move

1518
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:17,870
you a full flexibility you know move
 

1519
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,870
you a full flexibility you know move
your arms and legs I really want you to

1520
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:19,880
your arms and legs I really want you to
 

1521
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,120
your arms and legs I really want you to
be like a Olympic athlete in extreme

1522
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,130
be like a Olympic athlete in extreme
 

1523
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,610
be like a Olympic athlete in extreme
Explorer I don't want to waste any of

1524
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:24,620
Explorer I don't want to waste any of
 

1525
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,410
Explorer I don't want to waste any of
your energy so we take it from the human

1526
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:26,420
your energy so we take it from the human
 

1527
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,570
your energy so we take it from the human
design so I take a look at humans we

1528
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:28,580
design so I take a look at humans we
 

1529
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,280
design so I take a look at humans we
measure them we model them and then I

1530
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,290
measure them we model them and then I
 

1531
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,770
measure them we model them and then I
say okay can I put a spacesuit on them

1532
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:32,780
say okay can I put a spacesuit on them
 

1533
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,900
say okay can I put a spacesuit on them
that goes from the skin out so rather

1534
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:34,910
that goes from the skin out so rather
 

1535
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,550
that goes from the skin out so rather
than a gas pressurized shrinking that

1536
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:36,560
than a gas pressurized shrinking that
 

1537
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,100
than a gas pressurized shrinking that
spacecraft around the person so here's

1538
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,110
spacecraft around the person so here's
 

1539
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:41,170
spacecraft around the person so here's
how humans perform can I design a

1540
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:41,180
how humans perform can I design a
 

1541
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,790
how humans perform can I design a
spacesuit literally from the skin out

1542
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:42,800
spacesuit literally from the skin out
 

1543
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,040
spacesuit literally from the skin out
that's what we've come up with

1544
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,050
that's what we've come up with
 

1545
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:45,850
that's what we've come up with
mechanical counter-pressure some

1546
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:45,860
mechanical counter-pressure some
 

1547
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,530
mechanical counter-pressure some
patterning and that way it could be

1548
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:47,540
patterning and that way it could be
 

1549
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,750
patterning and that way it could be
order of magnitude less in terms of the

1550
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:49,760
order of magnitude less in terms of the
 

1551
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,360
order of magnitude less in terms of the
mass and it should provide maximum

1552
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,370
mass and it should provide maximum
 

1553
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,370
mass and it should provide maximum
mobility for moon or mars

1554
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:54,380
mobility for moon or mars
 

1555
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,470
mobility for moon or mars
what's mechanical cano pressure like how

1556
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:56,480
what's mechanical cano pressure like how
 

1557
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,260
what's mechanical cano pressure like how
the heck can you even begin to create

1558
00:27:59,260 --> 00:27:59,270
the heck can you even begin to create
 

1559
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,530
the heck can you even begin to create
something that's tight-fitting so and

1560
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:02,540
something that's tight-fitting so and
 

1561
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,180
something that's tight-fitting so and
still doesn't protect you from the

1562
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:04,190
still doesn't protect you from the
 

1563
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,100
still doesn't protect you from the
elements and so on and the hold of the

1564
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,110
elements and so on and the hold of the
 

1565
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:08,770
elements and so on and the hold of the
pressure thing design channels we've

1566
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:08,780
pressure thing design channels we've
 

1567
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,240
pressure thing design channels we've
been working on it from so you can

1568
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:10,250
been working on it from so you can
 

1569
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,440
been working on it from so you can
either put someone in a balloon that's

either put someone in a balloon that's
 

1571
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,790
either put someone in a balloon that's
one way to do it that's conventional

so the pressure comes for the body comes

1684
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,370
so the pressure comes for the body comes
 

1685
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:09,370
so the pressure comes for the body comes
from the mechanical pressure just

1686
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:09,380
from the mechanical pressure just
 

1687
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,150
from the mechanical pressure just

comes from an architect or industrial

1728
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:54,710
comes from an architect or industrial
 

1729
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,020
comes from an architect or industrial
design background

1730
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,030
design background
 

1731
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:58,090
design background
so bringing those skills to bear as well

1732
00:30:58,090 --> 00:30:58,100
so bringing those skills to bear as well
 

1733
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,280
so bringing those skills to bear as well
we team up with industry folks who are

1734
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,290
we team up with industry folks who are
 

1735
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:03,130
we team up with industry folks who are
in athletic performance and designers so

1736
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:03,140
in athletic performance and designers so
 

1737
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,990
in athletic performance and designers so
it really is a team that brings all

1738
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,000
it really is a team that brings all
 

1739
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,090
it really is a team that brings all
those skills together so what role does

1740
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:07,100
those skills together so what role does
 

1741
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,970
those skills together so what role does
the spacesuit play in our long-term

1742
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:09,980
the spacesuit play in our long-term
 

1743
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,520
the spacesuit play in our long-term
staying in Mars sort of exploring the

1744
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:12,530
staying in Mars sort of exploring the
 

1745
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,560
staying in Mars sort of exploring the
doing all the work that astronauts do

1746
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:14,570
doing all the work that astronauts do
 

1747
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,810
doing all the work that astronauts do
but also perhaps civilians one day

1748
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:16,820
but also perhaps civilians one day
 

1749
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,790
but also perhaps civilians one day
almost like taking steps towards

1750
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:18,800
almost like taking steps towards
 

1751
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,710
almost like taking steps towards
colonization of Mars what world is a

1752
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
colonization of Mars what world is a
 

1753
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,720
colonization of Mars what world is a
spacesuit play there so you always need

1754
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:22,730
spacesuit play there so you always need
 

1755
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,130
spacesuit play there so you always need
life-support system

1756
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:24,140
life-support system
 

1757
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:26,050
life-support system
pressurized habitat and I like to say

1758
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:26,060
pressurized habitat and I like to say
 

1759
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:29,010
pressurized habitat and I like to say
we're not going to Mars to sit around

1760
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:29,020
we're not going to Mars to sit around
 

1761
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,810
we're not going to Mars to sit around
you know even if you land and have the

1762
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:31,820
you know even if you land and have the
 

1763
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,160
you know even if you land and have the
lander you're not going there to stay

1764
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,170
lander you're not going there to stay
 

1765
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,630
lander you're not going there to stay
inside that's for darn sure we're going

1766
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
inside that's for darn sure we're going
 

1767
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,980
inside that's for darn sure we're going
there to search for the evidence of life

1768
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:35,990
there to search for the evidence of life
 

1769
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,570
there to search for the evidence of life
that's why we're going to Mars so you

1770
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:37,580
that's why we're going to Mars so you
 

1771
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,880
that's why we're going to Mars so you
need a lot of mobility so for me the

1772
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:39,890
need a lot of mobility so for me the
 

1773
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,100
need a lot of mobility so for me the
suit is the best way to give the human

1774
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,110
suit is the best way to give the human
 

1775
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:43,930
suit is the best way to give the human
mobility we're always so gonna need

1776
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:43,940
mobility we're always so gonna need
 

1777
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,300
mobility we're always so gonna need
Rovers we're gonna need robots so for me

1778
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,310
Rovers we're gonna need robots so for me
 

1779
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,160
Rovers we're gonna need robots so for me
exploration is always a suite of

1780
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,170
exploration is always a suite of
 

1781
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,500
exploration is always a suite of
explorers some people are gonna some of

1782
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:50,510
explorers some people are gonna some of
 

1783
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,970
explorers some people are gonna some of
the suite of explorers or humans but

1784
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:51,980
the suite of explorers or humans but
 

1785
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,970
the suite of explorers or humans but
many are gonna be robots smart systems

1786
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:54,980
many are gonna be robots smart systems
 

1787
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,590
many are gonna be robots smart systems
things like that but I look at it it's

1788
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:56,600
things like that but I look at it it's
 

1789
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,030
things like that but I look at it it's
kind of all those capabilities together

1790
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,040
kind of all those capabilities together
 

1791
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,420
kind of all those capabilities together
make the best exploration team so let me

1792
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:01,430
make the best exploration team so let me
 

1793
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:03,870
make the best exploration team so let me
ask I loved artificial intelligence and

1794
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:03,880
ask I loved artificial intelligence and
 

1795
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,520
ask I loved artificial intelligence and
you thought I've also saw that you've

1796
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:06,530
you thought I've also saw that you've
 

1797
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:08,920
you thought I've also saw that you've
enjoyed the movie space obviously 2001 a

1798
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:08,930
enjoyed the movie space obviously 2001 a
 

1799
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,870
enjoyed the movie space obviously 2001 a
Space Odyssey let me ask the question

1800
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:10,880
Space Odyssey let me ask the question
 

1801
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,150
Space Odyssey let me ask the question
about Hal 9000 that makes a few

1802
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:13,160
about Hal 9000 that makes a few
 

1803
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,250
about Hal 9000 that makes a few
decisions there that prioritizes the

1804
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:15,260
decisions there that prioritizes the
 

1805
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,620
decisions there that prioritizes the
mission over the the astronauts do you

1806
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:17,630
mission over the the astronauts do you
 

1807
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,630
mission over the the astronauts do you
think from a high philosophical question

1808
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:19,640
think from a high philosophical question
 

1809
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,630
think from a high philosophical question
do you think hell did the right thing

1810
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
do you think hell did the right thing
 

1811
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,360
do you think hell did the right thing
prioritizing the mission I think our

1812
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:25,370
prioritizing the mission I think our
 

1813
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:27,490
prioritizing the mission I think our
artificial intelligence will be smarter

1814
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:27,500
artificial intelligence will be smarter
 

1815
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,680
artificial intelligence will be smarter
in the future for a Mars mission it's a

1816
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:29,690
in the future for a Mars mission it's a
 

1817
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,390
in the future for a Mars mission it's a
great question of is that the reality

1818
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:31,400
great question of is that the reality
 

1819
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,770
great question of is that the reality
isn't for a Mars mission you know we

1820
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:32,780
isn't for a Mars mission you know we
 

1821
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:34,660
isn't for a Mars mission you know we
need fully autonomous systems we will

1822
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:34,670
need fully autonomous systems we will
 

1823
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,910
need fully autonomous systems we will
get humans but they have to be fully

1824
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:36,920
get humans but they have to be fully
 

1825
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,580
get humans but they have to be fully
autonomous and that's a really important

1826
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:39,590
autonomous and that's a really important
 

1827
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:42,130
autonomous and that's a really important
concept because you know there's not

1828
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:42,140
concept because you know there's not
 

1829
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,390
concept because you know there's not
going to be a Mission Control on earth

1830
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:43,400
going to be a Mission Control on earth
 

1831
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:47,530
going to be a Mission Control on earth
you know I'd you know 20-minute time leg

1832
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:47,540
you know I'd you know 20-minute time leg
 

1833
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,790
you know I'd you know 20-minute time leg
there's just no way you're gonna control

1834
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:48,800
there's just no way you're gonna control
 

1835
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,620
there's just no way you're gonna control
so fully a ton so people have to be

1836
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:50,630
so fully a ton so people have to be
 

1837
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:52,210
so fully a ton so people have to be
fully autonomous as well but all of our

1838
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,220
fully autonomous as well but all of our
 

1839
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,370
fully autonomous as well but all of our
systems as well and so that's that's the

1840
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:54,380
systems as well and so that's that's the
 

1841
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,930
systems as well and so that's that's the
big design challenge so that's why we

1842
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:55,940
big design challenge so that's why we
 

1843
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,460
big design challenge so that's why we
test them out on the moon as well when

1844
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:57,470
test them out on the moon as well when
 

1845
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,960
test them out on the moon as well when
we have a okay a few seconds you know a

1846
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:58,970
we have a okay a few seconds you know a
 

1847
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,490
we have a okay a few seconds you know a
three-second time leg you can test him

1848
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:00,500
three-second time leg you can test him
 

1849
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,650
three-second time leg you can test him
out we have to really get autonomous

1850
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:02,660
out we have to really get autonomous
 

1851
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,010
out we have to really get autonomous
exploration down you asked me earlier

1852
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,020
exploration down you asked me earlier
 

1853
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,930
exploration down you asked me earlier
about Magellan and Magellan and his crew

1854
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:07,940
about Magellan and Magellan and his crew
 

1855
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,640
about Magellan and Magellan and his crew
they they left right they were

1856
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:09,650
they they left right they were
 

1857
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,740
they they left right they were
autonomous mm-hmm you know they were

1858
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:11,750
autonomous mm-hmm you know they were
 

1859
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,450
autonomous mm-hmm you know they were
autonomous they left and they were on

1860
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:13,460
autonomous they left and they were on
 

1861
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:14,860
autonomous they left and they were on
their own to figure out that mission

1862
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:14,870
their own to figure out that mission
 

1863
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,330
their own to figure out that mission
then when they hit land they have

1864
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:16,340
then when they hit land they have
 

1865
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,830
then when they hit land they have
resources as Institue resource

1866
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
resources as Institue resource
 

1867
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,720
resources as Institue resource
utilization and everything else they

1868
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:19,730
utilization and everything else they
 

1869
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,060
utilization and everything else they
brought with them so we have to I think

1870
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,070
brought with them so we have to I think
 

1871
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,470
brought with them so we have to I think
have that mindset for expression again

1872
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:23,480
have that mindset for expression again
 

1873
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,910
have that mindset for expression again
back to the moon it's more the testing

1874
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:24,920
back to the moon it's more the testing
 

1875
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,140
back to the moon it's more the testing
ground the proving ground with

1876
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:26,150
ground the proving ground with
 

1877
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:28,090
ground the proving ground with
technologies but when we get to Mars

1878
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:28,100
technologies but when we get to Mars
 

1879
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,460
technologies but when we get to Mars
it's so far away that we need fully

1880
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:30,470
it's so far away that we need fully
 

1881
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,170
it's so far away that we need fully
autonomous systems so I think that's

1882
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:32,180
autonomous systems so I think that's
 

1883
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,750
autonomous systems so I think that's
that's where again AI and autonomy come

1884
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:34,760
that's where again AI and autonomy come
 

1885
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,090
that's where again AI and autonomy come
in really robust autonomy things that we

1886
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,100
in really robust autonomy things that we
 

1887
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,890
in really robust autonomy things that we
don't have today yet so they're on the

1888
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:38,900
don't have today yet so they're on the
 

1889
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,750
don't have today yet so they're on the
drawing boards but we really need to

1890
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:40,760
drawing boards but we really need to
 

1891
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,160
drawing boards but we really need to
test them out because that's that's what

1892
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,170
test them out because that's that's what
 

1893
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,320
test them out because that's that's what
we're up against so fully autonomous

1894
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,330
we're up against so fully autonomous
 

1895
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:45,940
we're up against so fully autonomous
meaning like self-sufficient there's

1896
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:45,950
meaning like self-sufficient there's
 

1897
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,470
meaning like self-sufficient there's
still a role for the human in that

1898
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:47,480
still a role for the human in that
 

1899
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,120
still a role for the human in that
picture do you think there will be a

1900
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:49,130
picture do you think there will be a
 

1901
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:53,620
picture do you think there will be a
time when AI systems just beyond doing

1902
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:53,630
time when AI systems just beyond doing
 

1903
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,510
time when AI systems just beyond doing
fully autonomous flight control will

1904
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:55,520
fully autonomous flight control will
 

1905
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,750
fully autonomous flight control will
also help or even take mission decisions

1906
00:33:58,750 --> 00:33:58,760
also help or even take mission decisions
 

1907
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,700
also help or even take mission decisions
like how did that's interesting it

1908
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:00,710
like how did that's interesting it
 

1909
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:02,169
like how did that's interesting it
depends I mean they're gonna be designed

1910
00:34:02,169 --> 00:34:02,179
depends I mean they're gonna be designed
 

1911
00:34:02,179 --> 00:34:03,760
depends I mean they're gonna be designed
by humans as you mentioned humans are

1912
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:03,770
by humans as you mentioned humans are
 

1913
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,230
by humans as you mentioned humans are
always in the loop I mean we might be on

1914
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:05,240
always in the loop I mean we might be on
 

1915
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,090
always in the loop I mean we might be on
earth we might be in orbit on Mars maybe

1916
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:07,100
earth we might be in orbit on Mars maybe
 

1917
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,950
earth we might be in orbit on Mars maybe
the systems the Landers down on the

1918
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:08,960
the systems the Landers down on the
 

1919
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,710
the systems the Landers down on the
surface of Mars but I think we're gonna

1920
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:11,720
surface of Mars but I think we're gonna
 

1921
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,139
surface of Mars but I think we're gonna
get we are right now just on earth-based

1922
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:14,149
get we are right now just on earth-based
 

1923
00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:16,419
get we are right now just on earth-based
systems you know AI systems that are

1924
00:34:16,419 --> 00:34:16,429
systems you know AI systems that are
 

1925
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:20,080
systems you know AI systems that are
incredibly capable and you know training

incredibly capable and you know training
 

1927
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,419
incredibly capable and you know training
them with all the data that we have now

1928
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:22,429
them with all the data that we have now
 

1929
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,610
them with all the data that we have now
you know petabytes of data from Earth

1930
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:24,620
you know petabytes of data from Earth
 

1931
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,590
you know petabytes of data from Earth
what I care about for the autonomy and

1932
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:26,600
what I care about for the autonomy and
 

1933
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,119
what I care about for the autonomy and
AI right now how we're applying it and

1934
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:28,129
AI right now how we're applying it and
 

1935
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:30,310
AI right now how we're applying it and
research is to look at earth and look at

1936
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
research is to look at earth and look at
 

1937
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,350
research is to look at earth and look at
climate systems I mean that's the it's

1938
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:32,360
climate systems I mean that's the it's
 

1939
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,149
climate systems I mean that's the it's
not for Mars to me today right now AI is

1940
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159
not for Mars to me today right now AI is
 

1941
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,600
not for Mars to me today right now AI is
to eyes on earth all of our space data

1942
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:36,610
to eyes on earth all of our space data
 

1943
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,850
to eyes on earth all of our space data
compiling that using supercomputers

1944
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:38,860
compiling that using supercomputers
 

1945
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,470
compiling that using supercomputers
because we have so much information and

1946
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:41,480
because we have so much information and
 

1947
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,760
because we have so much information and
knowledge and we need to get that into

1948
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:42,770
knowledge and we need to get that into
 

1949
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,020
knowledge and we need to get that into
people's hands we need first there's the

1950
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:44,030
people's hands we need first there's the
 

1951
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,270
people's hands we need first there's the
educational issue with climate and our

1952
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:46,280
educational issue with climate and our
 

1953
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,940
educational issue with climate and our
changing climate then we need to change

1954
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:48,950
changing climate then we need to change
 

1955
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:51,159
changing climate then we need to change
human behavior that's the biggie so this

1956
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:51,169
human behavior that's the biggie so this
 

1957
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:53,590
human behavior that's the biggie so this
next decade it's urgent we take care of

1958
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:53,600
next decade it's urgent we take care of
 

1959
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,060
next decade it's urgent we take care of
our own spaceship which is spaceship

1960
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:55,070
our own spaceship which is spaceship
 

1961

earth so that's to me where my focus has

1962
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:58,670
earth so that's to me where my focus has
 

1963
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:01,360
earth so that's to me where my focus has
been for AI systems using whatever is

been for AI systems using whatever is
out there kind of imagining also what

1966
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:03,920
out there kind of imagining also what
 

1967
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,860
out there kind of imagining also what
the future situation is the satellite

the future situation is the satellite
imagery of Earth of the future if you

1970
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:07,970
imagery of Earth of the future if you
 

1971
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:09,790
imagery of Earth of the future if you
can hold that in your hands that's gonna

1972
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:09,800
can hold that in your hands that's gonna
 

1973
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,820
can hold that in your hands that's gonna
be really powerful will that help people

1974
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:11,830
be really powerful will that help people
 

1975
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,230
be really powerful will that help people
accelerate positive change for Earth and

1976
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,240
accelerate positive change for Earth and
 

1977
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,670
accelerate positive change for Earth and
for us to live in balance with earth I

1978
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
for us to live in balance with earth I
 

1979
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,500
for us to live in balance with earth I
hope so and kind of start with the ocean

1980
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:17,510
hope so and kind of start with the ocean
 

1981
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,900
hope so and kind of start with the ocean
systems so oceans to land to air and

1982
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:19,910
systems so oceans to land to air and
 

1983
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,270
systems so oceans to land to air and
kind of using all the space data so it's

1984
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:22,280
kind of using all the space data so it's
 

1985
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,560
kind of using all the space data so it's
a huge role for artificial

1986
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:23,570
a huge role for artificial
 

1987
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,960
a huge role for artificial
telogen to help us analyze I call it

1988
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:25,970
telogen to help us analyze I call it
 

1989
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:28,660
telogen to help us analyze I call it
curating the data using the data it has

a lot - of visualizations as as well do
you think and a weird dark question do

1994
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:34,430
you think and a weird dark question do
 

1995
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:37,000
you think and a weird dark question do
you think human species can survive if

1996
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,010
you think human species can survive if
 

1997
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,460
you think human species can survive if
we don't become interplanetary in the

1998
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:39,470
we don't become interplanetary in the
 

1999
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:43,920
we don't become interplanetary in the
next century or a couple of centuries

2000

next century or a couple of centuries
 

2001
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:45,880
next century or a couple of centuries
absolutely we can survive

2002
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:45,890
absolutely we can survive
 

2003
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,940
absolutely we can survive
I don't think Mars is option B actually

2004
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:47,950
I don't think Mars is option B actually
 

2005
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,770
I don't think Mars is option B actually
I think is all about saving spaceship

2006
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:50,780
I think is all about saving spaceship
 

2007
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,680
I think is all about saving spaceship
earth and humanity I simply put you know

2008
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:53,690
earth and humanity I simply put you know
 

2009
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,820
earth and humanity I simply put you know
earth doesn't need us

2010
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:54,830
earth doesn't need us
 

2011
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:57,040
earth doesn't need us
but we really need our you know all

2012
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:57,050
but we really need our you know all
 

2013
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:59,440
but we really need our you know all
humanity needs to live in balance with

2014
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,450
humanity needs to live in balance with
 

2015
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,970
humanity needs to live in balance with
earth because earth has been here a long

2016
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:00,980
earth because earth has been here a long
 

2017
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,320
earth because earth has been here a long
time before we ever showed up and it'll

2018
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,330
time before we ever showed up and it'll
 

2019
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:04,420
time before we ever showed up and it'll
be here a long time after it's just a

2020
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:04,430
be here a long time after it's just a
 

2021
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,100
be here a long time after it's just a
matter of how do we want to live with

2022
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:06,110
matter of how do we want to live with
 

2023
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:08,260
matter of how do we want to live with
all living beings you know much more in

2024
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,270
all living beings you know much more in
 

2025
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,450
all living beings you know much more in
balance because we need to take care of

2026
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:10,460
balance because we need to take care of
 

2027
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,220
balance because we need to take care of
the earth and right now we're we're not

2028
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,230
the earth and right now we're we're not
 

2029
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,470
the earth and right now we're we're not
so that's the urgency and I think it is

2030
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:14,480
so that's the urgency and I think it is
 

2031
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,590
so that's the urgency and I think it is
the next decade to try to live much more

2032
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:17,600

in this together it's just one blue
 

2047
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,270
in this together it's just one blue
bubble it's for Humanity so when I think

2048
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:34,280
bubble it's for Humanity so when I think
 

2049
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,680
bubble it's for Humanity so when I think
people realize that we're all astronauts

2050
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:35,690
people realize that we're all astronauts
 

2051
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:37,480
people realize that we're all astronauts
that's the great news is everyone's be

2052
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:37,490
that's the great news is everyone's be
 

2053
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,160
that's the great news is everyone's be
an astronaut you birth we're all on

2054
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,170
an astronaut you birth we're all on
 

2055
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:41,050
an astronaut you birth we're all on
we're all astronauts of spaceship earth

2056
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,060
we're all astronauts of spaceship earth
 

2057
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,910
we're all astronauts of spaceship earth
and okay this is our mission this is our

2058
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:42,920
and okay this is our mission this is our
 

2059

mission to take care of the planet and
 

2061
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,520
mission to take care of the planet and
yet as we explore out from our from our

2062
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:48,530
yet as we explore out from our from our
 

2063
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:52,120
yet as we explore out from our from our
spaceship earth here out into the space

2064
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:52,130
spaceship earth here out into the space
 

2065
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:54,190
spaceship earth here out into the space
what do you think the next 50 hundred

2066
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,200
what do you think the next 50 hundred
 

2067
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,020
what do you think the next 50 hundred
200 years look like for space

2068
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,030
200 years look like for space
 

2069
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,990
200 years look like for space
exploration I'm optimistic so I think

2070
00:36:58,990 --> 00:36:59,000
exploration I'm optimistic so I think
 

2071
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,260
exploration I'm optimistic so I think
that we'll have lots of people thousands

2072
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:02,270
that we'll have lots of people thousands
 

2073
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:03,550
that we'll have lots of people thousands
of people tens of thousands people who

2074
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:03,560
of people tens of thousands people who
 

2075
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,960
of people tens of thousands people who
knows maybe millions in low-earth orbit

2076
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:04,970
knows maybe millions in low-earth orbit
 

2077
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,220
knows maybe millions in low-earth orbit
that's just a place that we're gonna

2078
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:06,230
that's just a place that we're gonna
 

2079
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,120
that's just a place that we're gonna
have people and actually some industry

2080
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:09,130
have people and actually some industry
 

2081
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,440
have people and actually some industry
manufacturing things like that that that

2082
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,450
manufacturing things like that that that
 

2083
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,060
manufacturing things like that that that
dream I hope we realize getting people

2084
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:13,070
dream I hope we realize getting people
 

2085
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,680
dream I hope we realize getting people
to the moon so I can envision a lot of

2086
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:14,690
to the moon so I can envision a lot of
 

2087
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,480
to the moon so I can envision a lot of
people on the moon again it's great

2088
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:16,490
people on the moon again it's great
 

2089
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:19,240
people on the moon again it's great
place to living or visiting probably

2090
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:19,250
place to living or visiting probably
 

2091
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:22,030
place to living or visiting probably
visiting and living if you want to most

2092
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:22,040
visiting and living if you want to most
 

2093
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,290
visiting and living if you want to most
people are gonna want to come back to to

2094
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:23,300
people are gonna want to come back to to
 

2095
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,400
people are gonna want to come back to to
earth I think but there'll be some

2096
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:24,410
earth I think but there'll be some
 

2097
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,380
earth I think but there'll be some
people and it's not such a long it's a

2098
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,390
people and it's not such a long it's a
 

2099
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,180
people and it's not such a long it's a
good view it's a beautiful view so I

2100
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:28,190
good view it's a beautiful view so I
 

2101
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,340
good view it's a beautiful view so I
think that we will have you know many

2102
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:30,350
think that we will have you know many
 

2103
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,810
think that we will have you know many
people on the moon as well I think

2104
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:31,820
people on the moon as well I think
 

2105
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,460
people on the moon as well I think
there'll be some people you told me well

2106
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,470
there'll be some people you told me well
 

2107
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,200
there'll be some people you told me well
you know hundreds of years out so we'll

2108
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:35,210
you know hundreds of years out so we'll
 

2109
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:36,910
you know hundreds of years out so we'll
have people will be interplanetary for

2110
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:36,920
have people will be interplanetary for
 

2111
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,360
have people will be interplanetary for
sure

2112
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,370
sure
 

2113
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:39,610
sure
as a species so I think we'll be on the

2114
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:39,620
as a species so I think we'll be on the
 

2115
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:42,160
as a species so I think we'll be on the
moon I think we'll be on Mars Venus no

2116
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:42,170
moon I think we'll be on Mars Venus no
 

2117
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:43,840
moon I think we'll be on Mars Venus no
it's already a runaway greenhouse gas so

2118
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:43,850
it's already a runaway greenhouse gas so
 

2119
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,700
it's already a runaway greenhouse gas so
not a great great place for science you

2120
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:45,710
not a great great place for science you
 

2121
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:47,530
not a great great place for science you
know Jupiter all of in within the solar

2122

2125
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,700
system great place for all of our
scientific probes I don't see so much in

2126
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:51,710
scientific probes I don't see so much in
 

2127
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,350
scientific probes I don't see so much in
terms of human physical presence we'll

2128
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:53,360
terms of human physical presence we'll
 

2129
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,120
terms of human physical presence we'll
be exploring them so we we live in our

2130
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,130
be exploring them so we we live in our
 

2131
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,710
be exploring them so we we live in our
minds there because we're exploring them

2132
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:56,720
minds there because we're exploring them
 

2133
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,980
minds there because we're exploring them
and going on those journeys but it's

2134
00:37:59,980 --> 00:37:59,990
and going on those journeys but it's
 

2135
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,860
and going on those journeys but it's
really our choice in terms of our

really our choice in terms of our
 

2137
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,200
really our choice in terms of our
decisions of how in balance you know

2138
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,210
decisions of how in balance you know
 

2139
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,940
decisions of how in balance you know

so I say mid you know 2020 mid 20 you
know 2025 2030 five will be on the moon

2152
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:22,070
know 2025 2030 five will be on the moon
 

2153
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,220
know 2025 2030 five will be on the moon
and hopefully with more people than less

2154
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:24,230
and hopefully with more people than less
 

2155
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,660
and hopefully with more people than less
but first with you know a few astronauts

2156
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:25,670
but first with you know a few astronauts
 

2157
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,730
but first with you know a few astronauts
it'll be global international folks but

2158
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:27,740
it'll be global international folks but
 

2159
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,560
it'll be global international folks but
we really need those 10 years I think on

2160
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:29,570
we really need those 10 years I think on
 

2161
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:31,570
we really need those 10 years I think on
the moon and then so by the way later in

2162
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:31,580
the moon and then so by the way later in
 

2163
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,210
the moon and then so by the way later in
the decade in the 2030s we will have all

2164
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:34,220
the decade in the 2030s we will have all
 

2165
