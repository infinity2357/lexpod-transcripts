00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:23,199
on your own land that's different
 

335
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,350
on your own land that's different
and that was one of the first times in

00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
and that was one of the first times in
 

337
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,430
and that was one of the first times in
america where like on euro

of course it's pearl harbor but like
this is like in recent history

342
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:31,360
this is like in recent history
 

343
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,629
this is like in recent history
it's like they hit us here

344
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
it's like they hit us here
 

345
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,670
it's like they hit us here
that was like a profound idea i think

346
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:37,680
that was like a profound idea i think
 

347
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,510
that was like a profound idea i think
america was very very good at exporting

348
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
america was very very good at exporting
 

349
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,670
america was very very good at exporting
the violence elsewhere for a long time

350
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:41,680
the violence elsewhere for a long time
 

351
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,909
the violence elsewhere for a long time
and uh there was this element of uh

352
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:43,919
and uh there was this element of uh
 

353
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,029
and uh there was this element of uh
complacency

354
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
complacency
 

355
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,230
complacency
but also this element of uh um you know

356
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:48,240
but also this element of uh um you know
 

357
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,909
but also this element of uh um you know
really just american superiority that

358
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
really just american superiority that
 

359
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,510
really just american superiority that
doesn't happen here right

360
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:51,520
doesn't happen here right
 

361
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,510
doesn't happen here right
and i think that that woke people up not

362
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:53,520
and i think that that woke people up not
 

363
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,629
and i think that that woke people up not
only to

364
00:05:54,629 --> 00:05:54,639
only to
 

365
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,189
only to
um kind of the idea that other places

366
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
um kind of the idea that other places
 

367
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,629
um kind of the idea that other places
around the world may not like the

368
00:05:58,629 --> 00:05:58,639
around the world may not like the
 

369
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,629
around the world may not like the
american ideals may not like democracy

370
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:00,639
american ideals may not like democracy
 

371
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:01,909
american ideals may not like democracy
and capitalism and

372
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
and capitalism and
 

373
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,270
and capitalism and
and that but also maybe we aren't as

374
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:05,280
and that but also maybe we aren't as
 

375
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,430
and that but also maybe we aren't as
big tough and secure as we thought we

376
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
big tough and secure as we thought we
 

377
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,189
big tough and secure as we thought we
were right and so obviously i think you

378
00:06:09,189 --> 00:06:09,199
were right and so obviously i think you
 

379
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:09,990
were right and so obviously i think you
see the kind of over

380
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,000
see the kind of over
 

381
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,830
see the kind of over
rotation with a lot of the kind of

382
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:11,840
rotation with a lot of the kind of
 

383
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,270
rotation with a lot of the kind of
security theater that came

384
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:13,280
security theater that came
 

385
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,029
security theater that came
after that of almost psychologically

386
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
after that of almost psychologically
 

387
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,629
after that of almost psychologically
let's make our citizens feel

388
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
let's make our citizens feel
 

389
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,309
let's make our citizens feel
like they're safe even if the things

390
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:18,319
like they're safe even if the things
 

391
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,990
like they're safe even if the things
that we're doing don't necessarily you

392
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:20,000
that we're doing don't necessarily you
 

393
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,909
that we're doing don't necessarily you
know kind of change that apparatus

394
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
know kind of change that apparatus
 

395
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,430
know kind of change that apparatus
but on top of that i think that it

396
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
but on top of that i think that it
 

397
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,270
but on top of that i think that it
really woke people up to

398
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:25,280
really woke people up to
 

399
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,469
really woke people up to
uh extremism around the world and uh

400
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:28,479
uh extremism around the world and uh
 

401
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,390
uh extremism around the world and uh
i don't know if necessarily there was a

402
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:30,400
i don't know if necessarily there was a
 

403
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,830
i don't know if necessarily there was a
change in the extremism

404
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
change in the extremism
 

405
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,670
change in the extremism
as much as it just was an awareness

406
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:33,680
as much as it just was an awareness
 

407
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,590
as much as it just was an awareness

going to go and do this instead

496
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:00,720
going to go and do this instead
 

497
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,950
going to go and do this instead
and walk away i don't know necessarily

498
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
and walk away i don't know necessarily
 

499
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,909
and walk away i don't know necessarily
if it was a

500
00:08:03,909 --> 00:08:03,919
if it was a
 

501
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,230
if it was a
i want to pursue the same story right

502
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:06,240
i want to pursue the same story right
 

503
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,029
i want to pursue the same story right
and obviously he

504
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,039
and obviously he
 

505
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,790
and obviously he
ended up dying and so not exactly the

506
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
ended up dying and so not exactly the
 

507
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,150
ended up dying and so not exactly the
the end result that you want

508
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,160
the end result that you want
 

509
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,390
the end result that you want
but i think it was almost like uh he

510
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:12,400
but i think it was almost like uh he
 

511
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,510
but i think it was almost like uh he
made it okay

512
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:13,520
made it okay
 

513
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,950
made it okay
if you were on a certain trajectory in

514
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:14,960
if you were on a certain trajectory in
 

515
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,869
if you were on a certain trajectory in
life to go take this detour

516
00:08:16,869 --> 00:08:16,879
life to go take this detour
 

517
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,110
life to go take this detour
and and to go do it um but the second

518
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:19,120
and and to go do it um but the second
 

519
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,629
and and to go do it um but the second
thing is i was 17.

520
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:20,639
thing is i was 17.
 

521
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,909
thing is i was 17.
you're pretty stupid when you're 17.

522
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
you're pretty stupid when you're 17.
 

523
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,830
you're pretty stupid when you're 17.
you're pretty naive when you're 17 right

524
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:23,840
you're pretty naive when you're 17 right
 

525
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,869
you're pretty naive when you're 17 right
and so uh i almost um kind of backed

526
00:08:26,869 --> 00:08:26,879
and so uh i almost um kind of backed
 

527
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,430
and so uh i almost um kind of backed
into

528
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:27,440
into
 

529
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,230
into
the deployment because i signed up uh as

530
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,240
the deployment because i signed up uh as
 

531
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,710
the deployment because i signed up uh as
a

532
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
a
 

533
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,949
a
a reserve member and so basically the

534
00:08:32,949 --> 00:08:32,959
a reserve member and so basically the
 

535
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:34,790
a reserve member and so basically the
plan was to sign up for the reserves i

536
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:34,800
plan was to sign up for the reserves i
 

537
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,070
plan was to sign up for the reserves i
was going to go to basic training get

538
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:36,080
was going to go to basic training get
 

539
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,750
was going to go to basic training get
all the you know kind of education and

540
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:37,760
all the you know kind of education and
 

541
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,630
all the you know kind of education and
qualification

542
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:38,640
qualification
 

543
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,149
qualification
i was going to go to college and then

544
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:40,159
i was going to go to college and then
 

545
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,990
i was going to go to college and then
after college you know maybe there's a

546
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,000
after college you know maybe there's a
 

547
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,990
after college you know maybe there's a
chance that you will go and serve or do

548
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,000
chance that you will go and serve or do
 

549
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,030
chance that you will go and serve or do
whatever

550
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,040
whatever
 

551
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,790
whatever
for me i ended up getting deployed when

552
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:46,800
for me i ended up getting deployed when
 

553
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,710
for me i ended up getting deployed when
i was a junior in uh college so i got

554
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:48,720
i was a junior in uh college so i got
 

555
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,150
i was a junior in uh college so i got
pulled out of school

556
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:50,160
pulled out of school
 

557
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,190
pulled out of school
and so at 20 years old it's not exactly

558
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,200
and so at 20 years old it's not exactly
 

559
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,710
and so at 20 years old it's not exactly
what you thought you were signing up for

560
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:54,720
what you thought you were signing up for
 

561
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,630
what you thought you were signing up for
right especially to kind of leave school

562
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:56,640
right especially to kind of leave school
 

563
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,790
right especially to kind of leave school
to go do it and then on top of that

564
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
to go do it and then on top of that
 

565
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,110
to go do it and then on top of that
uh i probably had an advantage over most

566
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:01,120
uh i probably had an advantage over most
 

567
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,550
uh i probably had an advantage over most
people both on the

568
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,560
people both on the
 

569
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,590
people both on the
entry to combat and the exit to kind of

570
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:05,600
entry to combat and the exit to kind of
 

571
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,949
entry to combat and the exit to kind of
a combat situation which

572
00:09:06,949 --> 00:09:06,959
a combat situation which
 

573
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,670
a combat situation which
was football so i always explained that

574
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:09,680
was football so i always explained that
 

575
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,310
was football so i always explained that
um

576
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:10,320
um
 

577
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,509
um
in hindsight you're in a male-dominated

578
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:13,519
in hindsight you're in a male-dominated
 

579
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,590
in hindsight you're in a male-dominated
testosterone driven kind of combative

there's training and
 

587
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,350
there's training and
and uh you know injuries and just kind

588
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
and uh you know injuries and just kind
 

589
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,710
and uh you know injuries and just kind
of all of the things that go into

00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
it's just a little bit you know more
 

599

potential death and things like that but
 

603
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,269
potential death and things like that but
also on the exit from that deployment

604
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
also on the exit from that deployment
 

605
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,110
also on the exit from that deployment
most guys i was there with they're going

606
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,120
most guys i was there with they're going
 

607
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,710
most guys i was there with they're going
back to being you know

608
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
back to being you know
 

609
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,590
back to being you know
prison guards police officers working at

610
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
prison guards police officers working at
 

611
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,870
prison guards police officers working at
the lumber yard

612
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:44,880
the lumber yard
 

613
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,470
the lumber yard
you know just kind of everyday americans

614
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:48,480
you know just kind of everyday americans
 

615
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,190
you know just kind of everyday americans
and so i had the fortunate ability to go

616
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
and so i had the fortunate ability to go
 

617
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,230
and so i had the fortunate ability to go
back into

618
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:52,240
back into
 

619
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,750
back into
uh kind of that combative environment go

620
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:53,760
uh kind of that combative environment go
 

621
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,269
uh kind of that combative environment go
back to play football and so it was

622
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:55,279
back to play football and so it was
 

623
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,870
back to play football and so it was
almost this like de-escalation on the

624
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:56,880
almost this like de-escalation on the
 

625
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,829
almost this like de-escalation on the
way out

626
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
way out
 

627
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,590
way out
uh where they take your guns away we

628
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
uh where they take your guns away we
 

629
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,750
uh where they take your guns away we
still got a uniform still male dominated

630
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:01,760
still got a uniform still male dominated
 

631
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,350
still got a uniform still male dominated
uh still combative and then eventually

632
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:03,360
uh still combative and then eventually
 

633
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,949
uh still combative and then eventually
you're just a normal citizen

634
00:10:04,949 --> 00:10:04,959
you're just a normal citizen
 

635
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,790
you're just a normal citizen
and so i think that in some weird way i

636
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
and so i think that in some weird way i
 

637
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,310
and so i think that in some weird way i
was you know very fortunate to kind of

638
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,320
was you know very fortunate to kind of
 

639
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:08,790
was you know very fortunate to kind of
on the

640
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
on the
 

641
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,630
on the
entry and exit have that experience

642
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:10,640
entry and exit have that experience
 

643
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,990
entry and exit have that experience
where other guys didn't

644
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,000
where other guys didn't
 

645
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,269
where other guys didn't
so what you were deployed to iraq

646
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
so what you were deployed to iraq
 

647
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,310
so what you were deployed to iraq
were there any memories experiences that

648
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:18,320
were there any memories experiences that
 

649
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,829
were there any memories experiences that
changed you

650
00:10:19,829 --> 00:10:19,839
changed you
 

651
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,150
changed you
or in general like you're probably a

652
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,160
or in general like you're probably a
 

653
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,150
or in general like you're probably a
different man on the other side of it

654
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
different man on the other side of it
 

655
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,310
different man on the other side of it
how did that time change you i think

656
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,320

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,630
occasions
i remember we were driving down the road

just not necessarily to you personally
 

679
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,470
just not necessarily to you personally
just to the uniform to what you stand

680
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
just to the uniform to what you stand
 

681

just to the uniform to what you stand
for it's all the stuff

00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
for it's all the stuff
 

683
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,910
for it's all the stuff
when you see it you see it right and i

684
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:51,920
when you see it you see it right and i
 

685
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,350
when you see it you see it right and i
always think of um

686
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
always think of um
 

687
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,750
always think of um
if you've ever uh watched the movie a 12

688
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:55,760
if you've ever uh watched the movie a 12
 

689
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,470
if you've ever uh watched the movie a 12
strong

690
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:56,480
strong
 

691
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,470
strong
and in it they've got this afghan

692
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:58,480
and in it they've got this afghan
 

693
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,150
and in it they've got this afghan
afghanistan warlord and he's

694
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:00,160
afghanistan warlord and he's
 

695
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,990
afghanistan warlord and he's
talking to a bunch of soldiers and he

696
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
talking to a bunch of soldiers and he
 

697
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,590
talking to a bunch of soldiers and he
says you know you don't have killer eyes

698
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,600
says you know you don't have killer eyes
 

699
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,190
says you know you don't have killer eyes
you do you do and he's just like he can

700
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
you do you do and he's just like he can
 

701
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,790
you do you do and he's just like he can
just tell right he's seen so many

702
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:06,800
just tell right he's seen so many
 

703
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,829
just tell right he's seen so many
soldiers

704
00:11:07,829 --> 00:11:07,839
soldiers
 

705
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,630
soldiers
and so i think that that was a a memory

706
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:10,640
and so i think that that was a a memory
 

707
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,230
and so i think that that was a a memory
on a number of occasions where i just

708
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:12,240
on a number of occasions where i just
 

709
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,590
on a number of occasions where i just
saw a young kid

710
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:13,600
saw a young kid
 

711
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,630
saw a young kid
and i just said they hate us right and

712
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:16,640
and i just said they hate us right and
 

713
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,269
and i just said they hate us right and
and it's not

714
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
and it's not
 

715
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,190
and it's not
you personally it's what you stand for

716
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
you personally it's what you stand for
 

717
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,190
you personally it's what you stand for
but the the really big event was

718
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,200
but the the really big event was
 

719
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,670
but the the really big event was
when you first get to these combat zones

720
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
when you first get to these combat zones
 

721
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,590
when you first get to these combat zones
a lot of times what will happen is

722
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:25,600
a lot of times what will happen is
 

723
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,990
a lot of times what will happen is
you basically your unit teams up with a

724
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,000
you basically your unit teams up with a
 

725
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,870
you basically your unit teams up with a
unit that's leaving

726
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
unit that's leaving
 

727
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,230
unit that's leaving
and there's a handoff and it happens

728
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:30,240
and there's a handoff and it happens
 

729
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,509
and there's a handoff and it happens
over a couple of weeks and so you can

730
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
over a couple of weeks and so you can
 

731
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:32,470
over a couple of weeks and so you can
imagine almost

732
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
imagine almost
 

733
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,910
imagine almost
you know one percent of our team goes

734
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
you know one percent of our team goes
 

735
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,150
you know one percent of our team goes
out with 99 of their team then 5

736
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,160
out with 99 of their team then 5
 

737
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,790
out with 99 of their team then 5
95 10 90 all the way till it's 50 50 and

738
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
95 10 90 all the way till it's 50 50 and
 

739
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,990
95 10 90 all the way till it's 50 50 and
then eventually it rotates and then it's

740
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,000
then eventually it rotates and then it's
 

741
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,350
then eventually it rotates and then it's
majority of our team and

742
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:41,360
majority of our team and
 

743
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,910
majority of our team and
a small number of their team and so what

744
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:43,920
a small number of their team and so what
 

745
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,590
a small number of their team and so what
a lot of people will explain is the two

746
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
a lot of people will explain is the two
 

747
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,269
a lot of people will explain is the two
most dangerous times in war

748
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
most dangerous times in war
 

749
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,790
most dangerous times in war
are actually the first two or three

750
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,800
are actually the first two or three
 

751
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,870
are actually the first two or three
weeks in the last two or three weeks

752
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:50,880
weeks in the last two or three weeks
 

753
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,990
weeks in the last two or three weeks
when you first get there you don't know

754
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
when you first get there you don't know
 

755
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,269
when you first get there you don't know
who the people are you don't know the

756
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:53,279
who the people are you don't know the
 

757
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,550
who the people are you don't know the
terrain you don't know

758
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:54,560
terrain you don't know
 

759
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,790
terrain you don't know
you know kind of the local cultures and

760
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
you know kind of the local cultures and
 

761
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,389
you know kind of the local cultures and
who to look out for what signs all that

762
00:11:58,389 --> 00:11:58,399
who to look out for what signs all that
 

763
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,110
who to look out for what signs all that
kind of stuff

764
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
kind of stuff
 

765
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,710
kind of stuff
and the last two or three weeks is you

766
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
and the last two or three weeks is you
 

767
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,150
and the last two or three weeks is you
basically think you've survived the

768
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
basically think you've survived the
 

769
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,110
basically think you've survived the
deployment you're looking forward to

770
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
deployment you're looking forward to
 

771
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,389
deployment you're looking forward to
going home so you become complacent

772
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:04,399
going home so you become complacent
 

773
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,670
going home so you become complacent
things like that

774
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:05,680
things like that
 

775
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,030
things like that
and so we made it through that

776
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:07,040
and so we made it through that
 

777
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,949
and so we made it through that
transition period with no issues

778
00:12:08,949 --> 00:12:08,959
transition period with no issues
 

779
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,030
transition period with no issues
uh but the literally the very first

780
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040

training kicks in
 

835
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,470
training kicks in
and so immediately every single person

836
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:04,480
and so immediately every single person
 

837
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,310
and so immediately every single person
starts screaming out ied ied and they

838
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,320
starts screaming out ied ied and they
 

839
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,670
starts screaming out ied ied and they
start looking and trying to figure it

840
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:07,680
start looking and trying to figure it
 

841
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,030
start looking and trying to figure it
out and you realize

842
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,040
out and you realize
 

843
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,710
out and you realize
the united states military did a

844
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:10,720
the united states military did a
 

845
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,350
the united states military did a
fantastic job training us before we went

846
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:13,360
fantastic job training us before we went
 

847
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,030
fantastic job training us before we went
because in that moment nobody thought

848
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,040
because in that moment nobody thought
 

849
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,790
because in that moment nobody thought
about anything you just did what you had

850
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
about anything you just did what you had
 

851
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,710
about anything you just did what you had
been programmed to do

852
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:18,720
been programmed to do
 

853
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,470
been programmed to do
and so ultimately kind of through the

854
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:20,480
and so ultimately kind of through the
 

855
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,310
and so ultimately kind of through the
end of that event uh there was u.s

856
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
end of that event uh there was u.s
 

857
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,829
end of that event uh there was u.s
soldier that ended up dying he was uh

858
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:23,839

00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
and um when we got back to the base uh
 

863
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,150
and um when we got back to the base uh
kind of after that entire event

864
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
kind of after that entire event
 

865

i think it just hit us we are at war and
if we make mistakes here

868
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:34,800
if we make mistakes here
 

869
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,030
if we make mistakes here
that is the cost of you know kind of

870
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,040
that is the cost of you know kind of
 

871
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,150
that is the cost of you know kind of
those mistakes

872
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:38,160
those mistakes
 

873
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,550
those mistakes
and this was somebody who i didn't know

874
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
and this was somebody who i didn't know
 

875
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,150
and this was somebody who i didn't know
uh it was somebody who literally showed

876
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,160
uh it was somebody who literally showed
 

877
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,710
uh it was somebody who literally showed
up

878
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:42,720
up
 

879
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,269
up
kind of as secondary support for our

880
00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:45,279
kind of as secondary support for our
 

881
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:46,069
kind of as secondary support for our
unit

882
00:13:46,069 --> 00:13:46,079
unit
 

883
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,949
unit
and basically uh was there to help us

884
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
and basically uh was there to help us
 

885
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,629
and basically uh was there to help us
right and so it was one of those weird

886
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:50,639
right and so it was one of those weird
 

887
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:51,990
right and so it was one of those weird
situations where

888
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
situations where
 

889
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,750
situations where
uh you have this emotional connection

890
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
uh you have this emotional connection
 

891
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,350
uh you have this emotional connection
because it's somebody who

892
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:55,360
because it's somebody who
 

893
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,509
because it's somebody who
uh shared an event with you but you

894
00:13:57,509 --> 00:13:57,519
uh shared an event with you but you
 

895
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,389
uh shared an event with you but you
didn't know them

896
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
didn't know them
 

897
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,230
didn't know them
right and you learn their name later and

898
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:00,240
right and you learn their name later and
 

899
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,670
right and you learn their name later and
you understand that they have a family

900
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:01,680
you understand that they have a family
 

901
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,870
you understand that they have a family
and they have young kids and all this

902
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:02,880
and they have young kids and all this
 

903
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,509
and they have young kids and all this
stuff

904
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:03,519
stuff
 

905
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,269
stuff
and so again as a 20 year old kid you're

906
00:14:05,269 --> 00:14:05,279
and so again as a 20 year old kid you're
 

907
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,870
and so again as a 20 year old kid you're
kind of processing all this and you just

908
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:06,880
kind of processing all this and you just
 

909
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,990
kind of processing all this and you just
realize like

910
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:08,000

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,550
tanks rolling down the street from
another country

00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:50,560
another country
 

1017
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,470
another country
yeah and they were basically imposing

1018
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
yeah and they were basically imposing
 

1019
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,230
yeah and they were basically imposing
their rules on us

1020
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,240
their rules on us
 

1021
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,749
their rules on us
whether they thought it was the right

1022
00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:55,759
whether they thought it was the right
 

1023
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,269
whether they thought it was the right
thing to do or not the soldiers were

1024
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
thing to do or not the soldiers were
 

1025
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,629
thing to do or not the soldiers were
there they were doing this

there they were doing this
 

1027
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,550
there they were doing this
we would probably feel not so great

1028
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:00,560
we would probably feel not so great
 

1029
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,629
we would probably feel not so great
about it right at kind of a minimum

1030
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
about it right at kind of a minimum
 

1031
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,230
about it right at kind of a minimum
and at a maximum we'd be really really

1032
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
and at a maximum we'd be really really
 

1033
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,749
and at a maximum we'd be really really
pissed off we would fight back

1034
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759
pissed off we would fight back
 

1035
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,829
pissed off we would fight back
and so what you don't understand when

1036
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:07,839
and so what you don't understand when
 

1037
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,350
and so what you don't understand when
you're in the heat of the moment is

1038
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,360
you're in the heat of the moment is
 

1039
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,350
you're in the heat of the moment is
why does this person feel this way and

1040
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
why does this person feel this way and
 

1041
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
why does this person feel this way and
so what's very weird

1042
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
so what's very weird
 

1043
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,389
so what's very weird
is well what happens if a year ago u.s

1044
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:16,399
is well what happens if a year ago u.s
 

1045
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,990
is well what happens if a year ago u.s
soldiers came through

1046
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
soldiers came through
 

1047
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,150
soldiers came through
they got shot at they returned fire and

1048
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:20,160
they got shot at they returned fire and
 

1049
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,389
they got shot at they returned fire and
they killed that kid's uncle

1050
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
they killed that kid's uncle
 

1051
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,790
they killed that kid's uncle
you'd be pissed off right and so you

1052
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
you'd be pissed off right and so you
 

1053
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,550
you'd be pissed off right and so you
just start to understand like

1054
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
just start to understand like
 

1055
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,389
just start to understand like
we look at war very black and white we

1056
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
we look at war very black and white we
 

1057

we look at war very black and white we
look at it very much

1058
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:29,680
look at it very much
 

1059
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,430
look at it very much
from a clinical perspective we're going

1060
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:31,440
from a clinical perspective we're going
 

1061
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,350
from a clinical perspective we're going
to go we're going to go kind of invade

1062
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
to go we're going to go kind of invade
 

1063
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,470
to go we're going to go kind of invade
somewhere

1064
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:34,480
somewhere
 

1065
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,230
somewhere
we are the most dominant military in the

1066
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
we are the most dominant military in the
 

1067
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,150
we are the most dominant military in the
world we're very good at invading

1068
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
world we're very good at invading
 

1069
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,509
world we're very good at invading
uh and we will crush wherever we invade

1070
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
uh and we will crush wherever we invade
 

1071
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,629
uh and we will crush wherever we invade
but when you're actually on the ground

1072
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:42,639
but when you're actually on the ground
 

1073
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,230
but when you're actually on the ground
what you understand is the humanity of

1074
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:44,240
what you understand is the humanity of
 

1075
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,870
what you understand is the humanity of
it all

1076
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
it all
 

1077
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,470
it all
right and so what becomes very

1078
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
right and so what becomes very
 

1079
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,069
right and so what becomes very
interesting is uh

1080
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
interesting is uh
 

1081
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,509
interesting is uh
pretty much every veteran i know that

1082
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:49,519
pretty much every veteran i know that
 

1083

gonna bring hell with us
right and understand that is the

1112
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:15,520
right and understand that is the
 

1113
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,110
right and understand that is the
business that we are in

1114
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
business that we are in
 

1115
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,029
business that we are in
but every single other person up until

1116
00:17:19,029 --> 00:17:19,039
but every single other person up until
 

1117
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,110
but every single other person up until
we get sent has a job to do to prevent

1118
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
we get sent has a job to do to prevent
 

1119
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,309
we get sent has a job to do to prevent
having to send us

having to send us
 

1121
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,829
having to send us
and i think that ultimately that's where

1122
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:23,839
and i think that ultimately that's where
 

1123
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,750
and i think that ultimately that's where
you see a lot of kind of this generation

1124
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
you see a lot of kind of this generation
 

1125
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,909
you see a lot of kind of this generation
that is fought in iraq and afghanistan

1126
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
that is fought in iraq and afghanistan
 

1127
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,470
that is fought in iraq and afghanistan
that says listen maybe we shouldn't be

1128
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:30,480
that says listen maybe we shouldn't be
 

1129
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,830
that says listen maybe we shouldn't be
running around the world being the

1130
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:31,840
running around the world being the
 

1131
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,549
running around the world being the
police

1132
00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:32,559
police
 

1133
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,310
police
maybe we shouldn't be going and invading

1134
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
maybe we shouldn't be going and invading
 

1135
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,669
maybe we shouldn't be going and invading
all these different countries

1136
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:35,679
all these different countries
 

1137
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,510
all these different countries
because when you actually get to see

1138

because when you actually get to see
 

1139
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,510
because when you actually get to see
firsthand what happens

1140
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:39,520
firsthand what happens
 

1141
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,950
firsthand what happens
it's just something that we should avoid

1142
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:40,960
it's just something that we should avoid
 

1143
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,270
it's just something that we should avoid
at all cost but if we have to go

1144
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
at all cost but if we have to go
 

1145
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,590
at all cost but if we have to go
or we have to actually send soldiers

1146
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:45,600
or we have to actually send soldiers
 

1147
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,390
or we have to actually send soldiers
somewhere

1148
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:46,400
somewhere
 

1149
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,789
somewhere
understand what happens when that occurs

1150
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
understand what happens when that occurs
 

1151
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,990
understand what happens when that occurs
and you know the united states is the

always is that a fundamental aspect of
 

1167
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,830
always is that a fundamental aspect of
human nature

i think has like very negative
 

1175
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,470
i think has like very negative
connotations in terms of bullets and

1176
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
connotations in terms of bullets and
 

1177
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,510
connotations in terms of bullets and
bombs and death

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:13,520
bombs and death
 

1179
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,909
bombs and death
and kind of just very morbid type um

1180
00:18:17,909 --> 00:18:17,919
and kind of just very morbid type um
 

1181
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,950
and kind of just very morbid type um
understanding conflict on the other hand

1182
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
understanding conflict on the other hand
 

1183
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,390
understanding conflict on the other hand
i think people look at and say of course

1184
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
i think people look at and say of course
 

1185
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,909
i think people look at and say of course

there'll always be conflict right you
 

1187
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:24,870
there'll always be conflict right you
just can't have

1188
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
just can't have
 

1189
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,549
just can't have
billions of people all on the same

1190
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:26,559
billions of people all on the same
 

1191
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,070
billions of people all on the same
planet without some level of

1192
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:28,080
planet without some level of
 

1193
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,110
planet without some level of
disagreement whether that's a

1194
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,120
disagreement whether that's a
 

1195
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,470
disagreement whether that's a
disagreement of ideas

1196
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:30,480
disagreement of ideas
 

1197
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,310
disagreement of ideas
disagreement over physical you know

1198
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
disagreement over physical you know
 

1199
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,549
disagreement over physical you know
geography or something else and so i

1200
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
geography or something else and so i
 

1201
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,990
geography or something else and so i
think conflict will always

1202
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
think conflict will always
 

1203
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,029
think conflict will always
exist the question is what form does war

1204
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:39,039
exist the question is what form does war
 

1205
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,390
exist the question is what form does war
take moving forward

1206
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
take moving forward
 

1207
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,870
take moving forward
and so in my mind you know it's starting

1208
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:42,880
and so in my mind you know it's starting
 

1209
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,549
and so in my mind you know it's starting
to look a lot more clinical

1210
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
to look a lot more clinical
 

1211
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,549
to look a lot more clinical
right a lot more drones a lot less

1212
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:46,559
right a lot more drones a lot less
 

1213
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,990
right a lot more drones a lot less
soldiers on the ground

1214
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:48,000
soldiers on the ground
 

1215
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,750
soldiers on the ground
a lot more use of special forces and

1216
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:49,760
a lot more use of special forces and
 

1217
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,510
a lot more use of special forces and
kind of these small highly specialized

1218
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:51,520
kind of these small highly specialized
 

1219
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,270
kind of these small highly specialized
teams rather than kind of big mechanical

1220
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:53,280
teams rather than kind of big mechanical
 

1221
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:53,990
teams rather than kind of big mechanical
armies

1222
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:54,000
armies
 

1223
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,430
armies
um and then you get into like the

1224
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:55,440
um and then you get into like the
 

1225
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,590
um and then you get into like the
information warfare and kind of cyber

1226
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:57,600
information warfare and kind of cyber
 

1227
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,909
information warfare and kind of cyber
warfare and you start to understand that

1228
00:18:59,909 --> 00:18:59,919
warfare and you start to understand that
 

1229
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,350
warfare and you start to understand that
we're at war with a lot of people right

1230
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,360
we're at war with a lot of people right
 

1231
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,110
we're at war with a lot of people right
now right doesn't mean we're necessarily

1232
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,120
now right doesn't mean we're necessarily
 

1233
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,270
now right doesn't mean we're necessarily
dropping bombs uh on their countries

1234
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:05,280
dropping bombs uh on their countries
 

1235
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,310
dropping bombs uh on their countries
it doesn't necessarily mean we're

1236
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
it doesn't necessarily mean we're
 

1237
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,630
it doesn't necessarily mean we're
sending soldiers there but on a daily

1238
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:08,640
sending soldiers there but on a daily
 

1239
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,549
sending soldiers there but on a daily
basis we are engaged in these kind of

1240
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:10,559
basis we are engaged in these kind of
 

1241
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,029
basis we are engaged in these kind of
you know cyber battlefields and so if

1242
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
you know cyber battlefields and so if
 

1243
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,190
you know cyber battlefields and so if
that's where war starts to play out

1244
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:15,200
that's where war starts to play out
 

1245
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,750
that's where war starts to play out
um it one changes the tools and tactics

1246
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:17,760
um it one changes the tools and tactics
 

1247
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,110
um it one changes the tools and tactics
and techniques that

1248
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,120
and techniques that
 

1249
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,950
and techniques that
we need to arm our country and other

1250
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:20,960
we need to arm our country and other
 

1251
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,630
we need to arm our country and other
countries will arm themselves with

1252
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:22,640
countries will arm themselves with
 

1253
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,470
countries will arm themselves with
but it also changes the way that we

1254
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:24,480
but it also changes the way that we
 

1255
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,909
but it also changes the way that we
think about war right

1256
00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:25,919
think about war right
 

1257
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,470
think about war right
it see it sounds a lot less uh worrisome

1258
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:28,480
it see it sounds a lot less uh worrisome
 

1259
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,510
it see it sounds a lot less uh worrisome
if i say hey

1260
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:29,520
if i say hey
 

1261
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,029
if i say hey
we're going to go to war with a country

1262
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:31,039
we're going to go to war with a country
 

1263
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,070
we're going to go to war with a country
but by the way there's going to be no

1264
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,080
but by the way there's going to be no
 

1265
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,350
but by the way there's going to be no
death

1266
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:33,360
death
 

1267
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,789
death
right okay like that doesn't sound

1268
00:19:34,789 --> 00:19:34,799
right okay like that doesn't sound
 

1269
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,230
right okay like that doesn't sound
nearly as bad as hey we're going to go

1270
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
nearly as bad as hey we're going to go
 

1271
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,070
nearly as bad as hey we're going to go
send 10 000 soldiers and you know some

1272
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,080
send 10 000 soldiers and you know some
 

1273
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,350
send 10 000 soldiers and you know some
percentage of them are gonna die on the

1274
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:39,360
percentage of them are gonna die on the
 

1275
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,630
percentage of them are gonna die on the
battlefield and then we're gonna

1276
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
battlefield and then we're gonna
 

1277
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,789
battlefield and then we're gonna
you know basically pipe back videos and

1278
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:42,799
you know basically pipe back videos and
 

1279
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:43,669
you know basically pipe back videos and
articles

1280
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
articles
 

1281
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,430
articles

1282
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:45,440
saying that american soldiers are dying
 

1283
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,510
saying that american soldiers are dying
yeah it does seem to be a fundamental

1284
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:47,520

1285
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,870
yeah it does seem to be a fundamental

versus cyber security where i stole all
 

1299
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,149
versus cyber security where i stole all
their data

1300
00:20:04,149 --> 00:20:04,159
their data
 

1301
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,549
their data
stole all their money stole everything

1302
00:20:06,549 --> 00:20:06,559
stole all their money stole everything
 

1303
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,430
stole all their money stole everything
they owned

1304
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:07,440
they owned
 

1305
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,190
they owned
falsified their identity all that kind

1306
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:09,200
falsified their identity all that kind
 

1307
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,710
falsified their identity all that kind
of stuff that

1308
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
of stuff that
 

1309
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,750
of stuff that
those are both traumatic events

1310
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:13,760
those are both traumatic events
 

1311
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,310
those are both traumatic events
but they do seem to be fundamentally

1312
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:16,320
but they do seem to be fundamentally
 

1313
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,669
but they do seem to be fundamentally
different but maybe that's

1314
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:17,679
different but maybe that's
 

1315
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,470
different but maybe that's
actually very narrow style thinking

1316
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:20,480
actually very narrow style thinking
 

1317
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,750
actually very narrow style thinking
because

1318
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:21,760
because
 

1319
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,430
because
ultimately you have to think about what

1320
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:23,440
ultimately you have to think about what
 

1321
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,669
ultimately you have to think about what
is life and what's happiness

1322
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:25,679
is life and what's happiness
 

1323
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,669
is life and what's happiness
and it's like the samurai thinking

1324
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
and it's like the samurai thinking
 

1325
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,110
and it's like the samurai thinking
i'm not sure what's more painful if i

1326
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
i'm not sure what's more painful if i
 

1327
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,029
i'm not sure what's more painful if i
take it to myself like i'm not sure what

1328
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:35,039
take it to myself like i'm not sure what
 

1329
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,549
take it to myself like i'm not sure what
i would rather

1330
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559
i would rather
 

1331
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,909
i would rather
live through being stabbed

1332
00:20:39,909 --> 00:20:39,919
live through being stabbed
 

1333
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,270
live through being stabbed
like to death or

1334
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,280
like to death or
 

1335
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,310
like to death or
having my identity stolen all my

1336
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:46,320
having my identity stolen all my
 

1337
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,390
having my identity stolen all my
money stolen or maybe

1338
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:50,400

 

1339
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,350

reputation destroyed like with lies or

1340
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
reputation destroyed like with lies or
 

1341
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,270
reputation destroyed like with lies or
something like that

1342
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:55,280
something like that
 

1343
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,630
something like that
that that's very interesting to think

1344
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:56,640
that that's very interesting to think
 

1345
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,310
that that's very interesting to think
about if you think about quality of life

1346
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:58,320
about if you think about quality of life
 

1347
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,510
about if you think about quality of life
and all those kinds of things

1348
00:20:59,510 --> 00:20:59,520
and all those kinds of things
 

1349
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,430
and all those kinds of things
well one that's finite right

1350
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:03,440
well one that's finite right
 

1351
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,029
well one that's finite right
yeah and the other is kind of a long

1352
00:21:05,029 --> 00:21:05,039
yeah and the other is kind of a long
 

1353
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,710
yeah and the other is kind of a long
prolonged almost torture

1354
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:06,720
prolonged almost torture
 

1355
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,870
prolonged almost torture
physical pain versus psychological pain

1356
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:08,880
physical pain versus psychological pain
 

1357
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,710
physical pain versus psychological pain
uh it's really interesting to

1358
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
uh it's really interesting to
 

1359
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,789
uh it's really interesting to
it's really interesting to think about

1360
00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:12,799
it's really interesting to think about
 

1361
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,710
it's really interesting to think about
and i think another key piece to this um

1362
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:14,720
and i think another key piece to this um
 

1363
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,990
and i think another key piece to this um
which i don't have answers to

1364
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:16,000
which i don't have answers to
 

1365
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,830
which i don't have answers to
but but there is an element of emotion

1366
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
but but there is an element of emotion
 

1367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,630
but but there is an element of emotion
and rage in the physical violence versus

1368
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
and rage in the physical violence versus
 

1369
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,470
and rage in the physical violence versus
again more of that clinical you know

1370
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:22,480
again more of that clinical you know
 

1371
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,470
again more of that clinical you know
information warfare and so

1372
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:24,480
information warfare and so
 

1373
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,909
information warfare and so
um it's really easy to show a

1374
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:27,919
um it's really easy to show a
 

1375
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,390
um it's really easy to show a
battlefield where there's death on both

1376
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:30,400
battlefield where there's death on both
 

1377
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,190
battlefield where there's death on both
sides and

1378
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:31,200
sides and
 

1379
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,630
sides and
bombs being dropped and buildings

1380
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:32,640
bombs being dropped and buildings
 

1381
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,430
bombs being dropped and buildings
destroyed it it fits very well into

1382
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
destroyed it it fits very well into
 

1383
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,510
destroyed it it fits very well into
propaganda for everyone involved

1384
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
propaganda for everyone involved
 

1385
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,909
propaganda for everyone involved
right regardless of what side they're on

1386
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:39,919
right regardless of what side they're on
 

1387
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,110
right regardless of what side they're on
when you start talking about

1388
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,120
when you start talking about
 

1389
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,430
when you start talking about
cyber warfare how many times have we

1390
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
cyber warfare how many times have we
 

1391
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,470
cyber warfare how many times have we
seen a big company

1392
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:44,480
seen a big company
 

1393
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,549
seen a big company
get data hacked or information hacked

1394
00:21:46,549 --> 00:21:46,559
get data hacked or information hacked
 

1395
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,669
get data hacked or information hacked
and we all

1396
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
and we all
 

1397
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,270
and we all
you know read the headlines maybe throw

1398
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
you know read the headlines maybe throw
 

1399
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,789
you know read the headlines maybe throw
a tweet out and then move on with our

1400
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
a tweet out and then move on with our
 

1401
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,390
a tweet out and then move on with our
day and don't remember it anymore

1402
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,400
day and don't remember it anymore
 

1403
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,630
day and don't remember it anymore
and so it's just very very different i

1404
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:54,640
and so it's just very very different i
 

1405
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,430
and so it's just very very different i
think

1406
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:55,440
think
 

1407
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,350
think
in the emotion and response that it

1408
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:57,360
in the emotion and response that it
 

1409
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,870
in the emotion and response that it
invokes in people when they hear about

1410
00:21:58,870 --> 00:21:58,880
invokes in people when they hear about
 

1411
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,310
invokes in people when they hear about
it as well

1412
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:00,320
it as well
 

1413
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,149
it as well
given the conflict do you think people

1414
00:22:02,149 --> 00:22:02,159
given the conflict do you think people
 

1415
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,470
given the conflict do you think people
are fundamentally good

1416
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
are fundamentally good
 

1417
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,870
are fundamentally good
are we all sort of like blank slates

1418
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:06,880
are we all sort of like blank slates
 

1419
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,669
are we all sort of like blank slates
that could be

1420
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
that could be
 

1421
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,710
that could be
evil given the environment or good given

1422
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:10,720
evil given the environment or good given
 

1423
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,510
evil given the environment or good given
the environment

1424
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:11,520
the environment
 

1425
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,549
the environment
or can we kind of is there some base

1426
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:14,559
or can we kind of is there some base
 

1427
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,909
or can we kind of is there some base
that we can rely on that people

1428
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
that we can rely on that people
 

1429
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,390
that we can rely on that people
if left to their own devices will be

1430
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
if left to their own devices will be
 

1431
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,350
if left to their own devices will be
good

1432
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:21,360
good
 

1433
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:24,310
good
and trustworthy and honest i think you

1434
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:24,320
and trustworthy and honest i think you
 

1435
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,149
and trustworthy and honest i think you
have to separate out intention from

1436
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:26,159
have to separate out intention from
 

1437
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,350
have to separate out intention from
action

1438
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:27,360
action
 

1439
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,149
action
so if you talk to some of the most

1440
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
so if you talk to some of the most
 

1441
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,149
so if you talk to some of the most
heinous criminals in the world

1442
00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:32,159
heinous criminals in the world
 

1443
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,789
heinous criminals in the world
they've rationalized their actions and

1444
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:34,799
they've rationalized their actions and
 

1445
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,870
they've rationalized their actions and
so you've got to ask yourself

1446
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:36,880
so you've got to ask yourself
 

1447
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,870
so you've got to ask yourself
what is the level of which they

1448
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
what is the level of which they
 

1449
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,390
what is the level of which they
understood what they were doing

1450
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:40,400
understood what they were doing
 

1451
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,549
understood what they were doing
that they intended to be malicious

1452
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
that they intended to be malicious
 

1453
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,669
that they intended to be malicious
nefarious

1454
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:43,679
nefarious
 

1455
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,510
nefarious
um and kind of do bad things versus

1456
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
um and kind of do bad things versus
 

1457
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,630
um and kind of do bad things versus
the actual actions themselves and so um

1458
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:50,640
the actual actions themselves and so um
 

1459
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,270
the actual actions themselves and so um
even as a society you know if let's say

1460
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:53,280
even as a society you know if let's say
 

1461
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,070
even as a society you know if let's say
for example

1462
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:54,080
for example
 

1463
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,430
for example
you were to walk down the street and you

1464
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:55,440
you were to walk down the street and you
 

1465
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,029
you were to walk down the street and you
were to murder somebody on the sidewalk

1466
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
were to murder somebody on the sidewalk
 

1467
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,710
were to murder somebody on the sidewalk
completely unprovoked

1468
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
completely unprovoked
 

1469
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,950
completely unprovoked
we would look at you and say you are a

we would look at you and say you are a
 

1471

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,310
in our society and therefore we will

levy
 

1481
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,950
levy
you know the extent of rule of law

1482
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
you know the extent of rule of law
 

1483
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,390
you know the extent of rule of law
against you in order to

00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
become that a monster of that beast
 

1489
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,149

if in the same situation somebody walks

1490
00:23:18,149 --> 00:23:18,159
if in the same situation somebody walks
 

1491
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,830
if in the same situation somebody walks
in your house with a knife

1492
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:19,840
in your house with a knife
 

1493
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,950
in your house with a knife
and you murder them or you kill them

1494
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
and you murder them or you kill them
 

1495
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,950
and you murder them or you kill them
now we put you up on a pedestal as a

1496
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
now we put you up on a pedestal as a
 

1497
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,149
now we put you up on a pedestal as a
hero

1498
00:23:26,149 --> 00:23:26,159
hero
 

1499
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,430
hero
and those are two very very different

1500
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
and those are two very very different
 

1501
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,070
and those are two very very different
responses they may be just as morbid

1502
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,080
responses they may be just as morbid
 

1503
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,710
responses they may be just as morbid
they may be just as violent uh in terms

1504
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:32,720
they may be just as violent uh in terms
 

1505
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,230
they may be just as violent uh in terms
of the actual actions

1506
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:34,240
of the actual actions
 

1507
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,070
of the actual actions
the intentions the way it's perceived is

1508
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,080
the intentions the way it's perceived is
 

1509
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,669
the intentions the way it's perceived is
very very different and so

1510
00:23:37,669 --> 00:23:37,679
very very different and so
 

1511
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,070
very very different and so
i think that uh as a world we like a

1512
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:40,080
i think that uh as a world we like a
 

1513
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,149
i think that uh as a world we like a
very black and white clean-cut you know

1514
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:42,159
very black and white clean-cut you know
 

1515
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:42,470
very black and white clean-cut you know
good

1516
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:42,480
good
 

1517
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,390
good
bad uh i think the world's a lot more

1518
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
bad uh i think the world's a lot more
 

1519
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,230
bad uh i think the world's a lot more
messy than that and i think that

1520
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,240
messy than that and i think that
 

1521
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,750
messy than that and i think that
a lot of times when you look at

1522
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:47,760
a lot of times when you look at
 

1523
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,310
a lot of times when you look at
intention it's hard for us to tell what

1524
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
intention it's hard for us to tell what
 

1525
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,830
intention it's hard for us to tell what
somebody's intention is

1526
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:51,840
somebody's intention is
 

1527
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,549
somebody's intention is
but i've looked at a lot of you know

1528
00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:54,559
but i've looked at a lot of you know
 

1529
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,510
but i've looked at a lot of you know
people who are both

1530
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:55,520
people who are both
 

1531
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,110
people who are both
considered very good and also a lot of

1532
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:57,120
considered very good and also a lot of
 

1533
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,950
considered very good and also a lot of
people are considered very bad

1534
00:23:58,950 --> 00:23:58,960
people are considered very bad
 

1535
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,789
people are considered very bad
and they sound very similar in terms of

1536
00:24:00,789 --> 00:24:00,799
and they sound very similar in terms of
 

1537
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,110
and they sound very similar in terms of
the motivations for their actions

1538
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:03,120
the motivations for their actions
 

1539
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,789
the motivations for their actions
and so i think that it's just a really

1540
00:24:04,789 --> 00:24:04,799
and so i think that it's just a really
 

1541
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,470
and so i think that it's just a really
hard problem that probably doesn't have

1542
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:06,480
hard problem that probably doesn't have
 

1543
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,149
hard problem that probably doesn't have
a perfect solution or an answer

1544
00:24:08,149 --> 00:24:08,159
a perfect solution or an answer
 

1545
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,230
a perfect solution or an answer
do you give much value to the intention

1546
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:10,240
do you give much value to the intention
 

1547
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,390
do you give much value to the intention
or do you think is is better to look

1548
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
or do you think is is better to look
 

1549
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,710
or do you think is is better to look
at the results of the behavior uh as

1550
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:14,720
at the results of the behavior uh as
 

1551
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,830
at the results of the behavior uh as
opposed to the

1552
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:15,840
opposed to the
 

1553
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,789
opposed to the
in the un underlying ideology the

1554
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
in the un underlying ideology the
 

1555
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,149
in the un underlying ideology the
underlying intention

1556
00:24:20,149 --> 00:24:20,159
underlying intention
 

1557
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,350
underlying intention
of the behavior i think that intention

1558
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:23,360
of the behavior i think that intention
 

1559
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,789
of the behavior i think that intention
gets at the question of like are people

1560
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
gets at the question of like are people
 

1561
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,909
gets at the question of like are people
inherently good or bad

1562
00:24:25,909 --> 00:24:25,919
inherently good or bad
 

1563
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,669
inherently good or bad
yeah right is i think that they're

1564
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:27,679
yeah right is i think that they're
 

1565
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,350
yeah right is i think that they're
generally inherently good

1566
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
generally inherently good
 

1567
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,750
generally inherently good
and the intention is driving towards the

1568
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:31,760
and the intention is driving towards the
 

1569
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,830
and the intention is driving towards the
thing that they believe is the best

1570
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:33,840
thing that they believe is the best
 

1571
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,750
thing that they believe is the best
outcome or the best thing for them to

1572
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:35,760
outcome or the best thing for them to
 

1573
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,230
outcome or the best thing for them to
pursue the action i think is where we

1574
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:38,240
pursue the action i think is where we
 

1575
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,789
pursue the action i think is where we
spend most of our time focused on

1576
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:40,799
spend most of our time focused on
 

1577
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,269
spend most of our time focused on
and frankly we actually may be a better

1578
00:24:43,269 --> 00:24:43,279
and frankly we actually may be a better
 

1579
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:43,990
and frankly we actually may be a better
society

1580
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
society
 

1581
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,870
society
or kind of kinder as a humanity to each

other
 

1585
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,470
other
if we spent more time looking at

1586
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:48,480
if we spent more time looking at
 

1587
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,710
if we spent more time looking at
intention rather than action um but

1588
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:50,720
intention rather than action um but
 

1589
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,269

you know if somebody walks down the

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,870
you know if somebody walks down the
street and murders somebody uh it's

street and murders somebody uh it's
 

1595
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,710

really hard to have a conversation and
 

1597
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,310
really hard to have a conversation and
it may be inappropriate for us to have a

it may be inappropriate for us to have a

conversation about intention
 

1601
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,870
conversation about intention
versus uh any level of of action right

uh i work backwards off of what is the
 

1623
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,029
uh i work backwards off of what is the
maximalism that i believe in and the

1624
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
maximalism that i believe in and the
 

1625
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,149
maximalism that i believe in and the
world that i believe in

1626
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
world that i believe in
 

1627
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,070
world that i believe in
is kind of an automated world that is

1628
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
is kind of an automated world that is
 

1629
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,710
is kind of an automated world that is
run on these open decentralized

00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:38,720
run on these open decentralized

uh and what we ultimately do is we

uh and what we ultimately do is we
 

1635
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,669
uh and what we ultimately do is we
return

1636
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:43,679
return
 

1637
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,470

uh to people over institutions and what
 

1645
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,269
uh to people over institutions and what
we end up doing

1646
00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:53,279
we end up doing
 

1647
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,230
we end up doing
is we end up uh kind of taking what has

1648
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,240
is we end up uh kind of taking what has
 

1649
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,669
is we end up uh kind of taking what has
historically been a very

1650
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:57,679
historically been a very
 

1651
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,470
historically been a very
uh analog or physical world economy and

1652
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
uh analog or physical world economy and
 

1653
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:00,870
uh analog or physical world economy and
uh

1654
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:00,880
uh
 

1655
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,669
uh
geographic rule and we then kind of put

1656
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:03,679
geographic rule and we then kind of put
 

1657
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:04,549
geographic rule and we then kind of put
it in the cloud

1658
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:04,559
it in the cloud
 

1659
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,470
it in the cloud
and this digital economy becomes the

1660
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:06,480
and this digital economy becomes the
 

1661
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,230
and this digital economy becomes the
prevalent way that we all

1662
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:08,240
prevalent way that we all
 

1663
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,750
prevalent way that we all
uh conduct commerce communicate uh etc

1664
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:11,760
uh conduct commerce communicate uh etc
 

1665
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:12,470
uh conduct commerce communicate uh etc
and so

1666
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
and so
 

1667
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,549
and so
it's less about any one single

1668
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:14,559
it's less about any one single
 

1669
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,830
it's less about any one single
technology to me right

1670
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
technology to me right
 

1671
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,269
technology to me right
i think that it's pretty stupid for

1672
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
i think that it's pretty stupid for
 

1673
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,070
i think that it's pretty stupid for
people to um almost in a way

1674
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,080
people to um almost in a way
 

1675
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,630
people to um almost in a way
uh put an inanimate object up for uh

1676
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:24,640
uh put an inanimate object up for uh
 

1677
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,110
uh put an inanimate object up for uh
you know some sort of obsession uh to me

1678
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
you know some sort of obsession uh to me
 

1679
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,029
you know some sort of obsession uh to me
it's much more about the ideals the

1680
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:29,039
it's much more about the ideals the
 

1681
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:29,909
it's much more about the ideals the
ethos

1682
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:29,919
ethos
 

1683
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,710
ethos
uh and the most rational uh and likely

1684
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:32,720
uh and the most rational uh and likely
 

1685
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,190
uh and the most rational uh and likely
path

1686
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:33,200
path
 

1687
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,190
path
to that kind of end result or that world

1688
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:35,200
to that kind of end result or that world
 

1689
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,549
to that kind of end result or that world
that i think you know is at this point

1690
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
that i think you know is at this point
 

1691
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,070
that i think you know is at this point
just a foregone conclusion so the

1692
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
just a foregone conclusion so the
 

1693
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,029
just a foregone conclusion so the
distinction there

1694
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
distinction there
 

1695
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,029
distinction there
and maybe if people don't know the

1696
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
and maybe if people don't know the
 

1697
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,230
and maybe if people don't know the
terminology maximalism is basically

1698
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:44,240
terminology maximalism is basically
 

1699
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,830
terminology maximalism is basically
saying i really think this is a good

1700
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
saying i really think this is a good
 

1701
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,669
saying i really think this is a good
idea

1702
00:26:49,669 --> 00:26:49,679
idea
 

1703
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,990
idea
like uh you know if you prefer a certain

1704
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:52,000
like uh you know if you prefer a certain
 

1705
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,870
like uh you know if you prefer a certain
kind of diet

1706
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
kind of diet
 

1707
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,630
kind of diet
you could be a keto maximalist saying

1708
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:54,640
you could be a keto maximalist saying
 

1709
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,870
you could be a keto maximalist saying
like this is probably

1710
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:56,880
like this is probably
 

1711
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,870
like this is probably
maybe it's not a hundred percent but

1712
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
maybe it's not a hundred percent but
 

1713
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,950
maybe it's not a hundred percent but
probably the diet that's healthiest for

1714
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:00,960
probably the diet that's healthiest for
 

1715
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,230
probably the diet that's healthiest for
humans kind of thing

1716
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,240
humans kind of thing
 

1717
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,830
humans kind of thing
in the same sense bitcoin maximalism is

1718
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:04,840
in the same sense bitcoin maximalism is
 

1719
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,070
in the same sense bitcoin maximalism is
saying

1720
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
saying
 

1721
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,149
saying
you know of course we don't know there's

1722
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:08,159
you know of course we don't know there's
 

1723
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,909
you know of course we don't know there's
a lot of uncertainty but this particular

1724
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
a lot of uncertainty but this particular
 

1725
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,710
a lot of uncertainty but this particular
technology

1726
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:10,720
technology
 

1727
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,269
technology
seems to be the best representations of

1728
00:27:13,269 --> 00:27:13,279
seems to be the best representations of
 

1729
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:14,630
seems to be the best representations of
some set of ideals

1730
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
some set of ideals
 

1731
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,190
some set of ideals
that defines progress in in the future

1732
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:17,200
that defines progress in in the future
 

1733
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,870
that defines progress in in the future
but you're drawing a distinction between

1734
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:18,880
but you're drawing a distinction between
 

1735
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,789
but you're drawing a distinction between
sort of uh

1736
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
sort of uh
 

1737
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,830
sort of uh
cult-like obsession about an object of

1738
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:23,840
cult-like obsession about an object of
 

1739
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,110
cult-like obsession about an object of
any kind whether it's

1740
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,120
any kind whether it's
 

1741
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,549
any kind whether it's
keto uh or uh bitcoin

1742
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
keto uh or uh bitcoin
 

1743
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,350
keto uh or uh bitcoin
and just sort of believing that a

1744
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:31,360
and just sort of believing that a
 

1745
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,830
and just sort of believing that a
technology is the best representation of

1746
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
technology is the best representation of
 

1747
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,590
technology is the best representation of
a particular set of ideals

1748
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:35,600
a particular set of ideals
 

1749
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,110
a particular set of ideals
and you believe that sort of uh

1750
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,120
and you believe that sort of uh
 

1751
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,630
and you believe that sort of uh
this moving into the cloud

1752
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:42,640
this moving into the cloud
 

1753
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,310
this moving into the cloud
both the distributed nature of it but

1754
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:44,320
both the distributed nature of it but
 

1755
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,710
both the distributed nature of it but
also just the digital nature of it

1756
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:46,720
also just the digital nature of it
 

1757
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,029
also just the digital nature of it
is something that's going to uh be a

1758
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:49,039
is something that's going to uh be a
 

1759
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,789
is something that's going to uh be a
positive step for humanity

1760
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
positive step for humanity
 

1761
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,549
positive step for humanity
yeah i would even take maximalism a step

1762
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
yeah i would even take maximalism a step
 

1763
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,230
yeah i would even take maximalism a step
further and it's not just the

1764
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:54,240
further and it's not just the
 

1765
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,630
further and it's not just the
kind of singular viewpoint of this is

1766
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
kind of singular viewpoint of this is
 

1767
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,590
kind of singular viewpoint of this is
the best

1768
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:57,600
the best
 

1769
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,990
the best
it's also an element of it's

1770
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
it's also an element of it's
 

1771
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,389
it's also an element of it's
anti-everything else right

1772
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
anti-everything else right
 

1773
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,710
anti-everything else right
so you know take keto for example uh the

1774
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:04,720
so you know take keto for example uh the
 

1775
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,870
so you know take keto for example uh the
keto diet is not only the best diet all

1776
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
keto diet is not only the best diet all
 

1777
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,149
keto diet is not only the best diet all
the other diets are bad

1778
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
the other diets are bad
 

1779
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,070
the other diets are bad
yeah right and so it's it's a very

1780
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,080
yeah right and so it's it's a very
 

1781
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,590
yeah right and so it's it's a very
binary view of the world

1782
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:11,600
binary view of the world
 

1783
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,590
binary view of the world
um i think that what's probably most

1784
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
um i think that what's probably most
 

1785
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,789
um i think that what's probably most
misunderstood about

1786
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:14,799
misunderstood about
 

1787
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,029
misunderstood about
uh let's take bitcoin uh as a specific

1788
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
uh let's take bitcoin uh as a specific
 

1789
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:17,830
uh let's take bitcoin uh as a specific
example

1790
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
example
 

1791
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,669
example
is that most of the people who are

1792
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:19,679
is that most of the people who are
 

1793
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,070
is that most of the people who are
labeled bitcoin maximalist

1794
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
labeled bitcoin maximalist
 

1795
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,590
labeled bitcoin maximalist
they would be open-minded if they

1796
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
they would be open-minded if they
 

1797
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,110
they would be open-minded if they
believed that something else came along

1798
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,120
believed that something else came along
 

1799
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,389
believed that something else came along
that was a superior

1800
00:28:26,389 --> 00:28:26,399
that was a superior
 

1801
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,350
that was a superior
technology or had a better kind of

1802
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:29,360
technology or had a better kind of
 

1803
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,630
technology or had a better kind of
probability of achieving

1804
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:30,640
probability of achieving
 

1805
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,430
probability of achieving
again that ultimate vision i think where

1806
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
again that ultimate vision i think where
 

1807
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,070
again that ultimate vision i think where
uh

1808
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:34,080
uh
 

1809
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,070
uh
there's this controversy and kind of

1810
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
there's this controversy and kind of
 

1811
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,070
there's this controversy and kind of
clashing of uh ideas

1812
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:38,080
clashing of uh ideas
 

1813
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,310
clashing of uh ideas
is that the bitcoin community believes

1814
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
is that the bitcoin community believes
 

1815
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,549
is that the bitcoin community believes
bitcoin is the best way to do that

1816
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
bitcoin is the best way to do that
 

1817
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,110
bitcoin is the best way to do that
and has very specific arguments as to

1818
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:45,120
and has very specific arguments as to
 

1819
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,870
and has very specific arguments as to
why the other things are not

1820
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:46,880
why the other things are not
 

1821
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,549
why the other things are not
right and so what ultimately ends up

1822
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559
right and so what ultimately ends up
 

1823
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,070
right and so what ultimately ends up
happening which is very weird

1824
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:50,080
happening which is very weird
 

1825
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,149
happening which is very weird
in uh the investing world right it's

1826
00:28:52,149 --> 00:28:52,159
in uh the investing world right it's
 

1827
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,590
in uh the investing world right it's
unlikely that you and i are going to sit

1828
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:53,600
unlikely that you and i are going to sit
 

1829
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,110
unlikely that you and i are going to sit
down you're like apple stock is the best

1830
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
down you're like apple stock is the best
 

1831
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,389
down you're like apple stock is the best
stock and there's no other stock that's

1832
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
stock and there's no other stock that's
 

1833
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:57,990
stock and there's no other stock that's
worth anything yeah right

1834
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
worth anything yeah right
 

1835
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,149
worth anything yeah right
and uh and then also it's very weird if

1836
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
and uh and then also it's very weird if
 

1837
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,110
and uh and then also it's very weird if
you said to me

1838
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:01,120
you said to me
 

1839
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,669
you said to me
um you know this stock is worth zero and

1840
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:03,679
um you know this stock is worth zero and
 

1841
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:04,310
um you know this stock is worth zero and
that's where

1842
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:04,320
that's where
 

1843
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,789
that's where
everything that i own i've put on a

1844
00:29:06,789 --> 00:29:06,799
everything that i own i've put on a
 

1845
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,230
everything that i own i've put on a
short on one single company

1846
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,240
short on one single company
 

1847
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,750
short on one single company
right there's diversification there's

1848
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:09,760
right there's diversification there's
 

1849
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,269
right there's diversification there's
much more kind of probabilistic thinking

1850
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
much more kind of probabilistic thinking
 

1851
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,789
much more kind of probabilistic thinking
in finance in general

1852
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:12,799
in finance in general
 

1853
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,669
in finance in general
uh when it comes to this specific world

1854
00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:15,679
uh when it comes to this specific world
 

1855
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,269
uh when it comes to this specific world
of cryptocurrency and kind of digital

1856
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:17,279
of cryptocurrency and kind of digital
 

1857
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,389
of cryptocurrency and kind of digital
assets if you will

1858
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:18,399
assets if you will
 

1859
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,830
assets if you will
uh is there's two main groups of people

1860
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:21,840
uh is there's two main groups of people
 

1861
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,269
uh is there's two main groups of people
who are trying to build two

1862
00:29:23,269 --> 00:29:23,279
who are trying to build two
 

1863
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,230
who are trying to build two
very very different things at the onset

1864
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:26,240
very very different things at the onset
 

1865
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,990
very very different things at the onset
but when you unpack it and you start to

1866
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
but when you unpack it and you start to
 

1867
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,510
but when you unpack it and you start to
spend more time on it you guys they're

1868
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,520
spend more time on it you guys they're
 

1869
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,870
spend more time on it you guys they're
actually trying to accomplish the same

1870
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:30,880
actually trying to accomplish the same
 

1871
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,310
actually trying to accomplish the same
thing in two different ways

1872
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:32,320
thing in two different ways
 

1873
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,789
thing in two different ways
so bitcoin is seen i think as a digital

1874
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:34,799
so bitcoin is seen i think as a digital
 

1875
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,350
so bitcoin is seen i think as a digital
currency

1876
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:35,360
currency
 

1877
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,870
currency
right kind of the idea that this is

1878
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:36,880
right kind of the idea that this is
 

1879
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,230
right kind of the idea that this is
going to ascend to become the next

1880
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:38,240
going to ascend to become the next
 

1881
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,510
going to ascend to become the next
global reserve currency

1882
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:39,520
global reserve currency
 

1883
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,750
global reserve currency
it's a programmatic kind of transparent

1884
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:41,760
it's a programmatic kind of transparent
 

1885
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,190
it's a programmatic kind of transparent
um money

1886
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
um money
 

1887
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,669
um money
and uh it's essentially just 180 degrees

1888
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:45,679
and uh it's essentially just 180 degrees
 

1889
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,430
and uh it's essentially just 180 degrees
difference than the inflationary

1890
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:47,440
difference than the inflationary
 

1891
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,149
difference than the inflationary
you know non-transparent fiat currencies

1892
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
you know non-transparent fiat currencies
 

1893
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,750
you know non-transparent fiat currencies
that exist in the world

1894
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:51,760
that exist in the world
 

1895
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,590
that exist in the world
you then look at kind of everything else

1896
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
you then look at kind of everything else
 

1897
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,789
you then look at kind of everything else
right and you have a lot of smart

1898
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
right and you have a lot of smart
 

1899
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,470
right and you have a lot of smart
contract platforms and

1900
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:56,480
contract platforms and
 

1901
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,750
contract platforms and
various things that they're all going

1902
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:57,760
various things that they're all going
 

1903
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,190
various things that they're all going
after right ethereum with kind of the

1904
00:29:59,190 --> 00:29:59,200
after right ethereum with kind of the
 

1905
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,110
after right ethereum with kind of the
world computer approach and you can kind

1906
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:01,120
world computer approach and you can kind
 

1907
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,310
world computer approach and you can kind
of go down the line with all their other

1908
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:02,320
of go down the line with all their other
 

1909
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,510
of go down the line with all their other
arguments it's what they're trying to

1910
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:03,520
arguments it's what they're trying to
 

1911
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,470
arguments it's what they're trying to
build

1912
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:04,480
build
 

1913
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,070
build
i think the big difference just comes

1914
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:06,080
i think the big difference just comes
 

1915
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,389
i think the big difference just comes
down to uh innovation

1916
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:08,399
down to uh innovation
 

1917
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,750
down to uh innovation
for security and when you simplistically

1918
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
for security and when you simplistically
 

1919
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,310
for security and when you simplistically
look at it

1920
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:12,320
look at it
 

1921
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,510
look at it
via that lens you actually

1922
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
via that lens you actually
 

1923
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:16,789
via that lens you actually
understand where both people are coming

1924
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:16,799
understand where both people are coming
 

1925
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:18,230
understand where both people are coming
from when you say security start to

1926
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:18,240
from when you say security start to
 

1927
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,870
from when you say security start to
interrupt

1928
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:18,880
interrupt
 

1929
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,470
interrupt
do you mean financial security or do you

1930
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
do you mean financial security or do you
 

1931
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,389
do you mean financial security or do you
mean like literally the the the security

1932
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
mean like literally the the the security
 

1933
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,590
mean like literally the the the security
of the

1934
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
of the
 

1935
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,470
of the
of the particular cryptocurrency the the

1936
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
of the particular cryptocurrency the the
 

1937
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,389
of the particular cryptocurrency the the
technical security of a blockchain so

1938
00:30:28,389 --> 00:30:28,399
technical security of a blockchain so
 

1939
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,430
technical security of a blockchain so
when you look at let's say

1940
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:29,440
when you look at let's say
 

1941
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,310
when you look at let's say
um bitcoin versus ethereum right bitcoin

1942
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:32,320
um bitcoin versus ethereum right bitcoin
 

1943
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,070
um bitcoin versus ethereum right bitcoin
has decided and that community has

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,909
decided
security is the number one thing that

1948
00:30:35,909 --> 00:30:35,919
security is the number one thing that
 

1949
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:37,230
security is the number one thing that
you have to optimize for so

1950
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:37,240
you have to optimize for so
 

1951
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,549
you have to optimize for so
decentralization

1952
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
decentralization
 

1953
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,190
decentralization
um over everything else in terms of

1954
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:41,200
um over everything else in terms of
 

1955
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,029
um over everything else in terms of
transaction speeds

1956
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:43,039
transaction speeds
 

1957
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,029
transaction speeds
cost anything that you could come up

1958
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:45,039
cost anything that you could come up
 

1959
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,149
cost anything that you could come up
with that is

1960
00:30:46,149 --> 00:30:46,159
with that is
 

1961
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:47,590
with that is
something that would be important for a

1962
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
something that would be important for a
 

1963
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,029
something that would be important for a
currency the number one thing to

1964
00:30:49,029 --> 00:30:49,039
currency the number one thing to
 

1965
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,549
currency the number one thing to
optimize for is security

1966
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
optimize for is security
 

1967
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,789
optimize for is security
and as we have seen uh with a lot of

1968
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
and as we have seen uh with a lot of
 

1969
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,830
and as we have seen uh with a lot of
technologies right

1970
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
technologies right
 

1971
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,669
technologies right
facebook's libra or now what's known as

1972

facebook's libra or now what's known as
 

1973
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,190
facebook's libra or now what's known as
dm is a great example

1974
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,200
dm is a great example
 

1975
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,230
dm is a great example
uh not having decentralization is

1976
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,240
uh not having decentralization is
 

1977
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,430
uh not having decentralization is
susceptible to

1978
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
susceptible to
 

1979
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,549
susceptible to
the nation state and so a lot of these

1980
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:04,559
the nation state and so a lot of these
 

1981
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:05,269
the nation state and so a lot of these
other

1982
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:05,279
other
 

1983
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,909
other
platforms and blockchains uh they say

1984
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:07,919
platforms and blockchains uh they say
 

1985
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,710
platforms and blockchains uh they say
security is

1986
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
security is
 

1987
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,230
security is
important but it's not the most

1988
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,240
important but it's not the most
 

1989
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,590
important but it's not the most
important thing right we believe there's

1990
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:11,600
important thing right we believe there's
 

1991
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,710
important thing right we believe there's
a trade-off between

1992
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720
a trade-off between
 

1993
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,789
a trade-off between
you know a little less security and

1994
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:14,799
you know a little less security and
 

1995
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:16,149
you know a little less security and
transaction speed or

1996
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:16,159
transaction speed or
 

1997
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:18,789
transaction speed or
composability or whatever it is and so

1998
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
composability or whatever it is and so
 

1999
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,630
composability or whatever it is and so
take ethereum as kind of the

it was created because somebody wanted

2006
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,360
it was created because somebody wanted
 

2007
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,549
it was created because somebody wanted
to or a group of people wanted to do

2008

to or a group of people wanted to do
 

2009
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,750
to or a group of people wanted to do
something on bitcoin they felt like they

2010
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:29,760
something on bitcoin they felt like they
 

2011
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,870
something on bitcoin they felt like they
couldn't do it and so they said hey

2012
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:30,880
couldn't do it and so they said hey
 

2013
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,070
couldn't do it and so they said hey
we're going to go create something that

2014
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:32,080
we're going to go create something that
 

2015
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,430
we're going to go create something that
has these smart contracts that we can

2016
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:33,440
has these smart contracts that we can
 

2017
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,870
has these smart contracts that we can
then go do here

2018
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:34,880
then go do here
 

2019
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,470
then go do here
again this is technology right so the

2020
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
again this is technology right so the
 

2021
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,630
again this is technology right so the
tribalism of like you're right you're

2022
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:38,640
tribalism of like you're right you're
 

2023
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,029
tribalism of like you're right you're
wrong

2024
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
wrong
 

2025
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,710
wrong
to me is a little childish just in the

2026
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:40,720
to me is a little childish just in the
 

2027
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,070
to me is a little childish just in the
sense of like the market is going to

2028
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,080
sense of like the market is going to
 

2029
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,909
sense of like the market is going to
decide what is most valuable

2030
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
decide what is most valuable
 

2031
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,430
decide what is most valuable
and then when you go inside of that

2032
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
and then when you go inside of that
 

2033
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,789
and then when you go inside of that
community like there's a lot of dumb

2034
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:46,799
community like there's a lot of dumb

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:50,000
there's also a lot of really really
 

2041
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,430
there's also a lot of really really
great ideas that people trying to build

same thing in the ethereum world and so

2046
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
same thing in the ethereum world and so
 

2047
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,230

what you end up getting i think is the

2048
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,240
what you end up getting i think is the
 

2049
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,830
what you end up getting i think is the
tribalism really comes out of the idea

2050
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:57,840
tribalism really comes out of the idea
 

2051
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,430
tribalism really comes out of the idea
that there's a ticker price

2052
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
that there's a ticker price
 

2053
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,830
that there's a ticker price
that is attached to all of this right if

2054
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
that is attached to all of this right if
 

2055
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,269
that is attached to all of this right if
you go back in history of technology

2056
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:05,279
you go back in history of technology

the retail investor
 

2095
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,190
the retail investor
and the public and so it whether it's

access and ability to do it
 

2109
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,990
access and ability to do it
but there's also arguments against it

2110
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:50,000
but there's also arguments against it
 

2111
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,430
but there's also arguments against it
some people say hey it's easier to dupe

2112
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:51,440
some people say hey it's easier to dupe
 

2113
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,110
some people say hey it's easier to dupe
them and it's easier to run scams and

2114
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:53,120
them and it's easier to run scams and
 

2115
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,710
them and it's easier to run scams and
kind of all this stuff and so

2116
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
kind of all this stuff and so
 

2117
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,870
kind of all this stuff and so
ultimately i think that uh crypto is

2118
00:32:56,870 --> 00:32:56,880
ultimately i think that uh crypto is
 

2119
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,830
ultimately i think that uh crypto is
this like

2120
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:57,840
this like
 

2121
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,070
this like
arena of ideas it is literally the war

2122
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:00,080
arena of ideas it is literally the war
 

2123
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:01,110
arena of ideas it is literally the war
of attrition

2124
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
of attrition
 

2125
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,750
of attrition
and uh what will end up happening is ten

2126
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:03,760
and uh what will end up happening is ten
 

2127
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,430
and uh what will end up happening is ten
years from now you and i will talk

2128
00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:05,440
years from now you and i will talk
 

2129
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,269
years from now you and i will talk
and we're gonna say well the market said

2130
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:07,279
and we're gonna say well the market said
 

2131
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,350
and we're gonna say well the market said
x was valuable and y wasn't

2132
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
x was valuable and y wasn't
 

2133
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,909
x was valuable and y wasn't
and so all of the tribalism from between

2134
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
and so all of the tribalism from between
 

2135
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,269
and so all of the tribalism from between
you know here and there

2136
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:13,279
you know here and there
 

2137
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,269
you know here and there
uh it's fun it's you know engaging

2138
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:15,279
uh it's fun it's you know engaging
 

2139
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,549
uh it's fun it's you know engaging
whatever but also it doesn't really

2140
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
whatever but also it doesn't really
 

2141
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:16,950
whatever but also it doesn't really
matter

2142
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:16,960
matter
 

2143
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,470
matter
yeah because the public is involved

2144
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:18,480
yeah because the public is involved
 

2145
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,630
yeah because the public is involved
there's a lot of personalities and so

2146
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
there's a lot of personalities and so
 

2147
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,470
there's a lot of personalities and so
a lot of times we focus on the ex

2148
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:22,480
a lot of times we focus on the ex
 

2149
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,149
a lot of times we focus on the ex
extreme personalities

2150
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:24,159
extreme personalities
 

2151
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:26,710
extreme personalities
that do a lot of maybe uh pardon the

2152
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
that do a lot of maybe uh pardon the
 

2153
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,470
that do a lot of maybe uh pardon the
french [\h__\h] talking and

2154
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
french [\h__\h] talking and
 

2155
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,310
french [\h__\h] talking and
and so we kind of focus on that but

2156
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:30,320
and so we kind of focus on that but
 

2157
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,990
and so we kind of focus on that but
that's not necessarily representative of

2158
00:33:31,990 --> 00:33:32,000
that's not necessarily representative of
 

2159
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,389
that's not necessarily representative of
the

2160
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
the
 

2161
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,070
the
communities involved let's talk about

2162
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
communities involved let's talk about
 

2163
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,830
communities involved let's talk about
bitcoin first and then it'll help us use

2164
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:35,840
bitcoin first and then it'll help us use
 

2165
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,590
bitcoin first and then it'll help us use
as a kind of comparison to

2166
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:37,600
as a kind of comparison to
 

2167
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,669
as a kind of comparison to
ethereum or whatever else so when you

2168
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
ethereum or whatever else so when you
 

2169
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,190
ethereum or whatever else so when you
think about what is money

2170
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
think about what is money
 

2171
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,310
think about what is money
right that's kind of the first question

2172
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,320
right that's kind of the first question
 

2173
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,430
right that's kind of the first question
people really kind of go down the rabbit

2174
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
people really kind of go down the rabbit
 

2175
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,710
people really kind of go down the rabbit
hole on and

2176
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:44,720
hole on and
 

2177
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,269
hole on and
ultimately today it's a belief system

2178
00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:47,279
ultimately today it's a belief system
 

2179
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,789
ultimately today it's a belief system
right and you may believe that one

2180
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:48,799
right and you may believe that one
 

2181
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,549
right and you may believe that one
currency has more value over another

2182
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:50,559
currency has more value over another
 

2183
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,590
currency has more value over another
because it's backed by a certain

2184
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:51,600
because it's backed by a certain
 

2185
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,389
because it's backed by a certain
military or a certain government has

2186
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:54,399
military or a certain government has
 

2187
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,470
military or a certain government has
a monetary policy that you believe in or

2188
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
a monetary policy that you believe in or
 

2189
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,590
a monetary policy that you believe in or
don't believe in

2190
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:57,600
don't believe in
 

2191
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,029
don't believe in
but ultimately it's a belief system that

2192
00:33:59,029 --> 00:33:59,039
but ultimately it's a belief system that
 

2193
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,029
but ultimately it's a belief system that
there's nothing backing this

2194
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:01,039
there's nothing backing this
 

2195
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,029
there's nothing backing this
other than a government asks you to pay

2196
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,039
other than a government asks you to pay
 

2197
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,230
other than a government asks you to pay
your taxes in it right

2198
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:04,240
your taxes in it right
 

2199
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,230
your taxes in it right
and they can have a monopoly on violence

2200
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:06,240
and they can have a monopoly on violence
 

2201
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,590
and they can have a monopoly on violence
uh in terms they can put you in jail if

2202
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:07,600
uh in terms they can put you in jail if
 

2203
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,710
uh in terms they can put you in jail if
you don't pay your taxes

2204
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
you don't pay your taxes
 

2205
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,389
you don't pay your taxes
uh they can go to other countries and

2206
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:10,399
uh they can go to other countries and
 

2207
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,589
uh they can go to other countries and
they can invade and do all this stuff

2208
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
they can invade and do all this stuff
 

2209
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,310
they can invade and do all this stuff
it wasn't always like that right it was

2210
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:16,320
it wasn't always like that right it was
 

2211
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,109
it wasn't always like that right it was
historically

2212
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:17,119
historically
 

2213
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:19,669
historically
a layer one technology was gold and so

2214
00:34:19,669 --> 00:34:19,679
a layer one technology was gold and so
 

2215
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,149
a layer one technology was gold and so
gold

2216
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:20,159
gold
 

2217
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:22,950
gold
was a fantastic store of value you knew

2218
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
was a fantastic store of value you knew
 

2219
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,550
was a fantastic store of value you knew
that if you held gold it wasn't going to

2220
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
that if you held gold it wasn't going to
 

2221
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,069
that if you held gold it wasn't going to
be inflated away it was sound money it

2222
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
be inflated away it was sound money it
 

2223
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,669
be inflated away it was sound money it
was outside the system and no one could

2224
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:27,679
was outside the system and no one could
 

2225
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,950
was outside the system and no one could
create more of it

2226
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:28,960
create more of it
 

2227
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,550
create more of it
the reason why that's important is

2228
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
the reason why that's important is
 

2229
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,629
the reason why that's important is
because that optimization for store of

2230
00:34:32,629 --> 00:34:32,639
because that optimization for store of
 

2231
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,550
because that optimization for store of
value served as the bedrock

2232
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:34,560
value served as the bedrock
 

2233
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,990
value served as the bedrock
of the entire stack of uh money

2234
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:38,000
of the entire stack of uh money
 

2235
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,950
of the entire stack of uh money
uh for 5000 years and so the problem

2236
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960
uh for 5000 years and so the problem
 

2237
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,470
uh for 5000 years and so the problem
with that though again trade-off between

2238
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
with that though again trade-off between
 

2239
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,349
with that though again trade-off between
store of value

2240
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
store of value
 

2241
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,030
store of value
is it was really hard to transact with

2242
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:45,040
is it was really hard to transact with
 

2243
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,389
is it was really hard to transact with
right if i came in here

2244
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:46,399
right if i came in here
 

2245
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,069
right if i came in here
and i and you said hey i want a couple

2246
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
and i and you said hey i want a couple
 

2247
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,589
and i and you said hey i want a couple
of ounces of gold and i had a whole bar

2248
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:49,599
of ounces of gold and i had a whole bar
 

2249
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:50,470
of ounces of gold and i had a whole bar
i'd have to literally

2250
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
i'd have to literally
 

2251
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,869
i'd have to literally
shave off the ounces of gold uh it's

2252
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:52,879
shave off the ounces of gold uh it's
 

2253
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,030
shave off the ounces of gold uh it's
heavy to carry around if you said to me

2254
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:55,040
heavy to carry around if you said to me
 

2255
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,190
heavy to carry around if you said to me
hey you're in one city mail it to me

2256
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,200
hey you're in one city mail it to me
 

2257
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,470
hey you're in one city mail it to me
it's really expensive you know there's

2258
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480
it's really expensive you know there's
 

2259
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,670
it's really expensive you know there's
all these issues with it

2260
00:34:59,670 --> 00:34:59,680
all these issues with it
 

2261
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,510
all these issues with it
and so ultimately what people said was

2262
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:01,520
and so ultimately what people said was
 

2263
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,349
and so ultimately what people said was
well let's create a second layer

2264
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:03,359
well let's create a second layer
 

2265
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,030
well let's create a second layer
on top of that gold in order to make it

2266
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:05,040
on top of that gold in order to make it
 

2267
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,030
on top of that gold in order to make it
easier to transact and so we created

2268
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:07,040
easier to transact and so we created
 

2269
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,790
easier to transact and so we created
paper claims on the gold so hey don't

2270
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:08,800
paper claims on the gold so hey don't
 

2271
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,829
paper claims on the gold so hey don't
carry around the gold in your pocket

2272
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
carry around the gold in your pocket
 

2273
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:10,390
carry around the gold in your pocket
anymore

2274
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:10,400
anymore
 

2275
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,990
anymore
put it in a vault or a bank they're

2276
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:12,000
put it in a vault or a bank they're
 

2277
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,829
put it in a vault or a bank they're
going to issue a paper claim

2278
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:13,839
going to issue a paper claim
 

2279
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,190
going to issue a paper claim
now you and i can trade these paper

2280
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:15,200
now you and i can trade these paper
 

2281
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,790
now you and i can trade these paper
claims around and at any point if you

2282
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
claims around and at any point if you
 

2283
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,069
claims around and at any point if you
want the gold you just show up and you

2284
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:18,079
want the gold you just show up and you
 

2285
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,510
want the gold you just show up and you
say hey give me you know three ounces of

2286
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:19,520
say hey give me you know three ounces of
 

2287
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,430
say hey give me you know three ounces of
gold or two bars or whatever

2288
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
gold or two bars or whatever
 

2289
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,750
gold or two bars or whatever
and so that actually made the store a

2290
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:23,760
and so that actually made the store a
 

2291
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,790
and so that actually made the store a
value it was

2292
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:24,800
value it was
 

2293
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,310
value it was
allowed that to be the anchor and kind

2294
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:26,320
allowed that to be the anchor and kind
 

2295
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,910
allowed that to be the anchor and kind
of the most important part the security

2296
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
of the most important part the security
 

2297
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,230
of the most important part the security
of

2298
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,240
of
 

2299
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,069
of
your purchasing power but now it became

2300
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,079
your purchasing power but now it became
 

2301
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,430
your purchasing power but now it became
easier to transact and then eventually

2302
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:31,440
easier to transact and then eventually
 

2303
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,950
easier to transact and then eventually
we built layers even on top of that so

2304
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:32,960
we built layers even on top of that so
 

2305
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,630
we built layers even on top of that so
everything from electronic money

2306
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:34,640
everything from electronic money
 

2307
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,310
everything from electronic money
uh kind of electronic q-sips all the way

2308
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:36,320
uh kind of electronic q-sips all the way
 

2309
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,990
uh kind of electronic q-sips all the way
to credit and other systems on top of

2310
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,000
to credit and other systems on top of
 

2311
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,950
to credit and other systems on top of
that gold

2312
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:38,960
that gold
 

2313
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,589
that gold
1971 comes around and obviously we d-peg

2314
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:41,599
1971 comes around and obviously we d-peg
 

2315
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,230
1971 comes around and obviously we d-peg
from that

2316
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
from that
 

2317
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,990
from that
gold right it was a temporary measure at

2318
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
gold right it was a temporary measure at
 

2319
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,430
gold right it was a temporary measure at
the time we ended up not going back to

2320
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:45,440
the time we ended up not going back to
 

2321
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:45,829
the time we ended up not going back to
it

2322
00:35:45,829 --> 00:35:45,839
it
 

2323
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,750
it
and so what you moved uh or transitioned

2324
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:47,760
and so what you moved uh or transitioned
 

2325
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,270
and so what you moved uh or transitioned
from was sound money which was outside

2326
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
from was sound money which was outside
 

2327
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,030
from was sound money which was outside
the system no one could create more

2328
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:51,040
the system no one could create more
 

2329
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,550
the system no one could create more
to now the government had full control

2330
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
to now the government had full control
 

2331
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,910
to now the government had full control
they could create as much as they wanted

2332
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:53,920
they could create as much as they wanted
 

2333
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,470
they could create as much as they wanted
to

2334
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,480
to
 

2335
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,589
to
they tried to be responsible and

2336
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:55,599
they tried to be responsible and
 

2337
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,349
they tried to be responsible and
disciplined but obviously hard to do

2338
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
disciplined but obviously hard to do
 

2339
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,550
disciplined but obviously hard to do
sometimes we've been really good at it

2340
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
sometimes we've been really good at it
 

2341
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,910
sometimes we've been really good at it
sometimes we've been less good at it and

2342
00:35:59,910 --> 00:35:59,920
sometimes we've been less good at it and
 

2343
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,030
sometimes we've been less good at it and
you go around the world and

2344
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:01,040
you go around the world and
 

2345
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,550
you go around the world and
some countries have absolutely sucked at

2346
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:02,560
some countries have absolutely sucked at
 

2347
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,150
some countries have absolutely sucked at
it and some have been good at it

2348
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:04,160
it and some have been good at it
 

2349
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,390
it and some have been good at it
and so when you look into the bitcoin

2350
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
and so when you look into the bitcoin
 

2351
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,150
and so when you look into the bitcoin
world i think that when you look at the

2352
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
world i think that when you look at the
 

2353
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,230
world i think that when you look at the
optimization for security similar to

2354
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
optimization for security similar to
 

2355
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,589
optimization for security similar to
gold store value

2356
00:36:11,589 --> 00:36:11,599
gold store value
 

2357
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,670
gold store value
people hold it purchasing power has gone

2358
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
people hold it purchasing power has gone
 

2359
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,589
people hold it purchasing power has gone
up a lot year over year it's like a 200

2360
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:15,599
up a lot year over year it's like a 200
 

2361
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,150
up a lot year over year it's like a 200
percent

2362
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
percent
 

2363
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,310
percent
year-over-year compounded annual growth

2364
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,320
year-over-year compounded annual growth
 

2365
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,510
year-over-year compounded annual growth
uh for over a decade

2366
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:19,520
uh for over a decade
 

2367
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,270
uh for over a decade
right so you measure this in kind of the

2368
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:21,280
right so you measure this in kind of the
 

2369
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,270
right so you measure this in kind of the
us dollar exchange price et cetera

2370
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:23,280
us dollar exchange price et cetera
 

2371
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,710
us dollar exchange price et cetera
but there's still a lot of people who

2372
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:24,720
but there's still a lot of people who
 

2373
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,109
but there's still a lot of people who
will yell and scream about it's slow

2374
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
will yell and scream about it's slow
 

2375
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,950
will yell and scream about it's slow
it's costly right all the things around

2376
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:28,960
it's costly right all the things around
 

2377
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,230
it's costly right all the things around
those transactions

2378
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
those transactions
 

2379
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,190
those transactions
that are obstacles or challenges and so

2380
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,200
that are obstacles or challenges and so
 

2381
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,790
that are obstacles or challenges and so
there's basically two schools of thought

2382
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
there's basically two schools of thought
 

2383
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,990
there's basically two schools of thought
and this is where we kind of get into

2384
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
and this is where we kind of get into
 

2385
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,190
and this is where we kind of get into
the bifurcation

2386
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,200
the bifurcation
 

2387
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,950
the bifurcation
some people just said hey this

2388
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:38,960
some people just said hey this
 

2389
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,109
some people just said hey this
technology is antiquated we can't use it

2390
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
technology is antiquated we can't use it
 

2391
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,310
technology is antiquated we can't use it
it doesn't make sense

2392
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:42,320
it doesn't make sense
 

2393
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,829
it doesn't make sense
uh and so what we're gonna do is we're

2394
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
uh and so what we're gonna do is we're
 

2395
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,510
uh and so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna go build something new and so you

2396
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:45,520
gonna go build something new and so you
 

2397
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,870
gonna go build something new and so you
go get you know kind of all of the

2398
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:46,880
go get you know kind of all of the
 

2399
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,630
go get you know kind of all of the
various versions there

2400
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
various versions there
 

2401
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,870
various versions there
the bitcoin community says no just like

2402
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:50,880
the bitcoin community says no just like
 

2403
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,710
the bitcoin community says no just like
gold had paper claims and other things

2404
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:52,720
gold had paper claims and other things
 

2405
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,230
gold had paper claims and other things
built on top and layer two three four

2406
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:54,240
built on top and layer two three four
 

2407
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:54,790
built on top and layer two three four
five

2408
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:54,800
five
 

2409
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,390
five
we're gonna do that here and so they've

2410
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:56,400
we're gonna do that here and so they've
 

2411
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,430
we're gonna do that here and so they've
already started to build kind of this

2412
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440
already started to build kind of this
 

2413
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,150
already started to build kind of this
layer two

2414
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:58,160
layer two
 

2415
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,990
layer two
where it's easier to transact it's

2416
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
where it's easier to transact it's
 

2417
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,230
where it's easier to transact it's
cheaper it's faster etc

2418
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,240
cheaper it's faster etc
 

2419
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,270
cheaper it's faster etc
and so i actually think that both of

2420
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:05,280
and so i actually think that both of
 

2421
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,870
and so i actually think that both of
those worlds are gonna coexist in the

2422
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:06,880
those worlds are gonna coexist in the
 

2423
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,589
those worlds are gonna coexist in the
future

2424
00:37:07,589 --> 00:37:07,599

the big question is just which one has

2426
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:09,520
the big question is just which one has
 

2427
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,790
the big question is just which one has
more importance

2428
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:10,800
more importance
 

2429
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,190
more importance
right so again get out of binary it's

2430
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,200
right so again get out of binary it's
 

2431
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,870
right so again get out of binary it's
just probabilistically

2432
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:14,880
just probabilistically
 

2433
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,589
just probabilistically
and so my personal belief is that the

2434
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
and so my personal belief is that the
 

2435
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,790
and so my personal belief is that the
security the the

2436
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
security the the
 

2437
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,190
security the the
store of value component as the bedrock

2438
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,200
store of value component as the bedrock
 

2439
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,030
store of value component as the bedrock
for a monetary system

2440
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:23,040
for a monetary system
 

2441
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,589
for a monetary system
is essential right like that is the most

2442
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
is essential right like that is the most
 

2443
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,589
is essential right like that is the most
important thing because you can always

2444
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:27,599
important thing because you can always
 

2445
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,670
important thing because you can always
improve the other components but you

2446
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:29,680
improve the other components but you
 

2447
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,589
improve the other components but you
can't go back and fix that kind of core

2448
00:37:31,589 --> 00:37:31,599
can't go back and fix that kind of core
 

2449
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,710
can't go back and fix that kind of core
piece

2450
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:32,720
piece
 

2451
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,990
piece
so if money money is a an idea that we

2452
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
so if money money is a an idea that we
 

2453
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,069
so if money money is a an idea that we
all it's like an emergent idea that we

2454
00:37:38,069 --> 00:37:38,079
all it's like an emergent idea that we
 

2455
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,270
all it's like an emergent idea that we
believe in

2456
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
believe in
 

2457
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,349

you're saying that security is one of

00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:41,359
you're saying that security is one of
 

2459
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,349
you're saying that security is one of
the most fundamental catalysts

2460
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:43,359
the most fundamental catalysts
 

2461
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,470
the most fundamental catalysts
or fuels for that idea to sort of take

2462
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
or fuels for that idea to sort of take
 

2463
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,349
or fuels for that idea to sort of take

the other stuff is really nice to have

2470
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
the other stuff is really nice to have
 

2471
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,190
the other stuff is really nice to have
but if you don't have the security

2472
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:55,200
but if you don't have the security
 

2473
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,470
but if you don't have the security
you're not going to

different
than everything else and right so being

2498
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:19,200
than everything else and right so being
 

2499
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,630
than everything else and right so being
different and wrong just means you're an

2500
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:20,640
different and wrong just means you're an
 

2501
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:21,109

idiot
 

2503
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,950
idiot
right being different and right means

2504
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:22,960
right being different and right means
 

2505
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,390
right being different and right means
that that's where kind of the outsized

2506
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:24,400
that that's where kind of the outsized
 

2507

and so if you look around the world at

2510
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:27,040
and so if you look around the world at
 

2511
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,109
and so if you look around the world at
currencies today they're all the same

non-transparent process
and what we've watched is the

2522
00:38:38,069 --> 00:38:38,079
and what we've watched is the
 

2523
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,589
and what we've watched is the
manipulation of all of those currencies

2524

might not be the case and so i do think
 

2565
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,550
might not be the case and so i do think
that there's uh kind of a relative

that there's uh kind of a relative
 

2567
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,069
that there's uh kind of a relative
analysis that goes on here if you

there's all kinds of arguments to make
 

2573
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,109
there's all kinds of arguments to make
that the dollar is better as a medium of

that the dollar is better as a medium of

that the dollar is better as a medium of

but if i go and i tell you what about in

but if i go and i tell you what about in
 

2579
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,750
but if i go and i tell you what about in
you know these kind of extreme

00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:33,760
and so i think that that's kind of one
 

2587
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,430
and so i think that that's kind of one
perspective to view this through

2588
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:35,440
perspective to view this through
 

2589

perspective to view this through
is security versus all of the innovative

2590
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,320

the second thing though that i think is

2594
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,320
the second thing though that i think is
 

2595
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,910
the second thing though that i think is
really really important is around

2596
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
really really important is around
 

2597

and so when you look at again every
 

2601
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,870
and so when you look at again every
currency in the world today

00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:53,119
highly susceptible to censorship
 

2607
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,190
highly susceptible to censorship

many countries around the world
 

2615
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,550
many countries around the world
do we sanction and cut them off in

so when you define when you talk about
 

2625
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,390
so when you define when you talk about
censorship do you mean just the

in the world
well look at it a little bit differently

2632
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
well look at it a little bit differently
 

2633
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,910
well look at it a little bit differently
which is that the united states has

2634
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:19,920
which is that the united states has
 

2635
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,510
which is that the united states has
kind of the american superiority because

2636
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,520
kind of the american superiority because
 

2637

we have the bombs the bullets the

2638
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:22,880
we have the bombs the bullets the
 

2639
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,670
we have the bombs the bullets the
soldiers and

2640
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:23,680
soldiers and
 

2641
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,750
soldiers and
and that military might we basically

2642
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:26,760
and that military might we basically
 

2643
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,550
and that military might we basically
impose our will

2644
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:28,560
impose our will
 

2645
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,510
impose our will
around the world and so uh there's a

2646
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:31,520
around the world and so uh there's a
 

2647
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,309
around the world and so uh there's a
very strong

2648
00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:32,319
very strong
 

2649
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,390
very strong

did nothing wrong now the governments
 

2659
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,270
did nothing wrong now the governments
are bad right in terms of the way that

2660
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:43,280
are bad right in terms of the way that
 

2661
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,510
are bad right in terms of the way that
you and i would look at democratic rule

but the people are being hurt as well so
 

2667
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,069
but the people are being hurt as well so
there's a whole group of people who

2668
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:52,079
there's a whole group of people who
 

2669
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:53,430
there's a whole group of people who
would have just argued listen

2670
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:53,440
would have just argued listen
 

2671
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,750
would have just argued listen
we shouldn't hurt anyone at the expense

2672
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:55,760
we shouldn't hurt anyone at the expense
 

2673
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,710
we shouldn't hurt anyone at the expense
of punishing

one person or a group of people there's
other people who argue against that

2678
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:00,400
other people who argue against that
 

2679
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,390
other people who argue against that
but i do think that if you really kind

2680
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:02,400
but i do think that if you really kind
 

2681
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,390
but i do think that if you really kind
of zoom out and you say i'm going to

2682
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:04,400
of zoom out and you say i'm going to
 

2683
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:04,950
of zoom out and you say i'm going to
take myself

2684
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:04,960
take myself

take myself
out of the western world view and i'm

2686

out of the western world view and i'm
 

2687
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,550
out of the western world view and i'm
simply going to look at this as we're

2688
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:08,560
simply going to look at this as we're
 

2689
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,550
simply going to look at this as we're
all part of the human race

2690
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
all part of the human race

argument for censorship

2694
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:14,079
argument for censorship

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,349
argument for censorship
but there also might be an argument

2696

but there also might be an argument
 

2697
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,270
but there also might be an argument
against the censorship and so what

00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
against the censorship and so what
 

2699
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,990

00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:01,359
to a true store value and
 

2749
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,470
to a true store value and
a medium of exchange right and so what

2750
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:04,480
a medium of exchange right and so what
 

2751
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,550
a medium of exchange right and so what
you see in many of these countries is

2752
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:06,560
you see in many of these countries is
 

2753
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,030
you see in many of these countries is
that when their currency starts to fail

2754
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:09,040
that when their currency starts to fail
 

2755
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,910
that when their currency starts to fail
the first thing that a government or a

2756
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:11,920
the first thing that a government or a
 

2757
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,750
the first thing that a government or a
group of people in power and influence

2758
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:13,760
group of people in power and influence
 

2759
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,309
group of people in power and influence
do

2760
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
do
 

2761
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,910
do
is they lock the citizens into the

2762
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:15,920
is they lock the citizens into the
 

2763
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,790
is they lock the citizens into the
currency with capital controls

2764
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:18,800
currency with capital controls
 

2765
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,349
currency with capital controls
why because if you let them out it

2766
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:21,359
why because if you let them out it
 

2767
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:23,349
why because if you let them out it
exasperates the problem

2768
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:23,359
exasperates the problem
 

2769
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,150
exasperates the problem
and so now what we're seeing is we

2770
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
and so now what we're seeing is we
 

2771
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,430
and so now what we're seeing is we
basically are giving

2772
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
basically are giving
 

2773
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,589
basically are giving
a tool to billions of people around the

2774
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
a tool to billions of people around the
 

2775
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,990
a tool to billions of people around the
world that is a peaceful protest

right they have arguments and some of
them are very good arguments as to why

2796
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:48,400
them are very good arguments as to why
 

2797
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,349
them are very good arguments as to why
they should do that they're trying to

2798
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
they should do that they're trying to
 

2799
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,790
they should do that they're trying to
mitigate short-term pain

mitigate short-term pain
 

2801
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,990
mitigate short-term pain
long-term they'll figure out the other

2802
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,000
long-term they'll figure out the other
 

2803
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,790
long-term they'll figure out the other
issues right they have very kind of um

2804
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,800
issues right they have very kind of um
 

2805
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,589
issues right they have very kind of um
elaborate and well-articulated um kind

2806
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
elaborate and well-articulated um kind
 

2807
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,349
elaborate and well-articulated um kind
of viewpoint as to why they're doing it

2808

of viewpoint as to why they're doing it
 

2809
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,069
of viewpoint as to why they're doing it
but you and i had no say and so when you

2810
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,079
but you and i had no say and so when you
 

2811
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,270
but you and i had no say and so when you
start to look at

2812
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:03,280
start to look at
 

2813
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,790
start to look at
we have a very small group of people in

2814
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:04,800
we have a very small group of people in
 

2815
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,109
we have a very small group of people in
this world uh both in our country and in

2816
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
this world uh both in our country and in
 

2817
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,069
this world uh both in our country and in
countries around the world

2818
00:43:08,069 --> 00:43:08,079
countries around the world
 

2819
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,309
countries around the world
that make these decisions that have very

2820
00:43:10,309 --> 00:43:10,319
that make these decisions that have very
 

2821
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:13,030
that make these decisions that have very
very far-reaching kind of impact

2822
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,040
very far-reaching kind of impact
 

2823
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,589
very far-reaching kind of impact
and on top of that in many cases there's

2824
00:43:15,589 --> 00:43:15,599
and on top of that in many cases there's
 

2825
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,390
and on top of that in many cases there's
actually not

2826
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
actually not
 

2827
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,109
actually not
that much kind of accountability because

2828
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:19,119
that much kind of accountability because
 

2829
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,069
that much kind of accountability because
usually these are not

2830
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:20,079
usually these are not
 

2831
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,349
usually these are not
elected officials who are making some of

2832
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:21,359
elected officials who are making some of
 

2833
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,670
elected officials who are making some of
these decisions these are appointed

2834
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,680
these decisions these are appointed
 

2835
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,030
these decisions these are appointed
you can argue that hey we elected

2836
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,040
you can argue that hey we elected
 

2837
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,870
you can argue that hey we elected
somebody who appointed them but at the

2838
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:26,880
somebody who appointed them but at the
 

2839
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:27,829
somebody who appointed them but at the
same time

2840
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:27,839
same time
 

2841
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:30,309
same time
that accountability isn't quite there

2842
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:30,319
that accountability isn't quite there
 

2843
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:31,750
that accountability isn't quite there
and so i think ultimately when you just

2844
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:31,760
and so i think ultimately when you just
 

2845
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,190
and so i think ultimately when you just
back out you say you know what is

2846
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
back out you say you know what is
 

2847
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,470
back out you say you know what is
bitcoin and why is it important to the

2848
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:34,480
bitcoin and why is it important to the
 

2849
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,589
bitcoin and why is it important to the
world

2850
00:43:35,589 --> 00:43:35,599
world
 

2851
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,910
world
it is giving access to anyone in the

2852
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:37,920
it is giving access to anyone in the
 

2853
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,510
it is giving access to anyone in the
world with an internet connection to a

2854
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:39,520
world with an internet connection to a
 

2855
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,390
world with an internet connection to a
store of value

2856
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
store of value
 

2857
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,550
store of value
and a monetary network that allows them

2858
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:42,560
and a monetary network that allows them
 

2859
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,390
and a monetary network that allows them
to peacefully protest and to

2860
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:44,400
to peacefully protest and to
 

2861
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,430
to peacefully protest and to
opt out of a system that

2862
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
opt out of a system that
 

2863
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,910
opt out of a system that
pretty much is not working for majority

2864
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
pretty much is not working for majority
 

2865
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,190
pretty much is not working for majority
of people in the world

2866
00:43:51,190 --> 00:43:51,200
of people in the world
 

2867
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,870
of people in the world
so it's moving the power from these

2868
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:52,880
so it's moving the power from these
 

2869
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,109
so it's moving the power from these
centralized places sometimes unelected

2870
00:43:55,109 --> 00:43:55,119
centralized places sometimes unelected
 

2871
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,829
centralized places sometimes unelected
to the individuals and to the people

2872
00:43:59,829 --> 00:43:59,839
to the individuals and to the people
 

2873
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,630
to the individuals and to the people
so the dollar does seem to work for for

2874
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
so the dollar does seem to work for for
 

2875
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,510
so the dollar does seem to work for for
americans

2876
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:03,520
americans
 

2877
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,710
americans
and for many people in the world but you

2878
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:06,720
and for many people in the world but you
 

2879
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,990
and for many people in the world but you
kind of have a vision you

2880
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
kind of have a vision you
 

2881
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,910
kind of have a vision you
you paint a picture of a future where

2882
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:09,920
you paint a picture of a future where
 

2883
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,190
you paint a picture of a future where
potentially we move to cryptocurrency so

2884
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:13,200
potentially we move to cryptocurrency so
 

2885
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,589
potentially we move to cryptocurrency so
what kind of trajectory do you see where

2886
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
what kind of trajectory do you see where
 

2887
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,150
what kind of trajectory do you see where
bitcoin can become the main currency

2888
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:18,160
bitcoin can become the main currency
 

2889
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,990
bitcoin can become the main currency
in the world or at least cryptocurrency

2890
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
in the world or at least cryptocurrency
 

2891
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,270
in the world or at least cryptocurrency
become the main

2892
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:21,280
become the main
 

2893
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,670
become the main
way of storing value in the world and

2894
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:23,680
way of storing value in the world and
 

2895
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,510
way of storing value in the world and
basically overtake the dollar

2896
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:25,520
basically overtake the dollar
 

2897
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,390
basically overtake the dollar
yeah so i always go first to we don't

2898
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:28,400
yeah so i always go first to we don't
 

2899
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,030
yeah so i always go first to we don't
need to have

2900
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
need to have
 

2901
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,030
need to have
competition like in terms of like a

2902
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,040
competition like in terms of like a
 

2903
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:33,270
competition like in terms of like a
direct competition between the dollar

2904
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:33,280
direct competition between the dollar
 

2905
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,150
direct competition between the dollar
and bitcoin right if you look at most

2906
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,160
and bitcoin right if you look at most
 

2907
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,670
and bitcoin right if you look at most
technologies in the world

2908
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:37,680
technologies in the world
 

2909

technologies in the world
uh the really valuable ones are actually

2910
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
uh the really valuable ones are actually
 

2911
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,270
uh the really valuable ones are actually
market expanding technologies

2912
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:41,280
market expanding technologies
 

2913
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,589
market expanding technologies
rather than simply just market share

2914
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:43,599
rather than simply just market share
 

2915
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:45,030
rather than simply just market share
stealing technologies

2916
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,040
stealing technologies
 

2917
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,030
stealing technologies
right so if you look at uber for example

2918
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:47,040
right so if you look at uber for example
 

2919
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,550
right so if you look at uber for example
uber didn't just say hey i'm going to go

2920
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
uber didn't just say hey i'm going to go

00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:53,920
people now there's literally millions of
 

2927
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:54,309
people now there's literally millions of
people

2928
00:44:54,309 --> 00:44:54,319
people
 

2929
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:55,510
people
in the united states who don't have cars

2930
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:55,520
in the united states who don't have cars
 

2931
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:57,589
in the united states who don't have cars
because they use uber right and so i

2932

think that bitcoin is very similar
 

2935
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,150
think that bitcoin is very similar
in that yes there is a component of

2936
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:02,160
in that yes there is a component of
 

2937
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,270
in that yes there is a component of
medium of exchange

2938
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
medium of exchange
 

2939
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,750
medium of exchange
uh in terms of the dollar but also there

2940
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:05,760
uh in terms of the dollar but also there
 

2941
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,349
uh in terms of the dollar but also there
is this component of just store value

2942
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:07,359
is this component of just store value
 

2943
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,710
is this component of just store value
assets in general

2944

assets in general
 

2945
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,710
assets in general
and so when you start to look at bitcoin

2946
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
and so when you start to look at bitcoin
 

2947
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,230
and so when you start to look at bitcoin
specifically i think that what you're

2948
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:12,240
specifically i think that what you're
 

2949
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,230
specifically i think that what you're
seeing is you're seeing a generational

2950
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,240
seeing is you're seeing a generational
 

2951
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:14,790
seeing is you're seeing a generational
gap

2952
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
gap
 

2953
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,870
gap
where young people say i grew up with a

2954
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:16,880
where young people say i grew up with a
 

2955

phone in my hand i'm digitally native
the whole idea of going to the bank and

2958
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:20,800
the whole idea of going to the bank and
 

2959

the whole idea of going to the bank and
sending a wire

or going to an atm and getting physical
cash is an antiquated idea in their mind

2964
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:26,400
cash is an antiquated idea in their mind
 

2965
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,910
cash is an antiquated idea in their mind
right i one time asked my brother he's

2966
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:27,920
right i one time asked my brother he's
 

2967
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,829
right i one time asked my brother he's
24 years old and i said hey how do you

send money to your friends
and he gave me one answer which i

2972
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:32,960
and he gave me one answer which i
 

2973
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,870
and he gave me one answer which i
expected which was venmo and the second

2974
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:34,880
expected which was venmo and the second
 

2975
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,190
expected which was venmo and the second
answer i didn't expect he said uber

2976
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:37,200
answer i didn't expect he said uber
 

2977
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,790
answer i didn't expect he said uber

said well we get in a car together and

2980
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:40,160
said well we get in a car together and
 

2981
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,470
said well we get in a car together and
at the end we split the ride

2982
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:42,480
at the end we split the ride
 

2983
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,069
at the end we split the ride
and so again you and i have probably

2984
00:45:44,069 --> 00:45:44,079
and so again you and i have probably
 

2985
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,069
and so again you and i have probably
both done that but i never thought of it

2986
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:46,079
both done that but i never thought of it
 

2987
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:47,589
both done that but i never thought of it
as a way to send money to each other and

2988
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
as a way to send money to each other and
 

2989
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:48,950
as a way to send money to each other and
so it is a

2990
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:48,960
so it is a
 

2991
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,430
so it is a
psychological difference between even me

2992
00:45:51,430 --> 00:45:51,440
psychological difference between even me
 

2993
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,309
psychological difference between even me
who's only you know

2994
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:52,319
who's only you know
 

2995
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,349
who's only you know
a decade older than him or so uh and his

2996
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:55,359
a decade older than him or so uh and his
 

2997
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,109
a decade older than him or so uh and his
peer group and so i think as we're

2998
00:45:57,109 --> 00:45:57,119
peer group and so i think as we're
 

2999
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,550
peer group and so i think as we're
watching kind of bitcoin

3000
00:45:58,550 --> 00:45:58,560
watching kind of bitcoin
 

3001
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,950
watching kind of bitcoin
continue this ascent ultimately what

3002
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
continue this ascent ultimately what
 

3003
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,670
continue this ascent ultimately what
we're seeing

3004
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:01,680
we're seeing
 

3005
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,670
we're seeing
is an entire generation of kids are

3006
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,680
is an entire generation of kids are
 

3007
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,510
is an entire generation of kids are

00:46:18,950 --> 00:46:18,960
make no money on this because
 

3023
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,510
make no money on this because
i have a belief that my dollar is being

3024
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
i have a belief that my dollar is being
 

3025
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,470
i have a belief that my dollar is being
devalued

3026
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
devalued
 

3027
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,150
devalued
and actually what we're starting to see

3028
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:24,160
and actually what we're starting to see
 

3029
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,710
and actually what we're starting to see
is again the internet has broken down

3030
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:26,720
is again the internet has broken down
 

3031
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,309
is again the internet has broken down
these walled gardens and kind of these

3032
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
these walled gardens and kind of these
 

3033
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,030
these walled gardens and kind of these
centralized uh hubs of information

3034
00:46:31,030 --> 00:46:31,040
centralized uh hubs of information
 

3035
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,710
centralized uh hubs of information
in that if you were to look at let's say

3036
00:46:32,710 --> 00:46:32,720
in that if you were to look at let's say
 

3037
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,829
in that if you were to look at let's say
the stock market from 1971 to today

3038
00:46:35,829 --> 00:46:35,839
the stock market from 1971 to today
 

3039
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:38,150
the stock market from 1971 to today
in dollar terms it's a 45 degree angle

3040
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
in dollar terms it's a 45 degree angle
 

3041
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,510
in dollar terms it's a 45 degree angle
right up into the right right you know

3042
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:39,520
right up into the right right you know
 

3043
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:40,150
right up into the right right you know
it's kind of seven

3044
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
it's kind of seven
 

3045
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,790
it's kind of seven
eight ten percent growth uh every year

3046
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:42,800
eight ten percent growth uh every year
 

3047
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,150
eight ten percent growth uh every year
and it's amazing just get invested in

3048
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:44,160
and it's amazing just get invested in
 

3049
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,270
and it's amazing just get invested in
the stock market and you'll make money

3050
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:45,280
the stock market and you'll make money
 

3051
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,550
the stock market and you'll make money
over a long period of time regardless of

3052
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
over a long period of time regardless of
 

3053
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,390
over a long period of time regardless of
the dips along the way

3054
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:48,400
the dips along the way
 

3055
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,069
the dips along the way
if you denominate that same stock market

3056
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:50,079
if you denominate that same stock market
 

3057
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,470
if you denominate that same stock market
in gold the stock market is down since

3058
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,480
in gold the stock market is down since
 

3059
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:54,470
in gold the stock market is down since
1971.

3060
00:46:54,470 --> 00:46:54,480
1971.
 

3061
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:56,069
1971.
and so is it so much that the stock

3062
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:56,079
and so is it so much that the stock
 

3063
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,829
and so is it so much that the stock
market is accruing true value

3064
00:46:57,829 --> 00:46:57,839
market is accruing true value
 

3065
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,589
market is accruing true value
or is it that the underlying currency in

3066

3069
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,589
which it is denominated in
is being devalued right and i was being

3070
00:47:03,589 --> 00:47:03,599
is being devalued right and i was being
 

3071
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:04,790
is being devalued right and i was being
devalued in a

3072
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:04,800
devalued in a
 

3073
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,630
devalued in a
very disciplined way right in terms of

3074
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:06,640
very disciplined way right in terms of
 

3075
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,829
very disciplined way right in terms of
it's not like it went 50

3076
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
it's not like it went 50
 

3077
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:09,829
it's not like it went 50
devaluation uh in a short period of time

3078
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:09,839
devaluation uh in a short period of time
 

3079
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,430
devaluation uh in a short period of time
but still being devalued

3080
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:11,440
but still being devalued
 

3081
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,109
but still being devalued
and so i think that people are waking up

3082
00:47:13,109 --> 00:47:13,119
and so i think that people are waking up
 

3083
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:15,270
and so i think that people are waking up
to this idea that a traditional 60 40

3084
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:15,280
to this idea that a traditional 60 40

when you
 

3095
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:25,270
when you
start to look at this people first look

00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:25,280
start to look at this people first look
 

3097
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,870
start to look at this people first look
at bitcoin via

two main ways in my opinion they look at
 

3101
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,150
two main ways in my opinion they look at
it one as a store value

3102

can't just save you have to invest
that is a really tall task for people

3136
00:47:58,150 --> 00:47:58,160
that is a really tall task for people
 

3137
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,349
that is a really tall task for people
they have a hard enough time just doing

so i think savings technology for a

3146
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:04,880
so i think savings technology for a
 

3147
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,630
so i think savings technology for a
bitcoin standpoint is if you

3148
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:06,640
bitcoin standpoint is if you
 

3149
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,990
bitcoin standpoint is if you
buy satoshi's or bitcoin over time it

3150
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:10,000
buy satoshi's or bitcoin over time it
 

3151
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:10,470
buy satoshi's or bitcoin over time it
will

3152
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:10,480
will
 

3153
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,990
will
uh increase from a purchasing power

3154
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
uh increase from a purchasing power
 

3155
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,030
uh increase from a purchasing power
standpoint because there's a fixed

3156
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:13,040
standpoint because there's a fixed
 

3157
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,270
standpoint because there's a fixed
supply and demand continues to rise

3158
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:15,280
supply and demand continues to rise
 

3159
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,510
supply and demand continues to rise
but then you start to look at well what

3160
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:17,520
but then you start to look at well what
 

3161
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,950
but then you start to look at well what
other assets do people put in their

3162
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
other assets do people put in their
 

3163
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,270
other assets do people put in their
portfolios whether it's art

3164
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:21,280
portfolios whether it's art
 

3165
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:23,829
portfolios whether it's art
it's real estate it's precious metals or

3166
00:48:23,829 --> 00:48:23,839
it's real estate it's precious metals or
 

3167
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,030
it's real estate it's precious metals or
something else

3168
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:25,040
something else
 

3169
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,870
something else
most of those assets are not because

3170
00:48:26,870 --> 00:48:26,880
most of those assets are not because
 

3171
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,230
most of those assets are not because
people actually think that they're going

3172
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
people actually think that they're going
 

3173
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,309
people actually think that they're going
to go up in value over time

3174
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:30,319
to go up in value over time
 

3175
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,630
to go up in value over time
they're using a store of value right the

3176
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:32,640
they're using a store of value right the
 

3177
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,990
they're using a store of value right the
reason why somebody buys gold

3178
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
reason why somebody buys gold
 

3179
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,589
reason why somebody buys gold
is because it's a store of value right

3180
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:35,599
is because it's a store of value right
 

3181
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,390
is because it's a store of value right
historically that's a narrative driven

3182
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:38,400
historically that's a narrative driven
 

3183
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,950
historically that's a narrative driven
uh type asset though right we tell

00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,990
opened up the possibility
and the desire from people to have a

3226
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:16,000
and the desire from people to have a
 

3227
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,950
and the desire from people to have a
world now where i can validate things so

3228
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:18,960
world now where i can validate things so
 

3229
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,750
world now where i can validate things so
when i see

3230
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:19,760
when i see
 

3231
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,950
when i see
that headline i want to see you

3232
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:22,960
that headline i want to see you
 

3233
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:24,470
that headline i want to see you
say whatever happened to the news if

3234
00:49:24,470 --> 00:49:24,480
say whatever happened to the news if
 

3235
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,990
say whatever happened to the news if
you're the subject of the news rather

3236
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:26,000
you're the subject of the news rather
 

3237
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,190
you're the subject of the news rather
than have somebody else tell me the

3238
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:27,200
than have somebody else tell me the
 

3239
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:27,990
than have somebody else tell me the
story

3240
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:28,000
story
 

3241
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,670
story
if i see that you say something is

3242
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:29,680
if i see that you say something is
 

3243
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,510
if i see that you say something is
scarce prove to me

3244
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
scarce prove to me
 

3245
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,829
scarce prove to me
that it is scarce and so i think that's

3246
00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:33,839
that it is scarce and so i think that's
 

3247
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:35,349
that it is scarce and so i think that's
kind of a psychological shift the

3248
00:49:35,349 --> 00:49:35,359
kind of a psychological shift the
 

3249
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:36,630
kind of a psychological shift the
younger generation is starting to

3250
00:49:36,630 --> 00:49:36,640
younger generation is starting to
 

3251
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,510
younger generation is starting to
understand because

3252
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
understand because
 

3253
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,430
understand because
ultimately you and i probably grew up in

3254
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
ultimately you and i probably grew up in
 

3255
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:40,630
ultimately you and i probably grew up in
a world where parents could tell us the

3256
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:40,640
a world where parents could tell us the
 

3257
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,109
a world where parents could tell us the
story

3258
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:41,119
story
 

3259
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,109
story
and we just believed it you know dad or

3260
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:43,119
and we just believed it you know dad or
 

3261
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:45,030
and we just believed it you know dad or
mom says it it must be true

3262
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
mom says it it must be true
 

3263
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,790
mom says it it must be true
if my brother heard a story what does he

3264
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:46,800
if my brother heard a story what does he
 

3265
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,870
if my brother heard a story what does he
do he goes to google and he looks it up

3266
00:49:48,870 --> 00:49:48,880
do he goes to google and he looks it up
 

3267
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,069
do he goes to google and he looks it up
randy comes back and usually tells my

3268
00:49:50,069 --> 00:49:50,079
randy comes back and usually tells my
 

3269
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,510
randy comes back and usually tells my
parents how you got the story wrong

3270
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
parents how you got the story wrong
 

3271
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:51,990
parents how you got the story wrong
right

3272
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:52,000
right
 

3273
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,349
right
and so i think that that that

3274
00:49:53,349 --> 00:49:53,359
and so i think that that that
 

3275
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,670
and so i think that that that
provability or that that validation

3276
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:55,680
provability or that that validation
 

3277
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,190
provability or that that validation
ends up becoming really really important

3278
00:49:57,190 --> 00:49:57,200
ends up becoming really really important
 

3279
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,630
ends up becoming really really important
and so you know look at something like

3280
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:58,640
and so you know look at something like
 

3281
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,990
and so you know look at something like
gold i think that

3282
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:00,000
gold i think that
 

3283
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,829
gold i think that
people are drastically underestimating

3284
00:50:01,829 --> 00:50:01,839
people are drastically underestimating
 

3285
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,910
people are drastically underestimating
the shift that's underway right now

3286
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
the shift that's underway right now
 

3287
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,910
the shift that's underway right now
gold is won down in value since april

3288
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
gold is won down in value since april
 

3289
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,430
gold is won down in value since april
or i'm sorry august of 2020. and so in a

3290
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
or i'm sorry august of 2020. and so in a
 

3291
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,829
or i'm sorry august of 2020. and so in a
time frame where central banks have had

3292
00:50:13,829 --> 00:50:13,839
time frame where central banks have had
 

3293
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,510
time frame where central banks have had
historic quantitative easing literally

3294
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:15,520
historic quantitative easing literally

hit an all-time high based on the the
 

3307
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:26,390
hit an all-time high based on the the

government response
 

3309
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,069
government response
has actually suffered uh for a main part

3310
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:30,079
has actually suffered uh for a main part
 

3311
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:30,710
has actually suffered uh for a main part
of this

3312
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:30,720
of this
 

3313
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,030
of this
financial crisis you then look at

3314
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:33,040
financial crisis you then look at
 

3315
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,390
financial crisis you then look at
central banks around the world who have

3316
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:34,400
central banks around the world who have
 

3317
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:34,710
central banks around the world who have
been

3318
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:34,720
been
 

3319
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:36,390
been
very large holders of gold for a long

3320
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:36,400
very large holders of gold for a long
 

3321
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,030
very large holders of gold for a long
time and net buyers on a monthly basis

3322
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:39,040
time and net buyers on a monthly basis
 

3323
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,589
time and net buyers on a monthly basis
for multiple months over the last six

3324
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:41,599
for multiple months over the last six
 

3325
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:42,630
for multiple months over the last six
months they've been net

3326
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:42,640
months they've been net
 

3327
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,349
months they've been net
sellers of gold and then you start to

3328
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:45,359
sellers of gold and then you start to
 

3329
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:45,910
sellers of gold and then you start to
look at

3330
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:45,920
look at
 

3331
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,589
look at
jewelry demand so the actual

3332
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:47,599
jewelry demand so the actual
 

3333
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,990
jewelry demand so the actual
non-monetary value of gold

3334
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,000
non-monetary value of gold
 

3335
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,950
non-monetary value of gold
and that demand for gold jewelry peaked

3336
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:52,960
and that demand for gold jewelry peaked
 

3337
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:53,990
and that demand for gold jewelry peaked
in 2013

3338
00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:54,000
in 2013
 

3339
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,870
in 2013
and has continued to fall since and so

3340
00:50:56,870 --> 00:50:56,880
and has continued to fall since and so
 

3341
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:57,990
and has continued to fall since and so
what you start to say to yourself is

3342
00:50:57,990 --> 00:50:58,000
what you start to say to yourself is
 

3343
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,390
what you start to say to yourself is
take

3344
00:50:58,390 --> 00:50:58,400
take
 

3345
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,069
take
just the asset of gold which about 10

3346
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:00,079
just the asset of gold which about 10
 

3347
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,990
just the asset of gold which about 10
trillion dollars market cap

3348
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,000
trillion dollars market cap
 

3349
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,750
trillion dollars market cap
and you say okay well if jewelry demand

3350
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:03,760
and you say okay well if jewelry demand
 

3351
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,109
and you say okay well if jewelry demand
continues to fall even if it's at a

3352
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:05,119
continues to fall even if it's at a
 

3353
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,430
continues to fall even if it's at a
slight rate but it continues to contract

3354
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
slight rate but it continues to contract
 

3355
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,349
slight rate but it continues to contract
you have central banks that now at some

3356
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
you have central banks that now at some
 

3357
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,349
you have central banks that now at some
times are net sellers and sometimes net

3358
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:11,359
times are net sellers and sometimes net
 

3359
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,349
times are net sellers and sometimes net
buyers right so okay again contraction

3360
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
buyers right so okay again contraction
 

3361
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:13,990
buyers right so okay again contraction
there

3362
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:14,000
there
 

3363
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,309
there
and then from the investment standpoint

3364
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:16,319
and then from the investment standpoint
 

3365
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,030
and then from the investment standpoint
the actual

3366
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:17,040
the actual
 

3367
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,109
the actual
price that the daily price of this

3368
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:19,119
price that the daily price of this
 

3369
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,870
price that the daily price of this
continues to fall which is

3370
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:20,880
continues to fall which is
 

3371
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:22,549
continues to fall which is
a signal that there's a contracting

3372
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
a signal that there's a contracting
 

3373
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:24,790
a signal that there's a contracting
demand from an investment perspective

3374
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:24,800
demand from an investment perspective
 

3375
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,670
demand from an investment perspective
that's 93 percent of all use of gold

3376
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:27,680
that's 93 percent of all use of gold
 

3377
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,870
that's 93 percent of all use of gold
only seven percent of it's used for

3378
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
only seven percent of it's used for
 

3379
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,630
only seven percent of it's used for
actual technology and metal conduction

3380
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:30,640
actual technology and metal conduction
 

3381
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,990
actual technology and metal conduction
and things like that

3382
00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:32,000
and things like that
 

3383
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,349
and things like that
and so you have a 10 trillion dollar

3384
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:33,359
and so you have a 10 trillion dollar
 

3385
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:36,230
and so you have a 10 trillion dollar

data changes and i'll change my mind and

3388
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:37,920
data changes and i'll change my mind and
 

3389
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,870
data changes and i'll change my mind and
other people change their mind but it

is on the decline and so if that happens

3394
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:41,520
is on the decline and so if that happens
 

3395
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,870
is on the decline and so if that happens
you're going to get the contraction of a

3396
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:42,880
you're going to get the contraction of a
 

3397
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,549
you're going to get the contraction of a
10 trillion dollar asset

3398
00:51:44,549 --> 00:51:44,559
10 trillion dollar asset
 

3399
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,790
10 trillion dollar asset
where's all that value go and what

3400
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:46,800
where's all that value go and what
 

3401
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,990
where's all that value go and what
you're seeing is at the same time that

3402
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
you're seeing is at the same time that
 

3403

you're seeing is at the same time that
that asset is contracting

that asset is contracting
you're also seeing a massive influx

3406
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
you're also seeing a massive influx
 

3407
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,829
you're also seeing a massive influx
from not only retail investors not only

from not only retail investors not only
 

3409
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:56,549
from not only retail investors not only
uh kind of

3410
00:51:56,549 --> 00:51:56,559
uh kind of
 

3411
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,549
uh kind of
the wealthy and the elite but also from

corporations pension funds etc into this
 

3417
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,790

kind of digital sound money so you're

3418
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:04,800
kind of digital sound money so you're
 

3419
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:06,390
kind of digital sound money so you're
saying that there's a kind of shift

3420
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:06,400
saying that there's a kind of shift
 

3421
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:09,190
saying that there's a kind of shift
from gold to bitcoin because they have a

3422
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:09,200
from gold to bitcoin because they have a
 

3423
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,710
from gold to bitcoin because they have a
lot of the same properties except

3424
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:10,720
lot of the same properties except
 

3425
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,190
lot of the same properties except
one is in the physical space the other

3426
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:13,200
one is in the physical space the other
 

3427
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,190
one is in the physical space the other
in the digital space so do you see like

3428
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
in the digital space so do you see like
 

3429
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,829
in the digital space so do you see like
central

3430
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:15,839
central
 

3431
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:19,510

there's a complete shift
 

3447
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,549
there's a complete shift
if you line up the gold community and

3548
00:54:12,069 --> 00:54:12,079
a quick criticism of sort of dating
 

3549
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,829
a quick criticism of sort of dating
culture and all that kind of stuff

3550
00:54:13,829 --> 00:54:13,839
culture and all that kind of stuff
 

3551
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,470
culture and all that kind of stuff
like i haven't uh had shocking

3552
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
like i haven't uh had shocking
 

3553
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,990
like i haven't uh had shocking
revelation that i've never been an

3554
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:18,000
revelation that i've never been an
 

3555
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,990
revelation that i've never been an
attended date or any of those things

3556
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:20,000
attended date or any of those things
 

3557
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,270
attended date or any of those things
i i believe that scarcity and dating and

3558
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
i i believe that scarcity and dating and
 

3559
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:26,710
i i believe that scarcity and dating and
interaction is like intensifies the

3560
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:26,720
interaction is like intensifies the
 

3561
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,349
interaction is like intensifies the
value of

3562
00:54:27,349 --> 00:54:27,359
value of
 

3563
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:29,750
value of
when the interactions do happen so we'll

3564
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:29,760
when the interactions do happen so we'll
 

3565
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,910
when the interactions do happen so we'll
need like when love does happen

3566
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
need like when love does happen
 

3567
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,230
need like when love does happen
and so in that sense there's something

3568
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
and so in that sense there's something
 

3569
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:36,309
and so in that sense there's something
magical about scarcity in the more

3570
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:36,319
magical about scarcity in the more
 

3571
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:38,069
magical about scarcity in the more
subjective psychological social

3572
00:54:38,069 --> 00:54:38,079
subjective psychological social
 

3573
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,710
subjective psychological social
world as well and perhaps money is just

3574
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:40,720
world as well and perhaps money is just
 

3575
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,309
world as well and perhaps money is just
another version of that right it's just

3576
00:54:42,309 --> 00:54:42,319
another version of that right it's just
 

3577
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,549
another version of that right it's just
it's all about the stories and ideas we

3578
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:44,559
it's all about the stories and ideas we
 

3579
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:45,510
it's all about the stories and ideas we
tell ourselves

3580
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:45,520
tell ourselves
 

3581
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:46,549
tell ourselves
i think they're actually more

3582
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559
i think they're actually more
 

3583
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,309
i think they're actually more
interconnected than you're giving it

3584
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:48,319
interconnected than you're giving it
 

3585
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,990
interconnected than you're giving it
credit for right which is

3586
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:50,000
credit for right which is
 

3587
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,589
credit for right which is
what is money money is time ultimately

3588
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:53,599
what is money money is time ultimately
 

3589
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:56,870
what is money money is time ultimately
right the the pursuit of

3590
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:56,880
right the the pursuit of
 

3591
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,829
right the the pursuit of
the acquisition of money right of

3592
00:54:59,829 --> 00:54:59,839
the acquisition of money right of
 

3593
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,309
the acquisition of money right of
whether it's a currency or true money

3594
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:02,319
whether it's a currency or true money
 

3595
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:04,630
whether it's a currency or true money
is because that should give you more

3596
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,640
is because that should give you more
 

3597
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,589
is because that should give you more
time

3598
00:55:05,589 --> 00:55:05,599
time
 

3599
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:07,910
time
and so one of my favorite movies ever is

3600
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
and so one of my favorite movies ever is
 

3601
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,870
and so one of my favorite movies ever is
uh and it's

3602
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:08,880
uh and it's
 

3603
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,789
uh and it's
funny because justin timberlake is in it

3604
00:55:10,789 --> 00:55:10,799
funny because justin timberlake is in it
 

3605
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:13,589
funny because justin timberlake is in it
uh is this movie

3606
00:55:13,589 --> 00:55:13,599
uh is this movie
 

3607
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,829
uh is this movie
i lose most people at that point in time

3608
00:55:15,829 --> 00:55:15,839
i lose most people at that point in time
 

3609
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:16,630
i lose most people at that point in time
in time

3610
00:55:16,630 --> 00:55:16,640
in time
 

3611
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,069
in time
and basically the premise of the movie

3612
00:55:18,069 --> 00:55:18,079
and basically the premise of the movie
 

3613
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,150
and basically the premise of the movie
is that everyone has a clock that's

3614
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:20,160
is that everyone has a clock that's
 

3615
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,750
is that everyone has a clock that's
embedded into their arm

3616
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
embedded into their arm
 

3617
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,549
embedded into their arm
and so uh if you go to work you

3618
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
and so uh if you go to work you
 

3619
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:25,270
and so uh if you go to work you
basically

3620
00:55:25,270 --> 00:55:25,280
basically
 

3621
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,950
basically
put your arm underneath when you leave

3622
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:26,960
put your arm underneath when you leave
 

3623
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,710
put your arm underneath when you leave
and there's time that's deposited into

3624
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:28,720
and there's time that's deposited into
 

3625
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,710
and there's time that's deposited into
your clock and if your clock ever hits

3626
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
your clock and if your clock ever hits
 

3627
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:33,510
your clock and if your clock ever hits
all zeros you're dead you die on the

3628
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
all zeros you're dead you die on the
 

3629
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,309
all zeros you're dead you die on the
spot

3630
00:55:34,309 --> 00:55:34,319
spot
 

3631
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,069
spot
and so there's a number of scenes where

3632
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,079
and so there's a number of scenes where
 

3633
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,589
and so there's a number of scenes where
people are basically running

3634
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:37,599
people are basically running
 

3635
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,950
people are basically running
you know to get to you and i give you a

3636
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:38,960
you know to get to you and i give you a
 

3637
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,230
you know to get to you and i give you a
little bit more time so that you can get

3638
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:40,240
little bit more time so that you can get
 

3639
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,990
little bit more time so that you can get
to work on monday and then you

3640
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
to work on monday and then you
 

3641
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,910
to work on monday and then you
work to acquire time and so basically

3642
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
work to acquire time and so basically
 

3643
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,750
work to acquire time and so basically
time becomes this currency

3644
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
time becomes this currency
 

3645
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,589
time becomes this currency
but what becomes very fascinating about

3646
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:47,599
but what becomes very fascinating about
 

3647
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,470
but what becomes very fascinating about
it is there are sections in society

3648
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:50,480
it is there are sections in society
 

3649
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,710
it is there are sections in society
where literally there's physical places

3650
00:55:52,710 --> 00:55:52,720
where literally there's physical places
 

3651
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:54,630
where literally there's physical places
if you only have let's say

3652
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:54,640
if you only have let's say
 

3653
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:56,870
if you only have let's say
72 hours or less you're allowed to go to

3654
00:55:56,870 --> 00:55:56,880
72 hours or less you're allowed to go to
 

3655
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,150
72 hours or less you're allowed to go to
section 1.

3656
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,160
section 1.
 

3657
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,910
section 1.
section 5 though is because you have

3658
00:55:59,910 --> 00:55:59,920
section 5 though is because you have
 

3659
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,270
section 5 though is because you have
years and years and years

3660
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:01,280
years and years and years
 

3661
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,990
years and years and years
on your clock and in this movie everyone

3662
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
on your clock and in this movie everyone
 

3663
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,670
on your clock and in this movie everyone
at the age of 25

3664
00:56:05,670 --> 00:56:05,680
at the age of 25
 

3665
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:08,630
at the age of 25
freezes from a biological aging

3666
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
freezes from a biological aging
 

3667
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,589
freezes from a biological aging
standpoint

3668
00:56:09,589 --> 00:56:09,599
standpoint
 

3669
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,270
standpoint
so everyone stays the same but you may

3670
00:56:11,270 --> 00:56:11,280
so everyone stays the same but you may
 

3671
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,750
so everyone stays the same but you may
have lived for a thousand years

3672
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
have lived for a thousand years
 

3673
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,670
have lived for a thousand years
and so what becomes so fascinating about

3674
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:15,680
and so what becomes so fascinating about
 

3675
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,190
and so what becomes so fascinating about
it is that

3676
00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:17,200
it is that
 

3677
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,670
it is that
rich people have time poor people do not

3678
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:19,680
rich people have time poor people do not
 

3679
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:20,710
rich people have time poor people do not
have time

3680
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:20,720
have time
 

3681
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:22,950
have time
and so in it justin timberlake the main

3682
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
and so in it justin timberlake the main
 

3683
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,150
and so in it justin timberlake the main
character at one point

3684
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:24,160
character at one point
 

3685
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,950
character at one point
uh essentially acquires a bunch of time

3686
00:56:26,950 --> 00:56:26,960
uh essentially acquires a bunch of time
 

3687
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:27,910
uh essentially acquires a bunch of time
and he's able to go

3688
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:27,920
and he's able to go
 

3689
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:31,030
and he's able to go
to one of the higher levels and now he's

3690
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:31,040
to one of the higher levels and now he's
 

3691
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,109
to one of the higher levels and now he's
attending all these galas and you know

3692
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
attending all these galas and you know
 

3693
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:34,870
attending all these galas and you know
poker nights and all stuff

3694
00:56:34,870 --> 00:56:34,880
poker nights and all stuff
 

3695
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,549
poker nights and all stuff
and one of the first things that he

3696
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
and one of the first things that he
 

3697
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,549
and one of the first things that he
learns is that in

3698
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:38,559
learns is that in
 

3699
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:40,630
learns is that in
the lower end of society everyone is

3700
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:40,640
the lower end of society everyone is
 

3701
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:41,910
the lower end of society everyone is
running everywhere

3702
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
running everywhere
 

3703
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,390
running everywhere
at all times in the movie because time

3704
00:56:44,390 --> 00:56:44,400
at all times in the movie because time
 

3705
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,549
at all times in the movie because time
is so finite and it is so scarce

3706
00:56:46,549 --> 00:56:46,559
is so finite and it is so scarce
 

3707
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,390
is so finite and it is so scarce
and so therefore why would i walk down

3708
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400

00:56:59,910 --> 00:56:59,920
you are seen as lower class yeah
 

3717
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,390
you are seen as lower class yeah
because wealth is time and so that movie

3718
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:02,400
because wealth is time and so that movie
 

3719
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,549
because wealth is time and so that movie
is you know it's got a ton of kind of um

3720
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
is you know it's got a ton of kind of um
 

3721
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:05,990
is you know it's got a ton of kind of um
things that you can pull out of it but

3722
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:06,000
things that you can pull out of it but
 

3723
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:06,470
things that you can pull out of it but
to me

3724
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:06,480
to me
 

3725
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:09,510
to me
is the perfect epitome of money is time

3726
00:57:09,510 --> 00:57:09,520
is the perfect epitome of money is time
 

3727
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,309
is the perfect epitome of money is time
and so when you start to think about the

3728
00:57:12,309 --> 00:57:12,319
and so when you start to think about the
 

3729
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:13,190
and so when you start to think about the
acquisition

3730
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:13,200
acquisition
 

3731
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,030
acquisition
of money right it goes to this whole

3732
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,040
of money right it goes to this whole
 

3733
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,670
of money right it goes to this whole
idea of time billionaire and i know that

3734
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:17,680
idea of time billionaire and i know that
 

3735
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:19,270
idea of time billionaire and i know that
there's probably a lot of people have

3736
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
there's probably a lot of people have
 

3737
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:20,870
there's probably a lot of people have
heard about this already but

3738
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:20,880
heard about this already but
 

3739
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:23,430
heard about this already but
if you think of a million seconds it's

3740
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
if you think of a million seconds it's
 

3741
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,309
if you think of a million seconds it's
about

3742
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:24,319
about
 

3743
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:29,430
about
11 days a billion seconds is 31 years

3744
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:29,440
11 days a billion seconds is 31 years
 

3745
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,910
11 days a billion seconds is 31 years
and so if i said to somebody you have to

3746
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:31,920
and so if i said to somebody you have to
 

3747
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,950
and so if i said to somebody you have to
switch lives

3748
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:32,960
switch lives
 

3749
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,470
switch lives
with warren buffett would you do it

3750
00:57:36,470 --> 00:57:36,480
with warren buffett would you do it
 

3751
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:37,990
with warren buffett would you do it
some people would say sure that'd be

3752
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:38,000
some people would say sure that'd be
 

3753
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,430
some people would say sure that'd be
their initial reaction i said but you

3754
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:39,440
their initial reaction i said but you
 

3755
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,390
their initial reaction i said but you
gotta have to be you know 92 years old

3756
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,400
gotta have to be you know 92 years old
 

3757
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,589
gotta have to be you know 92 years old
is the money worth the lack of time most

3758
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
is the money worth the lack of time most
 

3759
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,030
is the money worth the lack of time most
people would say no right there's this

who really articulated this well um and

3764
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:51,680
who really articulated this well um and
 

3765
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,109
who really articulated this well um and
ultimately what ends up happening is you

3766
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
ultimately what ends up happening is you
 

3767
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,470
ultimately what ends up happening is you
realize time is more valuable than the

3768
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:54,480
realize time is more valuable than the
 

3769
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,109
realize time is more valuable than the
money

money
 

3771
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,150
money
but you you acquire the money to

3772
00:57:58,150 --> 00:57:58,160
but you you acquire the money to
 

3773
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,309
but you you acquire the money to
gain more time and be the reason it's

3774
00:58:00,309 --> 00:58:00,319
gain more time and be the reason it's
 

3775
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,150
gain more time and be the reason it's
valuable is because of the scarcity of

the physics means that um

00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:09,520
the physics means that um

i don't know but it it feels like

3788
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:15,920
i don't know but it it feels like
 

3789
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,630
i don't know but it it feels like
pretty sure we're mortal and in that

pretty sure we're mortal and in that

gives value to time it's fascinating to

3794
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
gives value to time it's fascinating to
 

3795
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,069
gives value to time it's fascinating to
think about all the thought experiments

3796
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:24,079
think about all the thought experiments

00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
of if that could actually be on the
 

3801
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,470
of if that could actually be on the
economy if you can actually convert time

if you start to pull on this a little
 

3807
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,230
if you start to pull on this a little
bit and say okay

00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:40,480
in their 20s has about 2 billion seconds
 

3813
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:42,150
in their 20s has about 2 billion seconds
left in their life right kind of

understand this
 

3823
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,030
understand this
concept think of wealth

3824
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040
concept think of wealth
 

3825
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,069
concept think of wealth
in dollar terms but dollars are being

3826
00:58:56,069 --> 00:58:56,079
in dollar terms but dollars are being
 

3827
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:57,190
in dollar terms but dollars are being
devalued

3828
00:58:57,190 --> 00:58:57,200
devalued
 

3829
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,630
devalued
and so you know a million dollars

3830
00:58:58,630 --> 00:58:58,640
and so you know a million dollars
 

3831
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,230
and so you know a million dollars
doesn't get you what it used to get

3832
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:00,240
doesn't get you what it used to get
 

3833
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,270
doesn't get you what it used to get
right it's kind of a

3834
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
right it's kind of a
 

3835
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,349
right it's kind of a
an old adage and so what you're doing is

3836
00:59:03,349 --> 00:59:03,359
an old adage and so what you're doing is
 

3837
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:04,630
an old adage and so what you're doing is
you're pursuing

3838
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:04,640
you're pursuing
 

3839
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,430
you're pursuing
something that ends up losing value and

3840
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
something that ends up losing value and
 

3841
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,230
something that ends up losing value and
so it's

3842
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:08,240
so it's
 

3843
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,390
so it's
the constant rat race it's how do i

3844
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:10,400
the constant rat race it's how do i
 

3845
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,990
the constant rat race it's how do i
constantly try to get more how do i get

3846
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:12,000
constantly try to get more how do i get
 

3847
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,589
constantly try to get more how do i get
more dollars how do i get more dollars

3848
00:59:13,589 --> 00:59:13,599
more dollars how do i get more dollars
 

3849
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:15,430
more dollars how do i get more dollars
because even if i say to myself you know

3850

the hundred thousand dollars five years
 

3859
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,510
the hundred thousand dollars five years
from now doesn't buy me what i thought

3860

from now doesn't buy me what i thought
it did so now i need

thousand or a million or whatever the
 

3867
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,390
thousand or a million or whatever the
number is

3868
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:28,400
number is
 

3869
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,630
number is
and so ultimately what ends up occurring

3870
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:30,640
and so ultimately what ends up occurring
 

3871
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,510
and so ultimately what ends up occurring
is that

3872
00:59:31,510 --> 00:59:31,520
is that
 

3873
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:33,589
is that
the bitcoin community and many people in

3874
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:33,599
the bitcoin community and many people in
 

3875
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,589
the bitcoin community and many people in
kind of this idea of sound money

3876
00:59:35,589 --> 00:59:35,599
kind of this idea of sound money
 

3877
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:37,670
kind of this idea of sound money
is you want to be able to acquire an

3878
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:37,680
is you want to be able to acquire an
 

3879
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,630
is you want to be able to acquire an
asset

3880
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
asset
 

3881
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,349
asset
that not only will hold the value right

3882
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:41,359
that not only will hold the value right
 

3883
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:42,950
that not only will hold the value right
the store of value over time

3884
00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:42,960
the store of value over time
 

3885
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,270
the store of value over time
but it will actually appreciate over

3886
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
but it will actually appreciate over
 

3887
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,309
but it will actually appreciate over
time

3888
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:46,319
time
 

3889
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,069
time
and so when you look at something like

3890
00:59:48,069 --> 00:59:48,079
and so when you look at something like
 

3891
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:49,750
and so when you look at something like
bitcoin against the dollar against other

3892
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:49,760
bitcoin against the dollar against other
 

3893
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,030
bitcoin against the dollar against other
types of assets

3894
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:51,040
types of assets
 

3895
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,950
types of assets
all of these assets are down compared to

3896
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:52,960
all of these assets are down compared to
 

3897
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,190
all of these assets are down compared to
bitcoin right now some of that's just

3898
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:55,200
bitcoin right now some of that's just
 

3899
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,589
bitcoin right now some of that's just
in the early days of kind of the pricing

3900
00:59:57,589 --> 00:59:57,599
in the early days of kind of the pricing
 

3901
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,430
in the early days of kind of the pricing
of an asset you go from very small to

3902
00:59:59,430 --> 00:59:59,440
of an asset you go from very small to
 

3903
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,870
of an asset you go from very small to
something much larger

3904
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:00,880
something much larger
 

3905
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:02,150
something much larger
but now what you start to look at is

3906
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:02,160
but now what you start to look at is
 

3907
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,910
but now what you start to look at is
well if you have a finite supply of

3908
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:03,920
well if you have a finite supply of
 

3909
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,030
well if you have a finite supply of
something

3910
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:05,040
something
 

3911
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,670
something
what ends up happening is people begin

3912
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
what ends up happening is people begin
 

3913
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:09,190
what ends up happening is people begin
to value it more

3914
01:00:09,190 --> 01:00:09,200
to value it more
 

3915
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:11,750
to value it more
and so in a world where dollars are

3916
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:11,760
and so in a world where dollars are
 

3917
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,710
and so in a world where dollars are
infinite

3918
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
infinite
 

3919
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:15,109
infinite
and other fiat currencies are infinite

3920
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
and other fiat currencies are infinite
 

3921
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,230
and other fiat currencies are infinite
bitcoin becomes

3922
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:16,240
bitcoin becomes
 

3923
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,270
bitcoin becomes
very very interesting very special uh

3924
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:19,280
very very interesting very special uh
 

3925
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,510
very very interesting very special uh
and something that is very aspirational

3926
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:21,520
and something that is very aspirational
 

3927
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,549
and something that is very aspirational
and so i think that's where you're

3928
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:22,559
and so i think that's where you're
 

3929
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:23,910
and so i think that's where you're
starting to see people say wait a second

3930
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
starting to see people say wait a second
 

3931
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,510
starting to see people say wait a second
this is something where

3932
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:25,520
this is something where
 

3933
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,190
this is something where
that finite secure store of value

3934
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:29,200
that finite secure store of value
 

3935
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,829
that finite secure store of value
is essential to wealth generation and

3936
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:31,839
is essential to wealth generation and
 

3937
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:33,990
is essential to wealth generation and
preservation over a long period of time

3938
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,000
preservation over a long period of time
 

3939
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,309
preservation over a long period of time
and if sam harris is right that free

3940
01:00:36,309 --> 01:00:36,319
and if sam harris is right that free
 

3941
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,829
and if sam harris is right that free
will is an illusion this is really

3942
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:37,839
will is an illusion this is really
 

3943
01:00:37,839 --> 01:00:39,510
will is an illusion this is really
interesting to think about

3944
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:39,520
interesting to think about
 

3945
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,670
interesting to think about
maybe time is the kind of block chain

3946
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
maybe time is the kind of block chain
 

3947
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,750
maybe time is the kind of block chain
because you can't change anything and

3948
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:45,760
because you can't change anything and
 

3949
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,789
because you can't change anything and
then the

3950
01:00:46,789 --> 01:00:46,799
then the
 

3951
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:51,270
then the
physical space time of the universe is a

3952
01:00:51,270 --> 01:00:51,280
physical space time of the universe is a
 

3953
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:53,349
physical space time of the universe is a
ledger

3954
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:53,359
ledger
 

3955
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,309
ledger
so maybe uh it won't be bitcoin that

3956
01:00:56,309 --> 01:00:56,319
so maybe uh it won't be bitcoin that
 

3957
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,589
so maybe uh it won't be bitcoin that
replaces gold

3958
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
replaces gold
 

3959
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,270
replaces gold
maybe it'll be time once we crack open

3960
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
maybe it'll be time once we crack open
 

3961
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:01,670
maybe it'll be time once we crack open
that

3962
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:01,680
that
 

3963
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:03,109
that
in fact the universe is fully

3964
01:01:03,109 --> 01:01:03,119
in fact the universe is fully
 

3965
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:05,030
in fact the universe is fully
deterministic so maybe that's what like

3966
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
deterministic so maybe that's what like
 

3967
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,789
deterministic so maybe that's what like
eric weinstein is afraid of once you

3968
01:01:06,789 --> 01:01:06,799
eric weinstein is afraid of once you
 

3969
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:08,630
eric weinstein is afraid of once you
figure out the theories

3970
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,640
figure out the theories
 

3971
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,910
figure out the theories
of everything of physics will be able to

3972
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:11,920
of everything of physics will be able to
 

3973
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:12,710
of everything of physics will be able to
then start

3974
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:12,720
then start
 

3975
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,069
then start
trading create a market out of like the

3976
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:16,079
trading create a market out of like the
 

3977
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,390
trading create a market out of like the
very fabric of reality

3978
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:18,400
very fabric of reality
 

3979
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:20,710
very fabric of reality
and that way break it well if you look

3980
01:01:20,710 --> 01:01:20,720
and that way break it well if you look
 

3981
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,069
and that way break it well if you look
at

3982
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,079
at
 

3983
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,510
at
infinite inflationary type currencies

3984
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:25,520
infinite inflationary type currencies
 

3985
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,190
infinite inflationary type currencies
you can't do that right because it

3986
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:27,200
you can't do that right because it
 

3987
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,789
you can't do that right because it
constantly is losing value right

3988
01:01:28,789 --> 01:01:28,799
constantly is losing value right
 

3989
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:31,030
constantly is losing value right
when you look at a finite asset again

3990
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
when you look at a finite asset again
 

3991
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:31,910
when you look at a finite asset again
that has the

3992
01:01:31,910 --> 01:01:31,920
that has the
 

3993
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:34,789
that has the
provability of the actual finite element

3994
01:01:34,789 --> 01:01:34,799
provability of the actual finite element
 

3995
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,069
provability of the actual finite element
to it

3996
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:36,079
to it
 

3997
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:39,109
to it
ultimately the wealth is

3998
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
ultimately the wealth is
 

3999
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,230
ultimately the wealth is
that marketplace yeah and so you know i

4000
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:42,240
that marketplace yeah and so you know i
 

4001
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,230
that marketplace yeah and so you know i
i always uh kind of try to highlight for

4002
01:01:44,230 --> 01:01:44,240
i always uh kind of try to highlight for
 

4003
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:46,470
i always uh kind of try to highlight for
people the top 55

4004
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:46,480
people the top 55
 

4005
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:48,549
people the top 55
of americans understand something that

4006
01:01:48,549 --> 01:01:48,559
of americans understand something that
 

4007
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:49,829
of americans understand something that
the bottom 45

4008
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:49,839
the bottom 45
 

4009
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:53,589
the bottom 45
don't they invest right the bottom 45

4010
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:53,599
don't they invest right the bottom 45
 

4011
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,630
don't they invest right the bottom 45
consume the top 55 percent invest and

4012
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:56,640
consume the top 55 percent invest and
 

4013
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,309
consume the top 55 percent invest and
that's why we have a wealth and equality

4014
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
that's why we have a wealth and equality
 

4015
01:01:58,319 --> 01:01:58,710
that's why we have a wealth and equality
gap

4016
01:01:58,710 --> 01:01:58,720
gap
 

4017
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,630
gap
and it continues to get wider and wider

4018
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:00,640
and it continues to get wider and wider
 

4019
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,789
and it continues to get wider and wider
and wider is because the people who are

4020
01:02:02,789 --> 01:02:02,799
and wider is because the people who are
 

4021
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,789
and wider is because the people who are
holding the devaluing assets

4022
01:02:04,789 --> 01:02:04,799
holding the devaluing assets
 

4023
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,190
holding the devaluing assets
and saving or watching their wealth be

4024
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,200
and saving or watching their wealth be
 

4025
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:08,150
and saving or watching their wealth be
devalued away

4026
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
devalued away
 

4027
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,990
devalued away
and there's arguments and controversy

4028
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:10,000
and there's arguments and controversy
 

4029
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,150
and there's arguments and controversy

good thing
 

4209
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:05,109
good thing
and so when i see the exploration of

4210
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:05,119
and so when i see the exploration of
 

4211
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:07,029
and so when i see the exploration of
ideas in public

4212
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:07,039
ideas in public
 

4213
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,470
ideas in public
i actually think that those are the

4214
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:08,480
i actually think that those are the
 

4215
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,710
i actually think that those are the
people who are most open

4216
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:10,720
people who are most open
 

4217
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:13,670

to the kind of vehement blowback as well
 

4219
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,109
to the kind of vehement blowback as well
right because that's part of what

4220
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:15,119
right because that's part of what
 

4221
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,870
right because that's part of what
they're doing is that they're eliciting

4222
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:16,880
they're doing is that they're eliciting
 

4223
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,309
they're doing is that they're eliciting
hey i'm going to throw an idea into the

4224
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
hey i'm going to throw an idea into the
 

4225
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,309
hey i'm going to throw an idea into the
arena if it doesn't get attacked they

4226
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:20,319
arena if it doesn't get attacked they
 

4227
01:05:20,319 --> 01:05:21,589
arena if it doesn't get attacked they
actually may be more nervous

4228
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
actually may be more nervous
 

4229
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,510
actually may be more nervous
than if there is some level of you know

4230

bitcoin thesis

4352
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:12,640
bitcoin thesis
 

4353
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:14,549
bitcoin thesis
but ultimately what ends up happening is

4354
01:07:14,549 --> 01:07:14,559
but ultimately what ends up happening is
 

4355
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,990
but ultimately what ends up happening is
you're talking to somebody who's

4356
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:16,000
you're talking to somebody who's
 

4357
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,270
you're talking to somebody who's
an expert i've been thinking about for

4358
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:17,280
an expert i've been thinking about for
 

4359
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:19,430
an expert i've been thinking about for
five seven eight ten years right they've

4360
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:19,440
five seven eight ten years right they've
 

4361
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:20,630
five seven eight ten years right they've
gone through every simulation you

4362
01:07:20,630 --> 01:07:20,640
gone through every simulation you
 

4363
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:21,589
gone through every simulation you
possibly can

4364
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:21,599
possibly can
 

4365
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:24,870
possibly can
and they show up with data examples um

4366
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
and they show up with data examples um
 

4367
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,630
and they show up with data examples um
and responses now they're not always

4368
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:26,640
and responses now they're not always
 

4369
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,990
and responses now they're not always
right but they've just

4370
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
right but they've just
 

4371
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,309
right but they've just
done the work and so what i actually uh

4372
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:30,319
done the work and so what i actually uh
 

4373
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,470
done the work and so what i actually uh
like about folks like eric and others is

4374
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
like about folks like eric and others is
 

4375
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,510
like about folks like eric and others is
as they're kind of going through this

4376
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:33,520
as they're kind of going through this
 

4377
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,230
as they're kind of going through this
journey

4378
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:34,240
journey
 

4379
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:36,309
journey
they're incredibly smart right and they

4380
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
they're incredibly smart right and they
 

4381
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,549
they're incredibly smart right and they
provide uh or they um

4382
01:07:38,549 --> 01:07:38,559
provide uh or they um
 

4383
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,870
provide uh or they um
apply a lot of intellectual rigor to

4384
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
apply a lot of intellectual rigor to
 

4385
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,069
apply a lot of intellectual rigor to
some of these arguments

4386
01:07:42,069 --> 01:07:42,079
some of these arguments
 

4387
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:43,430
some of these arguments
and so what it does is what does it do

4388
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:43,440
and so what it does is what does it do
 

4389
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,870
and so what it does is what does it do
it's a marketplace it keeps people

4390
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
it's a marketplace it keeps people
 

4391
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,069
it's a marketplace it keeps people
honest

4392
01:07:46,069 --> 01:07:46,079
honest
 

4393
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:48,230
honest
so i uh let me sort of make a few

4394
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:48,240
so i uh let me sort of make a few
 

4395
01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:49,990
so i uh let me sort of make a few
comments it's kind of interesting uh so

4396
01:07:49,990 --> 01:07:50,000
comments it's kind of interesting uh so
 

4397
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:52,150
comments it's kind of interesting uh so
you're exactly right

4398
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:52,160
you're exactly right
 

4399
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:54,230
you're exactly right
uh maybe the blowback is part of the

4400
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,240
uh maybe the blowback is part of the
 

4401
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,750
uh maybe the blowback is part of the
mechanism that actually develops these

4402
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:55,760
mechanism that actually develops these
 

4403
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:56,870
mechanism that actually develops these
ideas and so on

4404
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:56,880
ideas and so on
 

4405
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,950
ideas and so on
i do want to kind of speak to a little

4406
01:07:58,950 --> 01:07:58,960
i do want to kind of speak to a little
 

4407
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:00,950
i do want to kind of speak to a little
bit of the toxicity that i've

4408
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
bit of the toxicity that i've
 

4409
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,630
bit of the toxicity that i've
experienced in the bitcoin community i

4410
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:02,640
experienced in the bitcoin community i
 

4411
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:03,829
experienced in the bitcoin community i
kind of see it

4412
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:03,839
kind of see it
 

4413
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:05,430
kind of see it
the bitcoin community i think he paints

4414
01:08:05,430 --> 01:08:05,440
the bitcoin community i think he paints
 

4415
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:07,190
the bitcoin community i think he paints
a really nice picture which i kind of

4416
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200
a really nice picture which i kind of
 

4417
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,349
a really nice picture which i kind of
see it as an immune system

4418
01:08:09,349 --> 01:08:09,359
see it as an immune system
 

4419
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,230
see it as an immune system
that protects against sort of uh the

4420
01:08:12,230 --> 01:08:12,240
that protects against sort of uh the
 

4421
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,430
that protects against sort of uh the
viruses

4422
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:13,440
viruses
 

4423
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,189
viruses
that are bad ideas that said the immune

4424
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:17,199
that are bad ideas that said the immune
 

4425
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:17,749
that are bad ideas that said the immune
system

4426
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:17,759
system
 

4427
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:21,430
system
can destroy a body right and

4428
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:21,440
can destroy a body right and
 

4429
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:22,950
can destroy a body right and
the thing you mentioned about eric and

4430
01:08:22,950 --> 01:08:22,960
the thing you mentioned about eric and
 

4431
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,950
the thing you mentioned about eric and
maybe about myself

4432
01:08:24,950 --> 01:08:24,960
maybe about myself
 

4433
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,349
maybe about myself
and in general just people exploring

4434
01:08:27,349 --> 01:08:27,359
and in general just people exploring
 

4435
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:28,630
and in general just people exploring
ideas

4436
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:28,640
ideas
 

4437
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:30,390
ideas
is there is a dunning-kruger effect

4438
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,400
is there is a dunning-kruger effect
 

4439
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,149
is there is a dunning-kruger effect
which is when you first

4440
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
which is when you first
 

4441
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,269
which is when you first
start exploring ideas deeply you have

4442
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:35,279
start exploring ideas deeply you have
 

4443
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:38,789
start exploring ideas deeply you have
um overblown level of confidence about

4444
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
um overblown level of confidence about
 

4445
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,630
um overblown level of confidence about
like how much you understand

4446
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
like how much you understand
 

4447
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,990
like how much you understand
and that's actually the process about

4448
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
and that's actually the process about
 

4449
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:43,110
and that's actually the process about
learning then you realize you don't

4450
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,120
learning then you realize you don't
 

4451
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:44,149
learning then you realize you don't
understand much

4452
01:08:44,149 --> 01:08:44,159
understand much
 

4453
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,430
understand much
what i've noticed with the bitcoin

4454
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
what i've noticed with the bitcoin
 

4455
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:47,269
what i've noticed with the bitcoin
community is uh

4456
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:47,279
community is uh
 

4457
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,470
community is uh
they're not as uh patient with the

4458
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:50,480
they're not as uh patient with the
 

4459
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:52,149
they're not as uh patient with the
the basics of the dunning-kruger effect

4460
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:52,159
the basics of the dunning-kruger effect
 

4461
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:54,229
the basics of the dunning-kruger effect
like if i step in

4462
01:08:54,229 --> 01:08:54,239
like if i step in
 

4463
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:57,269
like if i step in
and make declarative statements about

4464
01:08:57,269 --> 01:08:57,279
and make declarative statements about
 

4465
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:00,390
and make declarative statements about
bitcoin like i you know i read a long

4466
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:00,400
bitcoin like i you know i read a long
 

4467
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:01,110
bitcoin like i you know i read a long
time ago

4468
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:01,120
time ago
 

4469
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,309
time ago
uh the white paper like at the cursed

4470
01:09:04,309 --> 01:09:04,319
uh the white paper like at the cursed
 

4471
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,229
uh the white paper like at the cursed
degree level i felt

4472
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:06,239
degree level i felt
 

4473
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:09,349
degree level i felt
uh that i understand the technology this

4474
01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:09,359
uh that i understand the technology this
 

4475
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:10,709
uh that i understand the technology this
is basic intuitions

4476
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:10,719
is basic intuitions
 

4477
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:12,070
is basic intuitions
you know i didn't think about the social

4478
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:12,080
you know i didn't think about the social
 

4479
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,910
you know i didn't think about the social
dynamics i didn't think about any like

4480
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:13,920
dynamics i didn't think about any like
 

4481
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:15,669
dynamics i didn't think about any like
financial implications and

4482
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:15,679
financial implications and
 

4483
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:17,749
financial implications and
a lot of the deep actually the ongoing

4484
01:09:17,749 --> 01:09:17,759
a lot of the deep actually the ongoing
 

4485
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,590
a lot of the deep actually the ongoing
innovations and all that kind of stuff

4486
01:09:19,590 --> 01:09:19,600
innovations and all that kind of stuff
 

4487
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:20,870
innovations and all that kind of stuff
but i thought i understood that

4488
01:09:20,870 --> 01:09:20,880
but i thought i understood that
 

4489
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:22,390
but i thought i understood that
technology and so i step in and make

4490
01:09:22,390 --> 01:09:22,400
technology and so i step in and make
 

4491
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:23,990
technology and so i step in and make
declarative statements i think those are

4492
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:24,000
declarative statements i think those are
 

4493
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:24,630
declarative statements i think those are
the

4494
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:24,640
the
 

4495
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,950
the
the first time you say okay what's the

4496
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:26,960
the first time you say okay what's the
 

4497
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:28,229
the first time you say okay what's the
role of bitcoin in the world you start

4498
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:28,239
role of bitcoin in the world you start
 

4499
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:29,990
role of bitcoin in the world you start
thinking about it deeply

4500
01:09:29,990 --> 01:09:30,000
thinking about it deeply
 

4501
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,070
thinking about it deeply
and then you make statements the

4502
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,080
and then you make statements the
 

4503
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,870
and then you make statements the
toxicity that you get in those first few

4504
01:09:34,870 --> 01:09:34,880
toxicity that you get in those first few
 

4505
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:35,669
toxicity that you get in those first few
statements

4506
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:35,679
statements
 

4507
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,430
statements

but that doesn't mean that um you know
 

4605
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,630
but that doesn't mean that um you know
you have to sort of i guess develop

01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
you have to sort of i guess develop
 

4607
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,910

especially when you feel like in my case
 

4611
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,910
especially when you feel like in my case
that the person is coming from a good

4612
01:11:19,910 --> 01:11:19,920
that the person is coming from a good
 

4613
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:20,630
that the person is coming from a good
place right

4614
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
place right
 

4615
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,590
place right
i don't know if there's something you

4616
01:11:21,590 --> 01:11:21,600
i don't know if there's something you
 

4617
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,070
i don't know if there's something you
could say yeah that's positive about the

4618
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:24,080
could say yeah that's positive about the
 

4619
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,830
could say yeah that's positive about the
future of this kind of overcoming this

4620
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:25,840
future of this kind of overcoming this
 

4621
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:26,709
future of this kind of overcoming this
toxicity

4622
01:11:26,709 --> 01:11:26,719
toxicity
 

4623
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,310
toxicity
i think there's a couple of trends that

4624
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,320
i think there's a couple of trends that
 

4625
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,550
i think there's a couple of trends that
are all kind of coalescing here right

4626
01:11:30,550 --> 01:11:30,560
are all kind of coalescing here right
 

4627
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:32,310
are all kind of coalescing here right
in these types of experiences so one is

4628
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:32,320
in these types of experiences so one is
 

4629
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:33,590
in these types of experiences so one is
uh when you look at a community

4630
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:33,600
uh when you look at a community
 

4631
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,910
uh when you look at a community
there's always um a spectrum right in

4632
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:35,920
there's always um a spectrum right in
 

4633
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:36,630
there's always um a spectrum right in
terms of

4634
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:36,640
terms of
 

4635
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,149
terms of
there's some people who over index on

4636
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
there's some people who over index on
 

4637
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:40,229
there's some people who over index on
kindness uh and stupidity

4638
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:40,239
kindness uh and stupidity
 

4639
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:41,270
kindness uh and stupidity
right and there's some people who over

4640
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:41,280
right and there's some people who over
 

4641
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,270
right and there's some people who over
index on intelligence and uh basically

4642
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:43,280
index on intelligence and uh basically
 

4643
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,310
index on intelligence and uh basically
just being an [\h__\h]

4644
01:11:44,310 --> 01:11:44,320
just being an [\h__\h]
 

4645
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:45,830
just being an [\h__\h]
right and then you get everyone in

4646
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
right and then you get everyone in
 

4647
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,510
right and then you get everyone in
between and so like uh

4648
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
between and so like uh
 

4649
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,229
between and so like uh
naturally as we know the extremist ends

4650
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:50,239
naturally as we know the extremist ends
 

4651
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:50,709
naturally as we know the extremist ends
of

4652
01:11:50,709 --> 01:11:50,719
of
 

4653
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:52,390
of
uh any community end up being the

4654
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400
uh any community end up being the
 

4655
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:54,229
uh any community end up being the
loudest usually right

4656
01:11:54,229 --> 01:11:54,239
loudest usually right
 

4657
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:57,270
loudest usually right
the second thing is um

4658
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
the second thing is um
 

4659
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,750
the second thing is um
there is from the outsider view like in

4660
01:11:59,750 --> 01:11:59,760
there is from the outsider view like in
 

4661
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,350
there is from the outsider view like in
at the beginning of the exploration of

4662
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:01,360
at the beginning of the exploration of
 

4663
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:02,070
at the beginning of the exploration of
ideas

4664
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
ideas
 

4665
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,070

we must protect it with our lives
yeah right the truth's probably

4680
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:18,480
yeah right the truth's probably
 

4681
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:19,669
yeah right the truth's probably
somewhere in between there

4682
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
somewhere in between there
 

4683
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,590
somewhere in between there

white there's this kind of more gray
 

4687
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,870
white there's this kind of more gray
area that i think actually

4688
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:24,880
area that i think actually
 

4689
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,590
area that i think actually
um is where most people exist the other

01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,910
thing that's at play here
is uh i think the bitcoin community

4694
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:31,920

the public narrative

4752
01:13:26,229 --> 01:13:26,239
the public narrative
 

4753
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,070
the public narrative
you've shifted the the power the

4754
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
you've shifted the the power the
 

4755
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:29,669
you've shifted the the power the
asymmetry of power is more symmetrical

4756
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:29,679
asymmetry of power is more symmetrical
 

4757
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:32,149
asymmetry of power is more symmetrical
now it's the ultimate insurgency

4758
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
now it's the ultimate insurgency
 

4759
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,229
now it's the ultimate insurgency
right if you bring it back to the the

4760
01:13:34,229 --> 01:13:34,239
right if you bring it back to the the
 

4761
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,430
right if you bring it back to the the
field yes

4762
01:13:35,430 --> 01:13:35,440
field yes
 

4763
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,830
field yes
and so when you think about this you

4764
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
and so when you think about this you
 

4765
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,590
and so when you think about this you
have to lean into the advantage that you

4766
01:13:39,590 --> 01:13:39,600
have to lean into the advantage that you
 

4767
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:40,390
have to lean into the advantage that you
have

4768
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
have
 

4769
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,550
have
yeah and so what ends up happening is

4770
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:42,560
yeah and so what ends up happening is
 

4771
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,430
yeah and so what ends up happening is
you and i

4772
01:13:43,430 --> 01:13:43,440
you and i
 

4773
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,550
you and i
would absolutely lose it if we saw

4774
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:46,560
would absolutely lose it if we saw
 

4775
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:48,630
would absolutely lose it if we saw
jp morgan or goldman sachs or the

to the medium and the uh even playing
field that it would provide would

4786
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:00,480

it's uh it's a feature not a bug there's

it's uh it's a feature not a bug there's

but i do think it's a net positive it's
just like the immune system

just like the immune system

5083
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:32,390
of a fan base
if you will but there's a lot of people

5084
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:32,400
if you will but there's a lot of people
 

5085
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:33,750
if you will but there's a lot of people
who also think that sometimes they say

5086

you're just missing the last part which

5118
01:19:01,990 --> 01:19:02,000
you're just missing the last part which
 

5119
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:02,390
you're just missing the last part which
is

is
bitcoin's the solution right and so he

5122
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
bitcoin's the solution right and so he
 

5123
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,110
bitcoin's the solution right and so he
was gold and some other ideas but

5124
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:07,120
was gold and some other ideas but
 

5125
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:09,669
was gold and some other ideas but
i think that he's a perfect example of

5126
01:19:09,669 --> 01:19:09,679
i think that he's a perfect example of
 

5127
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:11,270
i think that he's a perfect example of
when you are part of

5128
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
when you are part of
 

5129
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:14,550
when you are part of
uh the establishment people view you in

5130
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:14,560
uh the establishment people view you in
 

5131
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:15,990
uh the establishment people view you in
a very static way as

5132
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:16,000
a very static way as
 

5133
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,709
a very static way as
uh the leader of a part of establishment

5134
01:19:18,709 --> 01:19:18,719
uh the leader of a part of establishment
 

5135
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:20,950
uh the leader of a part of establishment
but whether it's bill gates ray dalio or

5136
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
but whether it's bill gates ray dalio or
 

5137
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,149
but whether it's bill gates ray dalio or
somebody else

5138
01:19:22,149 --> 01:19:22,159
somebody else
 

5139
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:23,990

each one of these people were innovators

5140
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
each one of these people were innovators
 

5141
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,590
each one of these people were innovators
and challengers to a system they were

5142
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:25,600
and challengers to a system they were
 

5143
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:27,110
and challengers to a system they were
upstarts at one point

5144
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:27,120
upstarts at one point
 

5145
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,470
upstarts at one point
and so it's kind of this idea that like

5146
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,480
and so it's kind of this idea that like
 

5147
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:29,830
and so it's kind of this idea that like
if you live long enough you eventually

5148
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:29,840
if you live long enough you eventually
 

5149
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,189
if you live long enough you eventually
become the man

5150
01:19:31,189 --> 01:19:31,199
become the man
 

5151
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:33,350
become the man
right and so you know gates is a good

5152
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:33,360
right and so you know gates is a good
 

5153
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:34,470
right and so you know gates is a good
example right

5154
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:34,480
example right
 

5155
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:36,229
example right
warren buffett is a good example ray

5156
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
warren buffett is a good example ray
 

5157
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:38,310
warren buffett is a good example ray
dalio's a good example etc and so

5158
01:19:38,310 --> 01:19:38,320
dalio's a good example etc and so

5251
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:01,350
those
people would be like cios at

5252
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,360
people would be like cios at
 

5253
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,189
people would be like cios at
organizations some of them would be at

5261
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,229
and so you can see this kind of
inflection point

5262
01:21:10,229 --> 01:21:10,239
inflection point
 

5263
01:21:10,239 --> 01:21:12,390

there was infrastructure that got built
okay that kind of led to more adoption

5268
01:21:16,390 --> 01:21:16,400
okay that kind of led to more adoption
 

5269
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:17,350
okay that kind of led to more adoption
there was

5279
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,870
buy it and come out and say it okay that
led to inflection points

5280
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:26,880
led to inflection points
 

5281
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,270
led to inflection points
uh you started to have some of these

5282
01:21:29,270 --> 01:21:29,280
uh you started to have some of these
 

5283
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:31,189
uh you started to have some of these
kind of wall street legends

5284
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
kind of wall street legends

started

5288
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
started
 

5289
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:36,390
started
now you're seeing corporations start to

5290
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:36,400
now you're seeing corporations start to
 

5291
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:38,310
now you're seeing corporations start to
do it right eventually there's gonna be

5292
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:38,320
do it right eventually there's gonna be
 

5293
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:39,750
do it right eventually there's gonna be
a central bank that does it

a central bank that does it
 

5295
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:41,110
a central bank that does it
and so you kind of walk through that

5296
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:41,120
and so you kind of walk through that
 

5297
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,950
and so you kind of walk through that
line and what you understand it's like

5298
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:42,960
line and what you understand it's like
 

5299
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:44,470
line and what you understand it's like
it's the same thing every time it's just

5300
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:44,480
it's the same thing every time it's just
 

5301
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,070
it's the same thing every time it's just
somebody new

5302
01:21:46,070 --> 01:21:46,080
somebody new
 

5303
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:47,669
somebody new
right that that path right that

5304
01:21:47,669 --> 01:21:47,679
right that that path right that
 

5305
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:49,910
right that that path right that
bitcoiner's journey if you will

5306
01:21:49,910 --> 01:21:49,920
bitcoiner's journey if you will
 

5307

and i think that that is almost the
 

5309
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:53,030
and i think that that is almost the
beauty

5310
01:21:53,030 --> 01:21:53,040
beauty
 

5311
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:56,470
beauty
of it is uh if you short circuit the

5312
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:56,480
of it is uh if you short circuit the
 

5313
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,350
of it is uh if you short circuit the
journey

5314
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:57,360
journey
 

5315
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,390
journey
it's almost like somebody doesn't

5316
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:58,400
it's almost like somebody doesn't
 

5317
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,709
it's almost like somebody doesn't
appreciate it right if you take let's

5318
01:22:00,709 --> 01:22:00,719
appreciate it right if you take let's
 

5319
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:02,629
appreciate it right if you take let's
say somebody who's a young kid and you

5320
01:22:02,629 --> 01:22:02,639
say somebody who's a young kid and you
 

5321
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:03,750
say somebody who's a young kid and you
just give them a bunch of money and they

5322
01:22:03,750 --> 01:22:03,760
just give them a bunch of money and they
 

5323
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,430
just give them a bunch of money and they
didn't have to work hard for it

5324
01:22:05,430 --> 01:22:05,440
didn't have to work hard for it
 

5325
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:08,310
didn't have to work hard for it
they don't really appreciate it and uh

5326
01:22:08,310 --> 01:22:08,320
they don't really appreciate it and uh
 

5327
01:22:08,320 --> 01:22:08,790
they don't really appreciate it and uh

01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:08,800
ray
 

5329
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,390
ray
ray actually has the book principles

5330
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:10,400
ray actually has the book principles
 

5331
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:11,830
ray actually has the book principles
right and he talks about the hero's

5332
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:11,840
right and he talks about the hero's
 

5333
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:12,870
right and he talks about the hero's
journey so

5334
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:12,880
journey so

of
 

5339
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,629
of
you know thinking about digital currency

5340
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:18,639
you know thinking about digital currency
 

5341
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:19,910
you know thinking about digital currency
in general like

5342
01:22:19,910 --> 01:22:19,920
in general like
 

5343
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,950
in general like
digital finance it's one of the big

5344
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:22,960
digital finance it's one of the big
 

5345
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,709
digital finance it's one of the big
transitions

5346
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
transitions
 

5347
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:27,830
transitions
transformations of our world

5348
01:22:27,830 --> 01:22:27,840
transformations of our world
 

5349
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,709
transformations of our world
in some sense it's not just about money

5350
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:30,719
in some sense it's not just about money
 

5351
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:31,990
in some sense it's not just about money
or you could argue that money is

5352
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:32,000
or you could argue that money is
 

5353
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,669
or you could argue that money is
everything i mean it's like

5354
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:33,679
everything i mean it's like
 

5355
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:35,990
everything i mean it's like
money isn't just the the narrow

5356
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
money isn't just the the narrow
 

5357
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,590
money isn't just the the narrow
definition of money money is really

5358
01:22:37,590 --> 01:22:37,600
definition of money money is really
 

5359
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:38,070
definition of money money is really
everything

5360
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:38,080
everything
 

5361
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:40,149
everything
and so we're you could argue that sort

5362
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:40,159
and so we're you could argue that sort
 

5363
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,629
and so we're you could argue that sort
of uh cryptocurrency

5364
01:22:42,629 --> 01:22:42,639
of uh cryptocurrency
 

5365
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,870
of uh cryptocurrency
is like the base layer of this

5366
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
is like the base layer of this
 

5367
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,870
is like the base layer of this
transformation to the digital space and

5368
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:46,880
transformation to the digital space and
 

5369
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:48,390
transformation to the digital space and
everything else will just be

5370
01:22:48,390 --> 01:22:48,400
everything else will just be
 

5371
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,709
everything else will just be
built on top of it i use a different

5372
01:22:50,709 --> 01:22:50,719
built on top of it i use a different
 

5373
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:51,990
built on top of it i use a different
word um

5374
01:22:51,990 --> 01:22:52,000
word um
 

5375
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,390
word um
that i think is kind of closer to your

5376
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:54,400
that i think is kind of closer to your
 

5377
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:55,189
that i think is kind of closer to your
world which is

5378
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:55,199
world which is
 

5379
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:57,910
world which is
it's ultimately automation and what i

5380
01:22:57,910 --> 01:22:57,920
it's ultimately automation and what i
 

5381
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,550
it's ultimately automation and what i
mean by that

5382
01:22:58,550 --> 01:22:58,560
mean by that
 

5383
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:01,750
mean by that
is uh you know before 1970 or 1980 all

5384
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:01,760
is uh you know before 1970 or 1980 all
 

5385
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:03,350
is uh you know before 1970 or 1980 all
the assets were analog

5386
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:03,360
the assets were analog
 

5387
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:04,709
the assets were analog
and so when you have analog assets

5388
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:04,719
and so when you have analog assets
 

5389
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:06,149
and so when you have analog assets
physical stock certificates physical

5390
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:06,159
physical stock certificates physical
 

5391
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:07,750
physical stock certificates physical
bonds right physical

5392
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:07,760
bonds right physical
 

5393
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:10,629
bonds right physical
deed to a home you have to physically

5394
01:23:10,629 --> 01:23:10,639
deed to a home you have to physically
 

5395
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,430
deed to a home you have to physically
exchange them

5396
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:11,440
exchange them
 

5397
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:14,950
exchange them
yeah when we wanted to increase

5398
01:23:14,950 --> 01:23:14,960
yeah when we wanted to increase
 

5399
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:17,510
yeah when we wanted to increase
transactions and increase kind of global

5400
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:17,520
transactions and increase kind of global
 

5401
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:19,110
transactions and increase kind of global
finance and access

5402
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,120
finance and access
 

5403
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,790
finance and access
we took those physical assets and we

5404
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:20,800
we took those physical assets and we
 

5405
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:23,110
we took those physical assets and we
created electronic qsip assets so now we

5406
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,120
created electronic qsip assets so now we
 

5407
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,110
created electronic qsip assets so now we
have in centralized databases kind of a

5408
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,120
have in centralized databases kind of a
 

5409
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:25,910
have in centralized databases kind of a
file

5410
01:23:25,910 --> 01:23:25,920
file
 

5411
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,669
file
represents the asset that's sitting

5412
01:23:27,669 --> 01:23:27,679
represents the asset that's sitting
 

5413
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:28,950
represents the asset that's sitting
somewhere in custody

5414
01:23:28,950 --> 01:23:28,960
somewhere in custody
 

5415
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,390
somewhere in custody
and you and i can transact them a little

5416
01:23:30,390 --> 01:23:30,400
and you and i can transact them a little
 

5417
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:32,149
and you and i can transact them a little
bit easier but still centralized there's

5418
01:23:32,149 --> 01:23:32,159
bit easier but still centralized there's
 

5419
01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:33,350
bit easier but still centralized there's
still some bureaucracy

5420
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:33,360
still some bureaucracy
 

5421
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,270
still some bureaucracy
and you know maybe it takes two days to

5422
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:35,280
and you know maybe it takes two days to
 

5423
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:36,470
and you know maybe it takes two days to
transact rather than

5424
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:36,480
transact rather than
 

5425
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:37,990
transact rather than
actually mailing it across the other

5426
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:38,000
actually mailing it across the other
 

5427
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,669
actually mailing it across the other
world

5428
01:23:39,669 --> 01:23:39,679
world
 

5429
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,149
world
now what we're seeing is a transition

5430
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:42,159
now what we're seeing is a transition
 

5431
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,910
now what we're seeing is a transition
from those electronic q-sips to these

5432
01:23:43,910 --> 01:23:43,920
from those electronic q-sips to these
 

5433
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:45,270
from those electronic q-sips to these
digital assets

5434
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:45,280
digital assets
 

5435
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,110
digital assets
and so if you look at again just let's

5436
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:47,120
and so if you look at again just let's
 

5437
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,270
and so if you look at again just let's
say money uh or currency

5438
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:49,280
say money uh or currency
 

5439
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,470
say money uh or currency
every currency in the world is going to

5440
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:50,480
every currency in the world is going to
 

5441
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,070
every currency in the world is going to
be digital you're gonna have a digital

5442
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:52,080
be digital you're gonna have a digital
 

5443
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:52,550
be digital you're gonna have a digital
dollar

5444
01:23:52,550 --> 01:23:52,560
dollar
 

5445
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:55,669
dollar
a digital euro yen rmb you're gonna have

5446
01:23:55,669 --> 01:23:55,679
a digital euro yen rmb you're gonna have
 

5447
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,870
a digital euro yen rmb you're gonna have
decentralized uh kind of open source uh

5448
01:23:58,870 --> 01:23:58,880
decentralized uh kind of open source uh
 

5449
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,870
decentralized uh kind of open source uh
money like bitcoin you're also gonna

5450
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:00,880
money like bitcoin you're also gonna
 

5451
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,310
money like bitcoin you're also gonna
have private currencies

5452
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:02,320
have private currencies
 

5453
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:04,629
have private currencies
like facebook's attempt at dm uh and

5454
01:24:04,629 --> 01:24:04,639
like facebook's attempt at dm uh and
 

5455
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,229
like facebook's attempt at dm uh and
there will be others that will try to do

5456
01:24:06,229 --> 01:24:06,239
there will be others that will try to do
 

5457
01:24:06,239 --> 01:24:06,950
there will be others that will try to do
this

5458
01:24:06,950 --> 01:24:06,960
this
 

5459
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:09,270
this
and so when you get everything digital

5460
01:24:09,270 --> 01:24:09,280
and so when you get everything digital
 

5461
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,310
and so when you get everything digital
right and i think that's the kind of

5462
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:10,320
right and i think that's the kind of
 

5463
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:11,990
right and i think that's the kind of
first step everyone focuses on

5464
01:24:11,990 --> 01:24:12,000
first step everyone focuses on
 

5465
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,910
first step everyone focuses on
the competition at the technology layer

5466
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:13,920
the competition at the technology layer
 

5467
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,189
the competition at the technology layer
essentially goes away

5468
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:15,199
essentially goes away
 

5469
01:24:15,199 --> 01:24:16,790
essentially goes away
you get some level of feature parity and

5470
01:24:16,790 --> 01:24:16,800
you get some level of feature parity and
 

5471
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,149
you get some level of feature parity and
sure there's bells and whistles on each

5472
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
sure there's bells and whistles on each
 

5473
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:19,669
sure there's bells and whistles on each
kind of implementation of a digital

5474
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:19,679
kind of implementation of a digital
 

5475
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:20,470
kind of implementation of a digital
currency

5476
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:20,480
currency
 

5477
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,830
currency
but at the end of the day the technology

5478
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:21,840
but at the end of the day the technology
 

5479
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,910
but at the end of the day the technology
is relatively the same and ultimately

5480
01:24:23,910 --> 01:24:23,920
is relatively the same and ultimately
 

5481
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,590
is relatively the same and ultimately
what it will do is it will facilitate

5482
01:24:25,590 --> 01:24:25,600
what it will do is it will facilitate
 

5483
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:26,790
what it will do is it will facilitate
the adoption of

5484
01:24:26,790 --> 01:24:26,800
the adoption of
 

5485
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,629
the adoption of
digital wallets so you have to have a

5486
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:28,639
digital wallets so you have to have a
 

5487
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:29,669
digital wallets so you have to have a
digital wallet regardless of what

5488
01:24:29,669 --> 01:24:29,679
digital wallet regardless of what
 

5489
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:31,350
digital wallet regardless of what
digital currency you have same with me

5490
01:24:31,350 --> 01:24:31,360
digital currency you have same with me
 

5491
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,270
digital currency you have same with me
same with everybody else in the world

5492
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
same with everybody else in the world
 

5493
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,870
same with everybody else in the world
but what it does do is when you

5494
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
but what it does do is when you
 

5495
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,189
but what it does do is when you
kind of uh push away and reduce the

5496
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
kind of uh push away and reduce the
 

5497
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,430
kind of uh push away and reduce the
friction of competition at the

5498
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
friction of competition at the
 

5499
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:40,950
friction of competition at the
technology layer it moves the

5500
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:40,960
technology layer it moves the
 

5501
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,990
technology layer it moves the
competition to the monetary policy layer

5502
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
competition to the monetary policy layer
 

5503
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,430
competition to the monetary policy layer
and so when you get to that layer now

5504
01:24:45,430 --> 01:24:45,440
and so when you get to that layer now
 

5505
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,030
and so when you get to that layer now
often it becomes interesting because all

5506
01:24:47,030 --> 01:24:47,040
often it becomes interesting because all
 

5507
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,629
often it becomes interesting because all
of the currencies are the same

5508
01:24:48,629 --> 01:24:48,639
of the currencies are the same
 

5509
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:50,550
of the currencies are the same
except for this one right now and maybe

5510
01:24:50,550 --> 01:24:50,560
except for this one right now and maybe
 

5511
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,830
except for this one right now and maybe
there will be others in the future

5512
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:51,840
there will be others in the future
 

5513
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,910
there will be others in the future
uh but but for sure bitcoin today and

5514
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
uh but but for sure bitcoin today and
 

5515
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,430
uh but but for sure bitcoin today and
people may try to replicate in a private

5516
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,440
people may try to replicate in a private
 

5517
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,950
people may try to replicate in a private
manner or something but bitcoin is kind

5518
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:56,960
manner or something but bitcoin is kind
 

5519
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,149
manner or something but bitcoin is kind
of the the only

5520
01:24:58,149 --> 01:24:58,159
of the the only
 

5521
01:24:58,159 --> 01:25:01,910
of the the only
finite scarce digital cell money and so

5522
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
finite scarce digital cell money and so
 

5523
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,149
finite scarce digital cell money and so
when you then have that pretty big

5524
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:04,159
when you then have that pretty big
 

5525
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:05,270
when you then have that pretty big
difference in that competition at the

5526
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:05,280
difference in that competition at the
 

5527
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,790
difference in that competition at the
monetary policy layer

5528
01:25:06,790 --> 01:25:06,800
monetary policy layer
 

5529
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:08,709
monetary policy layer
it's actually not going to matter where

5530
01:25:08,709 --> 01:25:08,719
it's actually not going to matter where
 

5531
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:09,990
it's actually not going to matter where
you get paid

5532
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:10,000
you get paid
 

5533
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,990
you get paid
right and what i mean by that is like

5534
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
right and what i mean by that is like
 

5535
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,470
right and what i mean by that is like
you and i both live in a single currency

5536
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:14,480
you and i both live in a single currency
 

5537
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:17,590
you and i both live in a single currency
environment i get paid in dollars

5538
01:25:17,590 --> 01:25:17,600
environment i get paid in dollars
 

5539
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:20,390
environment i get paid in dollars
i historically have saved in dollars all

5540
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:20,400
i historically have saved in dollars all
 

5541
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:21,590
i historically have saved in dollars all
of the assets in my life

5542
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600

my debts in dollars whether it's taxes

my debts in dollars whether it's taxes
 

5547
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:29,189
my debts in dollars whether it's taxes
or in the private market

5548
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
or in the private market
 

5549
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,390
or in the private market
and i don't have to worry about foreign

5550
01:25:30,390 --> 01:25:30,400
and i don't have to worry about foreign
 

5551
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,390
and i don't have to worry about foreign
currencies i don't exchange anything the

5552
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
currencies i don't exchange anything the
 

5553
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,510
currencies i don't exchange anything the
only time i would ever think about in

5554
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:33,520
only time i would ever think about in
 

5555
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:34,790
only time i would ever think about in
other currencies if i'm going to another

5556
01:25:34,790 --> 01:25:34,800
other currencies if i'm going to another
 

5557
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:35,350
other currencies if i'm going to another
country

5558
01:25:35,350 --> 01:25:35,360
country
 

5559
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,990
country
in their single currency environment and

5560
01:25:37,990 --> 01:25:38,000
in their single currency environment and
 

5561
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,430
in their single currency environment and
in order to

5562
01:25:39,430 --> 01:25:39,440
in order to
 

5563
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:42,070
in order to
change or exchange my currency i go to

5564
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
change or exchange my currency i go to
 

5565
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:42,709
change or exchange my currency i go to
the bank

5566
01:25:42,709 --> 01:25:42,719
the bank
 

5567
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:44,470
the bank
or i go get ripped off at the airport

5568
01:25:44,470 --> 01:25:44,480
or i go get ripped off at the airport
 

5569
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:46,149
or i go get ripped off at the airport
right like those are my two options so

5570
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:46,159
right like those are my two options so
 

5571
01:25:46,159 --> 01:25:47,189
right like those are my two options so
it's high friction

5572
01:25:47,189 --> 01:25:47,199
it's high friction
 

5573
01:25:47,199 --> 01:25:49,510
it's high friction
to change between currencies when the

5574
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
to change between currencies when the
 

5575
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:50,550
to change between currencies when the
competition

5576
01:25:50,550 --> 01:25:50,560
competition
 

5577
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,189
competition
of technology is kind of um innovated

5578
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
of technology is kind of um innovated
 

5579
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:54,310
of technology is kind of um innovated
away

5580
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
away
 

5581
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,149
away
now i can get paid in dollars these

5582
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:56,159
now i can get paid in dollars these
 

5583
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,590
now i can get paid in dollars these
digital dollars and with a click of a

5584
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:57,600
digital dollars and with a click of a
 

5585
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,030
digital dollars and with a click of a
button switching to any other currency

5586
01:25:59,030 --> 01:25:59,040
button switching to any other currency
 

5587
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:00,149
button switching to any other currency
in the world

5588
01:26:00,149 --> 01:26:00,159
in the world
 

5589
01:26:00,159 --> 01:26:02,390
in the world
and so what ultimately happens is value

5590
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,400
and so what ultimately happens is value
 

5591
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,629
and so what ultimately happens is value
and liquidity is going to coalesce

5592
01:26:04,629 --> 01:26:04,639
and liquidity is going to coalesce
 

5593
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:05,270
and liquidity is going to coalesce
around

5594
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
around
 

5595
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,669
around
the best monetary policy and so you get

5596
01:26:07,669 --> 01:26:07,679
the best monetary policy and so you get
 

5597
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:08,870
the best monetary policy and so you get
in this very weird world where even if

5598
01:26:08,870 --> 01:26:08,880
in this very weird world where even if
 

5599
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:09,990
in this very weird world where even if
the united states says hey you're gonna

5600
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:10,000
the united states says hey you're gonna
 

5601
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,350
the united states says hey you're gonna
get paid in dollars you have to pay your

5602
01:26:11,350 --> 01:26:11,360
get paid in dollars you have to pay your
 

5603
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:12,470
get paid in dollars you have to pay your
taxes in dollars

5604
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:12,480
taxes in dollars
 

5605
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,990
taxes in dollars
you're gonna start to see people operate

5606
01:26:13,990 --> 01:26:14,000
you're gonna start to see people operate
 

5607
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,669
you're gonna start to see people operate
in a multi-currency environment where

5608
01:26:15,669 --> 01:26:15,679
in a multi-currency environment where
 

5609
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:17,030
in a multi-currency environment where
they say okay i got paid my digital

when you go to a multi-currency world

5622
01:26:28,550 --> 01:26:28,560
when you go to a multi-currency world
 

5623
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:30,070
when you go to a multi-currency world
it's not just about currency

5624
01:26:30,070 --> 01:26:30,080
it's not just about currency
 

5625
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,550
it's not just about currency
it's now multi-asset world because not

5626
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:32,560
it's now multi-asset world because not
 

5627
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:33,669
it's now multi-asset world because not
only is the

5628
01:26:33,669 --> 01:26:33,679
only is the
 

5629
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:36,310
only is the
currency digitized but that same

5630
01:26:36,310 --> 01:26:36,320
currency digitized but that same
 

5631
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,310
currency digitized but that same
technology is used to digitize

5632
01:26:38,310 --> 01:26:38,320
technology is used to digitize
 

5633
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:41,270
technology is used to digitize
stocks bonds and commodities as well and

5634
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:41,280
stocks bonds and commodities as well and
 

5635
01:26:41,280 --> 01:26:42,950
stocks bonds and commodities as well and
so today we live in a very fragmented

5636
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
so today we live in a very fragmented
 

5637
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,470
so today we live in a very fragmented
financial world where basically i have a

5638
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:44,480
financial world where basically i have a
 

5639
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,430
financial world where basically i have a
brokerage account

5640
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,440
brokerage account
 

5641
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:46,950
brokerage account
i have a bank account i may have an

5642
01:26:46,950 --> 01:26:46,960
i have a bank account i may have an
 

5643
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:49,430
i have a bank account i may have an
alternative asset account etc

5644
01:26:49,430 --> 01:26:49,440
alternative asset account etc
 

5645
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,950
alternative asset account etc
when i can put all those assets in a

5646
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:50,960
when i can put all those assets in a
 

5647
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:52,870
when i can put all those assets in a
single digital wallet

5648
01:26:52,870 --> 01:26:52,880
single digital wallet
 

5649
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,669
single digital wallet
and i can then go from asset to asset

5650
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:55,679
and i can then go from asset to asset
 

5651
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,270
and i can then go from asset to asset
without having to go back to a single

5652
01:26:57,270 --> 01:26:57,280
without having to go back to a single
 

5653
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,229
without having to go back to a single
unit of account

5654
01:26:58,229 --> 01:26:58,239
unit of account
 

5655
01:26:58,239 --> 01:27:00,550
unit of account
like frictionless uh going from acid to

5656
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:00,560
like frictionless uh going from acid to
 

5657
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,430
like frictionless uh going from acid to
asset yeah

5658
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
asset yeah
 

5659
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,110
asset yeah
so now what you end up doing is you

5660
01:27:03,110 --> 01:27:03,120
so now what you end up doing is you
 

5661
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,790
so now what you end up doing is you
start to open up the possibility for

5662
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
start to open up the possibility for
 

5663
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:06,950
start to open up the possibility for
machine-to-machine transactions

5664
01:27:06,950 --> 01:27:06,960
machine-to-machine transactions
 

5665
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,669
machine-to-machine transactions
so today if you and i write software

5666
01:27:09,669 --> 01:27:09,679
so today if you and i write software
 

5667
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:11,430
so today if you and i write software
code for two machines to transact with

5668
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
code for two machines to transact with
 

5669
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:12,070
code for two machines to transact with
each other

5670
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:12,080
each other
 

5671
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,910
each other
yeah they can't transact physical

5672
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:13,920
yeah they can't transact physical
 

5673
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,990
yeah they can't transact physical
currency and in many cases they can't

5674
01:27:15,990 --> 01:27:16,000
currency and in many cases they can't
 

5675
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,830
currency and in many cases they can't
actually transact the electronic q-sip

5676
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
actually transact the electronic q-sip
 

5677
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,510
actually transact the electronic q-sip
currencies or assets either

5678
01:27:19,510 --> 01:27:19,520
currencies or assets either
 

5679
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,790
currencies or assets either
because there's too long of a settlement

5680
01:27:20,790 --> 01:27:20,800
because there's too long of a settlement
 

5681
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,709
because there's too long of a settlement
time so you can't get true automation

5682
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:22,719
time so you can't get true automation
 

5683
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:24,149
time so you can't get true automation
right so the whole idea of like the

5684
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:24,159
right so the whole idea of like the
 

5685
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:26,149
right so the whole idea of like the
car's going to drive over a strip in the

5686
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:26,159
car's going to drive over a strip in the
 

5687
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:27,990
car's going to drive over a strip in the
road it's going to pay the toll

5688
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,000
road it's going to pay the toll
 

5689
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,590
road it's going to pay the toll
right well that can't happen right now

5690
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:29,600
right well that can't happen right now
 

5691
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:30,790
right well that can't happen right now
because literally the transaction won't

5692
01:27:30,790 --> 01:27:30,800
because literally the transaction won't
 

5693
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:32,310
because literally the transaction won't
go through right

5694
01:27:32,310 --> 01:27:32,320
go through right
 

5695
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,310
go through right
and so i always joke that like in an

5696
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:34,320
and so i always joke that like in an
 

5697
01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:35,350
and so i always joke that like in an
automated world

5698
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:35,360
automated world
 

5699
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:37,430
automated world
it's like a cd-rom but we're trying to

5700
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
it's like a cd-rom but we're trying to
 

5701
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,110
it's like a cd-rom but we're trying to
take cassette tape player assets and put

5702
01:27:39,110 --> 01:27:39,120
take cassette tape player assets and put
 

5703
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:39,990
take cassette tape player assets and put
it in the cd-rom

5704
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,000
it in the cd-rom
 

5705
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,430
it in the cd-rom
it's just incompatible technology

5706
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
it's just incompatible technology
 

5707
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,910
it's just incompatible technology
references nobody understands at this

5708
01:27:43,910 --> 01:27:43,920
references nobody understands at this
 

5709
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:44,470
references nobody understands at this
point

5710
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:44,480
point
 

5711
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:45,750
point
oh by the way you need to update your

5712
01:27:45,750 --> 01:27:45,760
oh by the way you need to update your
 

5713
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:47,270
oh by the way you need to update your
references i probably do it's like

5714
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:47,280
references i probably do it's like
 

5715
01:27:47,280 --> 01:27:48,870
references i probably do it's like
taking a cd-rom trying to put an mp3

5716
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
taking a cd-rom trying to put an mp3
 

5717
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:49,510
taking a cd-rom trying to put an mp3
player

5718
01:27:49,510 --> 01:27:49,520
player
 

5719
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:52,310
player
into uh streaming but but i think that

5720
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
into uh streaming but but i think that
 

5721
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,189
into uh streaming but but i think that
the reason why that becomes really

5722
01:27:53,189 --> 01:27:53,199
the reason why that becomes really
 

5723
01:27:53,199 --> 01:27:54,550
the reason why that becomes really
interesting is when you start to

5724
01:27:54,550 --> 01:27:54,560
interesting is when you start to
 

5725
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,270
interesting is when you start to
create these digital assets now you open

5726
01:27:57,270 --> 01:27:57,280
create these digital assets now you open
 

5727
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:58,629
create these digital assets now you open
up the world of possibilities

5728
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:58,639
up the world of possibilities
 

5729
01:27:58,639 --> 01:27:59,910
up the world of possibilities
so when new technology is created you

5730
01:27:59,910 --> 01:27:59,920
so when new technology is created you
 

5731
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:01,669
so when new technology is created you
can do two things you can either create

5732
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
can do two things you can either create
 

5733
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,430
can do two things you can either create
new things the world's never seen before

5734
01:28:03,430 --> 01:28:03,440
new things the world's never seen before
 

5735
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:04,950
new things the world's never seen before
or you can use it to improve the old

5736
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:04,960
or you can use it to improve the old
 

5737
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:05,669
or you can use it to improve the old
world

5738
01:28:05,669 --> 01:28:05,679
world
 

5739
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:07,669
world
most people because it's the easiest

5740
01:28:07,669 --> 01:28:07,679
most people because it's the easiest
 

5741
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:08,790
most people because it's the easiest
thing to think about

5742
01:28:08,790 --> 01:28:08,800
thing to think about
 

5743
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,270
thing to think about
want to improve the old world so an

5744
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
want to improve the old world so an
 

5745
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,790
want to improve the old world so an
equivalent of this would be

5746
01:28:12,790 --> 01:28:12,800
equivalent of this would be
 

5747
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:14,790
equivalent of this would be
when the internet came along a media

5748
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:14,800
when the internet came along a media
 

5749
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:16,149
when the internet came along a media
company that had newspapers

5750
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
company that had newspapers
 

5751
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,910
company that had newspapers
would say hey we should take a pdf of

5752
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:17,920
would say hey we should take a pdf of
 

5753
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,270
would say hey we should take a pdf of
the newspaper and we should put it on a

5754
01:28:19,270 --> 01:28:19,280
the newspaper and we should put it on a
 

5755
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:19,990
the newspaper and we should put it on a
website

5756
01:28:19,990 --> 01:28:20,000
website
 

5757
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:21,270
website
and now anyone in the world can go to

5758
01:28:21,270 --> 01:28:21,280
and now anyone in the world can go to
 

5759
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:22,550
and now anyone in the world can go to
this website they can read the newspaper

5760
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:22,560
this website they can read the newspaper
 

5761
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:23,590
this website they can read the newspaper
today

5762
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:23,600
today
 

5763
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,390
today
that was valuable but it missed out on

5764
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:26,400
that was valuable but it missed out on
 

5765
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:28,070
that was valuable but it missed out on
the ability to change headlines

5766
01:28:28,070 --> 01:28:28,080
the ability to change headlines
 

5767
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:30,709
the ability to change headlines
to test to put multimedia to distribute

5768
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
to test to put multimedia to distribute
 

5769
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:31,830
to test to put multimedia to distribute
it differently to

5770
01:28:31,830 --> 01:28:31,840
it differently to
 

5771
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:33,350
it differently to
you know do all kinds of things that

5772
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:33,360
you know do all kinds of things that
 

5773
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:34,870
you know do all kinds of things that
today we understand the internet really

5774
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:34,880
today we understand the internet really
 

5775
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:35,910
today we understand the internet really
empowered

5776
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:35,920
empowered
 

5777
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,430
empowered
and so what i think we're about to watch

5778
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:37,440
and so what i think we're about to watch
 

5779
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:38,870
and so what i think we're about to watch
happen is we're going to digitize the

5780
01:28:38,870 --> 01:28:38,880
happen is we're going to digitize the
 

5781
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:39,430
happen is we're going to digitize the
assets

5782
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
assets
 

5783
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,430
assets
we're going to put them all into these

5784
01:28:41,430 --> 01:28:41,440
we're going to put them all into these
 

5785
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,470
we're going to put them all into these
digital wallets

5786
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
digital wallets
 

5787
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:43,750
digital wallets
you're going to get automated

5788
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:43,760
you're going to get automated
 

5789
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:45,110
you're going to get automated
technologies where machines cannot

5790
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
technologies where machines cannot
 

5791
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,390
technologies where machines cannot
transact with each other

5792
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:46,400
transact with each other
 

5793
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,870
transact with each other
and we're going to do simple things like

5794
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:48,880
and we're going to do simple things like
 

5795
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:50,070
and we're going to do simple things like
why do we pay

5796
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
why do we pay
 

5797
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,270
why do we pay
people once every two weeks why don't we

5798
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:53,280
people once every two weeks why don't we
 

5799
01:28:53,280 --> 01:28:54,709
people once every two weeks why don't we
just pay them at the end of every day

5800
01:28:54,709 --> 01:28:54,719
just pay them at the end of every day
 

5801
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,870
just pay them at the end of every day
or why don't i literally stream payments

5802

almost makes me sad
looking into the future when we'll look

5834
01:29:24,070 --> 01:29:24,080
looking into the future when we'll look
 

5835
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:26,070
looking into the future when we'll look
back at this time it's like

5836
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:26,080
back at this time it's like
 

5837
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,110
back at this time it's like
is how incredibly inefficient

5838
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:29,120
is how incredibly inefficient
 

5839
01:29:29,120 --> 01:29:32,229
is how incredibly inefficient

all this kind of
just the the entirety of the

5852
01:29:43,990 --> 01:29:44,000
just the the entirety of the
 

5853
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,990
just the the entirety of the
transactions is just

5854
01:29:45,990 --> 01:29:46,000
transactions is just
 

5855
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:48,550
transactions is just
like painful almost all transactions are

5856
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:48,560
like painful almost all transactions are

01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:49,430
like painful almost all transactions are
painful

5858
01:29:49,430 --> 01:29:49,440
painful
 

5859
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:51,910
painful
and even and the companies that innovate

5860
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:51,920
and even and the companies that innovate
 

5861
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:52,470
and even and the companies that innovate
to make

5862
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:52,480
to make
 

5863
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:55,510
to make
the transactions a little bit more

5864
01:29:55,510 --> 01:29:55,520
the transactions a little bit more
 

5865
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:57,110
the transactions a little bit more
frictionless like amazon with the

5866
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
frictionless like amazon with the
 

5867
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,709
frictionless like amazon with the
one-click purchase button

5868
01:29:58,709 --> 01:29:58,719
one-click purchase button
 

5869
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:00,709
one-click purchase button
like went out huge but even that's

5870
01:30:00,709 --> 01:30:00,719
like went out huge but even that's
 

5871
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:02,149
like went out huge but even that's
really painful

5872
01:30:02,149 --> 01:30:02,159
really painful
 

5873
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:03,510
really painful
so it's actually really interesting

5874
01:30:03,510 --> 01:30:03,520
so it's actually really interesting
 

5875
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,030
so it's actually really interesting
especially then you start to move that

5876
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:05,040
especially then you start to move that
 

5877
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,709
especially then you start to move that
into the space of data

5878
01:30:06,709 --> 01:30:06,719
into the space of data
 

5879
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:08,070
into the space of data
there's a lot of people thinking about

5880
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,080
there's a lot of people thinking about
 

5881
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,189
there's a lot of people thinking about
privacy and data and like can we put

5882
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:11,199
privacy and data and like can we put
 

5883
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:14,310
privacy and data and like can we put
can we uh like convert data into

5884
01:30:14,310 --> 01:30:14,320
can we uh like convert data into
 

5885
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:17,270
can we uh like convert data into
like money it's just so that you can pay

5886
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:17,280
like money it's just so that you can pay
 

5887
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:19,189
like money it's just so that you can pay
for how much you reveal to the companies

5888
01:30:19,189 --> 01:30:19,199
for how much you reveal to the companies
 

5889
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:20,870
for how much you reveal to the companies
about your own private data that can

5890
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:20,880
about your own private data that can
 

5891
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:22,229
about your own private data that can
then be

5892
01:30:22,229 --> 01:30:22,239
then be
 

5893
01:30:22,239 --> 01:30:24,550
then be
used to assign value to you so you can

5894
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
used to assign value to you so you can
 

5895
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:25,910
used to assign value to you so you can
use a service for free

5896
01:30:25,910 --> 01:30:25,920
use a service for free
 

5897
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,590
use a service for free
if you hand over the data but there's

5898
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:27,600
if you hand over the data but there's
 

5899
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:29,830
if you hand over the data but there's
like explicit transaction going on

5900
01:30:29,830 --> 01:30:29,840
like explicit transaction going on
 

5901
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,669
like explicit transaction going on
so you can empower all those kinds of

5902
01:30:31,669 --> 01:30:31,679
so you can empower all those kinds of
 

5903
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:32,870
so you can empower all those kinds of
things

5904
01:30:32,870 --> 01:30:32,880
things
 

5905
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,350
things
that uh will just like fundamentally

5906
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:35,360
that uh will just like fundamentally
 

5907
01:30:35,360 --> 01:30:36,950

5910
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:38,000
really really exciting
 

5911
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,189
really really exciting
one of one of the most interesting

5912
01:30:39,189 --> 01:30:39,199
one of one of the most interesting
 

5913
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:41,430
one of one of the most interesting
things to me um is i invested in a

5914
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:41,440
things to me um is i invested in a
 

5915
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:42,390
things to me um is i invested in a
company called bridget

5916
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:42,400
company called bridget
 

5917
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:43,830
company called bridget
what they told me was they said eight

5918
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:43,840
what they told me was they said eight
 

5919
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,430
what they told me was they said eight
billion dollars

5920
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:45,440
billion dollars
 

5921
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,870
billion dollars
was paid to the top four banks last year

5922
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
was paid to the top four banks last year
 

5923
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,070
was paid to the top four banks last year
on overdraft fees okay so literally they

5924
01:30:52,070 --> 01:30:52,080
on overdraft fees okay so literally they
 

5925
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:53,270
on overdraft fees okay so literally they
took eight billion dollars from people

5926
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:53,280
took eight billion dollars from people
 

5927
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,470
took eight billion dollars from people
who didn't have money in their bank

5928
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
who didn't have money in their bank
 

5929
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,270
who didn't have money in their bank
account

5930
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:55,280
account
 

5931
01:30:55,280 --> 01:30:57,350
account
right and so when you dig into why is

5932
01:30:57,350 --> 01:30:57,360
right and so when you dig into why is
 

5933
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,790
right and so when you dig into why is
that a lot of times it's not that

5934
01:30:58,790 --> 01:30:58,800
that a lot of times it's not that
 

5935
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,629
that a lot of times it's not that
the people don't have the money it's

5936
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:00,639
the people don't have the money it's
 

5937
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:01,990
the people don't have the money it's
actually a mismatch of

5938
01:31:01,990 --> 01:31:02,000
actually a mismatch of
 

5939
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,910
actually a mismatch of
the payments yeah so what ends up

5940
01:31:03,910 --> 01:31:03,920
the payments yeah so what ends up
 

5941
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,030
the payments yeah so what ends up
happening is you get paid on the first

5942
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
happening is you get paid on the first
 

5943
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:05,830
happening is you get paid on the first
and the 15th

5944
01:31:05,830 --> 01:31:05,840
and the 15th
 

5945
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,229
and the 15th
but on the 12th your netflix bill hits

5946
01:31:08,229 --> 01:31:08,239
but on the 12th your netflix bill hits
 

5947
01:31:08,239 --> 01:31:10,390
but on the 12th your netflix bill hits
on the 13th you went grocery shopping

5948
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:10,400
on the 13th you went grocery shopping
 

5949
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,990
on the 13th you went grocery shopping
and on the 14th your car payments

5950
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:12,000
and on the 14th your car payments
 

5951
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,990
and on the 14th your car payments
hit you overdraft and then on the 15th

5952
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
hit you overdraft and then on the 15th
 

5953
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:14,950
hit you overdraft and then on the 15th
you actually get the check and then

5954
01:31:14,950 --> 01:31:14,960
you actually get the check and then
 

5955
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:15,830
you actually get the check and then
you're able to pay not only the

5956
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:15,840
you're able to pay not only the
 

5957
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,350
you're able to pay not only the
overdraft but for the

5958
01:31:17,350 --> 01:31:17,360
overdraft but for the
 

5959
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:19,669
overdraft but for the
expenses that you have and so something

5960
01:31:19,669 --> 01:31:19,679
expenses that you have and so something
 

5961
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:21,189
expenses that you have and so something

right yeah like that like that's it yeah
 

6029
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:31,590
right yeah like that like that's it yeah
and which is why they use the term

6030
01:32:31,590 --> 01:32:31,600
and which is why they use the term
 

6031
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:33,430
and which is why they use the term
which is why you use the term automation

6032
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:33,440
which is why you use the term automation
 

6033
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:35,030
which is why you use the term automation
which i think is kind of brilliant

6034
01:32:35,030 --> 01:32:35,040
which i think is kind of brilliant
 

6035
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:37,350
which i think is kind of brilliant
uh reframing of all this yeah because

6036
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,360
uh reframing of all this yeah because
 

6037
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:38,070
uh reframing of all this yeah because
ultimately

6038
01:32:38,070 --> 01:32:38,080
ultimately
 

6039
01:32:38,080 --> 01:32:40,310
ultimately
digital technologies are merely the

6040
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:40,320
digital technologies are merely the
 

6041
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,470
digital technologies are merely the
conduit to usher us into that world

6042
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480
conduit to usher us into that world
 

6043
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:45,669
conduit to usher us into that world
yeah and i think the most fascinating

6044
01:32:45,669 --> 01:32:45,679
yeah and i think the most fascinating
 

6045
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:46,070
yeah and i think the most fascinating
part

6046
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:46,080
part
 

6047
01:32:46,080 --> 01:32:49,350
part
of this entire industry is

6048
01:32:49,350 --> 01:32:49,360
of this entire industry is
 

6049
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:52,229
of this entire industry is
people who are trying to figure out now

6050
01:32:52,229 --> 01:32:52,239
people who are trying to figure out now
 

6051
01:32:52,239 --> 01:32:53,270
people who are trying to figure out now
that we're going to have these digital

6052
01:32:53,270 --> 01:32:53,280
that we're going to have these digital
 

6053
01:32:53,280 --> 01:32:54,550
that we're going to have these digital
technologies

6054
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:54,560
technologies
 

6055
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:56,870
technologies
how do we usher in that automated world

6056
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:56,880
how do we usher in that automated world
 

6057
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:57,750
how do we usher in that automated world
faster

6058
01:32:57,750 --> 01:32:57,760
faster
 

6059
01:32:57,760 --> 01:32:59,430
faster
and so there's people who are building

6060
01:32:59,430 --> 01:32:59,440
and so there's people who are building
 

6061
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:01,110
and so there's people who are building
all kinds of incredible things right

6062
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120
all kinds of incredible things right
 

6063
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,149
all kinds of incredible things right
there's literally

6064
01:33:02,149 --> 01:33:02,159
there's literally
 

6065
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,350
there's literally
um some technologies where you can

6066
01:33:05,350 --> 01:33:05,360
um some technologies where you can
 

6067
01:33:05,360 --> 01:33:08,470
um some technologies where you can
stream uh for paying for consumption of

6068
01:33:08,470 --> 01:33:08,480
stream uh for paying for consumption of
 

6069
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:09,270
stream uh for paying for consumption of
content

6070
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:09,280
content
 

6071
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:11,669
content
yeah right there's i saw somebody

6072
01:33:11,669 --> 01:33:11,679
yeah right there's i saw somebody
 

6073
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:13,830
yeah right there's i saw somebody
recently who they basically said hey

6074
01:33:13,830 --> 01:33:13,840
recently who they basically said hey
 

6075
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,470
recently who they basically said hey
i have created something but it's not

6076
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:16,480
i have created something but it's not
 

6077
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:17,510
i have created something but it's not
gonna be released

6078
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:17,520
gonna be released
 

6079
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,430
gonna be released
until everyone and almost like a

6080
01:33:19,430 --> 01:33:19,440
until everyone and almost like a
 

6081
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:20,550
until everyone and almost like a
gofundme type

6082
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:20,560
gofundme type
 

6083
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,270
gofundme type
situation pays for in combination then

6084
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:23,280
situation pays for in combination then
 

6085
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:24,470
situation pays for in combination then
it gets unlocked

6086
01:33:24,470 --> 01:33:24,480
it gets unlocked
 

6087
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:25,669
it gets unlocked
and so when you start to think about

6088
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:25,679
and so when you start to think about
 

6089
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:27,430
and so when you start to think about
this it's not only innovation on the

6090
01:33:27,430 --> 01:33:27,440
this it's not only innovation on the
 

6091
01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:29,669
this it's not only innovation on the
technology front it's innovation around

6092
01:33:29,669 --> 01:33:29,679
technology front it's innovation around
 

6093
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,790
technology front it's innovation around
the way that we form capital it's the

6094
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:32,800
the way that we form capital it's the
 

6095
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,149
the way that we form capital it's the
way that we

6096
01:33:34,149 --> 01:33:34,159
way that we
 

6097
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:35,830
way that we
organize resources it's the way that we

6098
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:35,840
organize resources it's the way that we
 

6099
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:37,990
organize resources it's the way that we
build companies it's the business models

6100
01:33:37,990 --> 01:33:38,000
build companies it's the business models
 

6101
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,590
build companies it's the business models
right it's the application of those

6102
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:39,600
right it's the application of those
 

6103
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:40,470
right it's the application of those
technologies

6104
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
technologies
 

6105
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:43,270
technologies
all that stuff starts to change and go

6106
01:33:43,270 --> 01:33:43,280
all that stuff starts to change and go
 

6107
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:44,070
all that stuff starts to change and go
back to

6108
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:44,080
back to
 

6109
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:48,229
back to
20 uh 2007 is when the iphone came out

6110
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:48,239
20 uh 2007 is when the iphone came out
 

6111
01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:50,229
20 uh 2007 is when the iphone came out
uber wasn't possible right he's going

6112
01:33:50,229 --> 01:33:50,239
uber wasn't possible right he's going
 

6113
01:33:50,239 --> 01:33:51,590
uber wasn't possible right he's going
online like all these companies that

6114
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
online like all these companies that
 

6115
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,350
online like all these companies that
weren't possible before

6116
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:53,360
weren't possible before
 

6117
01:33:53,360 --> 01:33:55,110
weren't possible before
when the digital technologies are kind

6118
01:33:55,110 --> 01:33:55,120
when the digital technologies are kind
 

6119
01:33:55,120 --> 01:33:57,030
when the digital technologies are kind
of adopted on a global scale

6120
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:57,040
of adopted on a global scale
 

6121
01:33:57,040 --> 01:33:59,030
of adopted on a global scale
i think that we all myself included

6122
01:33:59,030 --> 01:33:59,040
i think that we all myself included
 

6123
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:01,510
i think that we all myself included
drastically underestimate how

6124
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:01,520
drastically underestimate how
 

6125
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:04,470
drastically underestimate how
fast and how big innovation can be uh

6126
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,480
fast and how big innovation can be uh
 

6127
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:05,350
fast and how big innovation can be uh
because it's just hard

6128
01:34:05,350 --> 01:34:05,360
because it's just hard
 

6129
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:06,709
because it's just hard
right like like we like to think

6130
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:06,719
right like like we like to think
 

6131
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:07,990
right like like we like to think
linearly and that's not how the world

6132
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:08,000
linearly and that's not how the world
 

6133
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,470
linearly and that's not how the world
works

6134
01:34:08,470 --> 01:34:08,480
works
 

6135
01:34:08,480 --> 01:34:11,510
works
yeah i i do find it kind of interesting

6136
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:11,520
yeah i i do find it kind of interesting
 

6137
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:12,390
yeah i i do find it kind of interesting
uh

6138
01:34:12,390 --> 01:34:12,400
uh
 

6139
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:14,870
uh
it is nft based but uh i i don't think

6140
01:34:14,870 --> 01:34:14,880
it is nft based but uh i i don't think
 

6141
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:15,830
it is nft based but uh i i don't think
it has to be

6142
01:34:15,830 --> 01:34:15,840
it has to be
 

6143
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:19,350
it has to be
this uh this idea of i think

6144
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:19,360
this uh this idea of i think
 

6145
01:34:19,360 --> 01:34:22,550
this uh this idea of i think
big clout it's called or whatever uh the

6146
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,560
big clout it's called or whatever uh the
 

6147
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:24,950
big clout it's called or whatever uh the
idea of sort of investing in individuals

6148
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:24,960
idea of sort of investing in individuals
 

6149
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,629
idea of sort of investing in individuals
it makes me immediately think about

6150
01:34:26,629 --> 01:34:26,639
it makes me immediately think about
 

6151
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:28,229
it makes me immediately think about
investing in

6152
01:34:28,229 --> 01:34:28,239
investing in
 

6153
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:31,590
investing in
ideas so even just the words you speak

6154
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:31,600
ideas so even just the words you speak
 

6155
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:35,270
ideas so even just the words you speak
having value and sort of

6156
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:35,280
having value and sort of
 

6157
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:37,750
having value and sort of
if you have a frictionless like

6158
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:37,760
if you have a frictionless like
 

6159
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:39,110
if you have a frictionless like
automated

6160
01:34:39,110 --> 01:34:39,120
automated
 

6161
01:34:39,120 --> 01:34:41,750
automated
financial system then you could do a

6162
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:41,760
financial system then you could do a
 

6163
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,750
financial system then you could do a
bunch of interesting things about

6164
01:34:43,750 --> 01:34:43,760
bunch of interesting things about
 

6165
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:46,229
bunch of interesting things about
what it means to add value to the world

6166
01:34:46,229 --> 01:34:46,239
what it means to add value to the world
 

6167
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:47,830
what it means to add value to the world
i mean

6168
01:34:47,830 --> 01:34:47,840
i mean
 

6169
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:49,830
i mean
i don't know if bit cloud is currently

6170
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
i don't know if bit cloud is currently
 

6171
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:52,149
i don't know if bit cloud is currently
an efficient representation of that

6172
01:34:52,149 --> 01:34:52,159
an efficient representation of that
 

6173
01:34:52,159 --> 01:34:55,510
an efficient representation of that
but i am truly happy

6174
01:34:55,510 --> 01:34:55,520
but i am truly happy
 

6175
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:59,350
but i am truly happy
that however that thing works

6176
01:34:59,350 --> 01:34:59,360
that however that thing works
 

6177
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:02,629
that however that thing works
i'm just one notch above vladimir putin

6178
01:35:02,629 --> 01:35:02,639
i'm just one notch above vladimir putin
 

6179
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:04,229
i'm just one notch above vladimir putin
which is one of the that's like one of

6180
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:04,239
which is one of the that's like one of
 

6181
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:05,910
which is one of the that's like one of
the bucket list items for me

6182
01:35:05,910 --> 01:35:05,920
the bucket list items for me
 

6183
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,310
the bucket list items for me
to have a list where i'm one notch above

6184
01:35:08,310 --> 01:35:08,320
to have a list where i'm one notch above
 

6185
01:35:08,320 --> 01:35:08,950
to have a list where i'm one notch above
putin

6186
01:35:08,950 --> 01:35:08,960
putin
 

6187
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:10,390
putin
well what i think you're talking about

6188
01:35:10,390 --> 01:35:10,400
well what i think you're talking about
 

6189
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,550
well what i think you're talking about
here is important because there's

6190
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:12,560
here is important because there's
 

6191
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,109
here is important because there's
uh historical examples you could invest

6192
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:15,119
uh historical examples you could invest
 

6193
01:35:15,119 --> 01:35:15,590
uh historical examples you could invest
in

6194
01:35:15,590 --> 01:35:15,600
in
 

6195
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,149
in
a patent in some situations you could

6196
01:35:18,149 --> 01:35:18,159
a patent in some situations you could
 

6197
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:18,790
a patent in some situations you could
invest in

6198
01:35:18,790 --> 01:35:18,800
invest in
 

6199
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,189
invest in
an organization that has an idea right

6200
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:21,199
an organization that has an idea right
 

6201
01:35:21,199 --> 01:35:21,910
an organization that has an idea right
so these are

6202
01:35:21,910 --> 01:35:21,920
so these are
 

6203
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:23,990
so these are
super inefficient given kind of the

6204
01:35:23,990 --> 01:35:24,000
super inefficient given kind of the
 

6205
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:25,270
super inefficient given kind of the
vision that you're painting in terms of

6206
01:35:25,270 --> 01:35:25,280
vision that you're painting in terms of
 

6207
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,709
vision that you're painting in terms of
like investing directly in an idea in a

6208
01:35:26,709 --> 01:35:26,719
like investing directly in an idea in a
 

6209
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:28,870
like investing directly in an idea in a
super efficient automated fashion

6210
01:35:28,870 --> 01:35:28,880
super efficient automated fashion
 

6211
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,030
super efficient automated fashion
but that's how the technology evolution

6212
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:31,040
but that's how the technology evolution
 

6213
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,910
but that's how the technology evolution
works right

6214
01:35:31,910 --> 01:35:31,920
works right
 

6215
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:34,149
works right
is it's really hard to do it first and

6216
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:34,159
is it's really hard to do it first and
 

6217
01:35:34,159 --> 01:35:35,910
is it's really hard to do it first and
then slowly kind of becomes easier and

6218
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:35,920
then slowly kind of becomes easier and
 

6219
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:37,030
then slowly kind of becomes easier and
easier as technology

6220
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
easier as technology
 

6221
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,270
easier as technology
uh is more prevalent the other thing

6222
01:35:39,270 --> 01:35:39,280
uh is more prevalent the other thing
 

6223
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,229
uh is more prevalent the other thing
that i think is interesting is this

6224
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:40,239
that i think is interesting is this
 

6225
01:35:40,239 --> 01:35:42,070
that i think is interesting is this
whole idea of investing in people

6226
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:42,080
whole idea of investing in people
 

6227
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:43,910
whole idea of investing in people
if you really think about the

6228
01:35:43,910 --> 01:35:43,920
if you really think about the
 

6229
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,750
if you really think about the
origination of that is i would hire

6230
01:35:45,750 --> 01:35:45,760
origination of that is i would hire
 

6231
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:46,950
origination of that is i would hire
somebody

6232
01:35:46,950 --> 01:35:46,960
somebody
 

6233
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,030
somebody
right i pay you money and then you're

6234
01:35:49,030 --> 01:35:49,040
right i pay you money and then you're
 

6235
01:35:49,040 --> 01:35:50,229
right i pay you money and then you're
going to create production

6236
01:35:50,229 --> 01:35:50,239
going to create production
 

6237
01:35:50,239 --> 01:35:51,990
going to create production
but i take the lion's share and you

6238
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:52,000
but i take the lion's share and you
 

6239
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,310
but i take the lion's share and you
don't now there's things like

6240
01:35:54,310 --> 01:35:54,320
don't now there's things like
 

6241
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,470
don't now there's things like
these isas these income sharing

6242
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:56,480
these isas these income sharing
 

6243
01:35:56,480 --> 01:35:58,470
these isas these income sharing
agreements where basically i will

6244
01:35:58,470 --> 01:35:58,480
agreements where basically i will
 

6245
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,229
agreements where basically i will
educate you on something train you on

6246
01:36:00,229 --> 01:36:00,239
educate you on something train you on
 

6247
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:02,709
educate you on something train you on
something i'll put up capital

6248
01:36:02,709 --> 01:36:02,719
something i'll put up capital
 

6249
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:04,470
something i'll put up capital
right and then over time you'll pay me

6250
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
right and then over time you'll pay me
 

6251
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,470
right and then over time you'll pay me
back plus profits

6252
01:36:06,470 --> 01:36:06,480
back plus profits
 

6253
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,030
back plus profits
as some version eventually i don't know

6254
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,040
as some version eventually i don't know
 

6255
01:36:09,040 --> 01:36:10,310
as some version eventually i don't know
what it looks like

6256
01:36:10,310 --> 01:36:10,320
what it looks like
 

6257
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:13,430
what it looks like
but being able to get upside in

6258
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
but being able to get upside in
 

6259
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,109
but being able to get upside in
somebody's success

6260
01:36:15,109 --> 01:36:15,119
somebody's success
 

6261
01:36:15,119 --> 01:36:17,350
somebody's success
for having risk capital early on doesn't

6262
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
for having risk capital early on doesn't
 

6263
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:18,790
for having risk capital early on doesn't
seem that far off

6264
01:36:18,790 --> 01:36:18,800
seem that far off
 

6265
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:20,470
seem that far off
seen in professional sports you see it

6266
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:20,480
seen in professional sports you see it
 

6267
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,310
seen in professional sports you see it
in you know a lot of these things and so

6268
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
in you know a lot of these things and so
 

6269
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:25,189
in you know a lot of these things and so
i just think that a lot of um the focus

6270
01:36:25,189 --> 01:36:25,199
i just think that a lot of um the focus
 

6271
01:36:25,199 --> 01:36:25,830
i just think that a lot of um the focus
right now

6272
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:25,840
right now
 

6273
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:28,790
right now
is on the technology but ultimately

6274
01:36:28,790 --> 01:36:28,800
is on the technology but ultimately
 

6275
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:30,149
is on the technology but ultimately
these are

6276
01:36:30,149 --> 01:36:30,159
these are
 

6277
01:36:30,159 --> 01:36:32,629
these are
ideas that are very old and have had

6278
01:36:32,629 --> 01:36:32,639
ideas that are very old and have had
 

6279
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:34,390
ideas that are very old and have had
lots of success and traction and we're

6280
01:36:34,390 --> 01:36:34,400
lots of success and traction and we're
 

6281
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,070
lots of success and traction and we're
just merely standing in the way of the

6282
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:36,080
just merely standing in the way of the
 

6283
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:38,310
just merely standing in the way of the
evolution of these ideas with new

6284
01:36:38,310 --> 01:36:38,320
evolution of these ideas with new
 

6285
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:39,990
evolution of these ideas with new
technology and so

6286
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:40,000
technology and so
 

6287
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,830
technology and so
uh it's easy to get caught up in the

6288
01:36:41,830 --> 01:36:41,840
uh it's easy to get caught up in the
 

6289
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,590
uh it's easy to get caught up in the
technology but when you really zoom out

6290
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:43,600
technology but when you really zoom out
 

6291
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:44,550
technology but when you really zoom out
and look at it from the

6292
01:36:44,550 --> 01:36:44,560
and look at it from the
 

6293
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:46,550
and look at it from the
ideological standpoint and kind of the

6294
01:36:46,550 --> 01:36:46,560
ideological standpoint and kind of the
 

6295
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:48,229
ideological standpoint and kind of the
the progress of humanity

6296
01:36:48,229 --> 01:36:48,239
the progress of humanity
 

6297
01:36:48,239 --> 01:36:49,750
the progress of humanity
it's a foregone conclusion this stuff's

6298
01:36:49,750 --> 01:36:49,760
it's a foregone conclusion this stuff's
 

6299
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,669
it's a foregone conclusion this stuff's
going to happen it's just how

6300
01:36:51,669 --> 01:36:51,679
going to happen it's just how
 

6301
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:53,350
going to happen it's just how
i think the world is waiting and some of

6302
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:53,360
i think the world is waiting and some of
 

6303
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:55,590
i think the world is waiting and some of
us are trying to create

6304
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:55,600
us are trying to create
 

6305
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:57,510
us are trying to create
that future world which is like what are

6306
01:36:57,510 --> 01:36:57,520
that future world which is like what are
 

6307
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,350
that future world which is like what are
the applications of this technology that

6308
01:36:59,350 --> 01:36:59,360
the applications of this technology that
 

6309
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:00,950
the applications of this technology that
will transform the world

6310
01:37:00,950 --> 01:37:00,960
will transform the world
 

6311
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:03,590
will transform the world
and then you know i hate the term but

6312
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600
and then you know i hate the term but
 

6313
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,109
and then you know i hate the term but
killer apps like

6314
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:05,119
killer apps like
 

6315
01:37:05,119 --> 01:37:07,910
killer apps like
cool ideas that are implemented

6316
01:37:07,910 --> 01:37:07,920
cool ideas that are implemented
 

6317
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,750
cool ideas that are implemented
effectively at scale to transform the

6318
01:37:09,750 --> 01:37:09,760
effectively at scale to transform the
 

6319
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:11,510
effectively at scale to transform the
world there's been

6320
01:37:11,510 --> 01:37:11,520
world there's been
 

6321
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:13,510
world there's been
there's been a lot of different ideas

6322
01:37:13,510 --> 01:37:13,520
there's been a lot of different ideas
 

6323
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:14,709
there's been a lot of different ideas
popping up

6324
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
popping up
 

6325
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:16,470
popping up
like the there's a lot of ideas about

6326
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:16,480
like the there's a lot of ideas about
 

6327
01:37:16,480 --> 01:37:18,390
like the there's a lot of ideas about
social networks that are built on top of

6328
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:18,400
social networks that are built on top of
 

6329
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,669
social networks that are built on top of
the technology and all that kind of

6330
01:37:19,669 --> 01:37:19,679
the technology and all that kind of
 

6331
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:20,550
the technology and all that kind of
stuff

6332
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:20,560
stuff
 

6333
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:23,030
stuff
so but let me actually uh drag us back

6334
01:37:23,030 --> 01:37:23,040
so but let me actually uh drag us back
 

6335
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,550
so but let me actually uh drag us back
down to something basic

6336
01:37:24,550 --> 01:37:24,560
down to something basic
 

6337
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:29,109
down to something basic
if a person wanted to buy bitcoin

6338
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:29,119
if a person wanted to buy bitcoin
 

6339
01:37:29,119 --> 01:37:33,910
if a person wanted to buy bitcoin
store bitcoin how do they actually do it

6340
01:37:33,910 --> 01:37:33,920
store bitcoin how do they actually do it
 

6341
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:34,629
store bitcoin how do they actually do it
yeah

6342
01:37:34,629 --> 01:37:34,639
yeah
 

6343
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:36,390
yeah
so there's a couple of different ways to

6344
01:37:36,390 --> 01:37:36,400
so there's a couple of different ways to
 

6345
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,470
so there's a couple of different ways to
kind of uh acquire bitcoin

6346
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
kind of uh acquire bitcoin
 

6347
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,109
kind of uh acquire bitcoin
and in every way you've got to exchange

6348
01:37:41,109 --> 01:37:41,119
and in every way you've got to exchange
 

6349
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:42,390
and in every way you've got to exchange
some form of value

6350
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
some form of value
 

6351
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,470
some form of value
for bitcoin right which is part of why

6352
01:37:44,470 --> 01:37:44,480
for bitcoin right which is part of why
 

6353
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:45,910
for bitcoin right which is part of why
it has values because you're giving up

6354
01:37:45,910 --> 01:37:45,920
it has values because you're giving up
 

6355
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:46,470
it has values because you're giving up
value

6356
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:46,480
value
 

6357
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:50,790
value
so um in one way is to exchange

6358
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
so um in one way is to exchange
 

6359
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,070
so um in one way is to exchange
uh energy and computational power

6360
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:54,080
uh energy and computational power
 

6361
01:37:54,080 --> 01:37:56,229
uh energy and computational power
for bitcoin so you can mine it you can

6362
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:56,239
for bitcoin so you can mine it you can
 

6363
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:57,109
for bitcoin so you can mine it you can
literally take

6364
01:37:57,109 --> 01:37:57,119
literally take
 

6365
01:37:57,119 --> 01:37:59,350
literally take
uh computer power that you have you can

6366
01:37:59,350 --> 01:37:59,360
uh computer power that you have you can
 

6367
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,109
uh computer power that you have you can
rent it to the network

6368
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:01,119
rent it to the network
 

6369
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,109
rent it to the network
uh and run that software and then it

6370
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:03,119
uh and run that software and then it
 

6371
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:04,149
uh and run that software and then it
will pay you

6372
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:04,159
will pay you
 

6373
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,030
will pay you
a portion of the kind of daily revenue

6374
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,040
a portion of the kind of daily revenue
 

6375
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:08,470
a portion of the kind of daily revenue
uh off that system

6376
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
uh off that system
 

6377
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,990
uh off that system
you can acquire bitcoin in exchange for

6378
01:38:09,990 --> 01:38:10,000
you can acquire bitcoin in exchange for
 

6379
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,550

6448
01:39:20,790 --> 01:39:20,800
just like you would earn in a
 

6449
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:21,990
just like you would earn in a
traditional account but

6450
01:39:21,990 --> 01:39:22,000
traditional account but
 

6451
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:23,270
traditional account but
higher levels of interest because it's

6452
01:39:23,270 --> 01:39:23,280
higher levels of interest because it's
 

6453
01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:25,990
higher levels of interest because it's
this new thing or you can withdraw

6454
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,000
this new thing or you can withdraw
 

6455
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,229
this new thing or you can withdraw
it and you can put it into cold storage

6456
01:39:28,229 --> 01:39:28,239
it and you can put it into cold storage
 

6457
01:39:28,239 --> 01:39:29,830
it and you can put it into cold storage
on a hardware device you can leave it in

6458
01:39:29,830 --> 01:39:29,840
on a hardware device you can leave it in
 

6459
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:30,870
on a hardware device you can leave it in
a software wall there's kind of all

6460
01:39:30,870 --> 01:39:30,880
a software wall there's kind of all
 

6461
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,229
a software wall there's kind of all
these storage options

6462
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:32,239
these storage options
 

6463
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:33,830
these storage options
uh so block file is you know kind of the

6464
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:33,840
uh so block file is you know kind of the
 

6465
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,270
uh so block file is you know kind of the
one that i'm biased towards because

6466
01:39:35,270 --> 01:39:35,280
one that i'm biased towards because
 

6467
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:37,189
one that i'm biased towards because
so block files or sorry to interrupt uh

6468
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:37,199
so block files or sorry to interrupt uh
 

6469
01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:38,310
so block files or sorry to interrupt uh
so the block fi

6470
01:39:38,310 --> 01:39:38,320
so the block fi
 

6471
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:41,510
so the block fi
is is uh bitcoin only or is it an

6472
01:39:41,510 --> 01:39:41,520
is is uh bitcoin only or is it an
 

6473
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:42,229
is is uh bitcoin only or is it an
exchange with the

6474
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
exchange with the
 

6475
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,189
exchange with the
other crypto it's got a bunch of

6476
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,199
other crypto it's got a bunch of
 

6477
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:44,709
other crypto it's got a bunch of
different ones yeah they basically are

6478
01:39:44,709 --> 01:39:44,719
different ones yeah they basically are
 

6479
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:45,430
different ones yeah they basically are
agnostic

6480
01:39:45,430 --> 01:39:45,440
agnostic
 

6481
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:48,470
agnostic
to what it is um but they provide uh

6482
01:39:48,470 --> 01:39:48,480
to what it is um but they provide uh
 

6483
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:49,510
to what it is um but they provide uh
kind of financial

6484
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:49,520
kind of financial
 

6485
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:51,510
kind of financial
you know products to crypto investors

6486
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:51,520
you know products to crypto investors
 

6487
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:53,270
you know products to crypto investors
okay so you mentioned a few

6488
01:39:53,270 --> 01:39:53,280
okay so you mentioned a few
 

6489
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:54,790
okay so you mentioned a few
interesting ideas that'd be nice for

6490
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:54,800
interesting ideas that'd be nice for
 

6491
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:56,950
interesting ideas that'd be nice for
people who would not be familiar

6492
01:39:56,950 --> 01:39:56,960
people who would not be familiar
 

6493
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:00,070
people who would not be familiar
with it uh cold storage hot storage uh

6494
01:40:00,070 --> 01:40:00,080
with it uh cold storage hot storage uh
 

6495
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,669
with it uh cold storage hot storage uh
what does that mean so like

6496
01:40:01,669 --> 01:40:01,679
what does that mean so like
 

6497
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:04,629
what does that mean so like
i go to a website and i convert dollars

6498
01:40:04,629 --> 01:40:04,639
i go to a website and i convert dollars
 

6499
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:06,070
i go to a website and i convert dollars
to bitcoin

6500
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:06,080
to bitcoin
 

6501
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,070
to bitcoin
that's the kind of storage that's like

6502
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
that's the kind of storage that's like
 

6503
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,669
that's the kind of storage that's like
online banking

6504
01:40:09,669 --> 01:40:09,679
online banking
 

6505
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:12,950
online banking
right what else is there

6506
01:40:12,950 --> 01:40:12,960
right what else is there
 

6507
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:14,310
right what else is there
so there's a couple of different things

6508
01:40:14,310 --> 01:40:14,320
so there's a couple of different things
 

6509
01:40:14,320 --> 01:40:15,830
so there's a couple of different things
that you can do right and let's use the

6510
01:40:15,830 --> 01:40:15,840
that you can do right and let's use the
 

6511
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:18,229
that you can do right and let's use the
legacy system as kind of an example so

6512
01:40:18,229 --> 01:40:18,239
legacy system as kind of an example so
 

6513
01:40:18,239 --> 01:40:22,070
legacy system as kind of an example so
if i want to um get currency

6514
01:40:22,070 --> 01:40:22,080
if i want to um get currency
 

6515
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,310
if i want to um get currency
and i put in my bank account it sits

6516
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:24,320
and i put in my bank account it sits
 

6517
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:26,629
and i put in my bank account it sits
there i have to trust that the bank

6518
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:26,639
there i have to trust that the bank
 

6519
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,430
there i have to trust that the bank
doesn't go under nobody steals it all

6520
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,440
doesn't go under nobody steals it all
 

6521
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,030
doesn't go under nobody steals it all
this kind of stuff there's insurance for

6522
01:40:31,030 --> 01:40:31,040
this kind of stuff there's insurance for
 

6523
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:31,430
this kind of stuff there's insurance for
it right

6524
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:31,440
it right
 

6525
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:32,629
it right
there's all these kind of benefits in

6526
01:40:32,629 --> 01:40:32,639
there's all these kind of benefits in
 

6527
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:34,629
there's all these kind of benefits in
the legacy system to make sure that as

6528
01:40:34,629 --> 01:40:34,639
the legacy system to make sure that as
 

6529
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:35,590
the legacy system to make sure that as
long as i don't have

6530
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
long as i don't have
 

6531
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:36,870
long as i don't have
millions and millions of dollars there

6532
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:36,880
millions and millions of dollars there
 

6533
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:38,310
millions and millions of dollars there
i'm going to be protected pretty much if

6534
01:40:38,310 --> 01:40:38,320
i'm going to be protected pretty much if
 

6535
01:40:38,320 --> 01:40:39,430
i'm going to be protected pretty much if
anything happens

6536
01:40:39,430 --> 01:40:39,440
anything happens
 

6537
01:40:39,440 --> 01:40:42,550
anything happens
through fdic insurance if

6538
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:42,560
through fdic insurance if
 

6539
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,390
through fdic insurance if
i want to do that i'm taking that

6540
01:40:44,390 --> 01:40:44,400
i want to do that i'm taking that
 

6541
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:45,669
i want to do that i'm taking that
counterparty risk though

6542
01:40:45,669 --> 01:40:45,679
counterparty risk though
 

6543
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:46,870
counterparty risk though
so it's mitigated but there's still

6544
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:46,880
so it's mitigated but there's still
 

6545
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,470
so it's mitigated but there's still
counterparty risk i'm counting on that

6546
01:40:48,470 --> 01:40:48,480
counterparty risk i'm counting on that
 

6547
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:49,030
counterparty risk i'm counting on that
bank

6548
01:40:49,030 --> 01:40:49,040
bank
 

6549
01:40:49,040 --> 01:40:50,709
bank
but it is easier to move it around right

6550
01:40:50,709 --> 01:40:50,719
but it is easier to move it around right
 

6551
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:51,750
but it is easier to move it around right
if all of a sudden you call me up and

6552
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:51,760
if all of a sudden you call me up and
 

6553
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,270
if all of a sudden you call me up and
say hey send me some money i can press a

6554
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:53,280
say hey send me some money i can press a
 

6555
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,550
say hey send me some money i can press a
couple buttons on my computer

6556
01:40:54,550 --> 01:40:54,560
couple buttons on my computer
 

6557
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:56,950
couple buttons on my computer
and it'll send it to you if i want

6558
01:40:56,950 --> 01:40:56,960
and it'll send it to you if i want
 

6559
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:58,550
and it'll send it to you if i want
deeper level of security

6560
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:58,560
deeper level of security
 

6561
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:00,629
deeper level of security
i can go and i can get the physical

6562
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:00,639
i can go and i can get the physical
 

6563
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,709
i can go and i can get the physical
dollars and i can go and i can

6564
01:41:02,709 --> 01:41:02,719
dollars and i can go and i can
 

6565
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:04,950
dollars and i can go and i can
you know put under my mattress right and

6566
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:04,960
you know put under my mattress right and
 

6567
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:06,229
you know put under my mattress right and
i can say you know what

6568
01:41:06,229 --> 01:41:06,239
i can say you know what
 

6569
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:07,750
i can say you know what
it's not gonna be as easy to send it to

6570
01:41:07,750 --> 01:41:07,760
it's not gonna be as easy to send it to
 

6571
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:09,750
it's not gonna be as easy to send it to
you immediately but if i really want to

6572
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:09,760
you immediately but if i really want to
 

6573
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,390
you immediately but if i really want to
i can go

6574
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
i can go
 

6575
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,830
i can go
underneath my mattress pretty quickly i

6576
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:11,840
underneath my mattress pretty quickly i
 

6577
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,430
underneath my mattress pretty quickly i
can grab it i can get it back to the

6578
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
can grab it i can get it back to the
 

6579
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,750
can grab it i can get it back to the
bank and then i can send you the money

6580
01:41:15,750 --> 01:41:15,760
bank and then i can send you the money
 

6581
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:16,870
bank and then i can send you the money
the third thing i could do is i could

6582
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
the third thing i could do is i could
 

6583
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,310
the third thing i could do is i could
basically take those physical dollars

6584
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:18,320
basically take those physical dollars
 

6585
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,830
basically take those physical dollars
out of the bank and i could go and i

6586
01:41:19,830 --> 01:41:19,840
out of the bank and i could go and i
 

6587
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:21,270
out of the bank and i could go and i
could go put it literally

6588
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:21,280
could go put it literally
 

6589
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,109
could go put it literally
uh you know in a vault somewhere that i

6590
01:41:23,109 --> 01:41:23,119
uh you know in a vault somewhere that i
 

6591
01:41:23,119 --> 01:41:24,950
uh you know in a vault somewhere that i
don't have control over that's behind 10

6592
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:24,960
don't have control over that's behind 10
 

6593
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:25,830
don't have control over that's behind 10
passwords

6594
01:41:25,830 --> 01:41:25,840
passwords
 

6595
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:27,830
passwords
uh and biometric scanning and like it's

6596
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:27,840
uh and biometric scanning and like it's
 

6597
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:29,350
uh and biometric scanning and like it's
really difficult to even get to it yeah

6598
01:41:29,350 --> 01:41:29,360
really difficult to even get to it yeah
 

6599
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:30,070
really difficult to even get to it yeah
right

6600
01:41:30,070 --> 01:41:30,080
right
 

6601
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,350
right
so if you almost look at it as like

6602
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:31,360
so if you almost look at it as like
 

6603
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,510
so if you almost look at it as like
there's three stages of security that

6604
01:41:33,510 --> 01:41:33,520
there's three stages of security that
 

6605
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,109
there's three stages of security that
you could have in the traditional world

6606
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:35,119
you could have in the traditional world
 

6607
01:41:35,119 --> 01:41:36,870
you could have in the traditional world
the same thing is true in bitcoin so you

6608
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:36,880
the same thing is true in bitcoin so you
 

6609
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:38,470
the same thing is true in bitcoin so you
could buy bitcoin on any exchange you

6610
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:38,480
could buy bitcoin on any exchange you
 

6611
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:39,669
could buy bitcoin on any exchange you
could do it on wi-fi but you also can do

6612
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:39,679
could do it on wi-fi but you also can do
 

6613
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:41,669
could do it on wi-fi but you also can do
it on places like coinbase gemini

6614
01:41:41,669 --> 01:41:41,679
it on places like coinbase gemini
 

6615
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,950
it on places like coinbase gemini
kraken etc also cash app

6616
01:41:44,950 --> 01:41:44,960
kraken etc also cash app
 

6617
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,590
kraken etc also cash app
cash app you can do that i think i i

6618
01:41:47,590 --> 01:41:47,600
cash app you can do that i think i i
 

6619
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:48,149
cash app you can do that i think i i
think there's

6620
01:41:48,149 --> 01:41:48,159
think there's
 

6621
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:50,950
think there's
still sponsoring this podcast i'm not

6622
01:41:50,950 --> 01:41:50,960
still sponsoring this podcast i'm not
 

6623
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:52,070
still sponsoring this podcast i'm not
biased at all

6624
01:41:52,070 --> 01:41:52,080
biased at all
 

6625
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:54,870
biased at all
so once you get bitcoin on any of these

6626
01:41:54,870 --> 01:41:54,880
so once you get bitcoin on any of these
 

6627
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:55,750
so once you get bitcoin on any of these
uh venues

6628
01:41:55,750 --> 01:41:55,760
uh venues
 

6629
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:58,790
uh venues
uh you can leave it there on that venue

6630
01:41:58,790 --> 01:41:58,800
uh you can leave it there on that venue
 

6631
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,510
uh you can leave it there on that venue
now the trade-off is you're taking

6632
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:01,520
now the trade-off is you're taking
 

6633
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,430
now the trade-off is you're taking
counterparty risk so somebody else

6634
01:42:03,430 --> 01:42:03,440
counterparty risk so somebody else
 

6635
01:42:03,440 --> 01:42:05,030
counterparty risk so somebody else
is responsible for the security and the

6636
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:05,040
is responsible for the security and the
 

6637
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:06,550
is responsible for the security and the
protection of it uh

6638
01:42:06,550 --> 01:42:06,560
protection of it uh
 

6639
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:09,030
protection of it uh
in many cases big well-known companies

6640
01:42:09,030 --> 01:42:09,040
in many cases big well-known companies
 

6641
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:09,990
in many cases big well-known companies
who have billions and billions of

6642
01:42:09,990 --> 01:42:10,000
who have billions and billions of
 

6643
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,109
who have billions and billions of
dollars of assets

6644
01:42:11,109 --> 01:42:11,119
dollars of assets
 

6645
01:42:11,119 --> 01:42:12,470
dollars of assets
they have higher levels of security

6646
01:42:12,470 --> 01:42:12,480
they have higher levels of security
 

6647
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:13,830
they have higher levels of security
that's why they're well known that's why

6648
01:42:13,830 --> 01:42:13,840
that's why they're well known that's why
 

6649
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:15,109
that's why they're well known that's why
people trust them whatever but you are

6650
01:42:15,109 --> 01:42:15,119
people trust them whatever but you are
 

6651
01:42:15,119 --> 01:42:17,189
people trust them whatever but you are
taking counterparty risk

6652
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:17,199
taking counterparty risk
 

6653
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:19,270
taking counterparty risk
it is easier to quickly send to somebody

6654
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,280
it is easier to quickly send to somebody
 

6655
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,030
it is easier to quickly send to somebody
so this so the trade-off of like ease of

6656
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:21,040
so this so the trade-off of like ease of
 

6657
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:21,669
so this so the trade-off of like ease of
use

6658
01:42:21,669 --> 01:42:21,679
use
 

6659
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:23,510
use
uh but counterparty risk is big and in

6660
01:42:23,510 --> 01:42:23,520
uh but counterparty risk is big and in
 

6661
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,109
uh but counterparty risk is big and in
the bitcoin community specifically

6662
01:42:25,109 --> 01:42:25,119
the bitcoin community specifically
 

6663
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,750
the bitcoin community specifically
this is a huge thing of uh they really

6664
01:42:27,750 --> 01:42:27,760
this is a huge thing of uh they really
 

6665
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:28,790
this is a huge thing of uh they really
really have a cape for

6666
01:42:28,790 --> 01:42:28,800
really have a cape for
 

6667
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,870
really have a cape for
not leaving the bitcoin there right for

6668
01:42:30,870 --> 01:42:30,880
not leaving the bitcoin there right for
 

6669
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:32,629
not leaving the bitcoin there right for
the obvious counter priority

6670
01:42:32,629 --> 01:42:32,639
the obvious counter priority
 

6671
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:33,990
the obvious counter priority
the second thing you can do is you can

6672
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,000
the second thing you can do is you can
 

6673
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,550
the second thing you can do is you can
basically get it off of an exchange and

6674
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
basically get it off of an exchange and
 

6675
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:37,669
basically get it off of an exchange and
you can put it in

6676
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:37,679
you can put it in
 

6677
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:39,030
you can put it in
some level of kind of what i'll call a

6678
01:42:39,030 --> 01:42:39,040
some level of kind of what i'll call a
 

6679
01:42:39,040 --> 01:42:41,030
some level of kind of what i'll call a
second layer of storage that second

6680
01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:41,040
second layer of storage that second
 

6681
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:41,990
second layer of storage that second
layer storage could be

6682
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
layer storage could be
 

6683
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,669
layer storage could be
a hardware device that you can quickly

6684
01:42:43,669 --> 01:42:43,679
a hardware device that you can quickly
 

6685
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:45,030
a hardware device that you can quickly
just you know grab off your desk and

6686
01:42:45,030 --> 01:42:45,040
just you know grab off your desk and
 

6687
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:46,709
just you know grab off your desk and
plug into your computer and immediately

6688
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:46,719
plug into your computer and immediately
 

6689
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:47,830
plug into your computer and immediately
use that's what they call like a

6690
01:42:47,830 --> 01:42:47,840
use that's what they call like a
 

6691
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:48,390
use that's what they call like a
hardware

6692
01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:48,400
hardware
 

6693
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:50,310
hardware
hardware wallet yep or you can have some

6694
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:50,320
hardware wallet yep or you can have some
 

6695
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:51,830
hardware wallet yep or you can have some
sort of software wallet right where it's

6696
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:51,840
sort of software wallet right where it's
 

6697
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:52,310
sort of software wallet right where it's
not on

6698
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:52,320
not on
 

6699
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:54,550
not on
an exchange but there is some level of

6700
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:54,560
an exchange but there is some level of
 

6701
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:56,229
an exchange but there is some level of
uh in between between the hardware

6702
01:42:56,229 --> 01:42:56,239
uh in between between the hardware
 

6703
01:42:56,239 --> 01:42:58,229
uh in between between the hardware
wallet and the exchange in this software

6704
01:42:58,229 --> 01:42:58,239
wallet and the exchange in this software
 

6705
01:42:58,239 --> 01:42:59,669
wallet and the exchange in this software
wallet but the software wallet is

6706
01:42:59,669 --> 01:42:59,679
wallet but the software wallet is
 

6707
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,270
wallet but the software wallet is
connected to the internet yeah

6708
01:43:01,270 --> 01:43:01,280
connected to the internet yeah
 

6709
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:03,510
connected to the internet yeah
and so um if you kind of think of it as

6710
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:03,520
and so um if you kind of think of it as
 

6711
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,629
and so um if you kind of think of it as
like the exchange

6712
01:43:04,629 --> 01:43:04,639
like the exchange
 

6713
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:06,790
like the exchange
software wallet hardware wallet and then

6714
01:43:06,790 --> 01:43:06,800
software wallet hardware wallet and then
 

6715
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:08,390
software wallet hardware wallet and then
there's something called deep storage

6716
01:43:08,390 --> 01:43:08,400
there's something called deep storage
 

6717
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:10,870
there's something called deep storage
right or cold storage um and this is you

6718
01:43:10,870 --> 01:43:10,880
right or cold storage um and this is you
 

6719
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:12,390
right or cold storage um and this is you
know literally there was a

6720
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:12,400
know literally there was a
 

6721
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:15,510
know literally there was a
a company uh called zappo that uh would

6722
01:43:15,510 --> 01:43:15,520
a company uh called zappo that uh would
 

6723
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:17,350
a company uh called zappo that uh would
put things in deep cold storage

6724
01:43:17,350 --> 01:43:17,360
put things in deep cold storage
 

6725
01:43:17,360 --> 01:43:19,109
put things in deep cold storage
and it was literally buried in a

6726
01:43:19,109 --> 01:43:19,119
and it was literally buried in a
 

6727
01:43:19,119 --> 01:43:20,390
and it was literally buried in a
mountain

6728
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:20,400
mountain
 

6729
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,629
mountain
right so like the odds that somebody's

6730
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:22,639
right so like the odds that somebody's
 

6731
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:24,229
right so like the odds that somebody's
physically gonna go there there's armed

6732
01:43:24,229 --> 01:43:24,239
physically gonna go there there's armed
 

6733
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,830
physically gonna go there there's armed
guards there's you know kind of all this

6734
01:43:25,830 --> 01:43:25,840
guards there's you know kind of all this
 

6735
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:26,870
guards there's you know kind of all this
type of stuff

6736
01:43:26,870 --> 01:43:26,880
type of stuff
 

6737
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:28,149
type of stuff
but again you're taking some level of

6738
01:43:28,149 --> 01:43:28,159
but again you're taking some level of
 

6739
01:43:28,159 --> 01:43:29,830
but again you're taking some level of
counterparty risk because they have your

6740
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
counterparty risk because they have your
 

6741
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:30,550
counterparty risk because they have your
bitcoin

6742
01:43:30,550 --> 01:43:30,560
bitcoin
 

6743
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,590
bitcoin
and so the saying or the phrase uh is

6744
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:33,600
and so the saying or the phrase uh is
 

6745
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:37,030
and so the saying or the phrase uh is
not your keys not your coins uh whereas

6746
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,040
not your keys not your coins uh whereas
 

6747
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,629
not your keys not your coins uh whereas
my buddy isaiah jackson came up with

6748
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:38,639
my buddy isaiah jackson came up with
 

6749
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:40,070
my buddy isaiah jackson came up with
these said uh uh

6750
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:40,080
these said uh uh
 

6751
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:42,390
these said uh uh
not your keys not your cheese right in

6752
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:42,400
not your keys not your cheese right in
 

6753
01:43:42,400 --> 01:43:43,510
not your keys not your cheese right in
terms of uh

6754
01:43:43,510 --> 01:43:43,520
terms of uh
 

6755
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,990
terms of uh
uh sovereignty is important right and

6756
01:43:45,990 --> 01:43:46,000
uh sovereignty is important right and
 

6757
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:47,189
uh sovereignty is important right and
ultimately this goes back to

6758
01:43:47,189 --> 01:43:47,199
ultimately this goes back to
 

6759
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:48,229
ultimately this goes back to
kind of the beginning of a conversation

6760
01:43:48,229 --> 01:43:48,239
kind of the beginning of a conversation
 

6761
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:50,470
kind of the beginning of a conversation
around bitcoin's ethos

6762
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:50,480
around bitcoin's ethos
 

6763
01:43:50,480 --> 01:43:52,790
around bitcoin's ethos
sovereignty right giving the power back

6764
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:52,800
sovereignty right giving the power back
 

6765
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:54,870
sovereignty right giving the power back
to people you don't have to rely on

6766

01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,040
uh this infrastructure in order to be
 

6769
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:58,870
uh this infrastructure in order to be
able to participate in this monetary

6770
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
able to participate in this monetary
 

6771
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,870

uh kind of economy which you are now

6772
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:00,880
uh kind of economy which you are now
 

6773
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:02,390
uh kind of economy which you are now
able to do is you're able to

6774
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,400
able to do is you're able to
 

6775
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:04,390
able to do is you're able to
use digital sound money you're able to

6776
01:44:04,390 --> 01:44:04,400
use digital sound money you're able to
 

6777
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:05,510
use digital sound money you're able to
keep control of it

6778
01:44:05,510 --> 01:44:05,520
keep control of it
 

6779
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,669
keep control of it
you and you alone are responsible for it

6780
01:44:07,669 --> 01:44:07,679
you and you alone are responsible for it
 

6781
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:09,750
you and you alone are responsible for it
so the idea of personal responsibility

6782
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:09,760
so the idea of personal responsibility
 

6783
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,910
so the idea of personal responsibility
um and then also you and you alone make

6784
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:11,920
um and then also you and you alone make
 

6785
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,030
um and then also you and you alone make
the decisions as to

6786
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:13,040
the decisions as to
 

6787
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,669
the decisions as to
whether you hold on to it or you use it

6788
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:15,679
whether you hold on to it or you use it
 

6789
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:17,430
whether you hold on to it or you use it
without censorship right no one can tell

01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:20,149
you what you can do with it or can't do
with it and so

6794
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
with it and so
 

6795
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:23,750
with it and so
the purchase and the storage what i find

6796
01:44:23,750 --> 01:44:23,760
the purchase and the storage what i find
 

6797
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:26,790
the purchase and the storage what i find
is uh depending on who you are there's

6798
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:26,800
is uh depending on who you are there's
 

6799
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,550
is uh depending on who you are there's
varying uh degrees of kind of concern

6800
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560
varying uh degrees of kind of concern
 

6801
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:32,550
varying uh degrees of kind of concern
or decisions that get made there a lot

6802
01:44:32,550 --> 01:44:32,560
or decisions that get made there a lot
 

6803
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:34,870

i wonder if you can sort of comment on

6814
01:44:43,830 --> 01:44:43,840
i wonder if you can sort of comment on
 

6815
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:47,270
i wonder if you can sort of comment on
that because you you have uh

6816
01:44:47,270 --> 01:44:47,280
that because you you have uh
 

6817
01:44:47,280 --> 01:44:50,470
that because you you have uh
uh sort of uh cash app and block fi and

6818
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480
uh sort of uh cash app and block fi and
 

6819
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:51,430
uh sort of uh cash app and block fi and

coinbase
 

6821
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:54,950

like you can store it that you can

6822
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:54,960
like you can store it that you can
 

6823
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,550
like you can store it that you can
purchase and trade it there and store it

6824
01:44:56,550 --> 01:44:56,560
purchase and trade it there and store it
 

6825
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:58,870
purchase and trade it there and store it
there and so on but ultimately they're

6826
01:44:58,870 --> 01:44:58,880
there and so on but ultimately they're
 

6827
01:44:58,880 --> 01:44:59,590
there and so on but ultimately they're
saying

6828
01:44:59,590 --> 01:44:59,600
saying
 

6829
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:01,430
saying
you want to you know keep some of it

6830
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
you want to you know keep some of it
 

6831
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:02,870
you want to you know keep some of it
there but you want to move it to the

6832
01:45:02,870 --> 01:45:02,880
there but you want to move it to the
 

6833
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:03,510
there but you want to move it to the
hardware

6834
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:03,520

hardware wallet
is like you can disconnect it from the

6840
01:45:08,870 --> 01:45:08,880
is like you can disconnect it from the
 

6841
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:10,790
is like you can disconnect it from the
computer because ultimately stuff that's

6842
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:10,800
computer because ultimately stuff that's
 

6843
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:12,870
computer because ultimately stuff that's
connected to the internet

6844
01:45:12,870 --> 01:45:12,880
connected to the internet
 

6845
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:15,590
connected to the internet
can be compromised can be controlled by

6846
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:15,600
can be compromised can be controlled by
 

6847
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:18,070
can be compromised can be controlled by
governments and other parties and so on

6848
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
governments and other parties and so on
 

6849
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:20,229
governments and other parties and so on
what are your thoughts about sort of

6850
01:45:20,229 --> 01:45:20,239
what are your thoughts about sort of
 

6851
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,470
what are your thoughts about sort of
practically speaking for

6852
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:22,480
practically speaking for
 

6853
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:25,910
practically speaking for
maybe like a regular citizen what's

6854
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:25,920
maybe like a regular citizen what's
 

6855
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,750
maybe like a regular citizen what's
what should be the role of the hardware

6856
01:45:27,750 --> 01:45:27,760
what should be the role of the hardware
 

6857
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:29,109
what should be the role of the hardware
wallet in their lives

6858
01:45:29,109 --> 01:45:29,119
wallet in their lives
 

6859
01:45:29,119 --> 01:45:30,950
wallet in their lives
yeah so at the highest level i just

6860
01:45:30,950 --> 01:45:30,960
yeah so at the highest level i just
 

6861
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,550
yeah so at the highest level i just
think that like learning about it is

6862
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:32,560
think that like learning about it is
 

6863
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:33,109
think that like learning about it is
important

6864
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:33,119
important
 

6865
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:34,390
important
right so even if you only have five

6866
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:34,400
right so even if you only have five
 

6867
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,709
right so even if you only have five
dollars equivalent of bitcoin

6868
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
dollars equivalent of bitcoin
 

6869
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,550
dollars equivalent of bitcoin
going and understanding here's how it

6870
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:38,560
going and understanding here's how it
 

6871
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,910
going and understanding here's how it
works here's why it's important

6872
01:45:39,910 --> 01:45:39,920
works here's why it's important
 

6873
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:41,750
works here's why it's important
here's how i would actually withdraw

6874
01:45:41,750 --> 01:45:41,760
here's how i would actually withdraw
 

6875
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,430
here's how i would actually withdraw
from an exchange under the hardware wall

6876
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,440
from an exchange under the hardware wall
 

6877
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,550
from an exchange under the hardware wall
like that alone

6878
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:44,560
like that alone
 

6879
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,470
like that alone
just as an intellectual exercise is a

6880
01:45:46,470 --> 01:45:46,480
just as an intellectual exercise is a
 

6881
01:45:46,480 --> 01:45:47,830
just as an intellectual exercise is a
worthwhile pursuit i think people should

6882
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
worthwhile pursuit i think people should
 

6883
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:48,470
worthwhile pursuit i think people should
go do that

6884
01:45:48,470 --> 01:45:48,480
go do that
 

6885
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,750
go do that
and actually go through the process of

6886
01:45:49,750 --> 01:45:49,760
and actually go through the process of
 

6887
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,510
and actually go through the process of
the steps so you feel like you can

6888
01:45:51,510 --> 01:45:51,520
the steps so you feel like you can
 

6889
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:53,430
the steps so you feel like you can
you can do it yeah yeah it's kind of

6890
01:45:53,430 --> 01:45:53,440
you can do it yeah yeah it's kind of
 

6891
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,709
you can do it yeah yeah it's kind of
like if i said to you you know hey we're

6892
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
like if i said to you you know hey we're
 

6893
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,070
like if i said to you you know hey we're
gonna go buy an asset

6894
01:45:56,070 --> 01:45:56,080
gonna go buy an asset
 

6895
01:45:56,080 --> 01:45:57,270
gonna go buy an asset
and you never went and you looked at it

6896
01:45:57,270 --> 01:45:57,280
and you never went and you looked at it
 

6897
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:58,790
and you never went and you looked at it
you never went and uh you know made a

6898
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
you never went and uh you know made a
 

6899
01:45:58,800 --> 01:45:59,590
you never went and uh you know made a
decision like

6900
01:45:59,590 --> 01:45:59,600
decision like
 

6901
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,510
decision like
sure maybe i did it or i didn't do it

6902
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:01,520
sure maybe i did it or i didn't do it
 

6903
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,189
sure maybe i did it or i didn't do it
but like you didn't actually experience

6904
01:46:03,189 --> 01:46:03,199
but like you didn't actually experience
 

6905
01:46:03,199 --> 01:46:04,310
but like you didn't actually experience
it right and so i think that that's the

6906
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:04,320
it right and so i think that that's the
 

6907
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,270
it right and so i think that that's the
important part

6908
01:46:05,270 --> 01:46:05,280
important part
 

6909
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,590
important part
the second thing is uh each person is

6910
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:07,600
the second thing is uh each person is
 

6911
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,109
the second thing is uh each person is
different from a

6912
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:09,119
different from a
 

6913
01:46:09,119 --> 01:46:10,709
different from a
how they view this asset so there are

6914
01:46:10,709 --> 01:46:10,719
how they view this asset so there are
 

6915
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:12,229
how they view this asset so there are
some people who are speculating right

6916
01:46:12,229 --> 01:46:12,239
some people who are speculating right
 

6917
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:13,510
some people who are speculating right
there's three use cases for bitcoin

6918
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:13,520
there's three use cases for bitcoin
 

6919
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:15,030
there's three use cases for bitcoin
there's store value medium of exchange

6920
01:46:15,030 --> 01:46:15,040
there's store value medium of exchange
 

6921
01:46:15,040 --> 01:46:16,390
there's store value medium of exchange
and speculation

6922
01:46:16,390 --> 01:46:16,400
and speculation
 

6923
01:46:16,400 --> 01:46:17,830
and speculation
and the people who are speculating they

6924
01:46:17,830 --> 01:46:17,840
and the people who are speculating they
 

6925
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,510
and the people who are speculating they
can't put it in deep cold storage

6926
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:19,520
can't put it in deep cold storage
 

6927
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,189
can't put it in deep cold storage
because they need to be able to trade it

6928
01:46:21,189 --> 01:46:21,199
because they need to be able to trade it
 

6929
01:46:21,199 --> 01:46:23,669
because they need to be able to trade it
right so what ends up happening is they

6930
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
right so what ends up happening is they
 

6931
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:24,950
right so what ends up happening is they
fall in the bucket of like high risk

6932
01:46:24,950 --> 01:46:24,960
fall in the bucket of like high risk
 

6933
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:26,229
fall in the bucket of like high risk
high reward

6934
01:46:26,229 --> 01:46:26,239
high reward
 

6935
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:27,990
high reward
they're trying to trade they're trying

6936
01:46:27,990 --> 01:46:28,000
they're trying to trade they're trying
 

6937
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:29,510
they're trying to trade they're trying
to do all these things and sure maybe

6938
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
to do all these things and sure maybe
 

6939
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:30,870
to do all these things and sure maybe
there are profits that they can generate

6940
01:46:30,870 --> 01:46:30,880
there are profits that they can generate
 

6941
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:31,830
there are profits that they can generate
if they're good at it

6942
01:46:31,830 --> 01:46:31,840
if they're good at it
 

6943
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:33,590
if they're good at it
but also they're introducing a lot of

6944
01:46:33,590 --> 01:46:33,600
but also they're introducing a lot of
 

6945
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:35,510
but also they're introducing a lot of
risk and so that person is very

6946
01:46:35,510 --> 01:46:35,520
risk and so that person is very
 

6947
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:36,709
risk and so that person is very
different than the person who says hey

6948
01:46:36,709 --> 01:46:36,719
different than the person who says hey
 

6949
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:38,149
different than the person who says hey

and then what's your time horizon and
 

6967
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,470
and then what's your time horizon and
what ends up happening is

6968
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
what ends up happening is
 

6969
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:55,830
what ends up happening is
more and more people in the bitcoin

6970

01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,030
of the advantages to
uh this community right if you look at

6976
01:47:01,030 --> 01:47:01,040
uh this community right if you look at
 

6977
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,790
uh this community right if you look at
the on-chain metrics 60

6978
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:02,800
the on-chain metrics 60
 

6979
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,030
the on-chain metrics 60
of bitcoin haven't moved uh from the

6980
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:05,040
of bitcoin haven't moved uh from the
 

6981
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,550
of bitcoin haven't moved uh from the
digital wallet in which they sit

6982
01:47:06,550 --> 01:47:06,560
digital wallet in which they sit
 

6983
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:08,709
digital wallet in which they sit
in the last 12 months so even though

6984
01:47:08,709 --> 01:47:08,719
in the last 12 months so even though
 

6985
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,550
in the last 12 months so even though
it's appreciated hundreds of percent

6986
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:10,560
it's appreciated hundreds of percent
 

6987
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:12,149
it's appreciated hundreds of percent
on the upside there's been lots of

6988
01:47:12,149 --> 01:47:12,159
on the upside there's been lots of
 

6989
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,629
on the upside there's been lots of
volatility a 50 drop in a single day

6990
01:47:14,629 --> 01:47:14,639
volatility a 50 drop in a single day
 

6991
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:16,950
volatility a 50 drop in a single day
in terms of the us dollar price still

6992
01:47:16,950 --> 01:47:16,960
in terms of the us dollar price still
 

6993
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:18,149
in terms of the us dollar price still
doesn't move and so these are

6994
01:47:18,149 --> 01:47:18,159
doesn't move and so these are
 

6995
01:47:18,159 --> 01:47:19,430
doesn't move and so these are
kind of the long-term holders right

6996
01:47:19,430 --> 01:47:19,440
kind of the long-term holders right
 

6997
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:21,430
kind of the long-term holders right
these are the the iron fists or

6998
01:47:21,430 --> 01:47:21,440
these are the the iron fists or
 

6999
01:47:21,440 --> 01:47:22,950
these are the the iron fists or
as recently as it's become popular the

7000
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:22,960
as recently as it's become popular the
 

7001
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:25,030
as recently as it's become popular the
diamond hands right

7002
01:47:25,030 --> 01:47:25,040
diamond hands right
 

7003
01:47:25,040 --> 01:47:26,790
diamond hands right
hands they're just they're not going

7004
01:47:26,790 --> 01:47:26,800
hands they're just they're not going
 

7005
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:28,950
hands they're just they're not going
anywhere and so i think that

7006
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:28,960
anywhere and so i think that
 

7007
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:31,910
anywhere and so i think that
those people are much more likely to not

7008
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:31,920
those people are much more likely to not
 

7009
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,030
those people are much more likely to not
have their bitcoin

7010
01:47:33,030 --> 01:47:33,040
have their bitcoin
 

7011
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,270
have their bitcoin
on exchanges or in software walls

7012
01:47:35,270 --> 01:47:35,280
on exchanges or in software walls
 

7013
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,629
on exchanges or in software walls
they've got it in some sort of like

7014
01:47:36,629 --> 01:47:36,639
they've got it in some sort of like
 

7015
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:37,669
they've got it in some sort of like
highly secure

7016
01:47:37,669 --> 01:47:37,679
highly secure
 

7017
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,149
highly secure
environment uh and what and one in which

7018
01:47:40,149 --> 01:47:40,159
environment uh and what and one in which
 

7019
01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:40,709
environment uh and what and one in which
they have

7020
01:47:40,709 --> 01:47:40,719
they have
 

7021
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:43,830
they have
deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent

7022
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:43,840
deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent
 

7023
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:44,790
deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent
sovereignty

7024
01:47:44,790 --> 01:47:44,800
sovereignty
 

7025
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:46,629
sovereignty
and the reason for that is because they

7026
01:47:46,629 --> 01:47:46,639
and the reason for that is because they
 

7027
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:48,310
and the reason for that is because they
have that long time horizon they don't

7028
01:47:48,310 --> 01:47:48,320
have that long time horizon they don't
 

7029
01:47:48,320 --> 01:47:49,350
have that long time horizon they don't
want to be

7030
01:47:49,350 --> 01:47:49,360
want to be
 

7031
01:47:49,360 --> 01:47:52,709
want to be
um kind of convicted around bitcoin

7032
01:47:52,709 --> 01:47:52,719
um kind of convicted around bitcoin
 

7033
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:55,590
um kind of convicted around bitcoin
sound money macro environment all stuff

7034
01:47:55,590 --> 01:47:55,600
sound money macro environment all stuff
 

7035
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:56,870
sound money macro environment all stuff
and then they make a mistake because

7036
01:47:56,870 --> 01:47:56,880
and then they make a mistake because
 

7037
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:57,830
and then they make a mistake because
they trusted

7038
01:47:57,830 --> 01:47:57,840
they trusted
 

7039
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:00,629
they trusted
you know abcd company uh and that

7040
01:48:00,629 --> 01:48:00,639
you know abcd company uh and that
 

7041
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:01,990
you know abcd company uh and that
counterparty risk because it ends up

7042
01:48:01,990 --> 01:48:02,000
counterparty risk because it ends up
 

7043
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:02,790
counterparty risk because it ends up
actually being

7044
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:02,800
actually being

you know fatal or or detrimental so
 

7047
01:48:05,199 --> 01:48:06,390
you know fatal or or detrimental so
again this is

7048
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:06,400
again this is

01:48:42,320 --> 01:48:44,310
go to other cultures so if we remove
ourselves from the western world culture

7086
01:48:44,310 --> 01:48:44,320
ourselves from the western world culture
 

7087
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:46,629
ourselves from the western world culture
of uh investing in gamification of

7088
01:48:46,629 --> 01:48:46,639
of uh investing in gamification of
 

7089
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:48,070
of uh investing in gamification of
financial markets and the

7090
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,080
financial markets and the
 

7091
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,669
financial markets and the
financialization of everything

7092
01:48:49,669 --> 01:48:49,679
financialization of everything
 

7093
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,750
financialization of everything
let's say we go to uh the culture of

7094
01:48:51,750 --> 01:48:51,760
let's say we go to uh the culture of
 

7095
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:53,109
let's say we go to uh the culture of
india

7096
01:48:53,109 --> 01:48:53,119
india
 

7097
01:48:53,119 --> 01:48:55,430
india
for hundreds if not thousands of years

7098
01:48:55,430 --> 01:48:55,440
for hundreds if not thousands of years
 

7099
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:56,950
for hundreds if not thousands of years
families basically

7100
01:48:56,950 --> 01:48:56,960
families basically
 

7101
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:59,430
families basically
saved their wealth in gold and in

7102
01:48:59,430 --> 01:48:59,440
saved their wealth in gold and in
 

7103
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,149
saved their wealth in gold and in
jewelry

7104
01:49:00,149 --> 01:49:00,159
jewelry
 

7105
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:02,550
jewelry
and in these hard assets with the

7106
01:49:02,550 --> 01:49:02,560
and in these hard assets with the
 

7107
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:03,990
and in these hard assets with the
expectation

7108
01:49:03,990 --> 01:49:04,000
expectation
 

7109
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,629
expectation
to pass it on to the next generation and

7110
01:49:06,629 --> 01:49:06,639
to pass it on to the next generation and
 

7111
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:07,109
to pass it on to the next generation and
so

7112
01:49:07,109 --> 01:49:07,119
so
 

7113
01:49:07,119 --> 01:49:09,830
so
it would be blasphemous to sell the

7114
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
it would be blasphemous to sell the
 

7115
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:10,870
it would be blasphemous to sell the
family's gold

7116
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:10,880
family's gold
 

7117
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,950
family's gold
in that culture right you know your

7118
01:49:12,950 --> 01:49:12,960
in that culture right you know your
 

7119
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:13,990
in that culture right you know your
great grandfather gave it to your

7120
01:49:13,990 --> 01:49:14,000
great grandfather gave it to your
 

7121
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,189
great grandfather gave it to your
grandfather your grandfather gave it to

7122
01:49:15,189 --> 01:49:15,199
grandfather your grandfather gave it to
 

7123
01:49:15,199 --> 01:49:16,709

01:49:16,709 --> 01:49:16,719
your father your father gave it to you
 

7125
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:20,310
your father your father gave it to you
right and so in that culture

7126
01:49:20,310 --> 01:49:20,320
right and so in that culture
 

7127
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,589
right and so in that culture
the long-term kind of uh holding

7128
01:49:23,589 --> 01:49:23,599
the long-term kind of uh holding
 

7129
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,430
the long-term kind of uh holding
is the default i think that what bitcoin

7130
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:27,440
is the default i think that what bitcoin
 

7131
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,669
is the default i think that what bitcoin
has presented again is a digital

7132
01:49:29,669 --> 01:49:29,679
has presented again is a digital
 

7133
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:30,629
has presented again is a digital
application

7134
01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:30,639
application
 

7135
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:32,950
application
of the exact same thing which is that

7136
01:49:32,950 --> 01:49:32,960
of the exact same thing which is that
 

7137
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,310
of the exact same thing which is that
while everything else in the world is

7138
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:34,320
while everything else in the world is
 

7139
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:37,030
while everything else in the world is
being devalued that is denominated in a

7140
01:49:37,030 --> 01:49:37,040
being devalued that is denominated in a
 

7141
01:49:37,040 --> 01:49:39,510
being devalued that is denominated in a
uh a currency that is being inflated

7142
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
uh a currency that is being inflated
 

7143
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:40,310
uh a currency that is being inflated
away

7144
01:49:40,310 --> 01:49:40,320
away
 

7145
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:43,589
away
whether it's quickly or not this finite

7146
01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
whether it's quickly or not this finite
 

7147
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,430
whether it's quickly or not this finite
supply this scarce asset ends up

7148
01:49:45,430 --> 01:49:45,440
supply this scarce asset ends up
 

7149
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:47,270
supply this scarce asset ends up
accruing more and more value over time

7150
01:49:47,270 --> 01:49:47,280
accruing more and more value over time
 

7151
01:49:47,280 --> 01:49:48,070
accruing more and more value over time
right

7152
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
right
 

7153
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:51,109
right
and so um i think that for me personally

7154
01:49:51,109 --> 01:49:51,119
and so um i think that for me personally
 

7155
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:53,990
and so um i think that for me personally
um i've got you know over 95 of my net

7156
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
um i've got you know over 95 of my net
 

7157
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,669
um i've got you know over 95 of my net
worth that's in this

7158
01:49:55,669 --> 01:49:55,679
worth that's in this
 

7159
01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,270
worth that's in this
90 over 95 percent of your net worth

7160
01:49:59,270 --> 01:49:59,280
90 over 95 percent of your net worth
 

7161
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:01,910
90 over 95 percent of your net worth
there's two important caveats to this

7162
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:01,920
there's two important caveats to this
 

7163
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:02,550
there's two important caveats to this
one

7164
01:50:02,550 --> 01:50:02,560
one
 

7165
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:05,629
one
is i didn't you know buy some bitcoin in

7166
01:50:05,629 --> 01:50:05,639
is i didn't you know buy some bitcoin in
 

7167
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:07,350
is i didn't you know buy some bitcoin in
2011 or 12

7168
01:50:07,350 --> 01:50:07,360
2011 or 12
 

7169
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,950
2011 or 12
right and then also it appreciated a

7170
01:50:08,950 --> 01:50:08,960
right and then also it appreciated a
 

7171
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:10,950
right and then also it appreciated a
bunch and it grew into that but

7172
01:50:10,950 --> 01:50:10,960
bunch and it grew into that but
 

7173
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:12,709
bunch and it grew into that but
from a cost basis perspective you know i

7174
01:50:12,709 --> 01:50:12,719
from a cost basis perspective you know i
 

7175
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:13,990
from a cost basis perspective you know i
put 100 and now it's

7176
01:50:13,990 --> 01:50:14,000
put 100 and now it's
 

7177
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:17,109
put 100 and now it's
a ton of money instead what i did was i

7178
01:50:17,109 --> 01:50:17,119
a ton of money instead what i did was i
 

7179
01:50:17,119 --> 01:50:19,189
a ton of money instead what i did was i
basically in 2018

7180
01:50:19,189 --> 01:50:19,199
basically in 2018
 

7181
01:50:19,199 --> 01:50:22,149
basically in 2018
um saw bitcoin from a us dollar price

7182
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:22,159
um saw bitcoin from a us dollar price
 

7183
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:23,510
um saw bitcoin from a us dollar price
standpoint was falling and falling and

7184
01:50:23,510 --> 01:50:23,520
standpoint was falling and falling and
 

7185
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:24,229
standpoint was falling and falling and
falling

7186
01:50:24,229 --> 01:50:24,239
falling
 

7187
01:50:24,239 --> 01:50:25,830
falling
and in december of 2018 it said take

7188
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:25,840
and in december of 2018 it said take
 

7189
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:27,669
and in december of 2018 it said take
about 50 of my net worth

7190
01:50:27,669 --> 01:50:27,679
about 50 of my net worth
 

7191
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,390
about 50 of my net worth
and convert it from dollar denominated

7192
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:30,400
and convert it from dollar denominated
 

7193
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,910
and convert it from dollar denominated
assets into bitcoin so it was a very

7194
01:50:31,910 --> 01:50:31,920
assets into bitcoin so it was a very
 

7195
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:33,430
assets into bitcoin so it was a very
kind of intentional decision with a very

7196
01:50:33,430 --> 01:50:33,440
kind of intentional decision with a very
 

7197
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,950
kind of intentional decision with a very
specific view on the world as to like

7198
01:50:34,950 --> 01:50:34,960
specific view on the world as to like
 

7199
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:36,709
specific view on the world as to like
why i was doing it

7200
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
why i was doing it
 

7201
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:39,030
why i was doing it
i then essentially just let it sit there

7202
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,040
i then essentially just let it sit there
 

7203
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:40,310
i then essentially just let it sit there
grow whatever

7204
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,320
grow whatever
 

7205
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,589
grow whatever
until uh the spring of 2020.

7206
01:50:43,589 --> 01:50:43,599
until uh the spring of 2020.
 

7207
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:45,189
until uh the spring of 2020.
and when i saw the government step in

7208
01:50:45,189 --> 01:50:45,199
and when i saw the government step in
 

7209
01:50:45,199 --> 01:50:47,589
and when i saw the government step in
and start to say hey we're going to

7210
01:50:47,589 --> 01:50:47,599
and start to say hey we're going to
 

7211
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:49,030
and start to say hey we're going to
really be aggressive in terms of

7212
01:50:49,030 --> 01:50:49,040
really be aggressive in terms of
 

7213
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,149
really be aggressive in terms of
interest rate manipulation and

7214
01:50:50,149 --> 01:50:50,159
interest rate manipulation and
 

7215
01:50:50,159 --> 01:50:51,270
interest rate manipulation and
quantitative easing

7216
01:50:51,270 --> 01:50:51,280
quantitative easing
 

7217
01:50:51,280 --> 01:50:52,790
quantitative easing
i then decided to go ahead and take

7218
01:50:52,790 --> 01:50:52,800
i then decided to go ahead and take
 

7219
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:54,310
i then decided to go ahead and take
basically the remainder

7220
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:54,320
basically the remainder
 

7221
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:55,990
basically the remainder
and start to convert it as well so i

7222
01:50:55,990 --> 01:50:56,000
and start to convert it as well so i
 

7223
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:57,910
and start to convert it as well so i
became very aggressive in doing that

7224
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:57,920
became very aggressive in doing that
 

7225
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,470
became very aggressive in doing that
and so the way that i look at it is

7226
01:51:00,470 --> 01:51:00,480
and so the way that i look at it is
 

7227
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,310
and so the way that i look at it is
that's actually my savings

7228
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:02,320
that's actually my savings
 

7229
01:51:02,320 --> 01:51:04,550
that's actually my savings
right and so in some weird way if i said

7230
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:04,560
right and so in some weird way if i said
 

7231
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,910
right and so in some weird way if i said
to you know what's the dollar worth

7232
01:51:05,910 --> 01:51:05,920
to you know what's the dollar worth
 

7233
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:06,629
to you know what's the dollar worth
you'd say well

7234
01:51:06,629 --> 01:51:06,639
you'd say well
 

7235
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:08,629
you'd say well
a one dollar bill's worth one dollar

7236
01:51:08,629 --> 01:51:08,639
a one dollar bill's worth one dollar
 

7237
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:11,189
a one dollar bill's worth one dollar
right bitcoin to me i denominate my

7238
01:51:11,189 --> 01:51:11,199
right bitcoin to me i denominate my
 

7239
01:51:11,199 --> 01:51:12,310
right bitcoin to me i denominate my
wealth in bitcoin

7240
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,320
wealth in bitcoin
 

7241
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:14,470
wealth in bitcoin
so i think of one bitcoin is worth one

7242
01:51:14,470 --> 01:51:14,480
so i think of one bitcoin is worth one
 

7243
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:16,149
so i think of one bitcoin is worth one
bitcoin not one bitcoin is worth sixty

7244
01:51:16,149 --> 01:51:16,159
bitcoin not one bitcoin is worth sixty
 

7245

right well guess what happens when you

7258
01:51:26,390 --> 01:51:26,400
right well guess what happens when you
 

7259
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:28,390
right well guess what happens when you
have a devaluing currency as the

7260
01:51:28,390 --> 01:51:28,400
have a devaluing currency as the
 

7261
01:51:28,400 --> 01:51:30,390
have a devaluing currency as the
denominator

7262
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:30,400
denominator
 

7263
01:51:30,400 --> 01:51:31,750
denominator
doesn't matter right like you're

7264
01:51:31,750 --> 01:51:31,760
doesn't matter right like you're
 

7265
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:33,350
doesn't matter right like you're
financially incentivized to spend or

7266
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,360
financially incentivized to spend or
 

7267
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,109
financially incentivized to spend or
invest right to consume

7268
01:51:35,109 --> 01:51:35,119
invest right to consume
 

7269
01:51:35,119 --> 01:51:38,070
invest right to consume
uh when you have an appreciating

7270
01:51:38,070 --> 01:51:38,080
uh when you have an appreciating
 

7271
01:51:38,080 --> 01:51:39,109
uh when you have an appreciating
currency

7272
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:39,119
currency
 

7273
01:51:39,119 --> 01:51:41,030
currency
all of a sudden you become much less

7274
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:41,040
all of a sudden you become much less
 

7275
01:51:41,040 --> 01:51:43,189
all of a sudden you become much less
consumptive

7276
01:51:43,189 --> 01:51:43,199
consumptive
 

7277
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:46,550
consumptive
yeah because you're actually trading off

7278
01:51:46,550 --> 01:51:46,560
yeah because you're actually trading off
 

7279
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,589
yeah because you're actually trading off
future purchasing power yeah for the

7280
01:51:49,589 --> 01:51:49,599
future purchasing power yeah for the
 

7281
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:50,629
future purchasing power yeah for the
consumption today

7282
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
consumption today
 

7283
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:54,149
consumption today
it's fascinating to think that if if uh

7284
01:51:54,149 --> 01:51:54,159
it's fascinating to think that if if uh
 

7285
01:51:54,159 --> 01:51:56,629
it's fascinating to think that if if uh
when you move about this world you think

7286
01:51:56,629 --> 01:51:56,639
when you move about this world you think
 

7287
01:51:56,639 --> 01:51:57,669
when you move about this world you think
in bitcoin

7288
01:51:57,669 --> 01:51:57,679
in bitcoin
 

7289
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:00,149
in bitcoin
you behave differently is if you think

7290
01:52:00,149 --> 01:52:00,159
you behave differently is if you think
 

7291
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:01,589
you behave differently is if you think
in dollars

7292
01:52:01,589 --> 01:52:01,599
in dollars
 

7293
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:05,109
in dollars
that's really fascinating people but but

7294
01:52:05,109 --> 01:52:05,119
that's really fascinating people but but
 

7295
01:52:05,119 --> 01:52:06,070
that's really fascinating people but but
here's the thing is

7296
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:06,080
here's the thing is
 

7297
01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:08,070
here's the thing is
the last 50 years or so is actually the

7298
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
the last 50 years or so is actually the
 

7299
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,950
the last 50 years or so is actually the
outlier in history

7300
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:10,960
outlier in history
 

7301
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:13,910
outlier in history
most people used to think this way yeah

7302
01:52:13,910 --> 01:52:13,920
most people used to think this way yeah
 

7303
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:14,950
most people used to think this way yeah
it's only when

7304
01:52:14,950 --> 01:52:14,960
it's only when
 

7305
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,990
it's only when
a fiat currency got introduced that

7306
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:18,000
a fiat currency got introduced that
 

7307
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:19,910
a fiat currency got introduced that
one argument the positive argument or

7308
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:19,920
one argument the positive argument or
 

7309
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,390
one argument the positive argument or
perspective is there was an explosion in

7310
01:52:22,390 --> 01:52:22,400
perspective is there was an explosion in
 

7311
01:52:22,400 --> 01:52:23,910
perspective is there was an explosion in
growth

7312
01:52:23,910 --> 01:52:23,920
growth
 

7313
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:24,950
growth
but really it's because there was a

7314
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:24,960
but really it's because there was a
 

7315
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,950
but really it's because there was a
financial incentive to consume yeah

7316
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:26,960
financial incentive to consume yeah
 

7317
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,189
financial incentive to consume yeah
right and there's nobody better in the

7318
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
right and there's nobody better in the
 

7319
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:30,470
right and there's nobody better in the
world than the united states

7320
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
world than the united states
 

7321
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,870
world than the united states
at consuming and we consume anything and

7322
01:52:32,870 --> 01:52:32,880
at consuming and we consume anything and
 

7323
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:33,669
at consuming and we consume anything and
everything

7324
01:52:33,669 --> 01:52:33,679
everything
 

7325
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:35,430
everything
and if you want to see a great example

7326
01:52:35,430 --> 01:52:35,440
and if you want to see a great example
 

7327
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:37,589
and if you want to see a great example
look at how big the coca-colas are at

7328
01:52:37,589 --> 01:52:37,599
look at how big the coca-colas are at
 

7329
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:38,229
look at how big the coca-colas are at
mcdonald's

7330
01:52:38,229 --> 01:52:38,239
mcdonald's
 

7331
01:52:38,239 --> 01:52:39,830
mcdonald's
right you know you go to other places

7332
01:52:39,830 --> 01:52:39,840
right you know you go to other places
 

7333
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:41,350
right you know you go to other places
they don't serve them that big

7334
01:52:41,350 --> 01:52:41,360
they don't serve them that big
 

7335
01:52:41,360 --> 01:52:44,950
they don't serve them that big
and so the other example or the negative

7336
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:44,960
and so the other example or the negative
 

7337
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:45,990
and so the other example or the negative
argument

7338
01:52:45,990 --> 01:52:46,000
argument
 

7339
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,430
argument
is we have to consume

7340
01:52:49,430 --> 01:52:49,440
is we have to consume
 

7341
01:52:49,440 --> 01:52:51,589
is we have to consume
because if not you end up being the

7342
01:52:51,589 --> 01:52:51,599
because if not you end up being the
 

7343
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:53,510
because if not you end up being the
bottom 45 percent of americans that held

7344
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:53,520
bottom 45 percent of americans that held
 

7345
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:55,430
bottom 45 percent of americans that held
no investable assets

7346
01:52:55,430 --> 01:52:55,440
no investable assets
 

7347
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:56,629
no investable assets
and actually are just having their

7348
01:52:56,629 --> 01:52:56,639
and actually are just having their
 

7349
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:58,629
and actually are just having their
wealth devalued away so holding the

7350
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
wealth devalued away so holding the
 

7351
01:52:58,639 --> 01:52:59,350
wealth devalued away so holding the
dollars

7352
01:52:59,350 --> 01:52:59,360
dollars
 

7353
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:01,669
dollars
end up being a very bad economic

7354
01:53:01,669 --> 01:53:01,679
end up being a very bad economic
 

7355
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:02,790
end up being a very bad economic
decision

7356
01:53:02,790 --> 01:53:02,800
decision
 

7357
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:04,629
decision
and so when you then switch to this

7358
01:53:04,629 --> 01:53:04,639
and so when you then switch to this
 

7359
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:06,149
and so when you then switch to this
sound money

7360
01:53:06,149 --> 01:53:06,159
sound money
 

7361
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:08,629
sound money
you say wait a second why would i if

7362
01:53:08,629 --> 01:53:08,639
you say wait a second why would i if
 

7363
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:10,470
you say wait a second why would i if

000 us dollars why would i spend that if

7370
01:53:17,189 --> 01:53:17,199
000 us dollars why would i spend that if
 

7371
01:53:17,199 --> 01:53:19,430
000 us dollars why would i spend that if
at some point in the future whether it's

7372

i could trade it for something much more
than that

7378

there's this kind of like eric weinstein
 

7407
01:53:54,320 --> 01:53:57,910
there's this kind of like eric weinstein
says that one of the problems is

7408
01:53:57,910 --> 01:53:57,920
says that one of the problems is
 

7409
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,629
says that one of the problems is
for the past several decades this whole

7410
01:54:00,629 --> 01:54:00,639
for the past several decades this whole
 

7411
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:01,830
for the past several decades this whole
economy

7412
01:54:01,830 --> 01:54:01,840
economy
 

7413
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:03,669
economy
society is built on the idea that we

7414
01:54:03,669 --> 01:54:03,679
society is built on the idea that we
 

7415
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:05,030
society is built on the idea that we
have to keep growing

7416
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,040
have to keep growing
 

7417
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:08,070
have to keep growing
like it depends on that idea and it's a

7418
01:54:08,070 --> 01:54:08,080
like it depends on that idea and it's a
 

7419
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:10,470
like it depends on that idea and it's a
good question whether that's going to

7420
01:54:10,470 --> 01:54:10,480
good question whether that's going to
 

7421
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:13,589
good question whether that's going to
result in huge problems or if like a

7422
01:54:13,589 --> 01:54:13,599
result in huge problems or if like a
 

7423
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:16,790
result in huge problems or if like a
college student on a deadline

7424
01:54:16,790 --> 01:54:16,800
college student on a deadline
 

7425
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:19,910
college student on a deadline
the the dependence on growth will mean

7426
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:19,920
the the dependence on growth will mean
 

7427
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,750
the the dependence on growth will mean
that we'll have to grow

7428
01:54:21,750 --> 01:54:21,760
that we'll have to grow
 

7429
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:24,629
that we'll have to grow
like the fear of death will force us to

7430
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
like the fear of death will force us to

01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:25,109
like the fear of death will force us to
grow

7432
01:54:25,109 --> 01:54:25,119
grow
 

7433
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:26,870
grow
but i think there's a false equivalency

7434
01:54:26,870 --> 01:54:26,880
but i think there's a false equivalency
 

7435
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:28,470
but i think there's a false equivalency
between um

7436
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:28,480
between um
 

7437
01:54:28,480 --> 01:54:30,629
between um
we're dependent on growth and then if

7438
01:54:30,629 --> 01:54:30,639
we're dependent on growth and then if
 

7439
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:32,149
we're dependent on growth and then if
the world was denominated and sound

7440
01:54:32,149 --> 01:54:32,159
the world was denominated and sound
 

7441
01:54:32,159 --> 01:54:32,629

let's say it's three percent of your
paycheck

7570
01:56:26,629 --> 01:56:26,639
paycheck
 

7571
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:28,310

take three percent go buy bitcoin don't

take three percent go buy bitcoin don't
 

7573
01:56:28,320 --> 01:56:29,669

worry about what the price is just do

7574
01:56:29,669 --> 01:56:29,679
worry about what the price is just do
 

7575
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:30,709
worry about what the price is just do
that over time

7576
01:56:30,709 --> 01:56:30,719
that over time
 

7577
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:32,229
that over time
and the reason why that's important is

7578
01:56:32,229 --> 01:56:32,239
and the reason why that's important is
 

7579
01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:35,189
and the reason why that's important is
um if in december of 2017 when bitcoin

7580
01:56:35,189 --> 01:56:35,199
um if in december of 2017 when bitcoin
 

7581
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:36,390
um if in december of 2017 when bitcoin
was at 20 000

7582
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:36,400
was at 20 000
 

7583
01:56:36,400 --> 01:56:38,470
was at 20 000
it was the height of kind of this last

7584
01:56:38,470 --> 01:56:38,480
it was the height of kind of this last
 

7585
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:40,070
it was the height of kind of this last
big upwards movement

7586
01:56:40,070 --> 01:56:40,080
big upwards movement
 

7587
01:56:40,080 --> 01:56:41,990
big upwards movement
you had taken all of your money and you

7588
01:56:41,990 --> 01:56:42,000
you had taken all of your money and you
 

7589
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:43,589
you had taken all of your money and you
had put it into bitcoin

7590
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:43,599
had put it into bitcoin
 

7591
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:45,189
had put it into bitcoin
you would have had to wait almost three

7592
01:56:45,189 --> 01:56:45,199
you would have had to wait almost three
 

7593
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:47,430
you would have had to wait almost three
years just to get back to quote-unquote

7594
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:47,440
years just to get back to quote-unquote
 

7595
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:50,550
years just to get back to quote-unquote
break even in us dollar terms if at the

7596
01:56:50,550 --> 01:56:50,560
break even in us dollar terms if at the
 

7597
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,589
break even in us dollar terms if at the
same time

7598
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:51,599
same time
 

7599
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:54,870
same time
you had simply bought then and over the

7600
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
you had simply bought then and over the
 

7601
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:56,870
you had simply bought then and over the
next three years bought every two weeks

7602
01:56:56,870 --> 01:56:56,880
next three years bought every two weeks
 

7603
01:56:56,880 --> 01:56:58,310
next three years bought every two weeks
you would have been up hundreds of

7604
01:56:58,310 --> 01:56:58,320
you would have been up hundreds of
 

7605
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:00,790
you would have been up hundreds of
percent three years later

7606
01:57:00,790 --> 01:57:00,800
percent three years later
 

7607
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,070
percent three years later
because what ended up happening was you

7608
01:57:02,070 --> 01:57:02,080
because what ended up happening was you
 

7609
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,589
because what ended up happening was you
bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at

01:57:03,589 --> 01:57:03,599
bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at
 

7611
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:04,070
bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at

7612
01:57:04,070 --> 01:57:04,080

7615
01:57:07,119 --> 01:57:09,510
12 10 9 8 3 4
5 5 5 you know all the way back up on

01:57:09,510 --> 01:57:09,520
5 5 5 you know all the way back up on
 

7617
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,870
5 5 5 you know all the way back up on
the other side

and so dollar cost averaging is one of

7620
01:57:12,709 --> 01:57:12,719
and so dollar cost averaging is one of
 

7621
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:14,629
and so dollar cost averaging is one of
these weird things that uh it almost

7622
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:14,639
these weird things that uh it almost
 

7623
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:16,550
these weird things that uh it almost
sounds too easy

7624
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:16,560
sounds too easy
 

7625
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:19,109
sounds too easy
but what we find is in america we have a

7626
01:57:19,109 --> 01:57:19,119
but what we find is in america we have a
 

7627
01:57:19,119 --> 01:57:21,350
but what we find is in america we have a
lack of financial education

7628
01:57:21,350 --> 01:57:21,360
lack of financial education
 

7629
01:57:21,360 --> 01:57:23,350
lack of financial education
and so rather than try to be smarter

7630
01:57:23,350 --> 01:57:23,360
and so rather than try to be smarter
 

7631
01:57:23,360 --> 01:57:24,790
and so rather than try to be smarter
than markets what most people are better

7632
01:57:24,790 --> 01:57:24,800
than markets what most people are better

01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:26,149

right just put it in based on those

right just put it in based on those
percentages and don't think about it

percentages and don't think about it
 

7651
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:43,270
percentages and don't think about it
and over a long enough period of time

almost anyone in the united states right
 

7657
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:47,990
almost anyone in the united states right
there's exceptions but almost anyone in

7658

the united states
can become a millionaire in their

have that long-term view and they allow
 

7667
01:57:54,080 --> 01:57:55,830
have that long-term view and they allow
compounding to work for them

7668

compounding to work for them
 

7669
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,350
compounding to work for them
and so don't look at the price of

and so don't look at the price of

bitcoin and all that kind of stuff just
 

7673
01:57:59,040 --> 01:57:59,910
bitcoin and all that kind of stuff just
pick a

7674

pick a
 

7675
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:03,030
pick a

kinds of different prices but you're
 

7705
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:24,709
kinds of different prices but you're
gonna get kind of a blended average

7706
01:58:24,709 --> 01:58:24,719
gonna get kind of a blended average
 

7707
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:26,629
gonna get kind of a blended average
and the more important thing is the

and the more important thing is the
 

7709
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:28,390
and the more important thing is the

01:58:42,320 --> 01:58:46,310
price and so on
that said uh you know bitcoin price

7728
01:58:46,310 --> 01:58:46,320
that said uh you know bitcoin price
 

7729
01:58:46,320 --> 01:58:49,910
that said uh you know bitcoin price
is volatile and

7730
01:58:49,910 --> 01:58:49,920
is volatile and
 

7731
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,589
is volatile and
you know again the argument i've heard

7732
01:58:53,589 --> 01:58:53,599
you know again the argument i've heard
 

7733
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:56,950
you know again the argument i've heard
is like everything that's going to be

7734
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:56,960
is like everything that's going to be
 

7735
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:00,310
is like everything that's going to be
a lot more valuable in the future

7736
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:00,320
a lot more valuable in the future
 

7737
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,310
a lot more valuable in the future
like if you look at the history like

7738
01:59:02,310 --> 01:59:02,320
like if you look at the history like
 

7739
01:59:02,320 --> 01:59:03,510
like if you look at the history like
companies like apple

7740
01:59:03,510 --> 01:59:03,520
companies like apple
 

7741
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:06,709
companies like apple
like tesla's now i mean but

7742
01:59:06,709 --> 01:59:06,719
like tesla's now i mean but
 

7743
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:08,629
like tesla's now i mean but
you know let's look at companies that

7744
01:59:08,629 --> 01:59:08,639
you know let's look at companies that
 

7745
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:10,470
you know let's look at companies that
have now stabilized right

7746
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:10,480
have now stabilized right
 

7747
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:12,950
have now stabilized right
uh apple is a good example it's like

7748
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:12,960
uh apple is a good example it's like
 

7749
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:14,870
uh apple is a good example it's like
volatile in the beginning

7750
01:59:14,870 --> 01:59:14,880
volatile in the beginning
 

7751
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:17,109
volatile in the beginning
and so the argument for bitcoin is like

7752
01:59:17,109 --> 01:59:17,119
and so the argument for bitcoin is like
 

7753
01:59:17,119 --> 01:59:18,870
and so the argument for bitcoin is like
yeah this is the early stages because

7754
01:59:18,870 --> 01:59:18,880
yeah this is the early stages because
 

7755
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:21,109
yeah this is the early stages because
it's going to be a lot more valuable

7756
01:59:21,109 --> 01:59:21,119
it's going to be a lot more valuable
 

7757
01:59:21,119 --> 01:59:23,189
it's going to be a lot more valuable
and right now it's volatile and this is

7758
01:59:23,189 --> 01:59:23,199
and right now it's volatile and this is
 

7759
01:59:23,199 --> 01:59:24,310
and right now it's volatile and this is
why you have to have these kinds of

7760
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:24,320
why you have to have these kinds of
 

7761
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:26,550
why you have to have these kinds of
strategies to write out the volatility

7762
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:26,560
strategies to write out the volatility
 

7763
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:28,310
strategies to write out the volatility
of course everything that goes to zero

7764
01:59:28,310 --> 01:59:28,320
of course everything that goes to zero
 

7765
01:59:28,320 --> 01:59:29,669
of course everything that goes to zero
is also volatile

7766
01:59:29,669 --> 01:59:29,679
is also volatile
 

7767
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:32,950
is also volatile
like the early days are volatile uh

7768
01:59:32,950 --> 01:59:32,960
like the early days are volatile uh
 

7769
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:35,109
like the early days are volatile uh
do you see like this volatility is like

7770
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:35,119
do you see like this volatility is like
 

7771
01:59:35,119 --> 01:59:36,629
do you see like this volatility is like
a feature or a bug

7772
01:59:36,629 --> 01:59:36,639
a feature or a bug
 

7773
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:39,109
a feature or a bug
or is this just like a way of life so

7774
01:59:39,109 --> 01:59:39,119
or is this just like a way of life so
 

7775
01:59:39,119 --> 01:59:40,390
or is this just like a way of life so
amazon is the one that i know the

7776
01:59:40,390 --> 01:59:40,400
amazon is the one that i know the
 

7777
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,470
amazon is the one that i know the
numbers on in terms of early volatility

7778
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:42,480
numbers on in terms of early volatility
 

7779
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,790
numbers on in terms of early volatility
uh every year since they've gone it has

7780
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:44,800
uh every year since they've gone it has
 

7781
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:46,709
uh every year since they've gone it has
gone public it's had a double-digit

7782
01:59:46,709 --> 01:59:46,719
gone public it's had a double-digit
 

7783
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:50,070
gone public it's had a double-digit
drawdown in that year uh the average

7784
01:59:50,070 --> 01:59:50,080
drawdown in that year uh the average
 

7785
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:52,550
drawdown in that year uh the average
is over 30 percent and one time it drew

7786
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:52,560
is over 30 percent and one time it drew
 

7787
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:55,189
is over 30 percent and one time it drew
down over 95 percent

7788
01:59:55,189 --> 01:59:55,199
down over 95 percent
 

7789
01:59:55,199 --> 01:59:57,189
down over 95 percent
sounds a lot like bitcoin right like oh

7790
01:59:57,189 --> 01:59:57,199
sounds a lot like bitcoin right like oh
 

7791
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:58,950
sounds a lot like bitcoin right like oh
wow this is crazy

7792
01:59:58,950 --> 01:59:58,960
wow this is crazy
 

7793
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:00,229
wow this is crazy
but it's one of the best performing

7794
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:00,239
but it's one of the best performing
 

7795
02:00:00,239 --> 02:00:01,750
but it's one of the best performing
stocks in the last 20 years if not the

7796
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:01,760
stocks in the last 20 years if not the
 

7797
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:03,350
stocks in the last 20 years if not the
best performing stock

7798
02:00:03,350 --> 02:00:03,360
best performing stock
 

7799
02:00:03,360 --> 02:00:05,669
best performing stock
and so volatility is not positive or

7800
02:00:05,669 --> 02:00:05,679
and so volatility is not positive or
 

7801
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:06,790
and so volatility is not positive or
negative

7802
02:00:06,790 --> 02:00:06,800
negative
 

7803
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:08,709
negative
it's positive or negative compared to

7804
02:00:08,709 --> 02:00:08,719
it's positive or negative compared to
 

7805
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:10,149
it's positive or negative compared to
the position you're in

7806
02:00:10,149 --> 02:00:10,159
the position you're in
 

7807
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:12,550
the position you're in
so if you're long and it's volatile to

7808
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
so if you're long and it's volatile to
 

7809
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,350
so if you're long and it's volatile to
the upside

7810
02:00:13,350 --> 02:00:13,360
the upside
 

7811
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,830
the upside
it's positive if you're long holding

7812
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:15,840
it's positive if you're long holding
 

7813
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:17,350
it's positive if you're long holding
something and it's volatile to the

7814
02:00:17,350 --> 02:00:17,360
something and it's volatile to the
 

7815
02:00:17,360 --> 02:00:17,990
something and it's volatile to the
downside

7816
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:18,000
downside
 

7817
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,430
downside
you see it as a negative it's all about

7818
02:00:19,430 --> 02:00:19,440
you see it as a negative it's all about
 

7819
02:00:19,440 --> 02:00:21,910
you see it as a negative it's all about
perspective with that said

7820
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:21,920
perspective with that said
 

7821
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:25,030
perspective with that said
um another way that i look at this is

7822
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:25,040
um another way that i look at this is
 

7823
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:28,149
um another way that i look at this is
every asset priced in bitcoin

7824
02:00:28,149 --> 02:00:28,159
every asset priced in bitcoin
 

7825
02:00:28,159 --> 02:00:31,990
every asset priced in bitcoin
is down significantly so over the last

7826
02:00:31,990 --> 02:00:32,000
is down significantly so over the last
 

7827
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:35,030
is down significantly so over the last
one three five years the dollar

7828
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:35,040
one three five years the dollar
 

7829
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:39,189
one three five years the dollar
priced in bitcoin has crashed 99

7830
02:00:39,189 --> 02:00:39,199
priced in bitcoin has crashed 99
 

7831
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,669
priced in bitcoin has crashed 99
if you denominate stocks it's down like

7832
02:00:41,669 --> 02:00:41,679
if you denominate stocks it's down like
 

7833
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:42,390
if you denominate stocks it's down like
80

7834

85 if you dominate gold if you

7836
02:00:44,790 --> 02:00:44,800
85 if you dominate gold if you
 

7837
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:46,470
85 if you dominate gold if you
denominate bonds if you just go down the

7838
02:00:46,470 --> 02:00:46,480
denominate bonds if you just go down the
 

7839
02:00:46,480 --> 02:00:48,870
denominate bonds if you just go down the
line real estate et cetera it's all down

7840
02:00:48,870 --> 02:00:48,880
line real estate et cetera it's all down
 

7841
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:51,990
line real estate et cetera it's all down
massively against bitcoin now you could

7842
02:00:51,990 --> 02:00:52,000
massively against bitcoin now you could
 

7843
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,030
massively against bitcoin now you could
argue that that's because

7844
02:00:53,030 --> 02:00:53,040
argue that that's because
 

7845
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:54,790
argue that that's because
bitcoin is appreciating in u.s dollar

7846
02:00:54,790 --> 02:00:54,800
bitcoin is appreciating in u.s dollar
 

7847
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:57,030
bitcoin is appreciating in u.s dollar
terms or you could actually

7848
02:00:57,030 --> 02:00:57,040
terms or you could actually
 

7849
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,990
terms or you could actually
argue that the world is repricing this

02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,000
argue that the world is repricing this

verse you know this dollar which is more

02:01:09,830 --> 02:01:09,840
verse you know this dollar which is more
 

7865
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:11,589
verse you know this dollar which is more
valuable and it continues to move up in

7866
02:01:11,589 --> 02:01:11,599
valuable and it continues to move up in

the world
 

7871
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:15,589
the world
ascribes to this some that's based on

7872
02:01:15,589 --> 02:01:15,599
ascribes to this some that's based on
 

7873
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:17,430
ascribes to this some that's based on
lindy effect just the longer it persists

02:01:17,430 --> 02:01:17,440
lindy effect just the longer it persists
 

7875
02:01:17,440 --> 02:01:19,350
lindy effect just the longer it persists
the more likely it is to survive

7876
02:01:19,350 --> 02:01:19,360
the more likely it is to survive
 

7877
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,709
the more likely it is to survive
some of that's based on like the

7878
02:01:20,709 --> 02:01:20,719
some of that's based on like the
 

7879
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:22,229
some of that's based on like the
underlying fundamentals of how much

7880
02:01:22,229 --> 02:01:22,239
underlying fundamentals of how much
 

7881

the usage transaction volume things like

7884
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:24,960
the usage transaction volume things like
 

7885
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:27,430
the usage transaction volume things like
that but some of it also

7886
02:01:27,430 --> 02:01:27,440
that but some of it also
 

7887
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,189
that but some of it also
is that as more and more people wake up

7888
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:29,199
is that as more and more people wake up
 

7889
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:30,870
is that as more and more people wake up
to the fact that it's a finite supply

7890
02:01:30,870 --> 02:01:30,880
to the fact that it's a finite supply
 

7891
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,950
to the fact that it's a finite supply
asset that has a place in the world

7892
02:01:32,950 --> 02:01:32,960
asset that has a place in the world
 

7893
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:34,870
asset that has a place in the world
and demand increases people just

7894
02:01:34,870 --> 02:01:34,880
and demand increases people just
 

7895
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:36,229
and demand increases people just
naturally compete and

7896
02:01:36,229 --> 02:01:36,239
naturally compete and
 

7897
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:38,550
naturally compete and
ascribe more value to it and so the

7898
02:01:38,550 --> 02:01:38,560
ascribe more value to it and so the
 

7899
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:39,990
ascribe more value to it and so the
volatility

7900
02:01:39,990 --> 02:01:40,000
volatility
 

7901
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:41,910
volatility
i think all comes back to like what do

7902
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:41,920
i think all comes back to like what do
 

7903
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:43,109
i think all comes back to like what do
you price

7904
02:01:43,109 --> 02:01:43,119
you price
 

7905
02:01:43,119 --> 02:01:44,870
you price
your life in for the majority of people

7906
02:01:44,870 --> 02:01:44,880
your life in for the majority of people
 

7907
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:46,470
your life in for the majority of people
that's dollars so you look at the us

7908
02:01:46,470 --> 02:01:46,480
that's dollars so you look at the us
 

7909
02:01:46,480 --> 02:01:49,189
that's dollars so you look at the us
dollar price you get all this volatility

7910
02:01:49,189 --> 02:01:49,199
dollar price you get all this volatility
 

7911
02:01:49,199 --> 02:01:51,350
dollar price you get all this volatility
the beauty of this is that 60 that

7912
02:01:51,350 --> 02:01:51,360
the beauty of this is that 60 that
 

7913
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,950
the beauty of this is that 60 that
doesn't move regardless of

7914
02:01:52,950 --> 02:01:52,960
doesn't move regardless of
 

7915
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:56,070
doesn't move regardless of
price upward or downward in movement

7916
02:01:56,070 --> 02:01:56,080
price upward or downward in movement
 

7917
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:57,030
price upward or downward in movement
those people aren't looking at the

7918
02:01:57,030 --> 02:01:57,040
those people aren't looking at the
 

7919
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:59,189
those people aren't looking at the
day-to-day price what they've basically

7920
02:01:59,189 --> 02:01:59,199
day-to-day price what they've basically
 

7921
02:01:59,199 --> 02:02:00,550
day-to-day price what they've basically
said is i've acquired x

7922
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:00,560
said is i've acquired x
 

7923
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,229
said is i've acquired x
amount of bitcoin and i'm just going to

7924
02:02:02,229 --> 02:02:02,239
amount of bitcoin and i'm just going to
 

7925
02:02:02,239 --> 02:02:03,990
amount of bitcoin and i'm just going to
hold it for years

7926
02:02:03,990 --> 02:02:04,000
hold it for years
 

7927
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:05,430
hold it for years
and every time somebody's done that

7928
02:02:05,430 --> 02:02:05,440
and every time somebody's done that
 

7929
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,750
and every time somebody's done that
right if you bought bitcoin at any point

7930
02:02:07,750 --> 02:02:07,760
right if you bought bitcoin at any point
 

7931
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:09,589
right if you bought bitcoin at any point
in the last 12 years and you held it

7932
02:02:09,589 --> 02:02:09,599
in the last 12 years and you held it
 

7933
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:13,750
in the last 12 years and you held it
till today you are up in us dollar terms

7934
02:02:13,750 --> 02:02:13,760
till today you are up in us dollar terms
 

7935
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:15,830
till today you are up in us dollar terms
now if we had this conversation 18

7936
02:02:15,830 --> 02:02:15,840
now if we had this conversation 18
 

7937
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:18,070
now if we had this conversation 18
months ago couldn't say that

7938
02:02:18,070 --> 02:02:18,080
months ago couldn't say that
 

7939
02:02:18,080 --> 02:02:20,310
months ago couldn't say that
so it's all about not only the

7940
02:02:20,310 --> 02:02:20,320
so it's all about not only the
 

7941
02:02:20,320 --> 02:02:21,189
so it's all about not only the
acquisition

7942
02:02:21,189 --> 02:02:21,199
acquisition
 

7943
02:02:21,199 --> 02:02:23,350
acquisition
price if you will it's also when are you

7944
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
price if you will it's also when are you
 

7945
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,229
price if you will it's also when are you
looking at it

7946
02:02:24,229 --> 02:02:24,239
looking at it
 

7947
02:02:24,239 --> 02:02:26,229
looking at it
right because there was a point in 2017

7948
02:02:26,229 --> 02:02:26,239
right because there was a point in 2017
 

7949
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:27,350
right because there was a point in 2017
you could have said the same thing but

7950
02:02:27,350 --> 02:02:27,360
you could have said the same thing but
 

7951
02:02:27,360 --> 02:02:28,709
you could have said the same thing but
in 18 you couldn't

7952
02:02:28,709 --> 02:02:28,719
in 18 you couldn't
 

7953
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:30,790
in 18 you couldn't
and so i tend to think a lot about

7954
02:02:30,790 --> 02:02:30,800
and so i tend to think a lot about
 

7955
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:32,070
and so i tend to think a lot about
humans are really really bad

7956
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:32,080
humans are really really bad
 

7957
02:02:32,080 --> 02:02:35,350
humans are really really bad
at short-term uh decision-making

7958
02:02:35,350 --> 02:02:35,360
at short-term uh decision-making
 

7959
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,030
at short-term uh decision-making
because we're so emotional especially

7960
02:02:37,030 --> 02:02:37,040
because we're so emotional especially
 

7961
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:38,550
because we're so emotional especially
when something has a price tied to it

7962
02:02:38,550 --> 02:02:38,560
when something has a price tied to it
 

7963
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:39,510
when something has a price tied to it
yeah so it's

7964
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:39,520
yeah so it's
 

7965
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:41,350
yeah so it's
in terms of our the strategies and

7966
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:41,360
in terms of our the strategies and
 

7967
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,030
in terms of our the strategies and
decision-making we should be long-term

7968
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:43,040
decision-making we should be long-term
 

7969
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:44,229
decision-making we should be long-term
and have like a regular

7970
02:02:44,229 --> 02:02:44,239
and have like a regular
 

7971
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:46,550
and have like a regular
almost think like an algorithm that in

7972
02:02:46,550 --> 02:02:46,560
almost think like an algorithm that in
 

7973
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:47,910
almost think like an algorithm that in
that in that kind of way

7974
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:47,920
that in that kind of way
 

7975
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,390
that in that kind of way
so i think you've tweeted that uh you

7976
02:02:50,390 --> 02:02:50,400
so i think you've tweeted that uh you
 

7977
02:02:50,400 --> 02:02:52,229
so i think you've tweeted that uh you
believe that bitcoin has a chance of

7978
02:02:52,229 --> 02:02:52,239
believe that bitcoin has a chance of
 

7979
02:02:52,239 --> 02:02:53,510
believe that bitcoin has a chance of
reaching one million i don't know what

7980
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
reaching one million i don't know what
 

7981
02:02:53,520 --> 02:02:57,030
reaching one million i don't know what
it is currently i think it's five

7982
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:57,040
it is currently i think it's five
 

7983
02:02:57,040 --> 02:03:00,070
it is currently i think it's five
which is incredible i

7984
02:03:00,070 --> 02:03:00,080
which is incredible i
 

7985
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,229
which is incredible i
think i remember when it was at least in

7986
02:03:02,229 --> 02:03:02,239
think i remember when it was at least in
 

7987
02:03:02,239 --> 02:03:04,070
think i remember when it was at least in
the double digits i think i remember was

7988
02:03:04,070 --> 02:03:04,080
the double digits i think i remember was
 

7989
02:03:04,080 --> 02:03:05,910
the double digits i think i remember was
in the signal digits of a dollar

7990
02:03:05,910 --> 02:03:05,920
in the signal digits of a dollar
 

7991
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,669
in the signal digits of a dollar
so the fact that it's across 50 is crazy

7992
02:03:09,669 --> 02:03:09,679
so the fact that it's across 50 is crazy
 

7993
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:13,189
so the fact that it's across 50 is crazy
uh but uh you're even crazier apparently

7994
02:03:13,189 --> 02:03:13,199
uh but uh you're even crazier apparently
 

7995
02:03:13,199 --> 02:03:15,189
uh but uh you're even crazier apparently
thinking that it can reach a million

7996
02:03:15,189 --> 02:03:15,199
thinking that it can reach a million
 

7997
02:03:15,199 --> 02:03:16,950
thinking that it can reach a million
so do you think it's possible for it to

7998
02:03:16,950 --> 02:03:16,960
so do you think it's possible for it to
 

7999
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:18,550
so do you think it's possible for it to
reach a million is there some kind of

8000
02:03:18,550 --> 02:03:18,560
reach a million is there some kind of
 

8001
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:19,669
reach a million is there some kind of
transformative effects

8002
02:03:19,669 --> 02:03:19,679
transformative effects
 

8003
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:21,990
transformative effects
we'll have to see first when might it

8004
02:03:21,990 --> 02:03:22,000
we'll have to see first when might it
 

8005
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:23,270
we'll have to see first when might it
reach a million like

8006
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,280
reach a million like
 

8007
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,109
reach a million like
what are the signs that we would look

8008
02:03:25,109 --> 02:03:25,119
what are the signs that we would look
 

8009
02:03:25,119 --> 02:03:26,950
what are the signs that we would look
for what's required for it to reach a

8010
02:03:26,950 --> 02:03:26,960
for what's required for it to reach a
 

8011
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,109
for what's required for it to reach a
million so let's just look at it from a

8012
02:03:29,109 --> 02:03:29,119
million so let's just look at it from a
 

8013
02:03:29,119 --> 02:03:29,750
million so let's just look at it from a
macro

8014
02:03:29,750 --> 02:03:29,760
macro
 

8015
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:32,310
macro
perspective uh gold is a 10 trillion

8016
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:32,320
perspective uh gold is a 10 trillion
 

8017
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:33,589
perspective uh gold is a 10 trillion
dollar asset

8018
02:03:33,589 --> 02:03:33,599
dollar asset
 

8019
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:35,510
dollar asset
and when you compare the technology of

8020
02:03:35,510 --> 02:03:35,520
and when you compare the technology of
 

8021
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:37,189
and when you compare the technology of
gold to the technology of

8022
02:03:37,189 --> 02:03:37,199
gold to the technology of
 

8023
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,189
gold to the technology of
bitcoin bitcoin is superior in every

8024
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:39,199
bitcoin bitcoin is superior in every
 

8025
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:40,709
bitcoin bitcoin is superior in every
single way right it's more

8026
02:03:40,709 --> 02:03:40,719
single way right it's more
 

8027
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:42,870
single way right it's more
portable it's more divisible uh it's

8028
02:03:42,870 --> 02:03:42,880
portable it's more divisible uh it's
 

8029
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:45,030
portable it's more divisible uh it's
more verifiable it's more scarce on

8030
02:03:45,030 --> 02:03:45,040
more verifiable it's more scarce on
 

8031
02:03:45,040 --> 02:03:47,589
more verifiable it's more scarce on
everything and so some people would

8032
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:47,599
everything and so some people would
 

8033
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:49,270
everything and so some people would
argue it's a 10x improvement some people

8034
02:03:49,270 --> 02:03:49,280
argue it's a 10x improvement some people
 

8035
02:03:49,280 --> 02:03:50,790
argue it's a 10x improvement some people
argue it's 100x improvement from a

8036
02:03:50,790 --> 02:03:50,800
argue it's 100x improvement from a
 

8037
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:52,390
argue it's 100x improvement from a
technology standpoint

8038
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:52,400
technology standpoint
 

8039
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:57,189
technology standpoint
and so we don't need bitcoin to actually

8040
02:03:57,189 --> 02:03:57,199
and so we don't need bitcoin to actually
 

8041
02:03:57,199 --> 02:04:00,310
and so we don't need bitcoin to actually
kind of um capture the full 10x or 100x

8042

kind of um capture the full 10x or 100x
 

8043
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:01,189
kind of um capture the full 10x or 100x
improvement from a

8044
02:04:01,189 --> 02:04:01,199
improvement from a
 

8045
02:04:01,199 --> 02:04:03,750
improvement from a
market cap standpoint if bitcoin simply

8046
02:04:03,750 --> 02:04:03,760
market cap standpoint if bitcoin simply
 

8047
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:04,390
market cap standpoint if bitcoin simply
captures

8048
02:04:04,390 --> 02:04:04,400
captures
 

8049
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:07,350

2x the value would be a 20 trillion

8050
02:04:07,350 --> 02:04:07,360
2x the value would be a 20 trillion
 

8051
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:08,709
2x the value would be a 20 trillion
dollar market cap which would put

8052
02:04:08,709 --> 02:04:08,719
dollar market cap which would put
 

8053
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:10,229
dollar market cap which would put
bitcoin at about a million dollars

8054
02:04:10,229 --> 02:04:10,239
bitcoin at about a million dollars
 

8055
02:04:10,239 --> 02:04:11,510
bitcoin at about a million dollars
right so kind of just from a macro

8056
02:04:11,510 --> 02:04:11,520
right so kind of just from a macro
 

8057
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,589
right so kind of just from a macro
perspective if you have a 10x or 100x

8058
02:04:13,589 --> 02:04:13,599
perspective if you have a 10x or 100x
 

8059
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:15,589
perspective if you have a 10x or 100x
improvement from a technology standpoint

8060
02:04:15,589 --> 02:04:15,599
improvement from a technology standpoint
 

8061
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:17,910
improvement from a technology standpoint
and you directionally get some value

8062
02:04:17,910 --> 02:04:17,920
and you directionally get some value
 

8063
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:19,430
and you directionally get some value
capture in that direction

8064
02:04:19,430 --> 02:04:19,440
capture in that direction
 

8065
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:21,750
capture in that direction
you're hitting around a million or more

8066
02:04:21,750 --> 02:04:21,760
you're hitting around a million or more
 

8067
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:23,030
you're hitting around a million or more
uh dollar price point

8068
02:04:23,030 --> 02:04:23,040
uh dollar price point
 

8069
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:25,510
uh dollar price point
you can ask a quick question which is uh

8070
02:04:25,510 --> 02:04:25,520
you can ask a quick question which is uh
 

8071
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:26,870
you can ask a quick question which is uh
what's the current market cap for

8072
02:04:26,870 --> 02:04:26,880
what's the current market cap for
 

8073
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:27,669
what's the current market cap for
bitcoin

8074
02:04:27,669 --> 02:04:27,679
bitcoin
 

8075
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:29,030
bitcoin
uh the current market cap's right around

8076
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:29,040
uh the current market cap's right around
 

8077
02:04:29,040 --> 02:04:30,629
uh the current market cap's right around
a trillion just over a trillion dollars

8078
02:04:30,629 --> 02:04:30,639
a trillion just over a trillion dollars
 

8079
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:31,030
a trillion just over a trillion dollars
and

8080
02:04:31,030 --> 02:04:31,040
and
 

8081
02:04:31,040 --> 02:04:33,990
and
you're saying gold is 10 trillion and uh

8082
02:04:33,990 --> 02:04:34,000
you're saying gold is 10 trillion and uh
 

8083
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:34,709
you're saying gold is 10 trillion and uh
i'm sorry

8084
02:04:34,709 --> 02:04:34,719
i'm sorry
 

8085
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:36,950
i'm sorry
where did you get the 20 trillion 20

8086
02:04:36,950 --> 02:04:36,960
where did you get the 20 trillion 20
 

8087
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:38,790
where did you get the 20 trillion 20
trillion would just be 2x cold's market

8088
02:04:38,790 --> 02:04:38,800
trillion would just be 2x cold's market
 

8089
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:39,669
trillion would just be 2x cold's market
cap

8090
02:04:39,669 --> 02:04:39,679
cap
 

8091
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:41,589
cap
got it right so if it's a 10x technology

8092
02:04:41,589 --> 02:04:41,599
got it right so if it's a 10x technology
 

8093
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:42,709
got it right so if it's a 10x technology
improvement let's just say it only

8094
02:04:42,709 --> 02:04:42,719
improvement let's just say it only
 

8095
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:44,310
improvement let's just say it only
captures 2x the market cap

8096
02:04:44,310 --> 02:04:44,320
captures 2x the market cap
 

8097
02:04:44,320 --> 02:04:46,790
captures 2x the market cap
got it right and so again if it was to

8098
02:04:46,790 --> 02:04:46,800
got it right and so again if it was to
 

8099
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:48,390
got it right and so again if it was to
capture just gold's market cap kind of

8100
02:04:48,390 --> 02:04:48,400
capture just gold's market cap kind of
 

8101
02:04:48,400 --> 02:04:49,030
capture just gold's market cap kind of
the equivalent

8102
02:04:49,030 --> 02:04:49,040
the equivalent
 

8103
02:04:49,040 --> 02:04:51,430
the equivalent
puts you around 500 000 right so you can

8104
02:04:51,430 --> 02:04:51,440
puts you around 500 000 right so you can
 

8105
02:04:51,440 --> 02:04:52,149
puts you around 500 000 right so you can
kind of see there's

8106
02:04:52,149 --> 02:04:52,159
kind of see there's
 

8107
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:54,470
kind of see there's
bitcoin so if you capture the entirety

8108
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:54,480
bitcoin so if you capture the entirety
 

8109
02:04:54,480 --> 02:04:55,990
bitcoin so if you capture the entirety
of the gold market

8110
02:04:55,990 --> 02:04:56,000
of the gold market
 

8111
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:58,229
of the gold market
uh then it would be value of single

8112
02:04:58,229 --> 02:04:58,239
uh then it would be value of single
 

8113
02:04:58,239 --> 02:05:00,229
uh then it would be value of single
bitcoin uh the price of a single bitcoin

8114
02:05:00,229 --> 02:05:00,239
bitcoin uh the price of a single bitcoin
 

8115
02:05:00,239 --> 02:05:02,069
bitcoin uh the price of a single bitcoin
would be 500

8116
02:05:02,069 --> 02:05:02,079
would be 500
 

8117
02:05:02,079 --> 02:05:05,830
would be 500
000 okay to reach a million it would be

8118
02:05:05,830 --> 02:05:05,840
000 okay to reach a million it would be
 

8119
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:06,950
000 okay to reach a million it would be
double that

8120
02:05:06,950 --> 02:05:06,960
double that
 

8121
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,629
double that
that's what the 20 trillion comes from

8122
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
that's what the 20 trillion comes from
 

8123
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,709
that's what the 20 trillion comes from
correct got it so if you then

8124
02:05:10,709 --> 02:05:10,719
correct got it so if you then
 

8125
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:14,229
correct got it so if you then
say to yourself okay how does the uh

8126
02:05:14,229 --> 02:05:14,239
say to yourself okay how does the uh
 

8127
02:05:14,239 --> 02:05:17,589
say to yourself okay how does the uh
the pricing um kind of cycles work right

8128
02:05:17,589 --> 02:05:17,599
the pricing um kind of cycles work right
 

8129
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:18,069
the pricing um kind of cycles work right
or

8130
02:05:18,069 --> 02:05:18,079
or
 

8131
02:05:18,079 --> 02:05:21,350
or
the boom and bust cycles gold

8132
02:05:21,350 --> 02:05:21,360
the boom and bust cycles gold
 

8133
02:05:21,360 --> 02:05:25,189
the boom and bust cycles gold
is a very kind of linear type

8134
02:05:25,189 --> 02:05:25,199
is a very kind of linear type
 

8135
02:05:25,199 --> 02:05:28,390
is a very kind of linear type

8136
02:05:28,390 --> 02:05:28,400
supply schedule meaning that there is a
 

8137
02:05:28,400 --> 02:05:29,589

uh in the beginning 50 bitcoin every 10
 

8171
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:01,669
uh in the beginning 50 bitcoin every 10
minutes was introduced into the supply

8172
02:06:01,669 --> 02:06:01,679
minutes was introduced into the supply
 

8173
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:03,430
minutes was introduced into the supply
after four years of that happening every

8174
02:06:03,430 --> 02:06:03,440
after four years of that happening every
 

8175
02:06:03,440 --> 02:06:05,430
after four years of that happening every
10 minutes it was cut in half

8176
02:06:05,430 --> 02:06:05,440
10 minutes it was cut in half
 

8177
02:06:05,440 --> 02:06:07,589
10 minutes it was cut in half
so on a in a single moment it went from

8178
02:06:07,589 --> 02:06:07,599
so on a in a single moment it went from
 

8179
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:09,350
so on a in a single moment it went from
50 to now it was 25.

50 to now it was 25.
four years every 10 minutes 25 got cut

8182
02:06:11,910 --> 02:06:11,920
four years every 10 minutes 25 got cut
 

8183
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:13,510
four years every 10 minutes 25 got cut
in half again to 12 and a half and then

that 900 bitcoin a day are coming into

8254
02:07:17,270 --> 02:07:17,280
that 900 bitcoin a day are coming into

that 900 bitcoin a day are coming into
the circulating supply

8256
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:18,800
the circulating supply
 

8257
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:21,189
the circulating supply
and so when you have 100 confidence

8258
02:07:21,189 --> 02:07:21,199
and so when you have 100 confidence
 

8259
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:22,629
and so when you have 100 confidence
because you can prove

8260
02:07:22,629 --> 02:07:22,639
because you can prove
 

8261
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:25,030
because you can prove
the supply side of this equation you can

8262
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:25,040
the supply side of this equation you can
 

8263
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,149
the supply side of this equation you can
hold it constant

8264
02:07:26,149 --> 02:07:26,159
hold it constant
 

8265
02:07:26,159 --> 02:07:29,270
hold it constant
i know with 100 accuracy the supply side

8266
02:07:29,270 --> 02:07:29,280
i know with 100 accuracy the supply side
 

8267
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:31,830
i know with 100 accuracy the supply side
so now i've reduced the mathematical

8268
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:31,840
so now i've reduced the mathematical
 

8269
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,750
so now i've reduced the mathematical
equation that i need to do to determine

8270
02:07:33,750 --> 02:07:33,760
equation that i need to do to determine
 

8271
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:34,870
equation that i need to do to determine
price movements

8272
02:07:34,870 --> 02:07:34,880
price movements
 

8273
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:37,109
price movements
to a 50 reduction i only have to worry

8274
02:07:37,109 --> 02:07:37,119
to a 50 reduction i only have to worry
 

8275
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:38,390
to a 50 reduction i only have to worry
about demand i don't have to worry about

8276
02:07:38,390 --> 02:07:38,400
about demand i don't have to worry about
 

8277
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:39,589
about demand i don't have to worry about
supply

8278
02:07:39,589 --> 02:07:39,599
supply
 

8279
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:41,270
supply
and so when i look at demand i can do

8280
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:41,280
and so when i look at demand i can do
 

8281
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,270
and so when i look at demand i can do
all kinds of things i can take the

8282
02:07:43,270 --> 02:07:43,280
all kinds of things i can take the
 

8283
02:07:43,280 --> 02:07:44,629
all kinds of things i can take the
demand over the last 10 years and the

8284
02:07:44,629 --> 02:07:44,639
demand over the last 10 years and the
 

8285
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:46,390
demand over the last 10 years and the
growth and just extrapolate it out i can

8286
02:07:46,390 --> 02:07:46,400
growth and just extrapolate it out i can
 

8287
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,950
growth and just extrapolate it out i can
increase it i can decrease it whatever

8288
02:07:48,950 --> 02:07:48,960
increase it i can decrease it whatever
 

8289
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:51,669
increase it i can decrease it whatever
but what you find is that these supply

8290
02:07:51,669 --> 02:07:51,679
but what you find is that these supply
 

8291
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:52,950
but what you find is that these supply
shocks

8292
02:07:52,950 --> 02:07:52,960
shocks
 

8293
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,589
shocks
lead to significant price appreciation

8294
02:07:55,589 --> 02:07:55,599
lead to significant price appreciation
 

8295
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:57,910
lead to significant price appreciation
as the asset gets repriced because there

8296
02:07:57,910 --> 02:07:57,920
as the asset gets repriced because there
 

8297
02:07:57,920 --> 02:07:59,830
as the asset gets repriced because there
there's a supply shock to it

8298
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
there's a supply shock to it
 

8299
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:02,310
there's a supply shock to it
and so probably the best thing that i've

8300
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:02,320
and so probably the best thing that i've
 

8301
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,069
and so probably the best thing that i've
done over the last couple of years was

8302
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:04,079
done over the last couple of years was
 

8303
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:06,790
done over the last couple of years was
in 2019 i started to talk about the idea

8304
02:08:06,790 --> 02:08:06,800
in 2019 i started to talk about the idea
 

8305
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:07,910
in 2019 i started to talk about the idea
that we were going to have both the

8306
02:08:07,910 --> 02:08:07,920
that we were going to have both the
 

8307
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:08,950
that we were going to have both the
supply shock

8308
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:08,960
supply shock
 

8309
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,109
supply shock
and the demand shock in 2021

8310
02:08:13,109 --> 02:08:13,119
and the demand shock in 2021
 

8311
02:08:13,119 --> 02:08:16,229
and the demand shock in 2021
or i'm sorry in 2020. i didn't know when

8312
02:08:16,229 --> 02:08:16,239
or i'm sorry in 2020. i didn't know when
 

8313
02:08:16,239 --> 02:08:17,589
or i'm sorry in 2020. i didn't know when
this bull market that we were in was

8314
02:08:17,589 --> 02:08:17,599
this bull market that we were in was
 

8315
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:19,669
this bull market that we were in was
gonna nobody knows right it's impossible

8316
02:08:19,669 --> 02:08:19,679
gonna nobody knows right it's impossible
 

8317
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:20,310
gonna nobody knows right it's impossible
to time

8318
02:08:20,310 --> 02:08:20,320
to time
 

8319
02:08:20,320 --> 02:08:21,750
to time
these things but you could tell that we

8320
02:08:21,750 --> 02:08:21,760
these things but you could tell that we
 

8321
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:23,589
these things but you could tell that we
were kind of at late stages of a cycle

8322
02:08:23,589 --> 02:08:23,599
were kind of at late stages of a cycle
 

8323
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:25,270
were kind of at late stages of a cycle
there was inverted yield curves there

8324
02:08:25,270 --> 02:08:25,280
there was inverted yield curves there
 

8325
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:27,910
there was inverted yield curves there
was re uh gyrations in the repo markets

the market turns over

8334
02:08:35,030 --> 02:08:35,040
the market turns over

02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:36,229
the market turns over
the government's gonna have to step in

we are addicted to stimulus they're

8338
02:08:37,910 --> 02:08:37,920
we are addicted to stimulus they're
 

8339
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:39,189
we are addicted to stimulus they're
gonna have to manipulate interest rates

8340
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
gonna have to manipulate interest rates
 

8341
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:40,149
gonna have to manipulate interest rates
down and they're gonna have to print

8342
02:08:40,149 --> 02:08:40,159
down and they're gonna have to print
 

8343
02:08:40,159 --> 02:08:41,109

that they were gonna have to step in in
 

8351
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,589
that they were gonna have to step in in
such an aggressive way and move rates

8352
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
such an aggressive way and move rates
 

8353
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:49,589
such an aggressive way and move rates
not down but down to zero

not down but down to zero
 

8355
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:50,870
not down but down to zero
and that they not only were going to

8356
02:08:50,870 --> 02:08:50,880
and that they not only were going to
 

8357
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:51,990
and that they not only were going to
print hundreds of billions but they

8358
02:08:51,990 --> 02:08:52,000
print hundreds of billions but they
 

8359
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,629
print hundreds of billions but they
could print trillions of dollars

8360
02:08:54,629 --> 02:08:54,639
could print trillions of dollars
 

8361
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:56,390
could print trillions of dollars
but the framework that i used to think

8362
02:08:56,390 --> 02:08:56,400
but the framework that i used to think
 

8363
02:08:56,400 --> 02:08:58,229
but the framework that i used to think
about this was when they

8364
02:08:58,229 --> 02:08:58,239
about this was when they
 

8365
02:08:58,239 --> 02:09:01,270
about this was when they
do that everyone is going to run

8366
02:09:01,270 --> 02:09:01,280
do that everyone is going to run
 

8367
02:09:01,280 --> 02:09:02,790
do that everyone is going to run
to store value assets they're going to

8368
02:09:02,790 --> 02:09:02,800
to store value assets they're going to
 

8369
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:03,830
to store value assets they're going to
run to gold they're going to run the

8370
02:09:03,830 --> 02:09:03,840
run to gold they're going to run the
 

8371
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:05,270
run to gold they're going to run the
bitcoin et cetera

8372
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:05,280
bitcoin et cetera
 

8373
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,510
bitcoin et cetera
and right as they do that it appears at

8374
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:07,520
and right as they do that it appears at
 

8375
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:08,790
and right as they do that it appears at
the same time there's going to be this

8376
02:09:08,790 --> 02:09:08,800
the same time there's going to be this
 

8377
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,069
the same time there's going to be this
supply shock so you're going to get a

8378
02:09:10,069 --> 02:09:10,079
supply shock so you're going to get a
 

8379
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:11,669
supply shock so you're going to get a
supply shock and a demand shock that are

8380
02:09:11,669 --> 02:09:11,679
supply shock and a demand shock that are
 

8381
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:13,270
supply shock and a demand shock that are
both positive for the price and i call

8382
02:09:13,270 --> 02:09:13,280
both positive for the price and i call
 

8383
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:15,910
both positive for the price and i call
it rocket fuel for bitcoin

8384
02:09:15,910 --> 02:09:15,920
it rocket fuel for bitcoin
 

8385
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:19,270
it rocket fuel for bitcoin
well it happened and here we are i now

8386
02:09:19,270 --> 02:09:19,280
well it happened and here we are i now
 

8387
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:20,629
well it happened and here we are i now
look for and i say okay

8388
02:09:20,629 --> 02:09:20,639
look for and i say okay
 

8389
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:22,149
look for and i say okay
we are likely going to see a hundred

8390
02:09:22,149 --> 02:09:22,159
we are likely going to see a hundred
 

8391
02:09:22,159 --> 02:09:23,430
we are likely going to see a hundred
thousand bitcoin a hundred thousand

8392
02:09:23,430 --> 02:09:23,440
thousand bitcoin a hundred thousand
 

8393
02:09:23,440 --> 02:09:25,030
thousand bitcoin a hundred thousand
dollar bitcoin this year right at some

8394
02:09:25,030 --> 02:09:25,040
dollar bitcoin this year right at some
 

8395
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:26,229
dollar bitcoin this year right at some
point i don't know when it happens but

8396
02:09:26,229 --> 02:09:26,239
point i don't know when it happens but
 

8397
02:09:26,239 --> 02:09:27,430
point i don't know when it happens but
we're moving in that city i think in

8398
02:09:27,430 --> 02:09:27,440
we're moving in that city i think in
 

8399
02:09:27,440 --> 02:09:30,629
we're moving in that city i think in
2021 we'll see a hundred thousand

8400
02:09:30,629 --> 02:09:30,639
2021 we'll see a hundred thousand
 

8401
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:32,790
2021 we'll see a hundred thousand
that would be uh my most conservative

8402
02:09:32,790 --> 02:09:32,800
that would be uh my most conservative
 

8403
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:33,990
that would be uh my most conservative
view uh i

8404
02:09:33,990 --> 02:09:34,000
view uh i
 

8405
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:35,510
view uh i
i've said a hundred thousand dollars

8406
02:09:35,510 --> 02:09:35,520
i've said a hundred thousand dollars
 

8407
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:38,149
i've said a hundred thousand dollars
since 2019 and people thought that was

8408
02:09:38,149 --> 02:09:38,159
since 2019 and people thought that was
 

8409
02:09:38,159 --> 02:09:40,790
since 2019 and people thought that was
insane and crazy and all stuff now i'm

8410
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:40,800
insane and crazy and all stuff now i'm
 

8411
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:41,990
insane and crazy and all stuff now i'm
the conservative guy in the room because

8412
02:09:41,990 --> 02:09:42,000
the conservative guy in the room because
 

8413
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:42,950
the conservative guy in the room because
i stick with the hundred thousand

8414
02:09:42,950 --> 02:09:42,960
i stick with the hundred thousand
 

8415
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:44,229
i stick with the hundred thousand
dollars and people are saying

8416
02:09:44,229 --> 02:09:44,239
dollars and people are saying
 

8417
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:47,189
dollars and people are saying
you know multiples of that number here

8418
02:09:47,189 --> 02:09:47,199
you know multiples of that number here
 

8419
02:09:47,199 --> 02:09:48,790
you know multiples of that number here
uh so we'll see what happens but

8420
02:09:48,790 --> 02:09:48,800
uh so we'll see what happens but
 

8421
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,310
uh so we'll see what happens but
but i think that there's still a lot of

8422
02:09:50,310 --> 02:09:50,320
but i think that there's still a lot of
 

8423
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:52,069
but i think that there's still a lot of
room kind of to run from a u.s dollar

8424
02:09:52,069 --> 02:09:52,079
room kind of to run from a u.s dollar
 

8425
02:09:52,079 --> 02:09:53,910
room kind of to run from a u.s dollar
price standpoint

8426
02:09:53,910 --> 02:09:53,920
price standpoint
 

8427
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,069
price standpoint
what is on the horizon is in 2024 we

8428
02:09:56,069 --> 02:09:56,079
what is on the horizon is in 2024 we
 

8429
02:09:56,079 --> 02:09:58,629
what is on the horizon is in 2024 we
will have another supply shock

8430
02:09:58,629 --> 02:09:58,639
will have another supply shock
 

8431
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:00,069
will have another supply shock
and so that's what i think will carry us

8432
02:10:00,069 --> 02:10:00,079
and so that's what i think will carry us
 

8433
02:10:00,079 --> 02:10:01,669
and so that's what i think will carry us
to the million dollar bitcoin from six

8434
02:10:01,669 --> 02:10:01,679
to the million dollar bitcoin from six
 

8435
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:03,189
to the million dollar bitcoin from six
to five to whatever

8436
02:10:03,189 --> 02:10:03,199
to five to whatever
 

8437
02:10:03,199 --> 02:10:05,669
to five to whatever
50 reduction yeah yeah and so that's

8438
02:10:05,669 --> 02:10:05,679
50 reduction yeah yeah and so that's
 

8439
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:06,390
50 reduction yeah yeah and so that's
what i think

8440
02:10:06,390 --> 02:10:06,400
what i think
 

8441
02:10:06,400 --> 02:10:07,910
what i think
uh we'll basically when we get that's

8442
02:10:07,910 --> 02:10:07,920
uh we'll basically when we get that's
 

8443
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:09,669
uh we'll basically when we get that's
that next supply shock that'll carry us

8444
02:10:09,669 --> 02:10:09,679
that next supply shock that'll carry us
 

8445
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:10,470
that next supply shock that'll carry us
up over 100

8446
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:10,480
up over 100
 

8447
02:10:10,480 --> 02:10:13,189
up over 100
or over a 1 million dollar bitcoin price

8448
02:10:13,189 --> 02:10:13,199
or over a 1 million dollar bitcoin price
 

8449
02:10:13,199 --> 02:10:14,069
or over a 1 million dollar bitcoin price
which

8450
02:10:14,069 --> 02:10:14,079
which
 

8451
02:10:14,079 --> 02:10:17,430
which
if historical examples persist and again

8452
02:10:17,430 --> 02:10:17,440
if historical examples persist and again
 

8453
02:10:17,440 --> 02:10:19,030
if historical examples persist and again
sometimes it's hard to use historical

8454
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:19,040
sometimes it's hard to use historical
 

8455
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:21,189
sometimes it's hard to use historical
examples to uh look at future

8456
02:10:21,189 --> 02:10:21,199
examples to uh look at future
 

8457
02:10:21,199 --> 02:10:23,510
examples to uh look at future
events um but if that happens we would

8458
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:23,520
events um but if that happens we would
 

8459
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,350
events um but if that happens we would
see a million dollars of bitcoin

8460
02:10:25,350 --> 02:10:25,360
see a million dollars of bitcoin
 

8461
02:10:25,360 --> 02:10:28,950
see a million dollars of bitcoin
by the end of 2026. after that wave

8462
02:10:28,950 --> 02:10:28,960
by the end of 2026. after that wave
 

8463
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:31,750
by the end of 2026. after that wave
so 2024 basically is the supply shock

8464
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:31,760
so 2024 basically is the supply shock
 

8465
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:32,390
so 2024 basically is the supply shock
and within

8466
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
and within
 

8467
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,870
and within
you know 18 to 24 months you would see

8468
02:10:34,870 --> 02:10:34,880
you know 18 to 24 months you would see
 

8469
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:35,750
you know 18 to 24 months you would see
the uh

8470
02:10:35,750 --> 02:10:35,760
the uh
 

8471
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:37,350
the uh
the kind of top of the next market

8472
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,360
the kind of top of the next market
 

8473
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,109
the kind of top of the next market
hopefully without a coupling to the net

8474
02:10:39,109 --> 02:10:39,119
hopefully without a coupling to the net
 

8475
02:10:39,119 --> 02:10:42,229
hopefully without a coupling to the net
to another pandemic yes we would like to

8476
02:10:42,229 --> 02:10:42,239
to another pandemic yes we would like to
 

8477
02:10:42,239 --> 02:10:43,990
to another pandemic yes we would like to
do all of this without a

8478
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
do all of this without a
 

8479
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,470
do all of this without a
public health crisis so that would take

8480
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:46,480
public health crisis so that would take
 

8481
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:47,189
public health crisis so that would take
it to

8482
02:10:47,189 --> 02:10:47,199
it to
 

8483
02:10:47,199 --> 02:10:50,069
it to
would uh 20 trillion you don't have to

8484
02:10:50,069 --> 02:10:50,079
would uh 20 trillion you don't have to
 

8485
02:10:50,079 --> 02:10:51,510
would uh 20 trillion you don't have to
compare it to the dollar

8486
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:51,520
compare it to the dollar
 

8487
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:54,069
compare it to the dollar
essentially in some sense that the

8488
02:10:54,069 --> 02:10:54,079
essentially in some sense that the
 

8489
02:10:54,079 --> 02:10:55,750
essentially in some sense that the
dollar could also lose value i mean

8490
02:10:55,750 --> 02:10:55,760
dollar could also lose value i mean
 

8491
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:57,350
dollar could also lose value i mean
there's a lot of kind of dynamics at

8492
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:57,360
there's a lot of kind of dynamics at
 

8493
02:10:57,360 --> 02:10:58,629
there's a lot of kind of dynamics at
play here

8494
02:10:58,629 --> 02:10:58,639
play here
 

8495
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:00,310
play here
now but like fundamentally there's going

8496
02:11:00,310 --> 02:11:00,320
now but like fundamentally there's going
 

8497
02:11:00,320 --> 02:11:01,990
now but like fundamentally there's going
to be a huge

8498
02:11:01,990 --> 02:11:02,000
to be a huge
 

8499
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:05,430
to be a huge
move in your prediction of value into

8500
02:11:05,430 --> 02:11:05,440
move in your prediction of value into
 

8501
02:11:05,440 --> 02:11:07,510
move in your prediction of value into
into bitcoin i mean that's a fascinating

8502
02:11:07,510 --> 02:11:07,520
into bitcoin i mean that's a fascinating
 

8503
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:10,310
into bitcoin i mean that's a fascinating
world to think about

8504
02:11:10,310 --> 02:11:10,320
world to think about
 

8505
02:11:10,320 --> 02:11:13,589
world to think about
uh i mean but i do have to kind of

8506
02:11:13,589 --> 02:11:13,599
uh i mean but i do have to kind of
 

8507
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:16,149
uh i mean but i do have to kind of
ask you about the whole space of

8508
02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:16,159
ask you about the whole space of
 

8509
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:17,270
ask you about the whole space of
technology there because

8510
02:11:17,270 --> 02:11:17,280
technology there because
 

8511
02:11:17,280 --> 02:11:18,470
technology there because
we're talking about the value of

8512
02:11:18,470 --> 02:11:18,480

right so i think again it's really

8586
02:12:38,550 --> 02:12:38,560
right so i think again it's really
 

8587
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:39,990
right so i think again it's really
important kind of who you

8588
02:12:39,990 --> 02:12:40,000
important kind of who you
 

8589
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:42,069
important kind of who you
ask is how you'll get that answer so

8590
02:12:42,069 --> 02:12:42,079
ask is how you'll get that answer so
 

8591
02:12:42,079 --> 02:12:43,030
ask is how you'll get that answer so
there's tiers

8592
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040
there's tiers
 

8593
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:44,870
there's tiers
and the way you divide those tiers might

8594
02:12:44,870 --> 02:12:44,880
and the way you divide those tiers might
 

8595
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:46,550
and the way you divide those tiers might
be different depending who you ask

8596
02:12:46,550 --> 02:12:46,560
be different depending who you ask
 

8597
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:48,470
be different depending who you ask
ultimately what it is is it's a meme

8598
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:48,480
ultimately what it is is it's a meme
 

8599
02:12:48,480 --> 02:12:50,229
ultimately what it is is it's a meme
yeah and it's used to

8600
02:12:50,229 --> 02:12:50,239
yeah and it's used to
 

8601
02:12:50,239 --> 02:12:53,589
yeah and it's used to
uh articulate the idea that

8602
02:12:53,589 --> 02:12:53,599
uh articulate the idea that
 

8603
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:54,950
uh articulate the idea that
whatever you want to put in that bucket

8604
02:12:54,950 --> 02:12:54,960
whatever you want to put in that bucket
 

8605
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:57,189
whatever you want to put in that bucket
has no value so [\h__\h] coin

8606
02:12:57,189 --> 02:12:57,199
has no value so [\h__\h] coin
 

8607

has no value so [\h__\h] coin
are coins that have no value yeah uh

8608

are coins that have no value yeah uh
 

8609
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:01,030
are coins that have no value yeah uh
what is fascinating

8610
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:01,040
what is fascinating
 

8611
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:03,109
what is fascinating
about it and i think that again speaks

8612
02:13:03,109 --> 02:13:03,119
about it and i think that again speaks
 

8613
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:05,030
about it and i think that again speaks

8714
02:14:40,229 --> 02:14:40,239
so what you have to do is you have to
 

8715
02:14:40,239 --> 02:14:41,510
so what you have to do is you have to
look at these technologies in these

8716
02:14:41,510 --> 02:14:41,520
look at these technologies in these
 

8717
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:43,109
look at these technologies in these
communities and say

8718
02:14:43,109 --> 02:14:43,119
communities and say
 

8719
02:14:43,119 --> 02:14:46,229
communities and say
well which volunteer teams or which

02:14:46,229 --> 02:14:46,239
well which volunteer teams or which
 

8721
02:14:46,239 --> 02:14:48,229
well which volunteer teams or which
technologies have been able to coalesce

8722
02:14:48,229 --> 02:14:48,239
technologies have been able to coalesce
 

8723
02:14:48,239 --> 02:14:49,910
technologies have been able to coalesce
these groups around it

8724
02:14:49,910 --> 02:14:49,920
these groups around it
 

8725
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:53,270
these groups around it
and in some way build the same level of

8726
02:14:53,270 --> 02:14:53,280
and in some way build the same level of
 

8727
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:53,990
and in some way build the same level of
engagement

8728
02:14:53,990 --> 02:14:54,000
engagement
 

8729
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:56,470
engagement
and protection and things like that and

02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:56,480
and protection and things like that and
 

8731
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:57,430
and protection and things like that and
so

8732
02:14:57,430 --> 02:14:57,440
so
 

8733
02:14:57,440 --> 02:14:59,830
so
you actually get tribalism but you also

8734
02:14:59,830 --> 02:14:59,840
you actually get tribalism but you also

or emotion it's math yeah you look at a
 

8869
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:28,389
or emotion it's math yeah you look at a
blockchain

8870
02:17:28,389 --> 02:17:28,399

and so it gives you a significant
 

9563
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:31,510
and so it gives you a significant
advantage and i think that um

9564
02:29:31,510 --> 02:29:31,520
advantage and i think that um
 

9565
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,670
advantage and i think that um

you know bill gates says that we

9590
02:29:54,389 --> 02:29:54,399
you know bill gates says that we
 

9591
02:29:54,399 --> 02:29:55,990
you know bill gates says that we
overestimate what we can do in one year

9592
02:29:55,990 --> 02:29:56,000
overestimate what we can do in one year
 

9593
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,510
overestimate what we can do in one year
underestimate what we can do in 10. well

9594
02:29:59,510 --> 02:29:59,520
underestimate what we can do in 10. well
 

9595
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:02,630
underestimate what we can do in 10. well
to me it's a kind of degree of

9596
02:30:02,630 --> 02:30:02,640
to me it's a kind of degree of
 

9597
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:05,910
to me it's a kind of degree of
uh mistake if you will 10 years maybe

9598
02:30:05,910 --> 02:30:05,920
uh mistake if you will 10 years maybe
 

9599
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:07,910
uh mistake if you will 10 years maybe
you're off by 10

9600
02:30:07,910 --> 02:30:07,920
you're off by 10
 

9601
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:10,070
you're off by 10
well if that line of progress continues

9602
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:10,080
well if that line of progress continues
 

9603
02:30:10,080 --> 02:30:11,830
well if that line of progress continues
20 years you may be off by

9604
02:30:11,830 --> 02:30:11,840
20 years you may be off by
 

9605
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:14,790
20 years you may be off by
100 and 30 years you may be off by a

9606
02:30:14,790 --> 02:30:14,800
100 and 30 years you may be off by a
 

9607
02:30:14,800 --> 02:30:15,590
100 and 30 years you may be off by a
thousand percent

9608
02:30:15,590 --> 02:30:15,600
thousand percent
 

9609
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:17,910
thousand percent
right like almost the further you go out

9610
02:30:17,910 --> 02:30:17,920
right like almost the further you go out
 

9611
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:20,469
right like almost the further you go out
the more inaccurate you become

9612
02:30:20,469 --> 02:30:20,479
the more inaccurate you become
 

9613
02:30:20,479 --> 02:30:23,830
the more inaccurate you become
and so i think that people who

9614
02:30:23,830 --> 02:30:23,840
and so i think that people who
 

9615
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:25,830
and so i think that people who
want to iterate their way to success

9616
02:30:25,830 --> 02:30:25,840
want to iterate their way to success
 

9617
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:27,190
want to iterate their way to success
right that's a common thing in like the

9618
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:27,200
right that's a common thing in like the
 

9619
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:29,030
right that's a common thing in like the
startup world

all these innovators
 

9635
02:30:42,800 --> 02:30:45,030
all these innovators
they actually say to themselves there is

a point in time
 

9639
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:48,469
a point in time
in the future where there's a world i

9640

in the future where there's a world i
 

9641
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:50,070
in the future where there's a world i
want to construct

9642
02:30:50,070 --> 02:30:50,080
want to construct
 

9643
02:30:50,080 --> 02:30:52,389
want to construct
and then they go and they construct it

9644
02:30:52,389 --> 02:30:52,399
and then they go and they construct it
 

9645
02:30:52,399 --> 02:30:53,830
and then they go and they construct it
regardless of

02:30:56,240 --> 02:30:57,750

it is just they're driving towards that

it is just they're driving towards that

do you have thoughts about like the long

lasting fundamental aspects of nfts
 

9689
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:40,230

i think there's probably both things

9690
02:31:40,230 --> 02:31:40,240
i think there's probably both things
 

9691
02:31:40,240 --> 02:31:43,110
i think there's probably both things
happening fad and things to learn

02:31:43,110 --> 02:31:43,120
happening fad and things to learn
 

9693
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:46,710
happening fad and things to learn
right and um if we just start with like

9694
02:31:46,710 --> 02:31:46,720
right and um if we just start with like
 

9695
02:31:46,720 --> 02:31:49,429
right and um if we just start with like
what is an nft it's a non-fungible token

9696
02:31:49,429 --> 02:31:49,439
what is an nft it's a non-fungible token
 

9697
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:50,389
what is an nft it's a non-fungible token
meaning that

9698
02:31:50,389 --> 02:31:50,399
meaning that
 

9699
02:31:50,399 --> 02:31:52,070
meaning that
um there's no fungibility and

9700
02:31:52,070 --> 02:31:52,080
um there's no fungibility and
 

9701
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:53,510
um there's no fungibility and
fungibility is a

9702
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
fungibility is a
 

9703
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:56,230
fungibility is a
fancy word i always describe it as if i

9704
02:31:56,230 --> 02:31:56,240
fancy word i always describe it as if i
 

9705
02:31:56,240 --> 02:31:57,510
fancy word i always describe it as if i
took a hundred dollar bill and i put it

9706
02:31:57,510 --> 02:31:57,520
took a hundred dollar bill and i put it
 

9707
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:58,550
took a hundred dollar bill and i put it
on the table with a bunch of other

9708
02:31:58,550 --> 02:31:58,560
on the table with a bunch of other
 

9709
02:31:58,560 --> 02:31:59,830
on the table with a bunch of other
hundred dollar bills and we mixed them

9710
02:31:59,830 --> 02:31:59,840
hundred dollar bills and we mixed them
 

9711
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:00,070
hundred dollar bills and we mixed them
up

9712
02:32:00,070 --> 02:32:00,080
up
 

9713
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:01,429
up
and i just grabbed a hundred dollar bill

9714
02:32:01,429 --> 02:32:01,439
and i just grabbed a hundred dollar bill
 

9715
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:03,830
and i just grabbed a hundred dollar bill
and left i'm no worse as long as they're

9716
02:32:03,830 --> 02:32:03,840
and left i'm no worse as long as they're
 

9717
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:04,309
and left i'm no worse as long as they're
all

9718
02:32:04,309 --> 02:32:04,319
all
 

9719
02:32:04,319 --> 02:32:05,990
all
you know uh official hundred dollar

9720
02:32:05,990 --> 02:32:06,000
you know uh official hundred dollar
 

9721
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,830
you know uh official hundred dollar
bills because as long as i have 100

9722
02:32:07,830 --> 02:32:07,840
bills because as long as i have 100
 

9723
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:10,150
bills because as long as i have 100
500 i don't need that exact same bill

9724
02:32:10,150 --> 02:32:10,160
500 i don't need that exact same bill
 

9725
02:32:10,160 --> 02:32:11,510
500 i don't need that exact same bill
back so that means that those hundred

9726
02:32:11,510 --> 02:32:11,520
back so that means that those hundred
 

9727
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,270
back so that means that those hundred
dollar bills are fungible

9728
02:32:13,270 --> 02:32:13,280
dollar bills are fungible
 

9729
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:15,750
dollar bills are fungible
non-fungible would be like art if i took

9730
02:32:15,750 --> 02:32:15,760
non-fungible would be like art if i took
 

9731
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:17,510
non-fungible would be like art if i took
a picasso and i put it down on the table

9732
02:32:17,510 --> 02:32:17,520
a picasso and i put it down on the table
 

9733
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:18,870
a picasso and i put it down on the table
and you brought three artists that no

9734
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:18,880
and you brought three artists that no
 

9735
02:32:18,880 --> 02:32:20,230
and you brought three artists that no
one's ever heard of before and we mixed

9736
02:32:20,230 --> 02:32:20,240
one's ever heard of before and we mixed
 

9737
02:32:20,240 --> 02:32:20,710
one's ever heard of before and we mixed
them up

9738
02:32:20,710 --> 02:32:20,720
them up
 

9739
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:22,150
them up
and i just took any random piece of art

9740
02:32:22,150 --> 02:32:22,160
and i just took any random piece of art
 

9741
02:32:22,160 --> 02:32:24,309
and i just took any random piece of art
it wasn't the picasso i lose because the

9742
02:32:24,309 --> 02:32:24,319
it wasn't the picasso i lose because the
 

9743
02:32:24,319 --> 02:32:25,670
it wasn't the picasso i lose because the
picasso is really important there right

9744
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:25,680
picasso is really important there right
 

9745
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:26,070
picasso is really important there right
so the

9746
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:26,080
so the
 

9747
02:32:26,080 --> 02:32:28,710
so the
non-fungibility is important in art what

9748
02:32:28,710 --> 02:32:28,720
non-fungibility is important in art what
 

9749
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:30,309
non-fungibility is important in art what
these non-fungible tokens essentially

9750
02:32:30,309 --> 02:32:30,319
these non-fungible tokens essentially
 

9751
02:32:30,319 --> 02:32:30,870
these non-fungible tokens essentially
are doing

9752
02:32:30,870 --> 02:32:30,880
are doing
 

9753
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:35,030
are doing
is they are creating scarcity

9754
02:32:35,030 --> 02:32:35,040
is they are creating scarcity
 

9755
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:38,230
is they are creating scarcity
and originality in a digital environment

9756
02:32:38,230 --> 02:32:38,240
and originality in a digital environment
 

9757
02:32:38,240 --> 02:32:40,950
and originality in a digital environment
and what i mean by that is um take a

9758
02:32:40,950 --> 02:32:40,960
and what i mean by that is um take a
 

9759
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:41,990
and what i mean by that is um take a
music file

9760
02:32:41,990 --> 02:32:42,000
music file
 

9761
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,070
music file
if i had a music file and you wanted it

9762
02:32:44,070 --> 02:32:44,080
if i had a music file and you wanted it
 

9763
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:45,110
if i had a music file and you wanted it
you said send it to me

9764
02:32:45,110 --> 02:32:45,120
you said send it to me
 

9765
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:47,270
you said send it to me
i press send it essentially creates a

9766
02:32:47,270 --> 02:32:47,280
i press send it essentially creates a
 

9767
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:49,349
i press send it essentially creates a
copy and you get one music file i get

9768
02:32:49,349 --> 02:32:49,359
copy and you get one music file i get
 

9769
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:50,070
copy and you get one music file i get
another

9770
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:50,080
another
 

9771
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:51,190
another
we don't care you can listen to the

9772
02:32:51,190 --> 02:32:51,200
we don't care you can listen to the
 

9773
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:52,550
we don't care you can listen to the
music i can listen to music we're super

9774
02:32:52,550 --> 02:32:52,560
music i can listen to music we're super
 

9775
02:32:52,560 --> 02:32:53,830
music i can listen to music we're super
happy

9776
02:32:53,830 --> 02:32:53,840
happy
 

9777
02:32:53,840 --> 02:32:57,190
happy
if i instead though have a digital file

9778
02:32:57,190 --> 02:32:57,200
if i instead though have a digital file
 

9779
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:01,429
if i instead though have a digital file
that entire premise is based on scarcity

9780
02:33:01,429 --> 02:33:01,439
that entire premise is based on scarcity
 

9781
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:03,190
that entire premise is based on scarcity
and i hit send and you get a copy and i

9782
02:33:03,190 --> 02:33:03,200
and i hit send and you get a copy and i
 

9783
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,230
and i hit send and you get a copy and i
keep the original or you get the

9784
02:33:04,230 --> 02:33:04,240
keep the original or you get the
 

9785
02:33:04,240 --> 02:33:05,590
keep the original or you get the
original i get a copy

9786
02:33:05,590 --> 02:33:05,600
original i get a copy
 

9787
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:08,870
original i get a copy
there's a problem and so ultimately

9788
02:33:08,870 --> 02:33:08,880
there's a problem and so ultimately
 

9789
02:33:08,880 --> 02:33:11,670
there's a problem and so ultimately
what i think is playing out with nfts is

9790
02:33:11,670 --> 02:33:11,680
what i think is playing out with nfts is
 

9791
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:12,950
what i think is playing out with nfts is
it's a technology

9792
02:33:12,950 --> 02:33:12,960
it's a technology
 

9793
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,190
it's a technology
regardless of where it plays out from

9794
02:33:15,190 --> 02:33:15,200
regardless of where it plays out from
 

9795
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:17,030
regardless of where it plays out from
blockchains or

9796
02:33:17,030 --> 02:33:17,040
blockchains or
 

9797
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,750
blockchains or
what in communities or environments that

9798
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:19,760
what in communities or environments that
 

9799
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:20,870
what in communities or environments that
just brings

9800
02:33:20,870 --> 02:33:20,880
just brings
 

9801
02:33:20,880 --> 02:33:25,030
just brings
true digital scarcity to the internet

9802
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:25,040
true digital scarcity to the internet
 

9803
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:26,630
true digital scarcity to the internet
and so naturally what do people do they

9804
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
and so naturally what do people do they
 

9805
02:33:26,640 --> 02:33:28,230
and so naturally what do people do they
look at the legacy world and they say

9806
02:33:28,230 --> 02:33:28,240
look at the legacy world and they say
 

9807
02:33:28,240 --> 02:33:30,389
look at the legacy world and they say
well what's scarce there that has value

9808
02:33:30,389 --> 02:33:30,399
well what's scarce there that has value
 

9809
02:33:30,399 --> 02:33:31,830
well what's scarce there that has value
how do we bring that to the digital

9810
02:33:31,830 --> 02:33:31,840
how do we bring that to the digital
 

9811
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:33,750
how do we bring that to the digital
world so art is a perfect example right

9812
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:33,760
world so art is a perfect example right
 

9813
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:34,230
world so art is a perfect example right
and

9814
02:33:34,230 --> 02:33:34,240
and
 

9815
02:33:34,240 --> 02:33:36,230
and
you know frankly last year i started to

9816
02:33:36,230 --> 02:33:36,240
you know frankly last year i started to
 

9817
02:33:36,240 --> 02:33:37,830
you know frankly last year i started to
look at this because it felt like this

9818
02:33:37,830 --> 02:33:37,840
look at this because it felt like this
 

9819
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:40,230
look at this because it felt like this
was going to be really really big

9820
02:33:40,230 --> 02:33:40,240
was going to be really really big
 

9821
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:43,830
was going to be really really big
and the conclusion i came to was

9822
02:33:43,830 --> 02:33:43,840
and the conclusion i came to was
 

9823
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:45,830
and the conclusion i came to was
just as bitcoin is going to be bigger

9824
02:33:45,830 --> 02:33:45,840
just as bitcoin is going to be bigger
 

9825
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:47,750
just as bitcoin is going to be bigger
than gold right the digital

9826
02:33:47,750 --> 02:33:47,760
than gold right the digital
 

9827
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:49,270
than gold right the digital
application of something is going to be

9828
02:33:49,270 --> 02:33:49,280
application of something is going to be
 

9829
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:50,870
application of something is going to be
bigger than the analog application

9830
02:33:50,870 --> 02:33:50,880
bigger than the analog application
 

9831
02:33:50,880 --> 02:33:51,990
bigger than the analog application
the same thing is going to be true in

9832
02:33:51,990 --> 02:33:52,000
the same thing is going to be true in
 

9833
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:54,150
the same thing is going to be true in
art the digital art world is going to be

9834
02:33:54,150 --> 02:33:54,160
art the digital art world is going to be
 

9835
02:33:54,160 --> 02:33:56,070
art the digital art world is going to be
bigger than the traditional art world

9836
02:33:56,070 --> 02:33:56,080
bigger than the traditional art world
 

9837
02:33:56,080 --> 02:33:57,590
bigger than the traditional art world
people think that sounds crazy at first

9838
02:33:57,590 --> 02:33:57,600
people think that sounds crazy at first
 

9839
02:33:57,600 --> 02:33:59,110
people think that sounds crazy at first
until you start to realize

9840
02:33:59,110 --> 02:33:59,120
until you start to realize
 

9841
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:01,510
until you start to realize
it's very very similar the yard is more

9842
02:34:01,510 --> 02:34:01,520
it's very very similar the yard is more
 

9843
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:02,389
it's very very similar the yard is more
portable

9844
02:34:02,389 --> 02:34:02,399
portable
 

9845
02:34:02,399 --> 02:34:04,630
portable
it can be divisible right it's got a

9846
02:34:04,630 --> 02:34:04,640
it can be divisible right it's got a
 

9847
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,389
it can be divisible right it's got a
larger demand market in terms of the

9848
02:34:06,389 --> 02:34:06,399
larger demand market in terms of the
 

9849
02:34:06,399 --> 02:34:07,429
larger demand market in terms of the
internet rather than an

9850
02:34:07,429 --> 02:34:07,439
internet rather than an
 

9851
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:09,110
internet rather than an
auction right all this kind of stuff

9852
02:34:09,110 --> 02:34:09,120
auction right all this kind of stuff
 

9853
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:10,630
auction right all this kind of stuff
when you display it

9854
02:34:10,630 --> 02:34:10,640
when you display it
 

9855
02:34:10,640 --> 02:34:13,750
when you display it
it can have motion and music and all of

9856
02:34:13,750 --> 02:34:13,760
it can have motion and music and all of
 

9857
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:14,150
it can have motion and music and all of
these

9858
02:34:14,150 --> 02:34:14,160
these
 

9859
02:34:14,160 --> 02:34:15,750
these
aspects to it that are better than the

9860
02:34:15,750 --> 02:34:15,760
aspects to it that are better than the
 

9861
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:17,270
aspects to it that are better than the
traditional art

9862
02:34:17,270 --> 02:34:17,280
traditional art
 

9863
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:18,710
traditional art
what the traditional art market has that

9864
02:34:18,710 --> 02:34:18,720
what the traditional art market has that
 

9865
02:34:18,720 --> 02:34:20,550
what the traditional art market has that
the digital art market has not had

9866
02:34:20,550 --> 02:34:20,560
the digital art market has not had
 

9867
02:34:20,560 --> 02:34:23,830
the digital art market has not had
is the narrative narrative-based world

9868
02:34:23,830 --> 02:34:23,840
is the narrative narrative-based world
 

9869
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:26,870
is the narrative narrative-based world
scarcity kind of in a digital sense

9870
02:34:26,870 --> 02:34:26,880
scarcity kind of in a digital sense
 

9871
02:34:26,880 --> 02:34:29,990
scarcity kind of in a digital sense
and so what i think the entire world

9872
02:34:29,990 --> 02:34:30,000
and so what i think the entire world
 

9873
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:31,510
and so what i think the entire world
is going through right now is an

9874
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:31,520
is going through right now is an
 

9875
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:33,349
is going through right now is an
exploration of how do we use this

9876
02:34:33,349 --> 02:34:33,359
exploration of how do we use this
 

9877
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:34,469
exploration of how do we use this
technology

9878
02:34:34,469 --> 02:34:34,479
technology
 

9879
02:34:34,479 --> 02:34:37,590
technology
to create new things

9880
02:34:37,590 --> 02:34:37,600
to create new things
 

9881
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:39,110
to create new things
frankly we're not going to be good at it

9882
02:34:39,110 --> 02:34:39,120
frankly we're not going to be good at it
 

9883
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:41,110
frankly we're not going to be good at it
for a while and so

9884
02:34:41,110 --> 02:34:41,120
for a while and so
 

9885
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:43,670
for a while and so
the only place i've really focused on is

9886
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:43,680
the only place i've really focused on is
 

9887
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:45,590
the only place i've really focused on is
digital art itself

9888
02:34:45,590 --> 02:34:45,600
digital art itself
 

9889
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:48,950
digital art itself
and i've always been interested in art

9890
02:34:48,950 --> 02:34:48,960
and i've always been interested in art
 

9891
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:51,030
and i've always been interested in art
but i wasn't going to go buy a painting

9892
02:34:51,030 --> 02:34:51,040
but i wasn't going to go buy a painting
 

9893
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:52,070
but i wasn't going to go buy a painting
and hang it on the wall

9894
02:34:52,070 --> 02:34:52,080
and hang it on the wall
 

9895
02:34:52,080 --> 02:34:53,830
and hang it on the wall
right in the sense of that's how i was

9896
02:34:53,830 --> 02:34:53,840
right in the sense of that's how i was
 

9897
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:55,750
right in the sense of that's how i was
going to store value

9898
02:34:55,750 --> 02:34:55,760
going to store value
 

9899
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:57,990
going to store value
what i find fascinating though is that i

9900
02:34:57,990 --> 02:34:58,000
what i find fascinating though is that i
 

9901
02:34:58,000 --> 02:34:59,349
what i find fascinating though is that i
now can take

9902
02:34:59,349 --> 02:34:59,359
now can take
 

9903
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:01,429
now can take
that concept which most of the

9904
02:35:01,429 --> 02:35:01,439
that concept which most of the
 

9905
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:02,870
that concept which most of the
wealthiest people in the world

9906
02:35:02,870 --> 02:35:02,880
wealthiest people in the world
 

9907
02:35:02,880 --> 02:35:04,389
wealthiest people in the world
have a significant portion some you know

9908
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:04,399
have a significant portion some you know
 

9909
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:06,389
have a significant portion some you know
some people have 20 percent in terms of

9910
02:35:06,389 --> 02:35:06,399
some people have 20 percent in terms of
 

9911
02:35:06,399 --> 02:35:07,910
some people have 20 percent in terms of
you know number of billionaires

9912
02:35:07,910 --> 02:35:07,920
you know number of billionaires
 

9913
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:10,950
you know number of billionaires
20 of their wealth is in art and you can

9914
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:10,960
20 of their wealth is in art and you can
 

9915
02:35:10,960 --> 02:35:12,070
20 of their wealth is in art and you can
bring to this digital realm

9916
02:35:12,070 --> 02:35:12,080
bring to this digital realm
 

9917
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:15,110
bring to this digital realm
which is much more um kind of natural to

9918
02:35:15,110 --> 02:35:15,120
which is much more um kind of natural to
 

9919
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:16,790
which is much more um kind of natural to
a digital native

9920
02:35:16,790 --> 02:35:16,800
a digital native
 

9921
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:18,389
a digital native
and so the best way to know how to

9922
02:35:18,389 --> 02:35:18,399
and so the best way to know how to
 

9923
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:20,150
and so the best way to know how to
describe the importance is

9924
02:35:20,150 --> 02:35:20,160
describe the importance is
 

9925
02:35:20,160 --> 02:35:22,790
describe the importance is
imagine a serial number being placed on

9926
02:35:22,790 --> 02:35:22,800
imagine a serial number being placed on
 

9927
02:35:22,800 --> 02:35:23,750
imagine a serial number being placed on
something

9928
02:35:23,750 --> 02:35:23,760
something
 

9929
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:26,070
something
take the eiffel tower the only eiffel

9930
02:35:26,070 --> 02:35:26,080
take the eiffel tower the only eiffel
 

9931
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:28,469
take the eiffel tower the only eiffel
tower that has value is the first one

9932
02:35:28,469 --> 02:35:28,479
tower that has value is the first one
 

9933
02:35:28,479 --> 02:35:30,870
tower that has value is the first one
every replica of it regardless of size

9934
02:35:30,870 --> 02:35:30,880
every replica of it regardless of size
 

9935
02:35:30,880 --> 02:35:31,830
every replica of it regardless of size
location

9936
02:35:31,830 --> 02:35:31,840
location
 

9937
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:33,750
location
you know who made it where they sent it

9938
02:35:33,750 --> 02:35:33,760
you know who made it where they sent it
 

9939
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,790
you know who made it where they sent it
they have no value

9940
02:35:35,790 --> 02:35:35,800
they have no value
 

9941
02:35:35,800 --> 02:35:38,389
they have no value
eiffeltower001 is the most important and

9942
02:35:38,389 --> 02:35:38,399
eiffeltower001 is the most important and
 

9943
02:35:38,399 --> 02:35:39,990
eiffeltower001 is the most important and
so i think that's ultimately what we're

9944
02:35:39,990 --> 02:35:40,000
so i think that's ultimately what we're
 

9945
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:41,270
so i think that's ultimately what we're
starting to see here

9946
02:35:41,270 --> 02:35:41,280
starting to see here
 

9947
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:43,830
starting to see here
and what we're looking at is probably

9948
02:35:43,830 --> 02:35:43,840
and what we're looking at is probably
 

9949
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:45,349
and what we're looking at is probably
one percent of what it's going to grow

9950
02:35:45,349 --> 02:35:45,359

strip away all the applications right
 

9965
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:58,389
strip away all the applications right
now and just think about

9966
02:35:58,389 --> 02:35:58,399
now and just think about
 

9967
02:35:58,399 --> 02:35:59,670
now and just think about
is digital scarcity going to be

9968
02:35:59,670 --> 02:35:59,680
is digital scarcity going to be
 

9969
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:01,190
is digital scarcity going to be
important on the internet right moving

9970
02:36:01,190 --> 02:36:01,200
important on the internet right moving
 

9971
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:02,469
important on the internet right moving
all the things that are scarce in the

all the things that are scarce in the
 

9973
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:04,230
all the things that are scarce in the
physical world into digital space

us trying to figure out which things can

9976
02:36:05,830 --> 02:36:05,840
us trying to figure out which things can
 

9977
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:08,230
us trying to figure out which things can
be moved and not and also there's things

9978
02:36:08,230 --> 02:36:08,240
be moved and not and also there's things
 

9979
02:36:08,240 --> 02:36:09,670
be moved and not and also there's things
in the digital space just like you're

9980
02:36:09,670 --> 02:36:09,680
in the digital space just like you're
 

9981
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:11,429
in the digital space just like you're
saying that don't exist in the physical

9982
02:36:11,429 --> 02:36:11,439
saying that don't exist in the physical
 

9983
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:12,070
saying that don't exist in the physical
world that

9984

world that
 

9985
02:36:12,080 --> 02:36:15,429
world that
might also benefit from gaining scarcity

9986
02:36:15,429 --> 02:36:15,439
might also benefit from gaining scarcity
 

9987
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:17,590
might also benefit from gaining scarcity
like you know people are i guess

9988
02:36:17,590 --> 02:36:17,600
like you know people are i guess

the all of the markets we see as
 

10021
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:56,630
the all of the markets we see as
financial markets and just turn

10022
02:36:56,630 --> 02:36:56,640
financial markets and just turn
 

10023
02:36:56,640 --> 02:36:58,230
financial markets and just turn
everything into a market

everything into a market
 

10025
02:36:58,240 --> 02:37:01,110
everything into a market
well so if i if i take you on like a i

10026
02:37:01,110 --> 02:37:01,120
well so if i if i take you on like a i
 

10027

well so if i if i take you on like a i
don't know

02:37:01,590 --> 02:37:01,600
don't know
 

10029
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:04,630
don't know
10 year fast forward yeah and i paint a

10030
02:37:04,630 --> 02:37:04,640
10 year fast forward yeah and i paint a
 

10031
02:37:04,640 --> 02:37:05,830
10 year fast forward yeah and i paint a
picture of

10032
02:37:05,830 --> 02:37:05,840
picture of
 

10033
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:07,429
picture of
something today that seems absolutely

10034
02:37:07,429 --> 02:37:07,439
something today that seems absolutely
 

10035
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:09,429
something today that seems absolutely
insane but there's early signs that

10036
02:37:09,429 --> 02:37:09,439
insane but there's early signs that
 

10037
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:11,349
insane but there's early signs that
people are building this and let's just

10038
02:37:11,349 --> 02:37:11,359
people are building this and let's just
 

10039
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:12,550
people are building this and let's just
give them the benefit of the doubt that

10040
02:37:12,550 --> 02:37:12,560
give them the benefit of the doubt that
 

10041
02:37:12,560 --> 02:37:14,070
give them the benefit of the doubt that
some of the early iterations will work

10042
02:37:14,070 --> 02:37:14,080
some of the early iterations will work
 

10043
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:17,030
some of the early iterations will work
and some of or most of them won't

10044
02:37:17,030 --> 02:37:17,040
and some of or most of them won't
 

10045
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:19,830
and some of or most of them won't
there's a world where you and i are

10046
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:19,840
there's a world where you and i are
 

10047
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:21,830
there's a world where you and i are
participating in a digital economy

10048
02:37:21,830 --> 02:37:21,840
participating in a digital economy
 

10049
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:25,190
participating in a digital economy
in a virtual world where uh whether it

10050
02:37:25,190 --> 02:37:25,200
in a virtual world where uh whether it
 

10051
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:26,309
in a virtual world where uh whether it
is a piece of art

10052
02:37:26,309 --> 02:37:26,319
is a piece of art
 

10053
02:37:26,319 --> 02:37:28,950
is a piece of art
it is a digital sculpture it is a

10054
02:37:28,950 --> 02:37:28,960
it is a digital sculpture it is a
 

10055
02:37:28,960 --> 02:37:29,590
it is a digital sculpture it is a

skin from a video game it is a digital
 

10059
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:33,270
skin from a video game it is a digital
good

10060
02:37:33,270 --> 02:37:33,280
good
 

10061
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:36,309
good
that we purchased somewhere online

10062
02:37:36,309 --> 02:37:36,319
that we purchased somewhere online
 

10063
02:37:36,319 --> 02:37:39,510
that we purchased somewhere online
and we bring it and we display it in a

10064
02:37:39,510 --> 02:37:39,520
and we bring it and we display it in a
 

10065
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:40,790
and we bring it and we display it in a
digital museum

10066
02:37:40,790 --> 02:37:40,800
digital museum
 

10067
02:37:40,800 --> 02:37:43,590
digital museum
or a virtual museum and so now all of a

10068
02:37:43,590 --> 02:37:43,600
or a virtual museum and so now all of a
 

10069
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:44,309
or a virtual museum and so now all of a
sudden

10070
02:37:44,309 --> 02:37:44,319
sudden
 

10071
02:37:44,319 --> 02:37:46,710
sudden
you can charge people for entry you can

10072
02:37:46,710 --> 02:37:46,720
you can charge people for entry you can
 

10073
02:37:46,720 --> 02:37:47,429
you can charge people for entry you can
consign

10074
02:37:47,429 --> 02:37:47,439
consign
 

10075
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:49,750
consign
digital goods it's the replication of

10076
02:37:49,750 --> 02:37:49,760
digital goods it's the replication of
 

10077
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:51,270
digital goods it's the replication of
what happens in the analog world

10078
02:37:51,270 --> 02:37:51,280
what happens in the analog world
 

10079
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:53,830
what happens in the analog world
now just in digital and when you do that

10080
02:37:53,830 --> 02:37:53,840
now just in digital and when you do that
 

10081
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:55,750
now just in digital and when you do that
what you do is you take

10082
02:37:55,750 --> 02:37:55,760
what you do is you take
 

10083
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:59,030
what you do is you take
the addressable markets of these assets

10084
02:37:59,030 --> 02:37:59,040
the addressable markets of these assets
 

10085
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:00,469
the addressable markets of these assets
or these mechanisms

10086
02:38:00,469 --> 02:38:00,479
or these mechanisms
 

10087
02:38:00,479 --> 02:38:03,429
or these mechanisms
and they explode in the digital realm

10088
02:38:03,429 --> 02:38:03,439
and they explode in the digital realm
 

10089
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:05,270
and they explode in the digital realm
and so now all of a sudden

10090
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:05,280
and so now all of a sudden
 

10091
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:08,550
and so now all of a sudden
how fast does the human race

10092
02:38:08,550 --> 02:38:08,560
how fast does the human race
 

10093
02:38:08,560 --> 02:38:10,469
how fast does the human race
accelerate when it comes to human

10094
02:38:10,469 --> 02:38:10,479
accelerate when it comes to human
 

10095
02:38:10,479 --> 02:38:11,750
accelerate when it comes to human
production

10096
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:11,760

to geography after geography after

10110
02:38:26,830 --> 02:38:26,840
to geography after geography after
 

10111
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:28,790
to geography after geography after
geography it's going to take time

10112
02:38:28,790 --> 02:38:28,800
geography it's going to take time
 

10113
02:38:28,800 --> 02:38:30,550
geography it's going to take time
it's going to take resources and

10114
02:38:30,550 --> 02:38:30,560
it's going to take resources and
 

10115
02:38:30,560 --> 02:38:31,590
it's going to take resources and
ultimately it's going to take lots of

10116
02:38:31,590 --> 02:38:31,600
ultimately it's going to take lots of
 

10117
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:32,790
ultimately it's going to take lots of
effort

10118
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:32,800
effort
 

10119
02:38:32,800 --> 02:38:35,030
effort
if i now said to you hey i'm going to

10120
02:38:35,030 --> 02:38:35,040
if i now said to you hey i'm going to
 

10121
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:35,990
if i now said to you hey i'm going to
transport you

10122
02:38:35,990 --> 02:38:36,000
transport you
 

10123
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:39,030
transport you
in this virtual world to multiple

10124
02:38:39,030 --> 02:38:39,040
in this virtual world to multiple
 

10125
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:40,230
in this virtual world to multiple
geographies

10126
02:38:40,230 --> 02:38:40,240
geographies
 

10127
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:42,309
geographies
but you're going to experience it in

10128
02:38:42,309 --> 02:38:42,319
but you're going to experience it in
 

10129
02:38:42,319 --> 02:38:43,990
but you're going to experience it in
this virtual

10130
02:38:43,990 --> 02:38:44,000
this virtual
 

10131
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,230
this virtual
uh world and you're going to have

10132
02:38:46,230 --> 02:38:46,240
uh world and you're going to have
 

10133
02:38:46,240 --> 02:38:47,750
uh world and you're going to have
digital goods that you can take

10134
02:38:47,750 --> 02:38:47,760
digital goods that you can take
 

10135
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:50,630
digital goods that you can take
from economy to economy or from location

10136
02:38:50,630 --> 02:38:50,640
from economy to economy or from location
 

10137
02:38:50,640 --> 02:38:52,389
from economy to economy or from location
to location

10138
02:38:52,389 --> 02:38:52,399
to location
 

10139
02:38:52,399 --> 02:38:53,830
to location
all of a sudden you may get maybe you

10140
02:38:53,830 --> 02:38:53,840
all of a sudden you may get maybe you
 

10141
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:55,270
all of a sudden you may get maybe you
get 90 of that you don't get a hundred

10142
02:38:55,270 --> 02:38:55,280
get 90 of that you don't get a hundred
 

10143
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:56,389
get 90 of that you don't get a hundred
percent of the same value we get ninety

10144
02:38:56,389 --> 02:38:56,399
percent of the same value we get ninety
 

10145
02:38:56,399 --> 02:38:57,990
percent of the same value we get ninety
percent of the value

10146
02:38:57,990 --> 02:38:58,000
percent of the value
 

10147
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,950
percent of the value
but you can do it at a much faster pace

10148
02:39:00,950 --> 02:39:00,960
but you can do it at a much faster pace
 

10149
02:39:00,960 --> 02:39:02,710
but you can do it at a much faster pace
and so in a six month period you've

10150
02:39:02,710 --> 02:39:02,720
and so in a six month period you've
 

10151
02:39:02,720 --> 02:39:03,270
and so in a six month period you've
actually

10152
02:39:03,270 --> 02:39:03,280
actually
 

10153
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:05,910
actually
made three times the progress than you

10154
02:39:05,910 --> 02:39:05,920
made three times the progress than you
 

10155
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:06,630
made three times the progress than you
would have

10156
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:06,640
would have
 

10157
02:39:06,640 --> 02:39:08,469
would have
if you had to do in the physical world

10158
02:39:08,469 --> 02:39:08,479
if you had to do in the physical world
 

10159
02:39:08,479 --> 02:39:10,150
if you had to do in the physical world
so that's where i think we're heading so

10160
02:39:10,150 --> 02:39:10,160
so that's where i think we're heading so
 

10161
02:39:10,160 --> 02:39:11,270
so that's where i think we're heading so
[Music]

10162
02:39:11,270 --> 02:39:11,280
[Music]
 

10163
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,429
[Music]
so there's digital art being displayed

10164
02:39:13,429 --> 02:39:13,439
so there's digital art being displayed
 

10165
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:15,030
so there's digital art being displayed
in the digital

10166
02:39:15,030 --> 02:39:15,040
in the digital
 

10167
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:16,870
in the digital
museum and people are being charged for

10168
02:39:16,870 --> 02:39:16,880
museum and people are being charged for
 

10169
02:39:16,880 --> 02:39:19,990
museum and people are being charged for
access and perhaps we plug in our senses

10170
02:39:19,990 --> 02:39:20,000
access and perhaps we plug in our senses
 

10171
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:21,750
access and perhaps we plug in our senses
which means we start to operate more and

10172
02:39:21,750 --> 02:39:21,760
which means we start to operate more and
 

10173
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:23,510
which means we start to operate more and
more in a virtual reality

10174
02:39:23,510 --> 02:39:23,520
more in a virtual reality
 

10175
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:25,429
more in a virtual reality
augmented reality virtual reality way

10176
02:39:25,429 --> 02:39:25,439
augmented reality virtual reality way
 

10177
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:27,110
augmented reality virtual reality way
with this digital world

10178
02:39:27,110 --> 02:39:27,120
with this digital world
 

10179
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:29,830
with this digital world
and increasingly go into this world

10180
02:39:29,830 --> 02:39:29,840
and increasingly go into this world
 

10181
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:30,469
and increasingly go into this world
basically

10182
02:39:30,469 --> 02:39:30,479
basically
 

10183
02:39:30,479 --> 02:39:33,670
basically
lived most of our productive and uh

10184
02:39:33,670 --> 02:39:33,680
lived most of our productive and uh
 

10185
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:37,110
lived most of our productive and uh
social lives in this digital world

10186
02:39:37,110 --> 02:39:37,120
social lives in this digital world
 

10187
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:39,510
social lives in this digital world
and increasingly essentially create a

10188
02:39:39,510 --> 02:39:39,520
and increasingly essentially create a
 

10189
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:41,270
and increasingly essentially create a
simulation

10190
02:39:41,270 --> 02:39:41,280
simulation
 

10191
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:44,150
simulation
uh where the biological basis is just

10192
02:39:44,150 --> 02:39:44,160
uh where the biological basis is just
 

10193
02:39:44,160 --> 02:39:44,950
uh where the biological basis is just
there to

10194
02:39:44,950 --> 02:39:44,960
there to
 

10195
02:39:44,960 --> 02:39:47,030
there to
sustain the brain that's used to operate

10196
02:39:47,030 --> 02:39:47,040
sustain the brain that's used to operate
 

10197
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:49,270
sustain the brain that's used to operate
in the in the virtual world

10198
02:39:49,270 --> 02:39:49,280
in the in the virtual world
 

10199
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:51,349
in the in the virtual world
uh taking us back to the original when

10200
02:39:51,349 --> 02:39:51,359
uh taking us back to the original when
 

10201
02:39:51,359 --> 02:39:53,349
uh taking us back to the original when
we started talking about war

10202
02:39:53,349 --> 02:39:53,359
we started talking about war
 

10203
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:56,070
we started talking about war
i wonder what conflict looks like in

10204
02:39:56,070 --> 02:39:56,080
i wonder what conflict looks like in
 

10205
02:39:56,080 --> 02:39:57,429
i wonder what conflict looks like in
that world

10206
02:39:57,429 --> 02:39:57,439
that world
 

10207
02:39:57,439 --> 02:39:59,510
that world
that uh the people who are born today

10208
02:39:59,510 --> 02:39:59,520
that uh the people who are born today
 

10209
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:02,150
that uh the people who are born today
maybe will be fighting wars

10210
02:40:02,150 --> 02:40:02,160
maybe will be fighting wars
 

10211
02:40:02,160 --> 02:40:05,270
maybe will be fighting wars
in the space in in that museum world

10212
02:40:05,270 --> 02:40:05,280
in the space in in that museum world
 

10213
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:07,030
in the space in in that museum world
in that digital world remember what i

10214
02:40:07,030 --> 02:40:07,040
in that digital world remember what i
 

10215
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:09,190
in that digital world remember what i
said we're moving from a world

10216
02:40:09,190 --> 02:40:09,200
said we're moving from a world
 

10217
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:12,710
said we're moving from a world
of conflict surrounded and determined by

10218
02:40:12,710 --> 02:40:12,720
of conflict surrounded and determined by
 

10219
02:40:12,720 --> 02:40:15,190
of conflict surrounded and determined by
bombs bullets and soldiers to a

10220
02:40:15,190 --> 02:40:15,200
bombs bullets and soldiers to a
 

10221
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:17,590
bombs bullets and soldiers to a
battlefield that is determined by

10222
02:40:17,590 --> 02:40:17,600
battlefield that is determined by
 

10223
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,469
battlefield that is determined by
war of information and cyber

10224
02:40:20,469 --> 02:40:20,479
war of information and cyber
 

10225
02:40:20,479 --> 02:40:21,750
war of information and cyber
capabilities

10226
02:40:21,750 --> 02:40:21,760
capabilities
 

10227
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:24,790
capabilities
and so in that virtual world is it

10228
02:40:24,790 --> 02:40:24,800
and so in that virtual world is it
 

10229
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:27,910
and so in that virtual world is it
about death and destruction of

10230
02:40:27,910 --> 02:40:27,920
about death and destruction of
 

10231
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:31,269
about death and destruction of
human life in the physical analog world

10232
02:40:31,269 --> 02:40:31,279
human life in the physical analog world
 

10233
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:33,830
human life in the physical analog world
or will it become more important to

10234
02:40:33,830 --> 02:40:33,840
or will it become more important to
 

10235
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:35,750
or will it become more important to
attack or defend

10236
02:40:35,750 --> 02:40:35,760
attack or defend
 

10237
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:38,950
attack or defend
virtual property and virtual life and

10238
02:40:38,950 --> 02:40:38,960
virtual property and virtual life and
 

10239
02:40:38,960 --> 02:40:40,389
virtual property and virtual life and
you know some level of virtual

10240
02:40:40,389 --> 02:40:40,399
you know some level of virtual
 

10241
02:40:40,399 --> 02:40:42,469
you know some level of virtual
sovereignty

10242
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:42,479
sovereignty
 

10243
02:40:42,479 --> 02:40:45,590
sovereignty
in my opinion the latter is more likely

10244
02:40:45,590 --> 02:40:45,600
in my opinion the latter is more likely
 

10245
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,070
in my opinion the latter is more likely
and so what you start to understand is

10246
02:40:48,070 --> 02:40:48,080
and so what you start to understand is
 

10247
02:40:48,080 --> 02:40:48,870
and so what you start to understand is
well

10248
02:40:48,870 --> 02:40:48,880
well
 

10249
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:51,990
well
what do you truly value in your life

10250
02:40:51,990 --> 02:40:52,000
what do you truly value in your life
 

10251
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:55,190
what do you truly value in your life
is it the physical analog materialistic

10252
02:40:55,190 --> 02:40:55,200
is it the physical analog materialistic
 

10253
02:40:55,200 --> 02:40:56,389
is it the physical analog materialistic
consumptive

10254
02:40:56,389 --> 02:40:56,399
consumptive
 

10255
02:40:56,399 --> 02:41:00,230
consumptive
goods or is it virtual

10256
02:41:00,230 --> 02:41:00,240
goods or is it virtual
 

10257
02:41:00,240 --> 02:41:03,510
goods or is it virtual
and in many cases something as simple as

10258
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:03,520
and in many cases something as simple as
 

10259
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:06,710
and in many cases something as simple as
the ability to connect with somebody

10260
02:41:06,710 --> 02:41:06,720
the ability to connect with somebody
 

10261
02:41:06,720 --> 02:41:09,030
the ability to connect with somebody
is really important and so one of the

10262
02:41:09,030 --> 02:41:09,040
is really important and so one of the
 

10263
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:10,389
is really important and so one of the
most disruptive

10264
02:41:10,389 --> 02:41:10,399
most disruptive
 

10265
02:41:10,399 --> 02:41:12,870
most disruptive
combative violent things that a country

10266
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:12,880
combative violent things that a country
 

10267
02:41:12,880 --> 02:41:15,110
combative violent things that a country
may do to another country in the future

10268
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:15,120
may do to another country in the future
 

10269
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:18,630
may do to another country in the future
simply take down the internet

need to
 

10281
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:33,190
need to
actually convince you through

actually convince you through
 

10283
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:34,950
actually convince you through
a monopoly on violence on physical

of
nefarious activities and i think that

02:41:44,870 --> 02:41:44,880
nefarious activities and i think that
 

10297
02:41:44,880 --> 02:41:46,070
nefarious activities and i think that
you know the united states has been

10298
02:41:46,070 --> 02:41:46,080
you know the united states has been
 

10299
02:41:46,080 --> 02:41:47,349
you know the united states has been
struggling with this idea over the last

02:41:47,349 --> 02:41:47,359
struggling with this idea over the last
 

10301
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:49,670
struggling with this idea over the last
couple of years in the political arena

10302
02:41:49,670 --> 02:41:49,680
couple of years in the political arena
 

10303
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:51,190
couple of years in the political arena
but what happens when it starts to come

10304
02:41:51,190 --> 02:41:51,200
but what happens when it starts to come
 

10305
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:54,230
but what happens when it starts to come
to other aspects of our life

10306
02:41:54,230 --> 02:41:54,240
to other aspects of our life
 

10307
02:41:54,240 --> 02:41:56,389
to other aspects of our life
and i think it's very likely it's almost

10308
02:41:56,389 --> 02:41:56,399
and i think it's very likely it's almost
 

10309
02:41:56,399 --> 02:41:58,710
and i think it's very likely it's almost
obviously likely that we're moving into

obviously likely that we're moving into

what if you can just program the

10386
02:43:25,429 --> 02:43:25,439
what if you can just program the
 

10387
02:43:25,439 --> 02:43:27,990
what if you can just program the
resources and gain the same leverage

10388
02:43:27,990 --> 02:43:28,000
resources and gain the same leverage
 

10389
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:30,550
resources and gain the same leverage
and do it at scale and do it in a very

10390
02:43:30,550 --> 02:43:30,560
and do it at scale and do it in a very
 

10391
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:31,910
and do it at scale and do it in a very
programmatic way

10392
02:43:31,910 --> 02:43:31,920
programmatic way
 

10393
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:33,910
programmatic way
and then have them actually make

10394
02:43:33,910 --> 02:43:33,920
and then have them actually make
 

10395
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:35,510
and then have them actually make
decisions

10396
02:43:35,510 --> 02:43:35,520
decisions
 

10397
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:37,910
decisions
in a way that doesn't require you to

10398
02:43:37,910 --> 02:43:37,920
in a way that doesn't require you to
 

10399
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:39,830
in a way that doesn't require you to
have thought of every single

10400
02:43:39,830 --> 02:43:39,840
have thought of every single
 

10401
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:42,710
have thought of every single
potential scenario or edge case that's

10402
02:43:42,710 --> 02:43:42,720
potential scenario or edge case that's
 

10403
02:43:42,720 --> 02:43:43,750
potential scenario or edge case that's
ultimately what we're talking about we

10404
02:43:43,750 --> 02:43:43,760
ultimately what we're talking about we
 

10405
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:45,750
ultimately what we're talking about we
talk about artificial intelligence right

10406
02:43:45,750 --> 02:43:45,760
talk about artificial intelligence right
 

10407
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:47,990
talk about artificial intelligence right
and so when you look at that when

10408
02:43:47,990 --> 02:43:48,000
and so when you look at that when
 

10409
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:49,590
and so when you look at that when
technology's created

10410
02:43:49,590 --> 02:43:49,600
technology's created
 

10411
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:52,389
technology's created
everyone uses it for good or bad but

10412
02:43:52,389 --> 02:43:52,399
everyone uses it for good or bad but
 

10413
02:43:52,399 --> 02:43:53,429
everyone uses it for good or bad but
both get used

10414
02:43:53,429 --> 02:43:53,439
both get used
 

10415
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:55,429
both get used
right and so whether we're talking about

10416
02:43:55,429 --> 02:43:55,439
right and so whether we're talking about
 

10417
02:43:55,439 --> 02:43:57,750
right and so whether we're talking about
cell phones beepers the internet

10418
02:43:57,750 --> 02:43:57,760
cell phones beepers the internet
 

10419
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:00,550
cell phones beepers the internet
guns whatever it's always used for good

10420
02:44:00,550 --> 02:44:00,560
guns whatever it's always used for good
 

10421
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:01,670
guns whatever it's always used for good
and bad

10422
02:44:01,670 --> 02:44:01,680

10423
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:03,429
and bad
the big question is and i think that you

10424
02:44:03,429 --> 02:44:03,439
the big question is and i think that you
 

10425
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:05,030
the big question is and i think that you
know yourself and many other people have

10426
02:44:05,030 --> 02:44:05,040
know yourself and many other people have
 

10427
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:06,309
know yourself and many other people have
rightfully

10428
02:44:06,309 --> 02:44:06,319
rightfully
 

10429
02:44:06,319 --> 02:44:09,990
rightfully
said this is the question really becomes

10430
02:44:09,990 --> 02:44:10,000
said this is the question really becomes
 

10431
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:13,110
said this is the question really becomes
is the negative and nefarious

10432
02:44:13,110 --> 02:44:13,120
is the negative and nefarious
 

10433
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:16,790
is the negative and nefarious
uses of this inadvertent potentially

10434
02:44:16,790 --> 02:44:16,800
uses of this inadvertent potentially
 

10435
02:44:16,800 --> 02:44:18,870
uses of this inadvertent potentially
or does it actually come from a

10436
02:44:18,870 --> 02:44:18,880
or does it actually come from a
 

10437
02:44:18,880 --> 02:44:20,230
or does it actually come from a
malicious person it's the intention

10438
02:44:20,230 --> 02:44:20,240
malicious person it's the intention
 

10439
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:21,510
malicious person it's the intention
militias

10440
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:21,520
militias
 

10441
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:22,950
militias
and to me that's what i i don't know

10442
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:22,960
and to me that's what i i don't know
 

10443
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:24,550
and to me that's what i i don't know
enough you know much more about this and

10444
02:44:24,550 --> 02:44:24,560
enough you know much more about this and
 

10445
02:44:24,560 --> 02:44:25,670
enough you know much more about this and
there's plenty of other people who do as

10446
02:44:25,670 --> 02:44:25,680
there's plenty of other people who do as
 

10447
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:26,550
there's plenty of other people who do as
well

10448
02:44:26,550 --> 02:44:26,560
well
 

10449
02:44:26,560 --> 02:44:29,830
well
but i do think that there will be

10450
02:44:29,830 --> 02:44:29,840
but i do think that there will be
 

10451
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:33,269
but i do think that there will be
nefarious actors and malicious people

10452
02:44:33,269 --> 02:44:33,279
nefarious actors and malicious people
 

10453
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:34,230
nefarious actors and malicious people
but we're going to treat them the same

10454
02:44:34,230 --> 02:44:34,240
but we're going to treat them the same
 

10455
02:44:34,240 --> 02:44:35,429
but we're going to treat them the same
way we've always treated people who use

10456
02:44:35,429 --> 02:44:35,439
way we've always treated people who use
 

10457
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:36,790
way we've always treated people who use
technology poorly

10458
02:44:36,790 --> 02:44:36,800
technology poorly
 

10459
02:44:36,800 --> 02:44:38,870
technology poorly
right we're going to understand it we're

10460
02:44:38,870 --> 02:44:38,880
right we're going to understand it we're
 

10461
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:39,750
right we're going to understand it we're
going to identify it we're going to

10462
02:44:39,750 --> 02:44:39,760
going to identify it we're going to
 

10463
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:41,030
going to identify it we're going to
control it and then we're going to end

10464
02:44:41,030 --> 02:44:41,040
control it and then we're going to end
 

10465
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:41,349
control it and then we're going to end
up

10466
02:44:41,349 --> 02:44:41,359
up
 

10467
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:42,950
up
reversing it or preventing that from

10468
02:44:42,950 --> 02:44:42,960
reversing it or preventing that from
 

10469
02:44:42,960 --> 02:44:45,510
reversing it or preventing that from
doing that it's the inadvertent things

10470
02:44:45,510 --> 02:44:45,520
doing that it's the inadvertent things
 

10471
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:46,710
doing that it's the inadvertent things
that i think are actually the most

10472
02:44:46,710 --> 02:44:46,720
that i think are actually the most
 

10473
02:44:46,720 --> 02:44:47,670
that i think are actually the most
dangerous

10474
02:44:47,670 --> 02:44:47,680
dangerous
 

10475
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:49,750
dangerous
because when you have something that can

10476
02:44:49,750 --> 02:44:49,760
because when you have something that can
 

10477
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:51,750
because when you have something that can
think for itself

10478
02:44:51,750 --> 02:44:51,760
think for itself
 

10479
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:54,710
think for itself
and there is no way to leverage a

10480
02:44:54,710 --> 02:44:54,720
and there is no way to leverage a
 

10481
02:44:54,720 --> 02:44:56,070
and there is no way to leverage a
monopoly on violence

10482
02:44:56,070 --> 02:44:56,080
monopoly on violence
 

10483
02:44:56,080 --> 02:45:00,070
monopoly on violence
for control it's a very scary thing

10484
02:45:00,070 --> 02:45:00,080
for control it's a very scary thing
 

10485
02:45:00,080 --> 02:45:02,070
for control it's a very scary thing
and it can i mean the the thing that's

10486
02:45:02,070 --> 02:45:02,080
and it can i mean the the thing that's
 

10487
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:03,190
and it can i mean the the thing that's
scary to me is that

10488
02:45:03,190 --> 02:45:03,200
scary to me is that
 

10489
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:05,429
scary to me is that
it can scale arbitrarily so it can

10490
02:45:05,429 --> 02:45:05,439
it can scale arbitrarily so it can
 

10491
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:07,510
it can scale arbitrarily so it can
outnumber humans very quickly

10492
02:45:07,510 --> 02:45:07,520
outnumber humans very quickly
 

10493
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:12,469
outnumber humans very quickly
even if it's dumber than humans and so

10494
02:45:12,469 --> 02:45:12,479
even if it's dumber than humans and so
 

10495
02:45:12,479 --> 02:45:14,710
even if it's dumber than humans and so
i don't know if we're able to reason

10496
02:45:14,710 --> 02:45:14,720
i don't know if we're able to reason
 

10497
02:45:14,720 --> 02:45:16,870
i don't know if we're able to reason
about a world

10498
02:45:16,870 --> 02:45:16,880
about a world
 

10499
02:45:16,880 --> 02:45:19,269
about a world
like let's look at the physical analog

10500
02:45:19,269 --> 02:45:19,279
like let's look at the physical analog
 

10501
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:21,510
like let's look at the physical analog
where all of a sudden

10502
02:45:21,510 --> 02:45:21,520
where all of a sudden
 

10503
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:24,230
where all of a sudden
uh let's talk about something kind of

10504
02:45:24,230 --> 02:45:24,240
uh let's talk about something kind of
 

10505
02:45:24,240 --> 02:45:26,070
uh let's talk about something kind of
like humans but dumber than humans like

10506
02:45:26,070 --> 02:45:26,080
like humans but dumber than humans like
 

10507
02:45:26,080 --> 02:45:26,710
like humans but dumber than humans like
chimps

10508
02:45:26,710 --> 02:45:26,720
chimps
 

10509
02:45:26,720 --> 02:45:30,070
chimps
okay imagine that all of a sudden chimps

10510
02:45:30,070 --> 02:45:30,080
okay imagine that all of a sudden chimps
 

10511
02:45:30,080 --> 02:45:32,550
okay imagine that all of a sudden chimps
could multiply

10512
02:45:32,550 --> 02:45:32,560
could multiply
 

10513
02:45:32,560 --> 02:45:35,110
could multiply
arbitrarily quickly and you could have

10514
02:45:35,110 --> 02:45:35,120
arbitrarily quickly and you could have
 

10515
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:35,910
arbitrarily quickly and you could have
like

10516
02:45:35,910 --> 02:45:35,920
like
 

10517
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:39,030
like
a trillion chimps the next day

10518
02:45:39,030 --> 02:45:39,040
a trillion chimps the next day
 

10519
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:41,030
a trillion chimps the next day
when when you only had maybe a million

10520
02:45:41,030 --> 02:45:41,040
when when you only had maybe a million
 

10521
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:42,550
when when you only had maybe a million
the day before

10522
02:45:42,550 --> 02:45:42,560
the day before
 

10523
02:45:42,560 --> 02:45:45,510
the day before
like how does that world look different

10524
02:45:45,510 --> 02:45:45,520
like how does that world look different
 

10525
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:46,469
like how does that world look different
where the [\h__\h] did all these

10526
02:45:46,469 --> 02:45:46,479
where the [\h__\h] did all these
 

10527
02:45:46,479 --> 02:45:49,429
where the [\h__\h] did all these
chimps come from and they like and then

10528
02:45:49,429 --> 02:45:49,439
chimps come from and they like and then
 

10529
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:51,269
chimps come from and they like and then
we can we can pretend to be like well

10530
02:45:51,269 --> 02:45:51,279
we can we can pretend to be like well
 

10531
02:45:51,279 --> 02:45:52,070
we can we can pretend to be like well
let's hope

10532
02:45:52,070 --> 02:45:52,080
let's hope
 

10533
02:45:52,080 --> 02:45:53,910
let's hope
the chimps like don't get violent

10534
02:45:53,910 --> 02:45:53,920
the chimps like don't get violent
 

10535
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:55,670
the chimps like don't get violent
because they they don't seem to get

10536
02:45:55,670 --> 02:45:55,680
because they they don't seem to get
 

10537
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:56,550
because they they don't seem to get
violent

10538
02:45:56,550 --> 02:45:56,560
violent
 

10539
02:45:56,560 --> 02:45:59,429
violent
when the resources aren't constrained

10540
02:45:59,429 --> 02:45:59,439
when the resources aren't constrained
 

10541
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:01,269
when the resources aren't constrained
but like we don't know

10542
02:46:01,269 --> 02:46:01,279
but like we don't know
 

10543
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:04,150
but like we don't know
and the problem is it all starts by

10544
02:46:04,150 --> 02:46:04,160
and the problem is it all starts by
 

10545
02:46:04,160 --> 02:46:05,349
and the problem is it all starts by
building that first

10546
02:46:05,349 --> 02:46:05,359
building that first
 

10547
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:08,309
building that first
chip multiplier device and everyone's

10548
02:46:08,309 --> 02:46:08,319
chip multiplier device and everyone's
 

10549
02:46:08,319 --> 02:46:09,830
chip multiplier device and everyone's
like okay yeah there's a lot of good

10550
02:46:09,830 --> 02:46:09,840
like okay yeah there's a lot of good
 

10551
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:11,670
like okay yeah there's a lot of good
applications you want

10552
02:46:11,670 --> 02:46:11,680
applications you want
 

10553
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:14,550
applications you want
you know you can make all kinds of

10554
02:46:14,550 --> 02:46:14,560
you know you can make all kinds of
 

10555
02:46:14,560 --> 02:46:15,269
you know you can make all kinds of
arguments

10556
02:46:15,269 --> 02:46:15,279
arguments
 

10557
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:17,750
arguments
for why you have more chimps maybe they

10558
02:46:17,750 --> 02:46:17,760
for why you have more chimps maybe they
 

10559
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:19,510
for why you have more chimps maybe they
can help you out around the house or

10560
02:46:19,510 --> 02:46:19,520
can help you out around the house or
 

10561
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:20,389
can help you out around the house or
something like that

10562
02:46:20,389 --> 02:46:20,399
something like that
 

10563
02:46:20,399 --> 02:46:23,510
something like that
in the physical space but

10564
02:46:23,510 --> 02:46:23,520
in the physical space but
 

10565
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:24,950
in the physical space but
ultimately it's the unintended

10566
02:46:24,950 --> 02:46:24,960
ultimately it's the unintended
 

10567
02:46:24,960 --> 02:46:27,190
ultimately it's the unintended
consequences that you're referring to is

10568
02:46:27,190 --> 02:46:27,200
consequences that you're referring to is
 

10569
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:29,110
consequences that you're referring to is
you don't know what's gonna happen i'm

10570
02:46:29,110 --> 02:46:29,120
you don't know what's gonna happen i'm
 

10571
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:31,429
you don't know what's gonna happen i'm
really worried about

10572
02:46:31,429 --> 02:46:31,439
really worried about
 

10573
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:34,790
really worried about
dumb ai agents uh

10574
02:46:34,790 --> 02:46:34,800
dumb ai agents uh
 

10575
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:37,750
dumb ai agents uh
like having impact when they're

10576
02:46:37,750 --> 02:46:37,760
like having impact when they're
 

10577
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:38,710
like having impact when they're
multiplied

10578
02:46:38,710 --> 02:46:38,720
multiplied
 

10579
02:46:38,720 --> 02:46:41,349
multiplied
to a million to a billion and are

10580
02:46:41,349 --> 02:46:41,359
to a million to a billion and are
 

10581
02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:44,550
to a million to a billion and are
allowed to operate in the digital space

10582
02:46:44,550 --> 02:46:44,560
allowed to operate in the digital space
 

10583
02:46:44,560 --> 02:46:47,190
allowed to operate in the digital space
especially as we clearly are moving more

10584
02:46:47,190 --> 02:46:47,200
especially as we clearly are moving more
 

10585
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:48,070
especially as we clearly are moving more
and more

10586
02:46:48,070 --> 02:46:48,080
and more
 

10587
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:52,230
and more
of our lives into the digital space so

10588
02:46:52,230 --> 02:46:52,240
of our lives into the digital space so
 

10589
02:46:52,240 --> 02:46:53,990
of our lives into the digital space so
it's kind of terrifying because we you

10590
02:46:53,990 --> 02:46:54,000
it's kind of terrifying because we you
 

10591
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:55,750
it's kind of terrifying because we you
know a lot of people are terrified

10592
02:46:55,750 --> 02:46:55,760
know a lot of people are terrified
 

10593
02:46:55,760 --> 02:46:57,830
know a lot of people are terrified
or like concerned about super

10594
02:46:57,830 --> 02:46:57,840
or like concerned about super
 

10595
02:46:57,840 --> 02:46:59,990
or like concerned about super
intelligent systems

10596
02:46:59,990 --> 02:47:00,000
intelligent systems
 

10597
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,070
intelligent systems
i think i'm definitely much more

10598
02:47:02,070 --> 02:47:02,080
i think i'm definitely much more
 

10599
02:47:02,080 --> 02:47:03,190
i think i'm definitely much more
concerned about

10600
02:47:03,190 --> 02:47:03,200
concerned about
 

10601
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:06,469
concerned about
super dumb systems at scale that that's

10602
02:47:06,469 --> 02:47:06,479
super dumb systems at scale that that's
 

10603
02:47:06,479 --> 02:47:07,349
super dumb systems at scale that that's
terrifying

10604
02:47:07,349 --> 02:47:07,359
terrifying
 

10605
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:09,830
terrifying
i always think about um the inadvertent

10606
02:47:09,830 --> 02:47:09,840
i always think about um the inadvertent
 

10607
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:11,269
i always think about um the inadvertent
but as you were talking what it made me

10608
02:47:11,269 --> 02:47:11,279
but as you were talking what it made me
 

10609
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:12,309
but as you were talking what it made me
think of is

10610
02:47:12,309 --> 02:47:12,319
think of is
 

10611
02:47:12,319 --> 02:47:15,349
think of is
also the irreversible irreversible right

10612
02:47:15,349 --> 02:47:15,359
also the irreversible irreversible right
 

10613
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:16,870
also the irreversible irreversible right
so it's one thing if there's

10614
02:47:16,870 --> 02:47:16,880
so it's one thing if there's
 

10615
02:47:16,880 --> 02:47:19,990
so it's one thing if there's
uh inadvertent negative impact

10616
02:47:19,990 --> 02:47:20,000
uh inadvertent negative impact
 

10617
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:21,750
uh inadvertent negative impact
but we have reversibility built into a

10618
02:47:21,750 --> 02:47:21,760
but we have reversibility built into a
 

10619
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:24,070
but we have reversibility built into a
system and we can fix our mistakes

10620
02:47:24,070 --> 02:47:24,080
system and we can fix our mistakes
 

10621
02:47:24,080 --> 02:47:26,150
system and we can fix our mistakes
yeah i think the really scary part is

10622
02:47:26,150 --> 02:47:26,160
yeah i think the really scary part is
 

10623
02:47:26,160 --> 02:47:28,150
yeah i think the really scary part is
when you overlay inadvertent mistakes

10624
02:47:28,150 --> 02:47:28,160
when you overlay inadvertent mistakes
 

10625
02:47:28,160 --> 02:47:28,870
when you overlay inadvertent mistakes
with the

10626
02:47:28,870 --> 02:47:28,880
with the
 

10627
02:47:28,880 --> 02:47:32,309
with the
irreversible aspect of it and therefore

10628
02:47:32,309 --> 02:47:32,319
irreversible aspect of it and therefore
 

10629
02:47:32,319 --> 02:47:35,110
irreversible aspect of it and therefore
humans have no control yeah if you if

10630
02:47:35,110 --> 02:47:35,120
humans have no control yeah if you if
 

10631
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:36,870
humans have no control yeah if you if
you have the trillion chimps

10632
02:47:36,870 --> 02:47:36,880
you have the trillion chimps
 

10633
02:47:36,880 --> 02:47:39,349
you have the trillion chimps
you can't they're not gonna like it when

10634
02:47:39,349 --> 02:47:39,359
you can't they're not gonna like it when
 

10635
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:44,070
you can't they're not gonna like it when
you try to start killing them off

10636
02:47:44,070 --> 02:47:44,080

 

10637
02:47:44,080 --> 02:47:48,550

uh all right but back to bitcoin

should check out
 

10683
02:48:34,160 --> 02:48:37,190
should check out
in order to learn about bitcoin yeah so

10684
02:48:37,190 --> 02:48:37,200
in order to learn about bitcoin yeah so
 

10685
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:39,910
in order to learn about bitcoin yeah so
the podcasts and uh email are like the

10686
02:48:39,910 --> 02:48:39,920
the podcasts and uh email are like the
 

10687
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:40,230
the podcasts and uh email are like the
two

10688
02:48:40,230 --> 02:48:40,240
two
 

10689
02:48:40,240 --> 02:48:42,070
two
most selfish things i do because the

10690
02:48:42,070 --> 02:48:42,080
most selfish things i do because the
 

10691
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:43,910
most selfish things i do because the
podcast is a way for me to learn from

10692
02:48:43,910 --> 02:48:43,920
podcast is a way for me to learn from
 

10693
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:44,630
podcast is a way for me to learn from
other people

10694
02:48:44,630 --> 02:48:44,640
other people
 

10695
02:48:44,640 --> 02:48:46,790
other people
so i get them to come on and tell me all

10696
02:48:46,790 --> 02:48:46,800
so i get them to come on and tell me all
 

10697
02:48:46,800 --> 02:48:48,150
so i get them to come on and tell me all
the things they're thinking about and i

10698
02:48:48,150 --> 02:48:48,160
the things they're thinking about and i
 

10699
02:48:48,160 --> 02:48:49,110
the things they're thinking about and i
get asked some questions

10700
02:48:49,110 --> 02:48:49,120
get asked some questions
 

10701
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:50,630
get asked some questions
what's it called by the way uh just a

10702
02:48:50,630 --> 02:48:50,640
what's it called by the way uh just a
 

10703
02:48:50,640 --> 02:48:52,150
what's it called by the way uh just a
pomp podcast

10704
02:48:52,150 --> 02:48:52,160
pomp podcast
 

10705
02:48:52,160 --> 02:48:55,429
pomp podcast
and so in doing that um it really

10706
02:48:55,429 --> 02:48:55,439
and so in doing that um it really
 

10707
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:57,750
and so in doing that um it really
is informative for me and i think that

10708
02:48:57,750 --> 02:48:57,760
is informative for me and i think that
 

10709
02:48:57,760 --> 02:48:59,110
is informative for me and i think that
my whole goal is just like if i'm

10710
02:48:59,110 --> 02:48:59,120
my whole goal is just like if i'm
 

10711
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:00,950
my whole goal is just like if i'm
learning other people will be learning

10712
02:49:00,950 --> 02:49:00,960
learning other people will be learning
 

10713
02:49:00,960 --> 02:49:02,950
learning other people will be learning
and then the email i read it every

10714
02:49:02,950 --> 02:49:02,960
and then the email i read it every
 

10715
02:49:02,960 --> 02:49:05,190
and then the email i read it every
morning because it forces me to

10716
02:49:05,190 --> 02:49:05,200
morning because it forces me to
 

10717
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:06,710
morning because it forces me to
collect my thoughts and actually

10718
02:49:06,710 --> 02:49:06,720
collect my thoughts and actually
 

10719
02:49:06,720 --> 02:49:08,469
collect my thoughts and actually
articulate them in somewhat of a

10720
02:49:08,469 --> 02:49:08,479
articulate them in somewhat of a
 

10721
02:49:08,479 --> 02:49:09,670
articulate them in somewhat of a
coherent way

10722
02:49:09,670 --> 02:49:09,680
coherent way
 

10723
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:12,230
coherent way
and so it's just something that um is

10724
02:49:12,230 --> 02:49:12,240
and so it's just something that um is
 

10725
02:49:12,240 --> 02:49:13,510
and so it's just something that um is
like a practice that i probably would do

10726
02:49:13,510 --> 02:49:13,520
like a practice that i probably would do
 

10727
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:14,710
like a practice that i probably would do
even if no one read it

10728
02:49:14,710 --> 02:49:14,720
even if no one read it
 

10729
02:49:14,720 --> 02:49:17,190
even if no one read it
and then by being able to publish it uh

10730
02:49:17,190 --> 02:49:17,200
and then by being able to publish it uh
 

10731
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:19,349
and then by being able to publish it uh
what does it do it elicits you know

10732
02:49:19,349 --> 02:49:19,359
what does it do it elicits you know
 

10733
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:21,030
what does it do it elicits you know
both the good and bad responses and so

10734
02:49:21,030 --> 02:49:21,040
both the good and bad responses and so
 

10735
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:22,070
both the good and bad responses and so
people will let me know if they think

10736
02:49:22,070 --> 02:49:22,080
people will let me know if they think
 

10737
02:49:22,080 --> 02:49:23,429
people will let me know if they think
i'm an idiot and they'll

10738
02:49:23,429 --> 02:49:23,439
i'm an idiot and they'll
 

10739
02:49:23,439 --> 02:49:24,710
i'm an idiot and they'll
usually not respond if they think that

10740
02:49:24,710 --> 02:49:24,720
usually not respond if they think that
 

10741
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:27,030
usually not respond if they think that
it's something smart and so um those two

10742
02:49:27,030 --> 02:49:27,040
it's something smart and so um those two
 

10743
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:28,389
it's something smart and so um those two
things are uh really

10744
02:49:28,389 --> 02:49:28,399
things are uh really
 

10745
02:49:28,399 --> 02:49:30,710
things are uh really
um educational for me and and i think

mark spitznagel
 

10837
02:50:51,279 --> 02:50:53,349
mark spitznagel
and so what he essentially does is he

10838
02:50:53,349 --> 02:50:53,359
and so what he essentially does is he
 

10839
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:55,269
and so what he essentially does is he
just reiterates over and over and over

10840
02:50:55,269 --> 02:50:55,279
just reiterates over and over and over
 

10841
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:55,990

10845
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:01,190
long-term thinking outliers disruption
all the stuff and so he's a guy who he

10846
02:51:01,190 --> 02:51:01,200
all the stuff and so he's a guy who he
 

10847
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:02,550
all the stuff and so he's a guy who he
runs a fund

10848
02:51:02,550 --> 02:51:02,560
runs a fund
 

10849
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:04,710
runs a fund
that essentially they just do uh tail

10850
02:51:04,710 --> 02:51:04,720
that essentially they just do uh tail
 

10851
02:51:04,720 --> 02:51:05,990

and so in you know march or february of

10854
02:51:08,550 --> 02:51:08,560
and so in you know march or february of
 

10855
02:51:08,560 --> 02:51:09,750
and so in you know march or february of
2020

10856
02:51:09,750 --> 02:51:09,760
2020
 

10857
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:12,630
2020
they're up like four thousand percent

10858
02:51:12,630 --> 02:51:12,640
they're up like four thousand percent
 

10859
02:51:12,640 --> 02:51:13,269
they're up like four thousand percent
right

10860
02:51:13,269 --> 02:51:13,279
right
 

10861
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:15,830
right
by the way they pretty much lose money

10862
02:51:15,830 --> 02:51:15,840
by the way they pretty much lose money
 

10863
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:16,309
by the way they pretty much lose money
you know

10864
02:51:16,309 --> 02:51:16,319
you know
 

10865
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:18,230
you know
for eight nine years then that happens

10866
02:51:18,230 --> 02:51:18,240
for eight nine years then that happens
 

10867
02:51:18,240 --> 02:51:19,990
for eight nine years then that happens
and so uh

10868
02:51:19,990 --> 02:51:20,000
and so uh
 

10869
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:20,790
and so uh
but they're still one of the best

10870
02:51:20,790 --> 02:51:20,800
but they're still one of the best
 

10871
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:22,710
but they're still one of the best
performing funds if you look at it over

10872
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:22,720
performing funds if you look at it over
 

10873
02:51:22,720 --> 02:51:24,070
performing funds if you look at it over
you know years and years and so it's

10874
02:51:24,070 --> 02:51:24,080
you know years and years and so it's
 

10875
02:51:24,080 --> 02:51:25,750
you know years and years and so it's
just this mindset of

10876
02:51:25,750 --> 02:51:25,760
just this mindset of
 

10877
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:28,150
just this mindset of
uh everyone is so short-term focused and

10878
02:51:28,150 --> 02:51:28,160
uh everyone is so short-term focused and
 

10879
02:51:28,160 --> 02:51:29,510
uh everyone is so short-term focused and
so i think it's just a great reminder to

10880
02:51:29,510 --> 02:51:29,520
so i think it's just a great reminder to
 

10881
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:31,429
so i think it's just a great reminder to
long-term thinking

10882
02:51:31,429 --> 02:51:31,439
long-term thinking
 

10883
02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:34,389
long-term thinking
uh and also i mean i've gotten quite a

uh and also i mean i've gotten quite a
 

10885
02:51:34,399 --> 02:51:36,150
uh and also i mean i've gotten quite a
bit of value just reading the papers

10886
02:51:36,150 --> 02:51:36,160
bit of value just reading the papers
 

10887
02:51:36,160 --> 02:51:37,990
bit of value just reading the papers
that's perhaps more like for technical

10888
02:51:37,990 --> 02:51:38,000
that's perhaps more like for technical
 

10889
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:39,910
that's perhaps more like for technical

02:54:24,710 --> 02:54:24,720
uneasy about it and so after an
 

11071
02:54:24,720 --> 02:54:25,590
uneasy about it and so after an
experience

11072
02:54:25,590 --> 02:54:25,600
experience
 

11073

what i think about it is if you have

11148
02:55:48,070 --> 02:55:48,080
what i think about it is if you have
 

11149
02:55:48,080 --> 02:55:49,269
what i think about it is if you have
resources

11150
02:55:49,269 --> 02:55:49,279
resources
 

11151
02:55:49,279 --> 02:55:51,510
resources
you can have time and if you have time

11152

not doing those things because they feel
 

11179
02:56:14,800 --> 02:56:15,670
not doing those things because they feel
the need to

what makes me happy
 

11191
02:56:26,640 --> 02:56:29,269
what makes me happy
if i can leverage financial resources to

if i can leverage financial resources to
 

11193
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:31,590
if i can leverage financial resources to
create more time to do the things i like

02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:44,710
they're not me right like like there's
almost this element of like you got to

11208
02:56:44,710 --> 02:56:44,720
almost this element of like you got to

11218
02:56:53,830 --> 02:56:53,840
that's a brilliant reframing of it
 

11219
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:57,670
that's a brilliant reframing of it
that said you kind of imply there's a

11220
02:56:57,670 --> 02:56:57,680
that said you kind of imply there's a
 

11221
02:56:57,680 --> 02:56:59,510
that said you kind of imply there's a
there's a reason behind this whole

11222
02:56:59,510 --> 02:56:59,520
there's a reason behind this whole
 

11223
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:01,190
there's a reason behind this whole
existence of ours there's a meaning to

11224
02:57:01,190 --> 02:57:01,200
existence of ours there's a meaning to
 

11225
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:01,910
existence of ours there's a meaning to
it

11226
02:57:01,910 --> 02:57:01,920
it
 

11227
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:03,990
it
so let me ask what is the meaning of

11228
02:57:03,990 --> 02:57:04,000
so let me ask what is the meaning of
 

11229
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:04,950
so let me ask what is the meaning of
life

11230
02:57:04,950 --> 02:57:04,960
life
 

11231
02:57:04,960 --> 02:57:07,750
life

anthony do you think about these
ridiculous big questions

02:57:09,269 --> 02:57:09,279
ridiculous big questions
 

11235
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:10,950
ridiculous big questions
that have no answer every once in a

um context of bitcoin and so bitcoiners
are have two things any bitcoiner if you

11272
02:57:45,910 --> 02:57:45,920
are have two things any bitcoiner if you
 

11273

02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:49,110
things one
they don't want the us dollar price to

02:57:49,110 --> 02:57:49,120
they don't want the us dollar price to
 

11279
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:50,550
they don't want the us dollar price to
go up because they actually want to

11280

go up because they actually want to
 

11281
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:51,590
go up because they actually want to
acquire more bitcoin

11282
02:57:51,590 --> 02:57:51,600
acquire more bitcoin
 

11283
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:53,190
acquire more bitcoin
right and then like once they feel like

11291
02:57:56,960 --> 02:57:58,550
think that they don't own enough and
they want to acquire more

11292
02:57:58,550 --> 02:57:58,560
they want to acquire more
 

11293
02:57:58,560 --> 02:58:02,630
they want to acquire more
and so at some point you say to yourself

11294
02:58:02,630 --> 02:58:02,640
and so at some point you say to yourself
 

11295
02:58:02,640 --> 02:58:05,110
and so at some point you say to yourself
what is enough and i think that the

11296
02:58:05,110 --> 02:58:05,120
what is enough and i think that the
 

11297
02:58:05,120 --> 02:58:06,630
what is enough and i think that the
whole meaning of life

11298
02:58:06,630 --> 02:58:06,640
whole meaning of life
 

11299
02:58:06,640 --> 02:58:09,910
whole meaning of life
is to understand kind of

11300
02:58:09,910 --> 02:58:09,920
is to understand kind of
 

11301
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:12,309
is to understand kind of
what your level of satisfaction is and

11302
02:58:12,309 --> 02:58:12,319
what your level of satisfaction is and
 

11303
02:58:12,319 --> 02:58:13,830
what your level of satisfaction is and
for some people that's a monetary thing

11304
02:58:13,830 --> 02:58:13,840
for some people that's a monetary thing
 

11305
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:15,349
for some people that's a monetary thing
some people that's a freedom of time

11306
02:58:15,349 --> 02:58:15,359
some people that's a freedom of time
 

11307
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:15,830
some people that's a freedom of time
thing

11308
02:58:15,830 --> 02:58:15,840
thing
 

11309
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:17,349
thing
for some people it's an impact thing

11310
02:58:17,349 --> 02:58:17,359
for some people it's an impact thing
 

11311
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:19,590
for some people it's an impact thing
whatever but just understanding that's

11312
02:58:19,590 --> 02:58:19,600
whatever but just understanding that's
 

11313
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:20,230
whatever but just understanding that's
important

11314
02:58:20,230 --> 02:58:20,240
important
 

11315
02:58:20,240 --> 02:58:22,710
important
and then going and accomplishing it and

11316
02:58:22,710 --> 02:58:22,720
and then going and accomplishing it and
 

11317
02:58:22,720 --> 02:58:24,389
and then going and accomplishing it and
what i've found is that

11318
02:58:24,389 --> 02:58:24,399
what i've found is that
 

11319
02:58:24,399 --> 02:58:26,230
what i've found is that
the people who i know who have done this

11320
02:58:26,230 --> 02:58:26,240
the people who i know who have done this
 

11321
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:27,670
the people who i know who have done this
and been intentional about it

11322
02:58:27,670 --> 02:58:27,680
and been intentional about it
 

11323
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:29,349
and been intentional about it
they accomplish it on a much shorter

11324
02:58:29,349 --> 02:58:29,359
they accomplish it on a much shorter
 

11325
02:58:29,359 --> 02:58:31,110
they accomplish it on a much shorter
timeline than people who don't

11326
02:58:31,110 --> 02:58:31,120
timeline than people who don't
 

11327
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:31,830
timeline than people who don't
right there's some people who start

11328
02:58:31,830 --> 02:58:31,840
right there's some people who start
 

11329
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:34,070
right there's some people who start
thinking about when they're 60 well

11330
02:58:34,070 --> 02:58:34,080
thinking about when they're 60 well
 

11331
02:58:34,080 --> 02:58:34,950
thinking about when they're 60 well
naturally you're not going to accomplish

11332
02:58:34,950 --> 02:58:34,960
naturally you're not going to accomplish
 

11333
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:36,150
naturally you're not going to accomplish
it before you're 60 if you start

11334
02:58:36,150 --> 02:58:36,160
it before you're 60 if you start
 

11335
02:58:36,160 --> 02:58:37,590
it before you're 60 if you start
thinking about it at 60.

11336
02:58:37,590 --> 02:58:37,600
thinking about it at 60.
 

11337
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:38,870
thinking about it at 60.
people who are thinking about it earlier

11338
02:58:38,870 --> 02:58:38,880
people who are thinking about it earlier
 

11339
02:58:38,880 --> 02:58:40,230
people who are thinking about it earlier
can do it and so i think that's really

11340
02:58:40,230 --> 02:58:40,240
can do it and so i think that's really
 

11341
02:58:40,240 --> 02:58:41,670
can do it and so i think that's really
it for me it's just like the meaning of

11342
02:58:41,670 --> 02:58:41,680
it for me it's just like the meaning of
 

11343
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:43,110
it for me it's just like the meaning of
life is to enjoy it

11344
02:58:43,110 --> 02:58:43,120
life is to enjoy it
 

11345
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:45,030
life is to enjoy it
the way i think about it that's because

11346
02:58:45,030 --> 02:58:45,040
the way i think about it that's because
 

11347
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:46,309
the way i think about it that's because
it's a really nice formulation

11348
02:58:46,309 --> 02:58:46,319
it's a really nice formulation
 

11349
02:58:46,319 --> 02:58:48,389
it's a really nice formulation
i i almost like to sort of oscillate

11350
02:58:48,389 --> 02:58:48,399
i i almost like to sort of oscillate
 

11351
02:58:48,399 --> 02:58:51,349
i i almost like to sort of oscillate
back and forth so majority of the time

11352
02:58:51,349 --> 02:58:51,359
back and forth so majority of the time
 

11353
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:53,030
back and forth so majority of the time
it's spent at the moment enough is

11354
02:58:53,030 --> 02:58:53,040
it's spent at the moment enough is
 

11355
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:55,990
it's spent at the moment enough is
enough of gratitude

11356
02:58:55,990 --> 02:58:56,000
enough of gratitude
 

11357
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:58,150
enough of gratitude
basically being content with where

11358
02:58:58,150 --> 02:58:58,160
basically being content with where
 

11359
02:58:58,160 --> 02:58:59,830
basically being content with where
you're at like deeply appreciative of

11360
02:58:59,830 --> 02:58:59,840
you're at like deeply appreciative of
 

11361
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:02,469
you're at like deeply appreciative of
every moment and all the bitcoin

11362
02:59:02,469 --> 02:59:02,479
every moment and all the bitcoin
 

11363
02:59:02,479 --> 02:59:04,230
every moment and all the bitcoin
whatever bitcoin you have being deeply

11364
02:59:04,230 --> 02:59:04,240
whatever bitcoin you have being deeply
 

11365
02:59:04,240 --> 02:59:05,030
whatever bitcoin you have being deeply
appreciative

11366
02:59:05,030 --> 02:59:05,040
appreciative
 

11367
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:07,429
appreciative
and that being enough and then some

11368
02:59:07,429 --> 02:59:07,439
and that being enough and then some
 

11369
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:08,950
and that being enough and then some
fraction of time

11370
02:59:08,950 --> 02:59:08,960
fraction of time
 

11371
02:59:08,960 --> 02:59:10,710
fraction of time
perhaps it shrinks as you get older

11372
02:59:10,710 --> 02:59:10,720
perhaps it shrinks as you get older
 

11373
02:59:10,720 --> 02:59:12,150
perhaps it shrinks as you get older
that's maybe there's an optimal

11374
02:59:12,150 --> 02:59:12,160
that's maybe there's an optimal
 

11375
02:59:12,160 --> 02:59:13,429
that's maybe there's an optimal
trajectory there but

11376
02:59:13,429 --> 02:59:13,439
trajectory there but
 

11377
02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:16,309
trajectory there but
some fraction of time is spent being

02:59:16,309 --> 02:59:16,319
some fraction of time is spent being
 

11379
02:59:16,319 --> 02:59:17,990
some fraction of time is spent being

02:59:17,990 --> 02:59:18,000
like deeply self-critical

like deeply self-critical
and nothing is enough nothing you've

and nothing is enough nothing you've
 

11383
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:22,150
and nothing is enough nothing you've
ever done is worth anything it's the

marvel minsky said like the secret to

11386
02:59:24,230 --> 02:59:24,240
marvel minsky said like the secret to
 

11387
02:59:24,240 --> 02:59:25,510
marvel minsky said like the secret to
success

11388
02:59:25,510 --> 02:59:25,520
success
 

11389
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:27,990
success
is hating everything you've ever done so

11390
02:59:27,990 --> 02:59:28,000
is hating everything you've ever done so
 

11391
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:29,910
is hating everything you've ever done so
like that mode of just hating

11392
02:59:29,910 --> 02:59:29,920
like that mode of just hating
 

11393
02:59:29,920 --> 02:59:31,830
like that mode of just hating
everything you've ever done and just

11394
02:59:31,830 --> 02:59:31,840
everything you've ever done and just
 

11395
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:33,510
everything you've ever done and just
like trying to improve trying to make

11396
02:59:33,510 --> 02:59:33,520
like trying to improve trying to make
 

11397
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:34,870
like trying to improve trying to make
stuff better

11398
02:59:34,870 --> 02:59:34,880
stuff better
 

11399
02:59:34,880 --> 02:59:37,349
stuff better
nothing's enough it's never enough that

11400
02:59:37,349 --> 02:59:37,359
nothing's enough it's never enough that
 

11401
02:59:37,359 --> 02:59:38,870
nothing's enough it's never enough that
kind of stuff and then oscillating back

11402
02:59:38,870 --> 02:59:38,880
kind of stuff and then oscillating back
 

11403
02:59:38,880 --> 02:59:39,830
kind of stuff and then oscillating back
and forth like

11404
02:59:39,830 --> 02:59:39,840
and forth like
 

11405
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:41,110
and forth like
you don't have to have the same

11406

you don't have to have the same
 

11407
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:42,790
you don't have to have the same
algorithm operating throughout the day

11408
02:59:42,790 --> 02:59:42,800
algorithm operating throughout the day
 

11409
02:59:42,800 --> 02:59:44,389
algorithm operating throughout the day
you could just like oscillate back and

11410
02:59:44,389 --> 02:59:44,399
you could just like oscillate back and
 

11411
02:59:44,399 --> 02:59:44,950
you could just like oscillate back and
forth

11412
02:59:44,950 --> 02:59:44,960
forth
 

11413
02:59:44,960 --> 02:59:48,070
forth
and maybe reserve that gratitude part

11414
02:59:48,070 --> 02:59:48,080
and maybe reserve that gratitude part
 

11415
02:59:48,080 --> 02:59:49,990
and maybe reserve that gratitude part
the chill part to when you're hanging

11416

the chill part to when you're hanging

the chill part to when you're hanging
out with family and friends and loved

and then when you're like alone or maybe
 

11423
02:59:54,399 --> 02:59:55,349
and then when you're like alone or maybe
a work

11424
02:59:55,349 --> 02:59:55,359
a work
 

11425
02:59:55,359 --> 02:59:57,349
a work
is that the madman comes out kind of

11426
02:59:57,349 --> 02:59:57,359
is that the madman comes out kind of
 

11427
02:59:57,359 --> 02:59:59,590
is that the madman comes out kind of
thing i also think it's um

11428
02:59:59,590 --> 02:59:59,600
thing i also think it's um
 

11429
02:59:59,600 --> 03:00:01,590
thing i also think it's um
kind of purpose driven in the sense of

11430
03:00:01,590 --> 03:00:01,600
kind of purpose driven in the sense of
 

11431
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:03,590
kind of purpose driven in the sense of
there's a lot of people who have the

11432
03:00:03,590 --> 03:00:03,600
there's a lot of people who have the
 

11433
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:06,550
there's a lot of people who have the
uh i need to do more but in a somewhat

11434
03:00:06,550 --> 03:00:06,560
uh i need to do more but in a somewhat
 

11435
03:00:06,560 --> 03:00:08,309
uh i need to do more but in a somewhat
altruistic way

11436
03:00:08,309 --> 03:00:08,319
altruistic way
 

11437
03:00:08,319 --> 03:00:10,150
altruistic way
so they're you know take elon as an

11438
03:00:10,150 --> 03:00:10,160
so they're you know take elon as an
 

11439
03:00:10,160 --> 03:00:11,750
so they're you know take elon as an
example

11440
03:00:11,750 --> 03:00:11,760
example
 

11441
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:15,510
example
the idea of colonizing mars

11442
03:00:15,510 --> 03:00:15,520
the idea of colonizing mars
 

11443
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:18,150
the idea of colonizing mars
sure if he is successful he will be very

11444
03:00:18,150 --> 03:00:18,160
sure if he is successful he will be very
 

11445
03:00:18,160 --> 03:00:18,630
sure if he is successful he will be very
rich

11446
03:00:18,630 --> 03:00:18,640
rich
 

11447
03:00:18,640 --> 03:00:20,389
rich
i don't think you or i or many people

11448
03:00:20,389 --> 03:00:20,399
i don't think you or i or many people
 

11449
03:00:20,399 --> 03:00:22,230
i don't think you or i or many people
believe he's doing it for the money

11450
03:00:22,230 --> 03:00:22,240
believe he's doing it for the money
 

11451
03:00:22,240 --> 03:00:23,269
believe he's doing it for the money
right there's a lot of other things he

11452
03:00:23,269 --> 03:00:23,279
right there's a lot of other things he
 

11453
03:00:23,279 --> 03:00:24,550
right there's a lot of other things he
could do that'd be much easier that

11454
03:00:24,550 --> 03:00:24,560
could do that'd be much easier that
 

11455
03:00:24,560 --> 03:00:26,710
could do that'd be much easier that
would make him tons of money

11456
03:00:26,710 --> 03:00:26,720
would make him tons of money
 

11457
03:00:26,720 --> 03:00:30,950
would make him tons of money
and so in some weird way he has enough

11458
03:00:30,950 --> 03:00:30,960
and so in some weird way he has enough
 

11459
03:00:30,960 --> 03:00:33,670
and so in some weird way he has enough
because he's able to free himself from

11460
03:00:33,670 --> 03:00:33,680
because he's able to free himself from
 

11461
03:00:33,680 --> 03:00:34,870
because he's able to free himself from
the constraints

11462
03:00:34,870 --> 03:00:34,880
the constraints
 

11463
03:00:34,880 --> 03:00:37,670
the constraints
of i need to acquire more resources and

11464
03:00:37,670 --> 03:00:37,680
of i need to acquire more resources and
 

11465
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:39,190
of i need to acquire more resources and
he can focus on what is the thing that i

11466
03:00:39,190 --> 03:00:39,200
he can focus on what is the thing that i
 

11467
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:41,670
he can focus on what is the thing that i
want to work on regardless of money

11468
03:00:41,670 --> 03:00:41,680
want to work on regardless of money
 

11469
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:44,630
want to work on regardless of money
and so in that pursuit that is

11470
03:00:44,630 --> 03:00:44,640
and so in that pursuit that is
 

11471
03:00:44,640 --> 03:00:45,670
and so in that pursuit that is
non-economic

11472
03:00:45,670 --> 03:00:45,680
non-economic
 

11473
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:47,670
non-economic
you can be as selfish as you want

11474
03:00:47,670 --> 03:00:47,680
you can be as selfish as you want
 

11475
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:49,670
you can be as selfish as you want
because ultimately you're not tied back

11476
03:00:49,670 --> 03:00:49,680
because ultimately you're not tied back
 

11477
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:50,950
because ultimately you're not tied back
to

11478
03:00:50,950 --> 03:00:50,960
to
 

11479
03:00:50,960 --> 03:00:53,830
to
this like measurement tool and so it's

11480
03:00:53,830 --> 03:00:53,840
this like measurement tool and so it's
 

11481
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:54,230
this like measurement tool and so it's
this

11482
03:00:54,230 --> 03:00:54,240
this
 

11483
03:00:54,240 --> 03:00:57,590
this
uh again like altruistic non-monetary

11484
03:00:57,590 --> 03:00:57,600
uh again like altruistic non-monetary
 

11485
03:00:57,600 --> 03:00:59,510
uh again like altruistic non-monetary
purpose and i think that there's a lot

11486
03:00:59,510 --> 03:00:59,520
purpose and i think that there's a lot
 

11487
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:00,389
purpose and i think that there's a lot
of people who spend their whole life

11488
03:01:00,389 --> 03:01:00,399
of people who spend their whole life
 

11489
03:01:00,399 --> 03:01:01,349
of people who spend their whole life
looking for that and they don't know

11490
03:01:01,349 --> 03:01:01,359
looking for that and they don't know
 

11491
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:02,870
looking for that and they don't know
what it is

11492
03:01:02,870 --> 03:01:02,880
what it is
 

11493
03:01:02,880 --> 03:01:05,590
what it is
and so again some people may not think

11494
03:01:05,590 --> 03:01:05,600
and so again some people may not think
 

11495
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:05,990
and so again some people may not think
of it that

11496
03:01:05,990 --> 03:01:06,000
of it that
 

11497
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:07,910
of it that
way but if you can find something to do

11498
03:01:07,910 --> 03:01:07,920
way but if you can find something to do
 

11499
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:09,030
way but if you can find something to do
that

11500
03:01:09,030 --> 03:01:09,040
that
 

11501
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:11,269
that
you win i don't think there's a better

11502
03:01:11,269 --> 03:01:11,279
you win i don't think there's a better
 

11503
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:13,670
you win i don't think there's a better
way to end it anthony i'm a huge fan

11504
03:01:13,670 --> 03:01:13,680
way to end it anthony i'm a huge fan
 

11505
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:15,269
way to end it anthony i'm a huge fan
it's a huge honor that you waste all

11506
03:01:15,269 --> 03:01:15,279
it's a huge honor that you waste all
 

11507
03:01:15,279 --> 03:01:16,710
it's a huge honor that you waste all
this time with me today

educating the world for for teaching me
 

11513
03:01:22,399 --> 03:01:23,030
educating the world for for teaching me
uh

11514

uh
 

11515
03:01:23,040 --> 03:01:24,550
uh
inspiring me to learn more about this

11516
03:01:24,550 --> 03:01:24,560
inspiring me to learn more about this
 

11517
03:01:24,560 --> 03:01:26,710
inspiring me to learn more about this
new set of technologies that

11518
03:01:26,710 --> 03:01:26,720
new set of technologies that
 

11519
03:01:26,720 --> 03:01:28,469
new set of technologies that
look like they have a potential to

11520
03:01:28,469 --> 03:01:28,479
look like they have a potential to
 

11521
03:01:28,479 --> 03:01:29,910
look like they have a potential to
change transform

11522
03:01:29,910 --> 03:01:29,920
change transform
 

11523
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:32,070
change transform
