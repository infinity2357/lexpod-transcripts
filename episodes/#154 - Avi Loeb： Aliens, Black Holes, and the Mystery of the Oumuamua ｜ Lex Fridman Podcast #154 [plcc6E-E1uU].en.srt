is life here on earth the only life in
the universe are humans the only

172

a better more precise framing of this
 

179
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,710
a better more precise framing of this
question would be this

180
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:56,720
question would be this
 

181
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,110
question would be this
throughout the expanse of space and over

and left evidence of their efforts so
 

193
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,670
and left evidence of their efforts so
let me ask

194
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:11,680
let me ask
 

195
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,149
let me ask
are we alone that's an excellent

196
00:03:14,149 --> 00:03:14,159
are we alone that's an excellent
 

197
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,430
are we alone that's an excellent
question uh for me

198
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:15,440
question uh for me
 

199
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,190
question uh for me
the answer is sort of clear because

200
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
the answer is sort of clear because
 

201
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,869
the answer is sort of clear because
i start from the principle of modesty

202
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:22,879
i start from the principle of modesty
 

203
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,949
i start from the principle of modesty
you know if we believe that we are alone

204
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:24,959
you know if we believe that we are alone
 

205
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,789
you know if we believe that we are alone
and special and unique

206
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:26,799
and special and unique
 

207
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,509
and special and unique
that shows organs my daughters when they

208
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:29,519
that shows organs my daughters when they
 

209
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,270
that shows organs my daughters when they
were infants they tended to think that

210
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
were infants they tended to think that
 

211
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,229
were infants they tended to think that
they are special

212
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
they are special
 

213
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,309
they are special
unique and then they went out to the

214
00:03:34,309 --> 00:03:34,319
unique and then they went out to the
 

215
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,430
unique and then they went out to the
street

216
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:35,440
street
 

217
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,830
street
and realized that other kids are very

218
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:37,840
and realized that other kids are very
 

219
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,110
and realized that other kids are very
much like them and

220
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:39,120
much like them and
 

221
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,270
much like them and
and then they developed a sense of a

222
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:41,280
and then they developed a sense of a
 

223
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,030
and then they developed a sense of a
better perspective about

224
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:43,040
better perspective about
 

225
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,430
better perspective about
themselves and i think the only reason

226
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
themselves and i think the only reason
 

227
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,190
themselves and i think the only reason
that we are still thinking that we are

228
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
that we are still thinking that we are
 

229
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:47,990
that we are still thinking that we are
special

230

special
 

231
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,070
special
is because we haven't searched well

232
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,080
is because we haven't searched well
 

233
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,830
is because we haven't searched well
enough to find others

234

enough to find others
 

235

enough to find others
that might even be better than us and

236
00:03:55,589 --> 00:03:55,599
that might even be better than us and
 

237
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,949
that might even be better than us and
you know i say that because i look at

238
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
you know i say that because i look at
 

239
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,710
you know i say that because i look at
the newspaper every morning and i see

240
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:58,720
the newspaper every morning and i see
 

241
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,350
the newspaper every morning and i see
that we

242
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
that we
 

243
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,350
that we
do foolish things we are not necessarily

244
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
do foolish things we are not necessarily
 

245
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,869
do foolish things we are not necessarily
the most intelligent ones

the most intelligent ones
 

247
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,470
the most intelligent ones
and if you think about it if you open a

248
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:04,480
and if you think about it if you open a
 

249
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,910
and if you think about it if you open a
recipe book

recipe book
 

251
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,630
recipe book
you see that out of the same ingredients

252
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:08,640
you see that out of the same ingredients
 

253
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,949
you see that out of the same ingredients
you can make very different cakes

you can make very different cakes
 

255
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,190
you can make very different cakes
depending on how you put them together

depending on how you put them together
 

257

and how you heat them up

i mean we are probably not the sharpest

272
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:28,960
i mean we are probably not the sharpest

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,629
i mean we are probably not the sharpest

cookie in the jar
 

275
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,030
cookie in the jar
and the my question is i mean it's

276
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
and the my question is i mean it's
 

277
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,629
and the my question is i mean it's
pretty obvious to me that we're probably

278
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
pretty obvious to me that we're probably
 

279
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,150
pretty obvious to me that we're probably
not alone because

280
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:36,160
not alone because
 

281
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,550
not alone because
half of all the sun-like stars we know

282
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:38,560
half of all the sun-like stars we know
 

283
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,550
half of all the sun-like stars we know
now as astronomers half of the sunlight

284
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:40,560
now as astronomers half of the sunlight
 

285
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,510
now as astronomers half of the sunlight

stars
 

287
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,070
stars
from the kepler satellite data have a

288
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
from the kepler satellite data have a
 

289
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,670
from the kepler satellite data have a
planet

290
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
planet
 

291
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,909
planet
the size of the earth roughly at the

292
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
the size of the earth roughly at the
 

293
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,909
the size of the earth roughly at the
same distance that the earth is

294
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:49,919
same distance that the earth is
 

295
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,710
same distance that the earth is
from the sun and that means that they

296
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:52,720
from the sun and that means that they
 

297
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,870
from the sun and that means that they
can have liquid water on their surface

298
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
can have liquid water on their surface
 

299
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,030
can have liquid water on their surface
and the chemistry of life as we know it

300
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,040
and the chemistry of life as we know it
 

301
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,710
and the chemistry of life as we know it
so if you roll the dice

302
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:58,720
so if you roll the dice
 

303
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,270
so if you roll the dice
billions of times just within the milky

304
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
billions of times just within the milky
 

305
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,870
billions of times just within the milky
way galaxy

306
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:02,880
way galaxy
 

307
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,670
way galaxy
and then you have tens of billions of

308
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:05,680
and then you have tens of billions of
 

309
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,029
and then you have tens of billions of
galaxies like it

310
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
galaxies like it
 

311
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,550
galaxies like it
within the observable volume of the

312
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:08,560
within the observable volume of the
 

313
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,629
within the observable volume of the
universe it would be extremely arrogant

314
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:10,639
universe it would be extremely arrogant
 

315
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,830
universe it would be extremely arrogant
to think that we're special i would

316
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:11,840
to think that we're special i would
 

317
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,710
to think that we're special i would
think that we're

318
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:12,720
think that we're
 

319
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,909
think that we're
sort of middle of the road typical forms

320
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:15,919
sort of middle of the road typical forms
 

321
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,029
sort of middle of the road typical forms
of life and that's why

322
00:05:17,029 --> 00:05:17,039
of life and that's why
 

323
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,110
of life and that's why
nobody pays attention to us you know if

324
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,120
nobody pays attention to us you know if
 

325
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,590
nobody pays attention to us you know if
you go down the street on a sidewalk

326
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:21,600
you go down the street on a sidewalk
 

327
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,909
you go down the street on a sidewalk
and you see an ant you don't pay

328
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:23,919
and you see an ant you don't pay
 

329
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:25,990
and you see an ant you don't pay
attention or a special respect to that

330
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,000
attention or a special respect to that
 

331
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,070
attention or a special respect to that
ant you just continue to walk and

332
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,080
ant you just continue to walk and
 

333
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,790
ant you just continue to walk and
so i think that we are sort of average

334
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:30,800
so i think that we are sort of average
 

335
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,790
so i think that we are sort of average
not very interesting not exciting so

336
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
not very interesting not exciting so
 

337
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,629
not very interesting not exciting so
nobody cares about us

338
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,639
nobody cares about us
 

339
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,550
nobody cares about us
we tend to think that we're special but

340
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:36,560
we tend to think that we're special but
 

341
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,629
we tend to think that we're special but
that's a sign of immaturity and we're

342
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:38,639
that's a sign of immaturity and we're
 

343
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,390
that's a sign of immaturity and we're
very early on in our development

344
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
very early on in our development
 

345
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,469
very early on in our development
yes that's another thing that we have

346
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
yes that's another thing that we have
 

347
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,629
yes that's another thing that we have
our technology only for 100 years

348
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:44,639
our technology only for 100 years
 

349
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,790
our technology only for 100 years
and it's evolving exponentially right

350
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:46,800
and it's evolving exponentially right
 

351
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,029
and it's evolving exponentially right
now on a three-year time scale

352
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
now on a three-year time scale
 

353
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,629
now on a three-year time scale
so imagine what would happen in a

354
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:50,639
so imagine what would happen in a
 

355
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,790
so imagine what would happen in a
hundred years in a thousand years

356
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:52,800
hundred years in a thousand years
 

357
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,790
hundred years in a thousand years
in a million years or in a billion years

358
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:54,800
in a million years or in a billion years
 

359
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,070
in a million years or in a billion years
now the sun

360
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
now the sun
 

361
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,189
now the sun
is actually relatively late in the star

362
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
is actually relatively late in the star
 

363
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,909
is actually relatively late in the star
formation

364
00:05:59,909 --> 00:05:59,919
formation
 

365
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,590
formation
history of the universe most of the

366
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
history of the universe most of the
 

367
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,749
history of the universe most of the
sun-like stars formed earlier

368
00:06:03,749 --> 00:06:03,759
sun-like stars formed earlier
 

369
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,670
sun-like stars formed earlier
and some of them already died you know

370
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
and some of them already died you know
 

371
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,189
and some of them already died you know
became white dwarfs

372
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
became white dwarfs
 

373
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,309
became white dwarfs
and so if you imagine that

374
00:06:10,309 --> 00:06:10,319
and so if you imagine that
 

375
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,110
and so if you imagine that
a civilization like ours existed around

376
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
a civilization like ours existed around
 

377
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,029
a civilization like ours existed around
a typical sun-like star

378
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:15,039
a typical sun-like star
 

379
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,990
a typical sun-like star
by now if they survived they could be a

380
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,000
by now if they survived they could be a
 

381
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,430
by now if they survived they could be a
billion years old

382
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
billion years old
 

383
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,350
billion years old
and then imagine a billionaire

384
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
and then imagine a billionaire
 

385
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,670
and then imagine a billionaire
technology it would look like magic to

386
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:23,680
technology it would look like magic to
 

387
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,230
technology it would look like magic to
us it

388
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:24,240
us it
 

389
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,469
us it
you know an approximation to god we

390
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
you know an approximation to god we
 

391
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,390
you know an approximation to god we
wouldn't be able to understand it

392
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
wouldn't be able to understand it
 

393
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,189
wouldn't be able to understand it
uh and so to in my view we should be

394
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:31,199
uh and so to in my view we should be
 

395
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,309
uh and so to in my view we should be
humble

396
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
humble
 

397
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,230
humble
and by the way we should probably just

398
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,240
and by the way we should probably just
 

399
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,070
and by the way we should probably just
listen and not speak

400
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:36,080
listen and not speak
 

401
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,590
listen and not speak
because there is a risk right if if

402
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:39,600
because there is a risk right if if
 

403
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,070
because there is a risk right if if
if you are inferior there is a risk if

404
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
if you are inferior there is a risk if
 

405
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,230
if you are inferior there is a risk if
you speak too loudly

406
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,240
you speak too loudly
 

407
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,870
you speak too loudly
uh something bad may happen to you you

408
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:46,880
uh something bad may happen to you you
 

409
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,990
uh something bad may happen to you you
mentioned uh

410
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,000
mentioned uh
 

411
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,230
mentioned uh
we should be humble also in the sense

412
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:50,240
we should be humble also in the sense
 

413
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,070
we should be humble also in the sense
with the analogy to ants

414
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,080
with the analogy to ants
 

415
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,909
with the analogy to ants
that uh they might be better than us

416
00:06:55,909 --> 00:06:55,919
that uh they might be better than us
 

417
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,230
that uh they might be better than us
so there's a kind of scale that we're

418
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:58,240
so there's a kind of scale that we're
 

419
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,670
so there's a kind of scale that we're
talking about and in the

420
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
talking about and in the
 

421
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,670
talking about and in the
in the question you mentioned the word

422
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
in the question you mentioned the word
 

423
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,029
in the question you mentioned the word
sentient

424
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
sentient
 

425
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,469
sentient
so sentience or maybe the more basic

426
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:06,479
so sentience or maybe the more basic
 

427
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,029
so sentience or maybe the more basic
formulation of that is consciousness do

428
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:09,039
formulation of that is consciousness do
 

429
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,790
formulation of that is consciousness do
you think

430
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:10,800
you think
 

431
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,990
you think
um do you think that this thing within

432
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:14,000
um do you think that this thing within
 

433
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,670
um do you think that this thing within
us humans in terms of the

434
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:15,680
us humans in terms of the
 

435
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,350
us humans in terms of the
typical life form of consciousness

436
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:19,360
typical life form of consciousness
 

437
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,550
typical life form of consciousness
is the essential element that permeates

438
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
is the essential element that permeates
 

439
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,309
is the essential element that permeates
other if if there's other alien

440
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:24,319
other if if there's other alien
 

441
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,830
other if if there's other alien
civilizations out there that they have

442
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:25,840
civilizations out there that they have
 

443
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,990
civilizations out there that they have
something like consciousness as well

444
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:28,000
something like consciousness as well
 

445
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,629
something like consciousness as well
or is this i guess i'm asking can you

446
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
or is this i guess i'm asking can you
 

447
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,270
or is this i guess i'm asking can you
try to untangle the word sentient

448
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:33,280
try to untangle the word sentient
 

449
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,150
try to untangle the word sentient
yeah so that's that's a good question uh

450
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,160
yeah so that's that's a good question uh
 

451
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,390
yeah so that's that's a good question uh
i think what is most abundant depending

452
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
i think what is most abundant depending
 

453
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,070
i think what is most abundant depending
on how long it survives

454
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,080
on how long it survives
 

455
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,430
on how long it survives
so if you look at us as an example

456
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
so if you look at us as an example
 

457
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,790
so if you look at us as an example
we are now we do have conscious and we

458
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:46,800
we are now we do have conscious and we
 

459
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,150
we are now we do have conscious and we
do have technology

460
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,160
do have technology
 

461
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,830
do have technology
but the technologies that we are

462
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:49,840
but the technologies that we are
 

463
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,469
but the technologies that we are
developing are also

464
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
developing are also
 

465
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:55,270
developing are also
means for our own destruction yes we can

466
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,280
means for our own destruction yes we can
 

467
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,749
means for our own destruction yes we can
tell

468
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
tell
 

469
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,909
tell
you know we can change the climate if we

470
00:07:57,909 --> 00:07:57,919
you know we can change the climate if we
 

471
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,670
you know we can change the climate if we
are not careful enough

472
00:07:59,670 --> 00:07:59,680
are not careful enough
 

473
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,629
are not careful enough
we can go into nuclear wars so we are

474
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
we can go into nuclear wars so we are
 

475
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,749
we can go into nuclear wars so we are
developing

476
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:03,759
developing
 

477
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,390
developing
means for our own destruction through

478
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
means for our own destruction through
 

479
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,150
means for our own destruction through
self-inflicted wounds

480
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,160
self-inflicted wounds
 

481
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,350
self-inflicted wounds
and it might well be that creatures like

482
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:11,360
and it might well be that creatures like
 

483
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,749
and it might well be that creatures like
us

484
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:11,759
us
 

485
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,749
us
are not long-lived that the crocodiles

486
00:08:15,749 --> 00:08:15,759
are not long-lived that the crocodiles
 

487
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,390
are not long-lived that the crocodiles
on other planets live for billions of

488
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:18,400
on other planets live for billions of
 

489
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,270
on other planets live for billions of
years

490
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
years
 

491
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,869
years
they don't destroy themselves they live

492
00:08:20,869 --> 00:08:20,879
they don't destroy themselves they live
 

493
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,350
they don't destroy themselves they live
naturally and so if you look around

494
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,360
naturally and so if you look around
 

495
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,749
naturally and so if you look around
the most common thing would be dumb

496
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
the most common thing would be dumb
 

497
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,670
the most common thing would be dumb
animals that live for long times you

498
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:27,680
animals that live for long times you
 

499
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,990
animals that live for long times you
know not those that have conscious

500
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
know not those that have conscious
 

501
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,350
know not those that have conscious
but in terms of changing the environment

502
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,360
but in terms of changing the environment
 

503
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,790
but in terms of changing the environment
i think since i mean humans develop

504
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:36,800
i think since i mean humans develop
 

505
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,230
i think since i mean humans develop
tools they've developed the ability

506
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:40,240
tools they've developed the ability
 

507
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,149
tools they've developed the ability
to construct technologies that would

508
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
to construct technologies that would
 

509
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,230
to construct technologies that would
lift us from this planet that we were

510
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:46,240
lift us from this planet that we were
 

511
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,990
lift us from this planet that we were
born in and that's something

512
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:48,000
born in and that's something
 

513
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,070
born in and that's something
animals without a conscious

514
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:50,080
animals without a conscious
 

515
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,150
animals without a conscious
consciousness cannot really

516
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:52,160
consciousness cannot really
 

517
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,670
consciousness cannot really
do and and so i you know in terms of

518
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:55,680
do and and so i you know in terms of
 

519
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,110
do and and so i you know in terms of
uh looking for things that are new that

520
00:08:59,110 --> 00:08:59,120
uh looking for things that are new that
 

521
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,990
uh looking for things that are new that
that went beyond the circumstances they

522
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:02,000
that went beyond the circumstances they
 

523
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,829
that went beyond the circumstances they
were born into

524
00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:03,839
were born into
 

525
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,269
were born into
i would think that even if they are

526
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:05,279
i would think that even if they are
 

527
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,350
i would think that even if they are
short-lived these are

528
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
short-lived these are
 

529
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,949
short-lived these are
the creatures that made the biggest

530
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
the creatures that made the biggest
 

531
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:10,550
the creatures that made the biggest
difference to their environment

532
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:10,560
difference to their environment
 

533
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,710
difference to their environment
and we can search for them you know even

534
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:12,720
and we can search for them you know even
 

535
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,910
and we can search for them you know even
if they're short-lived

536
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:13,920
if they're short-lived
 

537
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,750
if they're short-lived
and most of the civilizations are dead

538
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
and most of the civilizations are dead
 

539
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,110
and most of the civilizations are dead
by now yeah

540
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,120
by now yeah
 

541
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,470
by now yeah
even if that's the case that's sad to

542
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:18,480
even if that's the case that's sad to
 

543
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,389
even if that's the case that's sad to
think about by the way well but if you

544
00:09:20,389 --> 00:09:20,399
think about by the way well but if you
 

545
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:21,590
think about by the way well but if you
look on earth

546
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:21,600
look on earth
 

547
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,430
look on earth
that you know there's lots of cultures

548
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:23,440
that you know there's lots of cultures
 

549
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,030
that you know there's lots of cultures
that exist throughout time and they're

550
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:25,040
that exist throughout time and they're
 

551
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,990
that exist throughout time and they're
dead by now

552
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:26,000
dead by now
 

553
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,949
dead by now
the mayan culture was very sophisticated

554
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:28,959
the mayan culture was very sophisticated
 

555
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:29,670
the mayan culture was very sophisticated
died

556
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:29,680
died
 

557
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,350
died
but we can find evidence for it and

558
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:31,360
but we can find evidence for it and
 

559
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,030
but we can find evidence for it and
learn about it just by

560
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,040
learn about it just by
 

561
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,790
learn about it just by
archaeology digging into the ground

562
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:34,800
archaeology digging into the ground
 

563
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,870
archaeology digging into the ground
looking and so we can do the same thing

564
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:36,880
looking and so we can do the same thing
 

565
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,990
looking and so we can do the same thing
in space

566
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:38,000
in space
 

567
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,030
in space
look for dead civilizations and perhaps

568
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,040
look for dead civilizations and perhaps
 

569
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,710
look for dead civilizations and perhaps
we can learn a lesson

570
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
we can learn a lesson
 

571
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,230
we can learn a lesson
why they died and behave better so that

572
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
why they died and behave better so that
 

573
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,230
why they died and behave better so that
we will not share the same fate

574
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
we will not share the same fate
 

575
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,910
we will not share the same fate
so i think you know there is a lesson to

576
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
so i think you know there is a lesson to
 

577
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,310
so i think you know there is a lesson to
be learned from the sky

578
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:52,320
be learned from the sky
 

579
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,389
be learned from the sky
and by the way i should also say if we

580
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
and by the way i should also say if we
 

581
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,790
and by the way i should also say if we
find a technology that we have not

582
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:56,800
find a technology that we have not
 

583
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,389
find a technology that we have not
dreamed of that we can import to earth

584
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:00,399
dreamed of that we can import to earth
 

585
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,710
dreamed of that we can import to earth
that may be a better strategy for making

586
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
that may be a better strategy for making
 

587
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,750
that may be a better strategy for making
a fortune

588
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:03,760
a fortune
 

589
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,069
a fortune
than going to silicon valley or going to

590
00:10:06,069 --> 00:10:06,079
than going to silicon valley or going to
 

591
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:07,190
than going to silicon valley or going to
wall street

592
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:07,200
wall street
 

593
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,790
wall street
because you learn you make a jump start

594
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:10,800
because you learn you make a jump start
 

595
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,389
because you learn you make a jump start
into something of the future so that's

596
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:12,399
into something of the future so that's
 

597
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,150
into something of the future so that's
one way to do the leap is actually to

598
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:14,160
one way to do the leap is actually to
 

599
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,269
one way to do the leap is actually to
find

600
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:15,279
find
 

601
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,430
find
to literally discover versus come up

602
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:17,440
to literally discover versus come up
 

603
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,710
to literally discover versus come up
with the idea

604
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
with the idea
 

605
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,910
with the idea
in our own limited human capacity like a

606
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:21,920
in our own limited human capacity like a
 

607
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,150
in our own limited human capacity like a
cognitive capacity it would look like it

608
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,160
cognitive capacity it would look like it
 

609
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,910
cognitive capacity it would look like it
would feel like cheating in an exam

610
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:25,920
would feel like cheating in an exam
 

611
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,509
would feel like cheating in an exam
where you look over the shoulder of a

612
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
where you look over the shoulder of a
 

613
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,550
where you look over the shoulder of a
student next to you

614
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:28,560
student next to you
 

615
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,590
student next to you
yeah but it's not good on an exam but it

616
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:31,600
yeah but it's not good on an exam but it
 

617
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,990
yeah but it's not good on an exam but it
is good

618
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,000
is good
 

619
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,509
is good
when you're coming up with technology

620
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:33,519
when you're coming up with technology
 

621
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,190
when you're coming up with technology
that could change the the fabric of

622
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
that could change the the fabric of
 

623
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,470
that could change the the fabric of
human civilization

624
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:36,480
human civilization
 

625
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,829
human civilization
but there is uh you know in my

626
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
but there is uh you know in my
 

627
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,110
but there is uh you know in my
neck of the woods of artificial

neck of the woods of artificial
 

629
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,110

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:43,120
intelligence there's a lot of
 

631
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,790
intelligence there's a lot of
trajectories one can imagine

632

trajectories one can imagine
 

633
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,389
trajectories one can imagine
of creating very powerful

you know you can call super intelligence

640
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:55,279
you know you can call super intelligence
 

641
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,030
you know you can call super intelligence
that could achieve

00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
that could achieve
 

643
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,550
that could achieve
space exploration all those kinds of

space exploration all those kinds of

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,389
space exploration all those kinds of
things without consciousness

646

things without consciousness
 

647
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,910
things without consciousness
right without something that to us

00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
right without something that to us

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,069
humans looks like consciousness
and there you know there is a sad

652
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
and there you know there is a sad
 

653
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,710
and there you know there is a sad
feeling i have that consciousness too in

terms of us being humble
 

657
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,470
terms of us being humble
is a thing we humans take too seriously

658
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:16,480
is a thing we humans take too seriously
 

659
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,230
is a thing we humans take too seriously
that it's we think it's special just

660
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
that it's we think it's special just
 

661
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,069
that it's we think it's special just
because we have it but it could be a

because we have it but it could be a
 

663
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,509
because we have it but it could be a
thing that's actually holding us back in

664
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
thing that's actually holding us back in
 

665
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,949
thing that's actually holding us back in
some kind of way may well be

00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:22,959
some kind of way may well be
 

667
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,190
some kind of way may well be
it will be uh i should say something

668
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,200
it will be uh i should say something
 

669
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,150
it will be uh i should say something
about ai

670
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:26,160
about ai
 

671
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,470
about ai
because i do think it offers a very

672
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
because i do think it offers a very
 

673
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,470
because i do think it offers a very
important

674
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
important
 

675
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,430
important
step into the future if you look at the

676
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
step into the future if you look at the
 

677
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,190
step into the future if you look at the
old testament the bible

678
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
old testament the bible
 

679
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,910
old testament the bible
there is this story about noah's ark

680
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:37,920
there is this story about noah's ark
 

681
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:38,790
there is this story about noah's ark
that you might

682
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:38,800
that you might
 

683
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,230
that you might
know about noah knew about

684
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
know about noah knew about
 

685
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,350
know about noah knew about
a great flood that is about to endanger

686
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,360
a great flood that is about to endanger
 

687
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,389
a great flood that is about to endanger
all life on earth so he decided to build

688
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
all life on earth so he decided to build
 

689
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,670
all life on earth so he decided to build
an ark

690
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:49,680
an ark
 

691
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,910
an ark
and the bible actually talks about

692
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
and the bible actually talks about
 

693
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,910
and the bible actually talks about
specifically what the the size of this

694
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
specifically what the the size of this
 

695
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,990
specifically what the the size of this
ark was what the dimensions were

696
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,000
ark was what the dimensions were
 

697
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,350
ark was what the dimensions were
turns out it was quite similar to um

698
00:11:59,350 --> 00:11:59,360
turns out it was quite similar to um
 

699
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,269
turns out it was quite similar to um
that we will discuss in a few minutes

700
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:01,279
that we will discuss in a few minutes
 

701
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,910
that we will discuss in a few minutes
but at any event he built this ark

702
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:03,920
but at any event he built this ark
 

703
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,550
but at any event he built this ark
and he put animals on it so that they

704
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:06,560
and he put animals on it so that they
 

705
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,829
and he put animals on it so that they
were saved from the

706
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:07,839
were saved from the
 

707
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,069
were saved from the
great flood now you can think about

708
00:12:10,069 --> 00:12:10,079
great flood now you can think about
 

709
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,750
great flood now you can think about
doing the same on earth

710
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:11,760
doing the same on earth
 

711
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,949
doing the same on earth
because there are risks for future

712
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
because there are risks for future
 

713
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,269
because there are risks for future
catastrophes you know we could have the

714
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:17,279
catastrophes you know we could have the
 

715
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,870
catastrophes you know we could have the
self-inflicted wounds that we were

716
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:18,880
self-inflicted wounds that we were
 

717
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:19,670
self-inflicted wounds that we were
talking about

718
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:19,680
talking about
 

719
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,310
talking about
like nuclear war changing the climate or

720
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
like nuclear war changing the climate or
 

721
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,030
like nuclear war changing the climate or
there could be

722
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
there could be
 

723
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,069
there could be
an asteroid impacting us just like the

724
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:26,079
an asteroid impacting us just like the
 

725
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,750
an asteroid impacting us just like the
dinosaurs died you know they

726
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
dinosaurs died you know they
 

727
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,190
dinosaurs died you know they
the dinosaurs didn't have science

728
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:29,200
the dinosaurs didn't have science
 

729
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,790
the dinosaurs didn't have science
astronomy they couldn't

730
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
astronomy they couldn't
 

731
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,190
astronomy they couldn't
have a warning system but there was this

732
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:33,200
have a warning system but there was this
 

733
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,230
have a warning system but there was this
big stone big rock that approached there

734
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:36,240
big stone big rock that approached there
 

735
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,389
big stone big rock that approached there
it must have been a beautiful sight yeah

736
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:38,399
it must have been a beautiful sight yeah
 

737
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,230
it must have been a beautiful sight yeah
just when it was approaching got very

738
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
just when it was approaching got very
 

739
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,670
just when it was approaching got very
big and then smashed them

740
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:41,680
big and then smashed them
 

741
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,389
big and then smashed them
okay and killed them so um you could

742
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:44,399
okay and killed them so um you could
 

743
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,670
okay and killed them so um you could
have a catastrophe like that

744
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
have a catastrophe like that
 

745
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,509
have a catastrophe like that
or in a billion years the sun will

746
00:12:47,509 --> 00:12:47,519
or in a billion years the sun will
 

747
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,670
or in a billion years the sun will
basically boil off all the oceans

748
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:49,680
basically boil off all the oceans
 

749
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,030
basically boil off all the oceans
on earth and

750
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040

 

751
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,190

currently all our eggs are in one basket

752
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:55,200
currently all our eggs are in one basket
 

753
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,030
currently all our eggs are in one basket
but we can spread them

754
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,040
but we can spread them
 

755
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,350
but we can spread them
it's sort of like the printing press if

756
00:12:59,350 --> 00:12:59,360
it's sort of like the printing press if
 

757
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,310
it's sort of like the printing press if
you think about it

758
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:00,320
you think about it
 

759
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,190
you think about it
the revolution that gutenberg brought is

760
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:03,200
the revolution that gutenberg brought is
 

761
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:03,910
the revolution that gutenberg brought is
there were

762
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:03,920
there were
 

763
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,230
there were
very few copies of the bible at the time

764
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,240
very few copies of the bible at the time
 

765
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,910
very few copies of the bible at the time
and each of them was precious because it

766
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:07,920
and each of them was precious because it
 

767
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,949
and each of them was precious because it
was handwritten

768
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
was handwritten
 

769
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,030
was handwritten
but once the printing press produced

770
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:11,040
but once the printing press produced
 

771
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,310
but once the printing press produced
multiple copies

772
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
multiple copies
 

773
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,550
multiple copies
you know if something bad happened to

774
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:14,560
you know if something bad happened to
 

775
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,910
you know if something bad happened to
one of the copies it wasn't

776
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:15,920
one of the copies it wasn't
 

777
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,350
one of the copies it wasn't
a catastrophe you know it wasn't

778
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:17,360
a catastrophe you know it wasn't
 

779
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,110
a catastrophe you know it wasn't
disaster because you had many more

780
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
disaster because you had many more
 

781
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:19,990
disaster because you had many more
copies that

782
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
copies that
 

783
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,670
copies that
and so if we have copies of life

784
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:23,680
and so if we have copies of life
 

785
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,030
and so if we have copies of life
here on earth elsewhere then we avoid

786
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:27,040
here on earth elsewhere then we avoid
 

787
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,230
here on earth elsewhere then we avoid
the risk of it

788
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
the risk of it
 

789
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,430
the risk of it
being eliminated by a single point

790
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:31,440
being eliminated by a single point
 

791
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,389
being eliminated by a single point
breakdown catastrophe so the question is

792
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
breakdown catastrophe so the question is
 

793
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,509
breakdown catastrophe so the question is
can we build

794
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:35,519
can we build
 

795
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,949
can we build
nox spaceship that will carry life as we

796
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
nox spaceship that will carry life as we
 

797
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:39,350
nox spaceship that will carry life as we
know

798
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
know
 

799
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,110
know
now you might think we have to put

800
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:41,120
now you might think we have to put
 

801
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,470
now you might think we have to put
elephants and

802
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:42,480
elephants and
 

803
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,590
elephants and
whales and birds on a big spaceship but

804
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
whales and birds on a big spaceship but
 

805
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,629
whales and birds on a big spaceship but
that's not true

806
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
that's not true
 

807
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,269
that's not true
because all you need to know is the dna

808
00:13:49,269 --> 00:13:49,279
because all you need to know is the dna
 

809
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:49,990
because all you need to know is the dna
making

810
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
making
 

811
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,870
making
the genetic making of these animals put

812
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:52,880
the genetic making of these animals put
 

813
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,750
the genetic making of these animals put
it on

814
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:53,760
it on
 

815
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,790
it on
a computer system that has ai

816
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:56,800
a computer system that has ai
 

817
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,389
a computer system that has ai
plus a 3d printer

818
00:14:00,389 --> 00:14:00,399
plus a 3d printer
 

819
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,710
plus a 3d printer
so that this cubesat which is rather

820
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:02,720
so that this cubesat which is rather
 

821
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,670
so that this cubesat which is rather
small

822
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:03,680
small
 

823
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,150
small
can go with this information to another

824
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,160
can go with this information to another
 

825
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,030
can go with this information to another
planet and use the raw materials there

826
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
planet and use the raw materials there
 

827
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,069
planet and use the raw materials there
to produce synthetic life and that would

828
00:14:12,069 --> 00:14:12,079
to produce synthetic life and that would
 

829
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,069
to produce synthetic life and that would
be a way of producing copies just like

830
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
be a way of producing copies just like
 

831
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,590
be a way of producing copies just like
the gutenberg

832
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:15,600
the gutenberg
 

833
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,430
the gutenberg
printing press yeah and it doesn't have

834
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
printing press yeah and it doesn't have
 

835
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,110
printing press yeah and it doesn't have
to be exact copies of the humans it

836
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,120
to be exact copies of the humans it
 

837
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,750
to be exact copies of the humans it
could just

838
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:19,760
could just
 

839
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,470
could just
contain some basic elements of life and

840
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:22,480
contain some basic elements of life and
 

841
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,189
contain some basic elements of life and
then

842
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:23,199
then
 

843
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,150
then
have enough life on board that it could

844
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,160
have enough life on board that it could
 

845
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,750
have enough life on board that it could
uh

846
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
uh
 

847
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,910
uh
reproduce the process of evolution on

848
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:29,920
reproduce the process of evolution on
 

849
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,870
reproduce the process of evolution on
another place

850
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:30,880
another place
 

851
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,790

of course because it
uh you confront the mortality of your

there are 10 to the power 20 planets
 

903
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,550
there are 10 to the power 20 planets
like the earth

904
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:16,560
like the earth
 

905
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,949

in the observable volume of the universe

906
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:18,959
in the observable volume of the universe
 

907
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:20,069
in the observable volume of the universe
and

908

and even conquering all of earth
 

913
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,430
and even conquering all of earth
is just like an ant hugging a single

we are short-lived you know we
 

929
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,030
we are short-lived you know we
within a hundred years that's it right

930
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
within a hundred years that's it right

well let's uh talk about the

948
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
well let's uh talk about the
 

949
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:07,509
well let's uh talk about the
probably the most interesting object

950
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
probably the most interesting object
 

951
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,310
probably the most interesting object
i've heard about

952
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
i've heard about
 

953
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,230
i've heard about
and also the most fun to pronounce

954
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:12,240

 

955
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,350

can you tell me the story of this object

956
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:15,360
can you tell me the story of this object
 

957
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,629
can you tell me the story of this object
and why it may be

958
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:16,639
and why it may be
 

959
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,749
and why it may be
an important event in human history and

960
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:19,759
an important event in human history and
 

961
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,749
an important event in human history and
is it possibly a piece of alien

962
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:21,759
is it possibly a piece of alien
 

963
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,949
is it possibly a piece of alien
technology

964
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
technology
 

965
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,310
technology
right so this is the first object that

966
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:26,320
right so this is the first object that
 

967
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,430
right so this is the first object that
was spotted

968
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
was spotted
 

969
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,629
was spotted
close to earth from outside the solar

970
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
close to earth from outside the solar
 

971
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,670
close to earth from outside the solar
system

972
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:31,680
system
 

973
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,310
system
and it was found in on october 19

974
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:35,320
and it was found in on october 19
 

975
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,790
and it was found in on october 19
2017 and at that time it was receding

976
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:38,800
2017 and at that time it was receding
 

977
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,189
2017 and at that time it was receding
away from us

978
00:16:41,189 --> 00:16:41,199
away from us
 

979
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,749
away from us
and at first astronomers thought it must

980
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:43,759
and at first astronomers thought it must
 

981
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,670
and at first astronomers thought it must
be a piece of rock you know just like

982
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
be a piece of rock you know just like
 

983
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,670
be a piece of rock you know just like
all the asteroids and comets that we

984
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:47,680
all the asteroids and comets that we
 

985
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,230
all the asteroids and comets that we
have seen from within the solar system

986
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
have seen from within the solar system
 

987

have seen from within the solar system
and it just came from another star i

988
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:52,880
and it just came from another star i
 

989
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,790
and it just came from another star i
should say that the actual discovery of

990
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:54,800
should say that the actual discovery of
 

991
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,629
should say that the actual discovery of
this object was surprising to me because

992
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
this object was surprising to me because
 

993
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,069
this object was surprising to me because
a decade earlier

994
00:16:58,069 --> 00:16:58,079
a decade earlier
 

995
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,230
a decade earlier
i wrote the first paper together with ed

996
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
i wrote the first paper together with ed
 

997
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,430
i wrote the first paper together with ed
turner and

00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
whether the same telescope that was
 

1003
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,990
whether the same telescope that was
serving the sky

pan stars from hawaii would find

1006
00:17:10,549 --> 00:17:10,559
pan stars from hawaii would find
 

1007
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,350
pan stars from hawaii would find
anything from

1008
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:11,360
anything from
 

1009
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,990
anything from
interstellar space given what we know

1010
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:14,000
interstellar space given what we know
 

1011
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,590
interstellar space given what we know
about the solar system so if you assume

1012
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
about the solar system so if you assume
 

1013
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,390
about the solar system so if you assume
that other

1014
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:16,400
that other
 

1015
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,189
that other
planetary systems have similar abundance

1016
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:19,199
planetary systems have similar abundance
 

1017
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:19,429
planetary systems have similar abundance
of

1018
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:19,439
of
 

1019
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,750
of
rocks and you just calculate how many

1020
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
rocks and you just calculate how many
 

1021
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,750
rocks and you just calculate how many
should be ejected into interstellar

1022
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:23,760
should be ejected into interstellar
 

1023
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,630
should be ejected into interstellar

the conclusion is no it we shouldn't

1026
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:27,760
the conclusion is no it we shouldn't
 

1027
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,630
the conclusion is no it we shouldn't
find anything

1028
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:28,640
find anything
 

1029
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,029
find anything
with pan stars to me i apologize it's

1030
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:31,039
with pan stars to me i apologize it's
 

1031
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:31,990
with pan stars to me i apologize it's
probably revealing my

1032
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
probably revealing my
 

1033
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,310
probably revealing my
stupidity but it was surprising to me

1034
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:34,320
stupidity but it was surprising to me
 

1035
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,630
stupidity but it was surprising to me
that so few interstellar objects

1036
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:36,640
that so few interstellar objects
 

1037
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,190
that so few interstellar objects
from outside this whole system have ever

1038
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:39,200
from outside this whole system have ever
 

1039
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,310
from outside this whole system have ever
been detected or

1040
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:40,320
been detected or
 

1041
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,669
been detected or
not none has been you you do well

1042
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:43,679
not none has been you you do well
 

1043
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,990
not none has been you you do well
maybe talk about it that there has been

1044
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:46,000
maybe talk about it that there has been
 

1045
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,950
maybe talk about it that there has been
uh uh

1046
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
uh uh
 

1047
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,110
uh uh
one or two rocks since then well since

1048
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
one or two rocks since then well since
 

1049
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,310
one or two rocks since then well since
then there was one

1050
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
then there was one
 

1051
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,029
then there was one
uh called the borisov it was discovered

1052
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:53,039
uh called the borisov it was discovered
 

1053
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,430
uh called the borisov it was discovered
by

1054
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
by
 

1055
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,830
by
an amateur russian astronomer yeah uh

1056
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:55,840
an amateur russian astronomer yeah uh
 

1057
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,350
an amateur russian astronomer yeah uh
gennady borisov

1058
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:57,360
gennady borisov
 

1059
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,710
gennady borisov
and that one looked like a comet

1060
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
and that one looked like a comet
 

1061
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,549
and that one looked like a comet
yeah and just like a comet from within

1062
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:04,559
yeah and just like a comet from within
 

1063
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,150
yeah and just like a comet from within
the solar system but this is a really

1064
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,160
the solar system but this is a really
 

1065
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,789
the solar system but this is a really
important point

1066
00:18:06,789 --> 00:18:06,799
important point
 

1067
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,350
important point
sorry to interrupt it you showed that

1068
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
sorry to interrupt it you showed that
 

1069
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,350
sorry to interrupt it you showed that
it's unlikely that a rock from another

1070
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
it's unlikely that a rock from another
 

1071
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,870
it's unlikely that a rock from another
solar system

1072
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:12,880
solar system
 

1073
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,270
solar system
would arrive to ours right and so the

1074
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:15,280
would arrive to ours right and so the
 

1075
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,870
would arrive to ours right and so the
actual detection of this one was

1076
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:16,880
actual detection of this one was
 

1077
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,310
actual detection of this one was
surprising by itself

1078
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:18,320
surprising by itself
 

1079
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,590
surprising by itself
to me yes and

1080
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:21,600
to me yes and
 

1081
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,750
to me yes and
but then so at first they thought maybe

1082
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:23,760
but then so at first they thought maybe
 

1083
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,909
but then so at first they thought maybe
it's a comet or an asteroid but then it

1084
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:25,919
it's a comet or an asteroid but then it
 

1085
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,669
it's a comet or an asteroid but then it
look it didn't look like anything we've

1086
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
look it didn't look like anything we've
 

1087
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,029
look it didn't look like anything we've
seen before

1088
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:29,039
seen before
 

1089
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,310
seen before
borisov did look like a comet so people

1090
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:32,320
borisov did look like a comet so people
 

1091
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,150
borisov did look like a comet so people
asked me afterwards and said

1092
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:34,160
asked me afterwards and said
 

1093
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,950
asked me afterwards and said
you know doesn't it convince you if

1094
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:36,960
you know doesn't it convince you if
 

1095
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,230
you know doesn't it convince you if
borisov

1096
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:38,240
borisov
 

1097
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,070
borisov
looks like a comet doesn't he convince

1098
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
looks like a comet doesn't he convince
 

1099
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,390
looks like a comet doesn't he convince
you that um is also natural

1100
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
you that um is also natural
 

1101
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,950
you that um is also natural
yeah and i said you know when i went on

1102
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:44,960
yeah and i said you know when i went on
 

1103
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,029
yeah and i said you know when i went on
the first date with my wife

1104
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:47,039
the first date with my wife
 

1105
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,270
the first date with my wife
uh she looked special to me yes and

1106
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:49,280
uh she looked special to me yes and
 

1107
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,870
uh she looked special to me yes and
since then i met many women

1108
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:50,880
since then i met many women
 

1109
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,710
since then i met many women
yes that didn't change my opinion of my

1110
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:52,720
yes that didn't change my opinion of my
 

1111
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,270
yes that didn't change my opinion of my
life so you know that's not an argument

1112
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:55,280
life so you know that's not an argument
 

1113
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,669
life so you know that's not an argument
anyway so why did why did the

1114
00:18:59,669 --> 00:18:59,679
anyway so why did why did the
 

1115
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,950
anyway so why did why did the
muah look weird let me explain so first

1116
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:02,960
muah look weird let me explain so first
 

1117
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,430
muah look weird let me explain so first
of all

1118
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:03,440
of all
 

1119
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,510
of all
astronomers monitored the amount of

1120
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
astronomers monitored the amount of
 

1121
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,230
astronomers monitored the amount of
light sunlight that it reflects

1122
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:08,240
light sunlight that it reflects
 

1123
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,830
light sunlight that it reflects
and it was tumbling spinning every eight

1124
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:11,840
and it was tumbling spinning every eight
 

1125
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,710
and it was tumbling spinning every eight
hours

1126

hours
 

1127
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,789
hours
and as it was spinning the brightness

1128
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
and as it was spinning the brightness
 

1129
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,789
and as it was spinning the brightness
that we saw from that direction we

1130
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:16,799
that we saw from that direction we
 

1131
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,470
that we saw from that direction we
couldn't resolve it because it's tiny

1132
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:18,480
couldn't resolve it because it's tiny
 

1133
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:18,870
couldn't resolve it because it's tiny
it's

1134
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
it's
 

1135
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,350
it's
about 100 meters a few hundred feet size

1136
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:21,360
about 100 meters a few hundred feet size
 

1137
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,870
about 100 meters a few hundred feet size
of a football field

1138
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:22,880
of a football field
 

1139
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,830
of a football field
and we cannot from earth with existing

1140
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:25,840
and we cannot from earth with existing
 

1141
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,630
and we cannot from earth with existing
telescopes

1142

telescopes
 

1143
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,710
telescopes
we cannot resolve it the only way to

1144
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:28,720
we cannot resolve it the only way to
 

1145
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,710
we cannot resolve it the only way to
actually get a photograph of it

1146
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:30,720
actually get a photograph of it
 

1147
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,750
actually get a photograph of it
is to send the camera close to it

1148
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:33,760
is to send the camera close to it
 

1149
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,029
is to send the camera close to it
and that was not possible at the time

1150
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
and that was not possible at the time
 

1151
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,669
and that was not possible at the time
that umua was discovered because it was

1152
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:39,679
that umua was discovered because it was
 

1153
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,669
that umua was discovered because it was
already moving away from us faster than

1154
00:19:41,669 --> 00:19:41,679
already moving away from us faster than
 

1155
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,350
already moving away from us faster than
any rocket we can send

1156
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:43,360
any rocket we can send
 

1157
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,750
any rocket we can send
it's sort of like a guest that appeared

1158
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:45,760
it's sort of like a guest that appeared
 

1159
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,710
it's sort of like a guest that appeared
for dinner

1160
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:46,720
for dinner
 

1161
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,390
for dinner
and then by the time we realized that

1162
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:48,400
and then by the time we realized that
 

1163
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,950
and then by the time we realized that
it's weird the guest is already out the

1164
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:50,960
it's weird the guest is already out the
 

1165
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,789
it's weird the guest is already out the
front door into the dark street

1166
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
front door into the dark street
 

1167
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,909
front door into the dark street
yeah what we would like to find is an

1168
00:19:55,909 --> 00:19:55,919
yeah what we would like to find is an
 

1169
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:56,710
yeah what we would like to find is an
object like

1170
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:56,720
object like
 

1171
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,549
object like
it approaching us because then you can

1172
00:19:58,549 --> 00:19:58,559
it approaching us because then you can
 

1173
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,470
it approaching us because then you can
send the camera irrespective of how fast

1174
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:00,480
send the camera irrespective of how fast
 

1175
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,590
send the camera irrespective of how fast
it moves

1176
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:01,600
it moves
 

1177
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,830
it moves
and if we were to find it in july 2017

1178
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
and if we were to find it in july 2017
 

1179
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,669
and if we were to find it in july 2017
that would have been possible because it

1180
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:07,679
that would have been possible because it
 

1181
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,510
that would have been possible because it
was approaching us at that time

1182
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:09,520
was approaching us at that time
 

1183
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,710
was approaching us at that time
actually i was visiting mount haleakala

1184
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
actually i was visiting mount haleakala
 

1185
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,870
actually i was visiting mount haleakala
in maui hawaii with my family for

1186
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:14,880
in maui hawaii with my family for
 

1187
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,830
in maui hawaii with my family for
vacation at that time in july 2017 but

1188
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:17,840
vacation at that time in july 2017 but
 

1189
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,630
vacation at that time in july 2017 but
nobody knew uh

1190
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
nobody knew uh
 

1191
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,750
nobody knew uh
at the observatory that the um

1192
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
at the observatory that the um
 

1193
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,230
at the observatory that the um
is very close that's sad to think about

1194
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,240
is very close that's sad to think about
 

1195
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,310
is very close that's sad to think about
that we had the opportunity at that time

1196
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,320
that we had the opportunity at that time
 

1197
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,630
that we had the opportunity at that time
yes to send up a camera but don't worry

1198
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
yes to send up a camera but don't worry
 

1199
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,470
yes to send up a camera but don't worry
i mean there will be more there will be

1200
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:32,480
i mean there will be more there will be
 

1201
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,590
i mean there will be more there will be
more because

1202
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
more because
 

1203
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,630
more because
you know i i operate by the copernican

1204
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:36,640
you know i i operate by the copernican
 

1205
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,110
you know i i operate by the copernican
principle which says we don't live at a

1206
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,120
principle which says we don't live at a
 

1207
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,230
principle which says we don't live at a
special place

1208
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
special place
 

1209
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,029
special place
and we don't live at a special time and

1210
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:43,039
and we don't live at a special time and
 

1211
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:43,909
and we don't live at a special time and
that means

1212
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
that means
 

1213
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,149
that means
you know if we surveyed the sky for a

1214
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:46,159
you know if we surveyed the sky for a
 

1215
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,270
you know if we surveyed the sky for a
few years

1216
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
few years
 

1217
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,590
few years
and we had sensitivity to this region

1218
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
and we had sensitivity to this region
 

1219
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,190
and we had sensitivity to this region
between us and the sun

1220
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:51,200
between us and the sun
 

1221
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,549
between us and the sun
and we found this object with pan stars

1222
00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:54,559
and we found this object with pan stars
 

1223
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,149
and we found this object with pan stars
you know there should be many more that

1224
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
you know there should be many more that
 

1225
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,230
you know there should be many more that
we will find in the future

1226
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:58,240
we will find in the future
 

1227
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,470
we will find in the future
with surveys that might be even better

1228
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
with surveys that might be even better
 

1229
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,149
with surveys that might be even better
yes uh and actually in a

1230
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:02,159
yes uh and actually in a
 

1231
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,549
yes uh and actually in a
in three years time scale there would be

1232
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:04,559
in three years time scale there would be
 

1233
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,190
in three years time scale there would be
uh the so-called lsst that's a survey of

1234
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
uh the so-called lsst that's a survey of
 

1235
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,110
uh the so-called lsst that's a survey of
the vera rubin observatory

1236
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
the vera rubin observatory
 

1237
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,510
the vera rubin observatory
that would be much more sensitive and

1238
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:11,520
that would be much more sensitive and
 

1239
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,190
that would be much more sensitive and
could potentially find

1240
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:13,200
could potentially find
 

1241
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,470
could potentially find
an umumua-like object every month

1242
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:16,480
an umumua-like object every month
 

1243
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,710
an umumua-like object every month
okay so wow i'm just waiting for that

1244
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:18,720
okay so wow i'm just waiting for that
 

1245
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,789
okay so wow i'm just waiting for that
and the main reason for me to alert

1246
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:20,799
and the main reason for me to alert
 

1247
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,669
and the main reason for me to alert
everyone uh to the unusual properties of

1248
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:23,679
everyone uh to the unusual properties of
 

1249
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,630
everyone uh to the unusual properties of
umumua

1250
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:24,640
umumua
 

1251
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,190
umumua
is with the hope that next time around

1252
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,200
is with the hope that next time around
 

1253
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,149
is with the hope that next time around
when we see something

1254
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:28,159
when we see something
 

1255
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,710
when we see something
as unusual we would take a photograph or

1256
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:30,720
as unusual we would take a photograph or
 

1257
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,149
as unusual we would take a photograph or
we would get as much evidence as

1258
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:32,159
we would get as much evidence as
 

1259
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:32,710
we would get as much evidence as
possible

1260
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:32,720
possible
 

1261
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,950
possible
because science is based on evidence not

1262
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:34,960
because science is based on evidence not
 

1263
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,990
because science is based on evidence not
on prejudice

1264
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
on prejudice
 

1265
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,149
on prejudice
and we will get back to that theme so

1266
00:21:38,149 --> 00:21:38,159
and we will get back to that theme so
 

1267
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,830
and we will get back to that theme so
anyway let me let me point out some of

1268
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:39,840
anyway let me let me point out some of
 

1269
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,270
anyway let me let me point out some of
the properties actually yeah

1270
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:41,280
the properties actually yeah
 

1271
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,350
the properties actually yeah
the elongated nature all right other

1272
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:43,360
the elongated nature all right other
 

1273
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,870
the elongated nature all right other
things so

1274
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
things so
 

1275
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,789
things so
the light curve the amount of light

1276
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:46,799
the light curve the amount of light
 

1277
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,270
the light curve the amount of light
sunlight that was reflected from it

1278
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:49,280
sunlight that was reflected from it
 

1279
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,750
sunlight that was reflected from it
was changing over eight hours by a

1280
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:51,760
was changing over eight hours by a
 

1281
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,430
was changing over eight hours by a
factor of ten

1282
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:53,440
factor of ten
 

1283
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,310
factor of ten
meaning that the area of this object

1284
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
meaning that the area of this object
 

1285
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,310
meaning that the area of this object
even though we can't resolve it

1286
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
even though we can't resolve it
 

1287
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,110
even though we can't resolve it
the area on the sky that reflects

1288
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:01,120
the area on the sky that reflects
 

1289
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,310
the area on the sky that reflects
sunlight

1290
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:02,320
sunlight
 

1291
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,510
sunlight
was bigger by a factor of 10

1292
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
was bigger by a factor of 10
 

1293
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,230
was bigger by a factor of 10
in some phases as it was tumbling around

1294
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:08,240
in some phases as it was tumbling around
 

1295
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,669
in some phases as it was tumbling around
than in other phases so

1296
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
than in other phases so
 

1297
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,669
than in other phases so
even if you take a piece of paper that

1298
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
even if you take a piece of paper that
 

1299
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,110
even if you take a piece of paper that
is razor thin

1300
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:13,120
is razor thin
 

1301
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,470
is razor thin
you know it's there is a very small

1302
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:14,480
you know it's there is a very small
 

1303
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,270
you know it's there is a very small
likelihood that it's exactly edge-on

1304
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:17,280
likelihood that it's exactly edge-on
 

1305
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,669
likelihood that it's exactly edge-on
uh and getting a factor of 10 change in

1306
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
uh and getting a factor of 10 change in
 

1307
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,590
uh and getting a factor of 10 change in
the area that you see on the sky

1308
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:21,600
the area that you see on the sky
 

1309
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,149
the area that you see on the sky
is huge it's much more than any it means

1310
00:22:24,149 --> 00:22:24,159
is huge it's much more than any it means
 

1311
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,830
is huge it's much more than any it means
that the object has an unusual geometry

1312
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:27,840
that the object has an unusual geometry
 

1313
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,510
that the object has an unusual geometry
it's at least a factor of a few more

1314
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:29,520
it's at least a factor of a few more
 

1315
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,590
it's at least a factor of a few more
than any of the comets or asteroids that

1316
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:31,600
than any of the comets or asteroids that
 

1317
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,710
than any of the comets or asteroids that
we have seen before

1318
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
we have seen before
 

1319
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,630
we have seen before
you mentioned reflectivity so it's not

1320
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:34,640
you mentioned reflectivity so it's not
 

1321
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,549
you mentioned reflectivity so it's not
just the geometry but

1322
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:36,559
just the geometry but
 

1323
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,230
just the geometry but
the the properties of the surface of

1324
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:38,240
the the properties of the surface of
 

1325
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,310
the the properties of the surface of
that thing well uh

1326
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:40,320
that thing well uh
 

1327
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,630
that thing well uh
or no if you assume the reflectivity is

1328
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:42,640
or no if you assume the reflectivity is
 

1329
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,110
or no if you assume the reflectivity is
the same okay then it's just geometry if

1330
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,120
the same okay then it's just geometry if
 

1331
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:47,270
the same okay then it's just geometry if
you assume the reflectivity may change

1332
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,280
you assume the reflectivity may change
 

1333
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,350
you assume the reflectivity may change
yes then it could be a combination of

1334
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:49,360
yes then it could be a combination of
 

1335
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,029
yes then it could be a combination of
the area that you see and the

1336
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:51,039
the area that you see and the
 

1337
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,310
the area that you see and the
reflectivity because

1338
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:52,320
reflectivity because
 

1339
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,750
reflectivity because
different directions may reflect

1340
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:53,760
different directions may reflect
 

1341
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,230
different directions may reflect
differently but the point is that it's

1342
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:56,240
differently but the point is that it's
 

1343
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,270
differently but the point is that it's
very extreme

1344
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:57,280
very extreme
 

1345
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,710
very extreme
yes and it actually the best fit

1346
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:00,720
yes and it actually the best fit
 

1347
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,270
yes and it actually the best fit
to the light curve that we saw was of a

1348
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:03,280
to the light curve that we saw was of a
 

1349
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,230
to the light curve that we saw was of a
flat object

1350
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:04,240
flat object
 

1351
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,789
flat object
unlike all the cartoons that you have

1352
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:06,799
unlike all the cartoons that you have
 

1353
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,350
unlike all the cartoons that you have
seen

1354
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,360
seen
 

1355
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,870
seen
of a cigar shape a flat object at the 90

1356
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:10,880
of a cigar shape a flat object at the 90
 

1357
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,350
of a cigar shape a flat object at the 90
percent confidence gives a better model

1358
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
percent confidence gives a better model
 

1359
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,310
percent confidence gives a better model
for the way that the light varied and

1360
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:16,320
for the way that the light varied and
 

1361
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:16,630
for the way that the light varied and
it's

1362
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:16,640
it's
 

1363
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,549
it's
like flat meaning like a pancake like a

1364
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
like flat meaning like a pancake like a
 

1365
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,310
like flat meaning like a pancake like a
pancake exactly

1366
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:20,320
pancake exactly
 

1367
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,950
pancake exactly
uh and then so that's the you know the

1368
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:22,960
uh and then so that's the you know the
 

1369
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,909
uh and then so that's the you know the
very first

1370
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:23,919
very first
 

1371
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,549
very first
unusual property but to me it was not

1372
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
unusual property but to me it was not
 

1373
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,070
unusual property but to me it was not
unusual enough

1374
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,080
unusual enough
 

1375
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,630
unusual enough
to think that it might be artificial it

1376
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:30,640
to think that it might be artificial it
 

1377
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,190
to think that it might be artificial it
was not

1378
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:31,200
was not
 

1379
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,149
was not
significant enough then um there was no

1380
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
significant enough then um there was no
 

1381
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,350
significant enough then um there was no
commentary tale you know

1382
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:35,360
commentary tale you know
 

1383
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,110
commentary tale you know
no dust no gas around this object and

1384
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
no dust no gas around this object and
 

1385
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,029
no dust no gas around this object and
the spitzer space telescope

1386
00:23:41,029 --> 00:23:41,039
the spitzer space telescope
 

1387
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,950
the spitzer space telescope
really searched very deeply for

1388
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:42,960
really searched very deeply for
 

1389
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,789
really searched very deeply for
carbon-based molecules

1390
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:44,799
carbon-based molecules
 

1391
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,510
carbon-based molecules
there was nothing so it's definitely not

1392
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:47,520
there was nothing so it's definitely not
 

1393
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,070
there was nothing so it's definitely not
a comet

1394
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,080
a comet
 

1395
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,310
a comet
the way people expected it to be can you

1396
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:50,320
the way people expected it to be can you
 

1397
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,909
the way people expected it to be can you
maybe briefly mention what

1398
00:23:51,909 --> 00:23:51,919
maybe briefly mention what
 

1399
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,230
maybe briefly mention what
uh properties a comet that you're

1400
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:54,240
uh properties a comet that you're
 

1401
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,750
uh properties a comet that you're
referring to usually has

1402
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:55,760
referring to usually has
 

1403
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,350
referring to usually has
right so a comet is a rock that has some

1404
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,360
right so a comet is a rock that has some
 

1405
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,510
right so a comet is a rock that has some
water ice on the surface

1406
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:01,520
water ice on the surface
 

1407
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,950
water ice on the surface
so you can think of it as an icy rock

1408
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:04,960
so you can think of it as an icy rock
 

1409
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,789
so you can think of it as an icy rock
actually comets were discovered a long

1410
00:24:06,789 --> 00:24:06,799
actually comets were discovered a long
 

1411
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,990
actually comets were discovered a long
time ago but

1412
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,000
time ago but
 

1413
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,029
time ago but
uh the first model uh

1414
00:24:11,029 --> 00:24:11,039
uh the first model uh
 

1415
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:14,549
uh the first model uh
that was developed for them was by fred

1416
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:14,559
that was developed for them was by fred
 

1417
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:15,590
that was developed for them was by fred
the whipple

1418
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
the whipple
 

1419
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,549
the whipple
who was at harvard and i think the

1420
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
who was at harvard and i think the
 

1421
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,549
who was at harvard and i think the
legend goes that he got the idea from

1422
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:20,559
legend goes that he got the idea from
 

1423
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,510
legend goes that he got the idea from
walking through

1424
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:21,520
walking through
 

1425
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,310
walking through
harvard square and seeing uh during a

1426
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:24,320
harvard square and seeing uh during a
 

1427
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,110
harvard square and seeing uh during a
winter day

1428
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,120
winter day
 

1429
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,590
winter day
and seeing these icy rocks you know and

1430
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
and seeing these icy rocks you know and
 

1431
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,029
and seeing these icy rocks you know and
so a comet is icy

1432
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:29,039
so a comet is icy
 

1433
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,310
so a comet is icy
and this is uh it's just a rock

1434
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:32,320
and this is uh it's just a rock
 

1435
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,390
and this is uh it's just a rock
it's just a wrap yeah so when you have

1436
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:34,400
it's just a wrap yeah so when you have
 

1437
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,230
it's just a wrap yeah so when you have
ice on the surface

1438
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
ice on the surface
 

1439
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,110
ice on the surface
when the rock gets close to the sun the

1440
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
when the rock gets close to the sun the
 

1441
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,029
when the rock gets close to the sun the
sunlight warms it up

1442
00:24:41,029 --> 00:24:41,039
sunlight warms it up
 

1443
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,390
sunlight warms it up
and the the ice sublimates it evaporates

1444
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:44,400
and the the ice sublimates it evaporates
 

1445
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,950
and the the ice sublimates it evaporates
because the one thing about ice water

1446
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:46,960
because the one thing about ice water
 

1447
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,750
because the one thing about ice water
ice

1448
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
ice
 

1449
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,549
ice
is it doesn't become liquid if you warm

1450
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
is it doesn't become liquid if you warm
 

1451
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,990
is it doesn't become liquid if you warm
it up in vacuum

1452
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,000
it up in vacuum
 

1453
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,190
it up in vacuum
you know without an external pressure

1454
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:55,200
you know without an external pressure
 

1455
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,510
you know without an external pressure
it just goes straight into gas and

1456
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:57,520
it just goes straight into gas and
 

1457
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,870
it just goes straight into gas and
that's what you see as the

1458
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
that's what you see as the
 

1459
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,149
that's what you see as the
tail of a comet the only way to get

1460
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:02,159
tail of a comet the only way to get
 

1461
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,510
tail of a comet the only way to get
liquid water

1462
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:03,520
liquid water
 

1463
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,070
liquid water
is to have an atmosphere like on earth

1464
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:06,080
is to have an atmosphere like on earth
 

1465
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,909
is to have an atmosphere like on earth
that has an external pressure

1466
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:07,919
that has an external pressure
 

1467
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,390
that has an external pressure
only then you get liquid and that's why

1468
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:10,400
only then you get liquid and that's why
 

1469
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,830
only then you get liquid and that's why
it's essential to have an

1470
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
it's essential to have an
 

1471
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,230
it's essential to have an
atmosphere to a planet in order to have

1472
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,240
atmosphere to a planet in order to have
 

1473
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,110
atmosphere to a planet in order to have
liquid water

1474
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,120
liquid water
 

1475
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,029
liquid water
and the chemistry of life so if you look

1476
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
and the chemistry of life so if you look
 

1477
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,149
and the chemistry of life so if you look
at mars

1478
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:18,159
at mars
 

1479
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,430
at mars
mars lost its atmosphere and therefore

1480
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:21,440
mars lost its atmosphere and therefore
 

1481
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,590
mars lost its atmosphere and therefore
no liquid water on the surface anymore i

1482
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
no liquid water on the surface anymore i
 

1483
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,110
no liquid water on the surface anymore i
mean there may have been early

1484
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,120
mean there may have been early
 

1485
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,909
mean there may have been early
and that's what the perseverance uh

1486
00:25:27,909 --> 00:25:27,919
and that's what the perseverance uh
 

1487
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:28,470
and that's what the perseverance uh
survey

1488
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
survey
 

1489
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,549
survey
you know the perseverance mission we

1490
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:30,559
you know the perseverance mission we
 

1491
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,070
you know the perseverance mission we
will try to find out whether

1492
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:32,080
will try to find out whether
 

1493
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,230
will try to find out whether
it had liquid water whether there was

1494
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:34,240
it had liquid water whether there was
 

1495
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,190
it had liquid water whether there was
life perhaps

1496
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:35,200
life perhaps
 

1497
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,750
life perhaps
on it at the time but at some point it

1498
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:37,760
on it at the time but at some point it
 

1499
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,269
on it at the time but at some point it
lost its atmosphere

1500
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
lost its atmosphere
 

1501
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:41,909
lost its atmosphere
and then the liquid water was gone so

1502
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:41,919
and then the liquid water was gone so
 

1503
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,750
and then the liquid water was gone so
the only reason that we can live

1504
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:43,760
the only reason that we can live
 

1505
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,549
the only reason that we can live
on earth is because of the atmosphere

1506
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:46,559
on earth is because of the atmosphere
 

1507
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,549
on earth is because of the atmosphere
but a comet is in vacuum

1508
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:48,559
but a comet is in vacuum
 

1509
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:52,070
but a comet is in vacuum
pretty much and then when it gets warmed

1510
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
pretty much and then when it gets warmed
 

1511
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,510
pretty much and then when it gets warmed
up on the surface

1512
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
up on the surface
 

1513
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,630
up on the surface
the water becomes the water ice becomes

1514
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
the water becomes the water ice becomes
 

1515
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,029
the water becomes the water ice becomes
gas and then you see this cometary tail

1516
00:25:59,029 --> 00:25:59,039
gas and then you see this cometary tail
 

1517
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,830
gas and then you see this cometary tail
behind it

1518
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
behind it
 

1519
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,950
behind it
in addition to water there is

1520
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:02,960
in addition to water there is
 

1521
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,950
in addition to water there is
that there are all kinds of carbon-based

1522
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:04,960
that there are all kinds of carbon-based
 

1523
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,789
that there are all kinds of carbon-based
molecules of dust that comes

1524
00:26:06,789 --> 00:26:06,799
molecules of dust that comes
 

1525
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,269
molecules of dust that comes
off the surface and those are detectable

1526
00:26:09,269 --> 00:26:09,279
off the surface and those are detectable
 

1527
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,590
off the surface and those are detectable
yeah it's easy to detect it's very

1528
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:11,600
yeah it's easy to detect it's very
 

1529
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,590
yeah it's easy to detect it's very
prominent you see these cometary tails

1530
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
prominent you see these cometary tails
 

1531
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,029
prominent you see these cometary tails
that look very prominent because they

1532
00:26:15,029 --> 00:26:15,039
that look very prominent because they
 

1533
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,390
that look very prominent because they
reflect sunlight

1534
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:16,400
reflect sunlight
 

1535
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:17,750
reflect sunlight
and you can see them in fact it's

1536
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
and you can see them in fact it's
 

1537
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,669
and you can see them in fact it's
sometimes difficult to see the nucleus

1538
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
sometimes difficult to see the nucleus
 

1539
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,710
sometimes difficult to see the nucleus
of the comet

1540
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:20,720
of the comet
 

1541
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,630
of the comet
because it's surrounded and shrouded

1542
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:22,640
because it's surrounded and shrouded
 

1543
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,990
because it's surrounded and shrouded
with and in this

1544
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,000
with and in this
 

1545
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,630
with and in this
case there was no trace of anything

1546
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
case there was no trace of anything
 

1547
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,590
case there was no trace of anything
that's fast now

1548
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:27,600
that's fast now
 

1549
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,190
that's fast now
you might say okay it's not a com so

1550
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,200
you might say okay it's not a com so
 

1551
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,029
you might say okay it's not a com so
that's what the community said okay it's

1552
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:31,039
that's what the community said okay it's
 

1553
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,870
that's what the community said okay it's
not a no problem it's still a rock you

1554
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:32,880
not a no problem it's still a rock you
 

1555
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,149
not a no problem it's still a rock you
know it's not a comet

1556
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:34,159
know it's not a comet
 

1557
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,950
know it's not a comet
but it's just a rock bare rock you know

1558
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:36,960
but it's just a rock bare rock you know
 

1559
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,310
but it's just a rock bare rock you know
okay no problem

1560
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:38,320
okay no problem
 

1561
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,789
okay no problem
then and that's the thing that convinced

1562
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:40,799
then and that's the thing that convinced
 

1563
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,310
then and that's the thing that convinced
me to write about it

1564
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:42,320
me to write about it
 

1565
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,029
me to write about it
and then in june 2018 you know

1566
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
and then in june 2018 you know
 

1567
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,870
and then in june 2018 you know
significantly later

1568
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:46,880
significantly later
 

1569
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,789
significantly later
there was a report that in fact the

1570
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:48,799
there was a report that in fact the
 

1571
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,029
there was a report that in fact the
object

1572
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:51,039
object
 

1573
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,390
object
exhibited an excess push

1574
00:26:54,390 --> 00:26:54,400
exhibited an excess push
 

1575
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,149
exhibited an excess push
in addition to the force of gravity so

1576
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:56,159
in addition to the force of gravity so
 

1577
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,470
in addition to the force of gravity so
the sun acts on it by gravity but then

1578
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
the sun acts on it by gravity but then
 

1579
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,110
the sun acts on it by gravity but then
there was an

1580
00:26:59,110 --> 00:26:59,120
there was an
 

1581
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,669
there was an
extra push on this object that was

1582
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
extra push on this object that was
 

1583
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,269
extra push on this object that was
figured out from the orbit

1584
00:27:03,269 --> 00:27:03,279
figured out from the orbit
 

1585
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,070
figured out from the orbit
that you can trace and the the question

1586
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,080
that you can trace and the the question
 

1587
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,110
that you can trace and the the question
was what is this

1588
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:07,120
was what is this
 

1589
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:09,350
was what is this
excess push so for comets you get the

1590
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,360
excess push so for comets you get the
 

1591
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,070
excess push so for comets you get the
rocket effect when you evaporate gas

1592
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,080
rocket effect when you evaporate gas
 

1593
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:14,549
rocket effect when you evaporate gas
you know just like a jet engine on an

1594
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:14,559
you know just like a jet engine on an
 

1595
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,269
you know just like a jet engine on an
airplane

1596
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
airplane
 

1597
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,430
airplane
you throw a jet engine is very simple

1598
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
you throw a jet engine is very simple
 

1599
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,350
you throw a jet engine is very simple
you throw the gas back

1600
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:19,360
you throw the gas back
 

1601
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,110
you throw the gas back
and it pushes the airplane forward

1602
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:21,120
and it pushes the airplane forward
 

1603
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,710
and it pushes the airplane forward
that's all that's how it get

1604
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:22,720
that's all that's how it get
 

1605
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,830
that's all that's how it get
so in a case of a comet you throw gas in

1606
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:25,840
so in a case of a comet you throw gas in
 

1607
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,669
so in a case of a comet you throw gas in
the direction of the sun because it

1608
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
the direction of the sun because it
 

1609
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,389
the direction of the sun because it
and then you get a push okay so in the

1610
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
and then you get a push okay so in the
 

1611
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,470
and then you get a push okay so in the
case of comets you can get a push

1612
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
case of comets you can get a push
 

1613
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,789
case of comets you can get a push
but there was no commentary tale so then

1614
00:27:34,789 --> 00:27:34,799
but there was no commentary tale so then
 

1615
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,789
but there was no commentary tale so then
people said oh wait a second

1616
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:36,799
people said oh wait a second
 

1617
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,950
people said oh wait a second
is it an asteroid no but it behaves like

1618
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:38,960
is it an asteroid no but it behaves like
 

1619
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,830
is it an asteroid no but it behaves like
a comet but

1620
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:39,840
a comet but
 

1621
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,990
a comet but
it doesn't look like a comet so what it

1622
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:42,000
it doesn't look like a comet so what it
 

1623
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,710
it doesn't look like a comet so what it
well forget about it business as usual

1624
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
well forget about it business as usual
 

1625
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,909
well forget about it business as usual
so that's what i mean by a

1626
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:45,919
so that's what i mean by a
 

1627
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,750
so that's what i mean by a
non-gravitational

1628
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:47,760
non-gravitational
 

1629
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,149
non-gravitational
acceleration so that's interesting so

1630
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:50,159
acceleration so that's interesting so
 

1631
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:50,789
acceleration so that's interesting so
like the

1632
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:50,799
like the
 

1633
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,549
like the
the primary force acting on something

1634
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
the primary force acting on something
 

1635
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,950
the primary force acting on something
like just a rock like an asteroid

1636
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
like just a rock like an asteroid
 

1637
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,789
like just a rock like an asteroid
would be like you can predict the

1638
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
would be like you can predict the
 

1639
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,029
would be like you can predict the
trajectory based on the

1640
00:27:59,029 --> 00:27:59,039
trajectory based on the
 

1641
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,029
trajectory based on the
based on gravity and also here there's

1642
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:01,039
based on gravity and also here there's
 

1643
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,470
based on gravity and also here there's
detected movement that's

1644
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:02,480
detected movement that's
 

1645
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,470
detected movement that's
not cannot be accounted purely by the

1646
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:04,480
not cannot be accounted purely by the
 

1647
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,389
not cannot be accounted purely by the
gravity so if it was a comet

1648
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
gravity so if it was a comet
 

1649
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,430
gravity so if it was a comet
you would need about a tenth of

1650
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
you would need about a tenth of
 

1651
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,430
you would need about a tenth of
the mass of this comet the weight of

1652
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:11,440
the mass of this comet the weight of
 

1653
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,190
the mass of this comet the weight of
this government to be evaporated in

1654
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:13,200
this government to be evaporated in
 

1655
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:13,590
this government to be evaporated in
order

1656
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
order
 

1657
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,350
order
to give it and there's no sign of that

1658
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,360
to give it and there's no sign of that
 

1659
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,510
to give it and there's no sign of that
no sign ten percent of the mass

1660
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
no sign ten percent of the mass
 

1661
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,190
no sign ten percent of the mass
evaporating it's huge

1662
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
evaporating it's huge
 

1663
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,870
evaporating it's huge
think about it a hundred meter size

1664
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
think about it a hundred meter size
 

1665
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,590
think about it a hundred meter size
object losing ten percent of its mass

1666
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
object losing ten percent of its mass
 

1667
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,789
object losing ten percent of its mass
you can't miss that and uh so that's

1668
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
you can't miss that and uh so that's
 

1669
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,789
you can't miss that and uh so that's
super weird it's super weird what is

1670
00:28:28,789 --> 00:28:28,799
super weird it's super weird what is
 

1671
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,310
super weird it's super weird what is
there a good explanation

1672
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
there a good explanation
 

1673
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,750
there a good explanation
in your mind and possible explanations

1674
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
in your mind and possible explanations
 

1675
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,190
in your mind and possible explanations
for this you know so i operated just

1676
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,200
for this you know so i operated just
 

1677
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,269
for this you know so i operated just
like sherlock holmes in a way

1678
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:35,279
like sherlock holmes in a way
 

1679
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:37,190
like sherlock holmes in a way
i said okay what are the possibilities

1680
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:37,200
i said okay what are the possibilities
 

1681
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,950
i said okay what are the possibilities
and the only thing i could think so i

1682
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
and the only thing i could think so i
 

1683
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,830
and the only thing i could think so i
ruled out

1684
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:39,840
ruled out
 

1685
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,830
ruled out
everything else and i i said it must be

1686
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
everything else and i i said it must be
 

1687
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,110
everything else and i i said it must be
the sunlight

1688
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:43,120
the sunlight
 

1689
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,710
the sunlight
reflected off it okay so the sunlight

1690
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:46,720
reflected off it okay so the sunlight
 

1691
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,510
reflected off it okay so the sunlight
reflects off the surface and gives it a

1692
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
reflects off the surface and gives it a
 

1693
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:49,990
reflects off the surface and gives it a
push

1694
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
push
 

1695
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,029
push
just like you get a push on a sail on a

1696
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:53,039
just like you get a push on a sail on a
 

1697
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,029
just like you get a push on a sail on a
boat you know from the wind reflecting

1698
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
boat you know from the wind reflecting
 

1699
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,149
boat you know from the wind reflecting
off it

1700
00:28:56,149 --> 00:28:56,159
off it
 

1701
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,190
off it
now in order for this to be effective it

1702
00:28:59,190 --> 00:28:59,200
now in order for this to be effective it
 

1703
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,789
now in order for this to be effective it
turns out the object needs to be

1704
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:00,799
turns out the object needs to be
 

1705
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,029
turns out the object needs to be
extremely thin

1706
00:29:03,029 --> 00:29:03,039
extremely thin
 

1707
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,789
extremely thin
uh it turns out it needs to be less than

1708
00:29:04,789 --> 00:29:04,799
uh it turns out it needs to be less than
 

1709
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,950
uh it turns out it needs to be less than
a millimeter thick

1710
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
a millimeter thick
 

1711
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,990
a millimeter thick
nature does not produce such things so

1712
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
nature does not produce such things so
 

1713
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,950
nature does not produce such things so
but

1714
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:10,960
but
 

1715
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,269
but
we produce it because it's called the

1716
00:29:13,269 --> 00:29:13,279
we produce it because it's called the
 

1717
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:15,350
we produce it because it's called the
technology of a light sail

1718
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:15,360
technology of a light sail
 

1719
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,669
technology of a light sail
so we are for space exploration we are

1720
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
so we are for space exploration we are
 

1721
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,590
so we are for space exploration we are
exploring this technology because

1722
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
exploring this technology because
 

1723
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,389
exploring this technology because
it it has the benefit of not needing to

1724
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:22,399
it it has the benefit of not needing to
 

1725
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:23,510
it it has the benefit of not needing to
carry the fuel

1726
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:23,520
carry the fuel
 

1727
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,029
carry the fuel
with the spacecraft so you don't have

1728
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:25,039
with the spacecraft so you don't have
 

1729
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,789
with the spacecraft so you don't have
the fuel you just have a

1730
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:26,799
the fuel you just have a
 

1731
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,990
the fuel you just have a
uh you just have a sail and

1732
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:30,000
uh you just have a sail and
 

1733
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,549
uh you just have a sail and
it's being pushed either by sunlight or

1734
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:32,559
it's being pushed either by sunlight or
 

1735
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,750
it's being pushed either by sunlight or
by a laser beam

1736
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:33,760
by a laser beam
 

1737
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,830
by a laser beam
or whatever uh so perhaps this is the

1738
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
or whatever uh so perhaps this is the
 

1739
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,269
or whatever uh so perhaps this is the
light sail so this is

1740
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:39,279
light sail so this is
 

1741
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,630
light sail so this is
actually the same technology with the

1742
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:40,640
actually the same technology with the
 

1743
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,789
actually the same technology with the
with the starshop project yes

1744
00:29:42,789 --> 00:29:42,799
with the starshop project yes
 

1745
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,549
with the starshop project yes
so yeah that's fascinating okay people

1746
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
so yeah that's fascinating okay people
 

1747
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,870
so yeah that's fascinating okay people
afterwards say okay you work on this

1748
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
afterwards say okay you work on this
 

1749
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,710
afterwards say okay you work on this
project you imagine

1750
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
project you imagine
 

1751
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,750
project you imagine
you know no that's a pretty good

1752
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:49,760
you know no that's a pretty good
 

1753
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,190
you know no that's a pretty good
explanation right obviously my

1754
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
explanation right obviously my
 

1755
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,750
explanation right obviously my
imagination is limited by what i know

1756
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:53,760
imagination is limited by what i know
 

1757
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,710
imagination is limited by what i know
so i you know i would not deny that you

1758
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:56,720
so i you know i would not deny that you
 

1759
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,029
so i you know i would not deny that you
know

1760
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:57,039
know
 

1761
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,510
know
working on light sales expanded my

1762
00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
working on light sales expanded my
 

1763
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,830
working on light sales expanded my
ability to imagine this possibility yes

1764
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:01,840
ability to imagine this possibility yes
 

1765
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,070
ability to imagine this possibility yes
but let me offer another interesting

1766
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:04,080
but let me offer another interesting
 

1767
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,110
but let me offer another interesting
anecdote

1768
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,120
anecdote
 

1769
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,070
anecdote
in september this year 2020 i mean yes

1770
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:08,080
in september this year 2020 i mean yes
 

1771
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:08,549
in september this year 2020 i mean yes
uh

1772
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:08,559
uh
 

1773
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,669
uh
2020. yes um there was

1774
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:11,679
2020. yes um there was
 

1775
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,789
2020. yes um there was
another object found and it was given

1776
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:14,799
another object found and it was given
 

1777
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:15,350
another object found and it was given
the name

1778
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:15,360
the name
 

1779
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,389
the name
2020 so by the

1780
00:30:18,389 --> 00:30:18,399
2020 so by the
 

1781
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,269
2020 so by the
minor planet center you know this is an

1782
00:30:21,269 --> 00:30:21,279
minor planet center you know this is an
 

1783
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,070
minor planet center you know this is an
organization

1784
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
organization
 

1785
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,549
organization
actually in cambridge massachusetts that

1786
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:24,559
actually in cambridge massachusetts that
 

1787
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,830
actually in cambridge massachusetts that
gives names

1788
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:25,840
gives names
 

1789
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,070
gives names
to objects astronomical objects found in

1790
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:28,080
to objects astronomical objects found in
 

1791
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,350
to objects astronomical objects found in
the solar system and

1792
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:29,360
the solar system and
 

1793
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,669
the solar system and
they gave it that name 2020 so because

1794
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
they gave it that name 2020 so because
 

1795
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,190
they gave it that name 2020 so because
you know it looked like

1796
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
you know it looked like
 

1797
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,310
you know it looked like
uh an object in the solar system and

1798
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,320
uh an object in the solar system and
 

1799
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,870
uh an object in the solar system and
it moved in an orbit that is similar to

1800
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:38,880
it moved in an orbit that is similar to
 

1801
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,470
it moved in an orbit that is similar to
the orbit of the earth

1802
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:40,480
the orbit of the earth
 

1803
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,430
the orbit of the earth
but not the same exactly and therefore

1804
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:43,440
but not the same exactly and therefore
 

1805
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,310
but not the same exactly and therefore
it was bound

1806
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:44,320
it was bound
 

1807
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,510
it was bound
to the sun but it also exhibited

1808
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:47,520
to the sun but it also exhibited
 

1809
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,750
to the sun but it also exhibited
a deviation from what you expect based

1810
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:49,760
a deviation from what you expect based
 

1811
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,110
a deviation from what you expect based
on gravity

1812
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,120
on gravity
 

1813
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,350
on gravity
so the astronomers that found it

1814
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:53,360
so the astronomers that found it
 

1815
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,750
so the astronomers that found it
extrapolated back in time and found that

1816
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
extrapolated back in time and found that
 

1817
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:00,630
extrapolated back in time and found that
in 1966 it intercepted the earth

1818
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:00,640
in 1966 it intercepted the earth
 

1819
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,990
in 1966 it intercepted the earth
and then they realized they went to the

1820
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,000
and then they realized they went to the
 

1821
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,750
and then they realized they went to the
history books and they realized oh there

1822
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:03,760
history books and they realized oh there
 

1823
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,950
history books and they realized oh there
was a mission

1824
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:04,960
was a mission
 

1825
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,230
was a mission
called gruner surveyor lunar lander

1826
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:08,240
called gruner surveyor lunar lander
 

1827
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,830
called gruner surveyor lunar lander
surveyor 2 that had a rocket booster it

1828
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
surveyor 2 that had a rocket booster it
 

1829
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,830
surveyor 2 that had a rocket booster it
was a failed mission but

1830
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:13,840
was a failed mission but
 

1831
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,909
was a failed mission but
there was a rocket booster that was

1832
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:15,919
there was a rocket booster that was
 

1833
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,350
there was a rocket booster that was
kicked into space

1834
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
kicked into space
 

1835
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,789
kicked into space
and presumably this is the rocket

1836
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:18,799
and presumably this is the rocket
 

1837
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,710
and presumably this is the rocket
booster that we are seeing now

1838
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:20,720
booster that we are seeing now
 

1839
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,630
booster that we are seeing now
this rocket booster was sufficiently

1840
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:22,640
this rocket booster was sufficiently
 

1841
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,310
this rocket booster was sufficiently
hollow and thin

1842
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:24,320
hollow and thin
 

1843
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,470
hollow and thin
for us to recognize that it's pushed by

1844
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
for us to recognize that it's pushed by
 

1845
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,669
for us to recognize that it's pushed by
sunlight

1846
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
sunlight
 

1847
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,549
sunlight
so here is my point we can tell from the

1848
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:30,559
so here is my point we can tell from the
 

1849
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,470
so here is my point we can tell from the
orbit of an object obviously this object

1850
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:32,480
orbit of an object obviously this object
 

1851
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,789
orbit of an object obviously this object
didn't have any cometary tail

1852
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
didn't have any cometary tail
 

1853
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,590
didn't have any cometary tail
it was artificially made we know that it

1854
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
it was artificially made we know that it
 

1855
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,509
it was artificially made we know that it
was made by us

1856
00:31:39,509 --> 00:31:39,519
was made by us
 

1857
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,389
was made by us
and it did deviate from an orbit of a

1858
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
and it did deviate from an orbit of a
 

1859
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,350
and it did deviate from an orbit of a
rock

1860
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:43,360
rock
 

1861
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,070
rock
so just by seeing something that doesn't

1862
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
so just by seeing something that doesn't
 

1863
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,509
so just by seeing something that doesn't
have cometary tail

1864
00:31:47,509 --> 00:31:47,519
have cometary tail
 

1865
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,430
have cometary tail
and deviates from an orbit shaped by

1866
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:49,440
and deviates from an orbit shaped by
 

1867
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,549
and deviates from an orbit shaped by
gravity

1868
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
gravity
 

1869
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,630
gravity
we can tell that it's artificial in the

1870
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:52,640
we can tell that it's artificial in the
 

1871
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,149
we can tell that it's artificial in the
case of umuamua

1872
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
case of umuamua
 

1873
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,909
case of umuamua
it couldn't have been sent by humans

1874
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
it couldn't have been sent by humans
 

1875
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,509
it couldn't have been sent by humans
because it just

1876
00:31:57,509 --> 00:31:57,519
because it just
 

1877
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,430
because it just
passed near us for a few months we know

1878
00:31:59,430 --> 00:31:59,440
passed near us for a few months we know
 

1879
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,350
passed near us for a few months we know
exactly what we were doing in those

1880
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:01,360
exactly what we were doing in those
 

1881
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,430
exactly what we were doing in those
at that time and also it was moving

1882
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:03,440
at that time and also it was moving
 

1883
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,029
at that time and also it was moving
faster than any object that we can

1884
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:05,039
faster than any object that we can
 

1885
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,909
faster than any object that we can
launch

1886
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
launch
 

1887
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:07,909
launch
and so obviously it came from outside

1888
00:32:07,909 --> 00:32:07,919
and so obviously it came from outside
 

1889
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:09,590
and so obviously it came from outside
the solar system

1890
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:09,600
the solar system
 

1891
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,470
the solar system
and the question is who produced it now

1892
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
and the question is who produced it now
 

1893
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,549
and the question is who produced it now
i should say that you know when i walk

1894
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:14,559
i should say that you know when i walk
 

1895
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,269
i should say that you know when i walk
on vacation on a beach i often see

1896
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:17,279
on vacation on a beach i often see
 

1897
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,710
on vacation on a beach i often see
natural

1898
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:18,720
natural
 

1899
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,710
natural
objects like seashells that are

1900
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
objects like seashells that are
 

1901
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,870
objects like seashells that are
beautiful and i look at them and

1902
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:22,880
beautiful and i look at them and
 

1903
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,590
beautiful and i look at them and
um and every now and then i stumble on a

1904
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:25,600
um and every now and then i stumble on a
 

1905
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,430
um and every now and then i stumble on a
plastic bottle

1906
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:27,440
plastic bottle
 

1907
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,549
plastic bottle
and that was artificially produced

1908
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
and that was artificially produced
 

1909
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:33,269
and that was artificially produced
and my point is that maybe omua mua was

1910
00:32:33,269 --> 00:32:33,279
and my point is that maybe omua mua was
 

1911
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,549
and my point is that maybe omua mua was
a message in a bottle

1912
00:32:34,549 --> 00:32:34,559
a message in a bottle
 

1913
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,509
a message in a bottle
and we should see this is simply another

1914
00:32:37,509 --> 00:32:37,519
and we should see this is simply another
 

1915
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:38,070
and we should see this is simply another
window

1916
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:38,080
window
 

1917
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,830

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,110
where do you think it could have come
from and

the narrow-minded view as we'll probably

the narrow-minded view as we'll probably
 

1931
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,149
the narrow-minded view as we'll probably
talk about throughout is you know you

1932
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
talk about throughout is you know you
 

1933
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,149
talk about throughout is you know you
kind of want to stick to the things that

1934
00:33:00,149 --> 00:33:00,159
kind of want to stick to the things that
 

1935
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,590
kind of want to stick to the things that
uh to naturally originating objects like

00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:03,600
uh to naturally originating objects like
 

1937
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,269
uh to naturally originating objects like
asteroids and comets

asteroids and comets
 

1939
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,710
asteroids and comets
okay that's the space of possible

1940
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:06,720
okay that's the space of possible
 

1941
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,870
okay that's the space of possible
hypotheses and then if we expand beyond

1942
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:08,880
hypotheses and then if we expand beyond
 

1943
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,070
hypotheses and then if we expand beyond
that

1944
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:10,080
that
 

1945
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,590
that
you start to think okay these are

1946
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:11,600
you start to think okay these are
 

1947
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,190
you start to think okay these are
artificially constructed like you just

1948
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:13,200
artificially constructed like you just
 

1949
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,029
artificially constructed like you just
said it could be by humans

1950
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:15,039
said it could be by humans

it could be by uh by

it could be by uh by
whatever that means by some kind of

variety what is this object
 

1963
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,389
variety what is this object
then that will look at that an excellent

1964
00:33:32,389 --> 00:33:32,399
then that will look at that an excellent
 

1965
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,269
then that will look at that an excellent
question and

1966
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:33,279
question and
 

1967
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,190
question and
let me lay out i mean we don't have

1968
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,200
let me lay out i mean we don't have
 

1969
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,630
let me lay out i mean we don't have
enough evidence to tell

1970
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:36,640
enough evidence to tell
 

1971
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,310
enough evidence to tell
if we had a photograph perhaps we would

1972
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:38,320
if we had a photograph perhaps we would
 

1973
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,909
if we had a photograph perhaps we would
have more information but

1974
00:33:39,909 --> 00:33:39,919
have more information but
 

1975
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,630
have more information but
the possib there is one other peculiar

1976
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:42,640
the possib there is one other peculiar
 

1977
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,190
the possib there is one other peculiar
fact about umuamua

1978
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:45,200
fact about umuamua
 

1979
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,310
fact about umuamua
uh well other than it was very shiny i

1980
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:48,320
uh well other than it was very shiny i
 

1981
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,389
uh well other than it was very shiny i
that i didn't mention you know we didn't

1982
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:50,399
that i didn't mention you know we didn't
 

1983
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,389
that i didn't mention you know we didn't
detect any heat from it and

1984
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:52,399
detect any heat from it and
 

1985
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,950
detect any heat from it and
that implies that it's rather small and

1986
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:54,960
that implies that it's rather small and
 

1987
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,909
that implies that it's rather small and
shiny

1988
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
shiny
 

1989
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,389
shiny
uh but the other peculiar fact is that

1990
00:33:58,389 --> 00:33:58,399
uh but the other peculiar fact is that
 

1991
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,789
uh but the other peculiar fact is that
it was it came from a very special frame

1992
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799
it was it came from a very special frame
 

1993
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:01,990
it was it came from a very special frame
of reference

1994
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,000
of reference
 

1995
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,789
of reference
so it's sort of like finding a car in a

1996
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:04,799
so it's sort of like finding a car in a
 

1997
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,990
so it's sort of like finding a car in a
parking lot in a public parking lot

1998
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:08,000
parking lot in a public parking lot
 

1999
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,750
parking lot in a public parking lot
that you know you can't really tell

2000
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:09,760
that you know you can't really tell
 

2001
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:11,430
that you know you can't really tell
where it came from

2002
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:11,440
where it came from
 

2003
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,950
where it came from
so there is this frame of reference

2004
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:12,960
so there is this frame of reference
 

2005
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,550
so there is this frame of reference
where you average

2006
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:14,560
where you average
 

2007
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,790
where you average
over the motions of all the stars in the

2008
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:16,800
over the motions of all the stars in the
 

2009
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,389
over the motions of all the stars in the
neighborhood of the sun

2010
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:18,399
neighborhood of the sun
 

2011
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,230
neighborhood of the sun
so you find the so-called local standard

2012
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240
so you find the so-called local standard
 

2013
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,109
so you find the so-called local standard
of rest

2014
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:23,119
of rest
 

2015
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,230
of rest
of the galaxy and that's uh

2016
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
of the galaxy and that's uh
 

2017
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,629
of the galaxy and that's uh
a frame of reference that is obtained by

2018
00:34:28,629 --> 00:34:28,639
a frame of reference that is obtained by
 

2019
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,149
a frame of reference that is obtained by
averaging the random

2020
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:30,159
averaging the random
 

2021
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,470
averaging the random
motions of all the stars and the sun is

2022
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:32,480
motions of all the stars and the sun is
 

2023
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,310
motions of all the stars and the sun is
moving relative to that frame at some

2024
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,320
moving relative to that frame at some
 

2025
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,750
moving relative to that frame at some
speed

2026
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:35,760
speed
 

2027
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,750
speed
but this object was at rest in that

2028
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:37,760
but this object was at rest in that
 

2029
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,030
but this object was at rest in that
frame and only one in 500 stars

2030
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:41,040
frame and only one in 500 stars
 

2031
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,349
frame and only one in 500 stars
is so much at rest in that frame and

2032
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:43,359
is so much at rest in that frame and
 

2033
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:44,470
is so much at rest in that frame and
that's why i was saying it's like a

2034
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:44,480
that's why i was saying it's like a
 

2035
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,109
that's why i was saying it's like a
parking lot

2036
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:45,119
parking lot
 

2037
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,829
parking lot
it was parked there and we bumped into

2038
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:47,839
it was parked there and we bumped into
 

2039
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:49,909
it was parked there and we bumped into
it so the relative speed between the

2040
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:49,919
it so the relative speed between the
 

2041
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:51,109
it so the relative speed between the
solar system

2042
00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:51,119
solar system
 

2043
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:53,909
solar system
and this object is just because we are

2044
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:53,919
and this object is just because we are
 

2045
00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:55,430
and this object is just because we are
moving

2046
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:55,440
moving
 

2047
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,030
moving
it was sitting still now you ask

2048
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,040
it was sitting still now you ask
 

2049
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,950
it was sitting still now you ask
yourself why is it so

2050
00:34:58,950 --> 00:34:58,960
yourself why is it so
 

2051
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,430
yourself why is it so
unusual in that context you know why

2052
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:01,440
unusual in that context you know why
 

2053
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:02,630
unusual in that context you know why
because if it was

2054
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:02,640
because if it was
 

2055
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,950
because if it was
expelled from another planetary system

2056
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:04,960
expelled from another planetary system
 

2057
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,990
expelled from another planetary system
most likely

2058
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
most likely
 

2059
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,030
most likely
it will carry the speed of the host star

2060
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,040
it will carry the speed of the host star
 

2061
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,430
it will carry the speed of the host star
that it came from because it was you

2062
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
that it came from because it was you
 

2063
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,510
that it came from because it was you
know the most loosely bound objects are

2064
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520
know the most loosely bound objects are
 

2065
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,950
know the most loosely bound objects are
in the periphery

2066
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:14,960
in the periphery
 

2067
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,990
in the periphery
of the planetary system and they move

2068
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:18,000
of the planetary system and they move
 

2069
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,390
of the planetary system and they move
very slowly relative to the star and so

2070
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:20,400
very slowly relative to the star and so
 

2071
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,190
very slowly relative to the star and so
they carry

2072
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:21,200
they carry
 

2073
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,190
they carry
the when they are ripped apart from the

2074
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,200
the when they are ripped apart from the
 

2075
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,950
the when they are ripped apart from the
planetary system most of the objects

2076
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:24,960
planetary system most of the objects
 

2077
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,150
planetary system most of the objects
will have

2078
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
will have
 

2079
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,550
will have
the residual motion of the star roughly

2080
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:28,560
the residual motion of the star roughly
 

2081
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,750
the residual motion of the star roughly
relative to the local stuff

2082
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:29,760
relative to the local stuff
 

2083
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,670
relative to the local stuff
but this one was at rest in the locals

2084
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:31,680
but this one was at rest in the locals
 

2085
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,829
but this one was at rest in the locals
now one thing i can think of

2086
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
now one thing i can think of
 

2087
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:36,950
now one thing i can think of
if if there is a grid of uh

2088
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
if if there is a grid of uh
 

2089
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,349
if if there is a grid of uh
road posts you know like for navigation

2090
00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:39,359
road posts you know like for navigation
 

2091
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,310
road posts you know like for navigation
system

2092
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:40,320
system
 

2093
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,230
system
so that you can find your way in the

2094
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
so that you can find your way in the
 

2095
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,670
so that you can find your way in the
local frame yeah

2096
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:43,680
local frame yeah
 

2097
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,510
local frame yeah
then that would be one position these

2098
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:45,520
then that would be one position these
 

2099
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,109
then that would be one position these
are like little sensors

2100
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
are like little sensors
 

2101
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,790
are like little sensors
of that's fascinating to think about so

2102
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
of that's fascinating to think about so
 

2103
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,950
of that's fascinating to think about so
there could be i mean not necessarily

2104
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:50,960
there could be i mean not necessarily
 

2105
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,230
there could be i mean not necessarily
literally a grid but just uh evenly

2106
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:54,240
literally a grid but just uh evenly
 

2107
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,710
literally a grid but just uh evenly
in some definition of evenly spread out

2108
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
in some definition of evenly spread out
 

2109
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,150
in some definition of evenly spread out
set of objects like these

2110
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:58,160
set of objects like these
 

2111
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,230
set of objects like these
right that are just out there a lot of

2112
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
right that are just out there a lot of
 

2113
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,470
right that are just out there a lot of
them another possibility is that

2114
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:02,480
them another possibility is that
 

2115
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,310
them another possibility is that
these are relay stations you know that

2116
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:04,320
these are relay stations you know that
 

2117
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,510
these are relay stations you know that
for communication

2118
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:05,520
for communication
 

2119
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,270
for communication
you might think in order to communicate

2120
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
you might think in order to communicate
 

2121
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,950
you might think in order to communicate
you need a huge beacon

2122
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
you need a huge beacon
 

2123
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,990
you need a huge beacon
yeah a very powerful beacon but it's not

2124
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:12,000
yeah a very powerful beacon but it's not
 

2125
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,750
yeah a very powerful beacon but it's not
true because even on earth you know we

2126
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:13,760
true because even on earth you know we
 

2127
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,150
true because even on earth you know we
have these relay stations so you have

2128
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:16,160
have these relay stations so you have
 

2129
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,470
have these relay stations so you have
a not so powerful beacon so it can be

2130
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:18,480
a not so powerful beacon so it can be
 

2131
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,710
a not so powerful beacon so it can be
heard only out to a limited distance but

2132
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:20,720
heard only out to a limited distance but
 

2133
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,109
heard only out to a limited distance but
then

2134
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,119
then
 

2135
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,430
then
you relay the message yes and it could

2136
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:23,440
you relay the message yes and it could
 

2137
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,630
you relay the message yes and it could
be one of those

2138
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:24,640
be one of those
 

2139
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,109
be one of those
now after it collided with this the

2140
00:36:27,109 --> 00:36:27,119
now after it collided with this the
 

2141
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,030
now after it collided with this the
solar system of course it got a kick so

2142
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,040
solar system of course it got a kick so
 

2143
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,310
solar system of course it got a kick so
it's just like a

2144
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,320
it's just like a
 

2145
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,310
it's just like a
billiard ball you know we gave it a a

2146
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,320
billiard ball you know we gave it a a
 

2147
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,750
billiard ball you know we gave it a a
kick by colliding with

2148
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:33,760
kick by colliding with
 

2149
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,349
kick by colliding with
but most of them are not colliding with

2150
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
but most of them are not colliding with
 

2151
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,589
but most of them are not colliding with
stars and so that's one possibility

2152
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:37,599
stars and so that's one possibility
 

2153
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,910
stars and so that's one possibility
okay and there should be numer lots of

2154
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:39,920
okay and there should be numer lots of
 

2155
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,670
okay and there should be numer lots of
them if that's the case

2156
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:41,680
them if that's the case
 

2157
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,870
them if that's the case
um the other possibility

2158
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:44,880
um the other possibility
 

2159
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,349
um the other possibility
is that it's a probe you know that was

2160
00:36:47,349 --> 00:36:47,359
is that it's a probe you know that was
 

2161
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,710
is that it's a probe you know that was
sent

2162
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:48,720
sent
 

2163
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,470
sent
uh in the direction of the um

2164
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
uh in the direction of the um
 

2165
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,710
uh in the direction of the um
habitable region around the sun to find

2166
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
habitable region around the sun to find
 

2167
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,069
habitable region around the sun to find
out if there is life

2168
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079
out if there is life
 

2169
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,470
out if there is life
now it takes tens of thousands of years

2170
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
now it takes tens of thousands of years
 

2171
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,470
now it takes tens of thousands of years
for such a probe to traverse the solar

2172
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:00,480
for such a probe to traverse the solar
 

2173
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,390
for such a probe to traverse the solar
system from the outer edge of the oort

2174
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:02,400
system from the outer edge of the oort
 

2175
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,109
system from the outer edge of the oort
cloud

2176
00:37:03,109 --> 00:37:03,119
cloud
 

2177
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:06,230
cloud
all the way to where we are and you know

2178
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,240
all the way to where we are and you know
 

2179
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,750
all the way to where we are and you know
it's a long journey so when it started

2180
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:07,760
it's a long journey so when it started
 

2181
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,190
it's a long journey so when it started
the journey from the edge of the solar

2182
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:09,200
the journey from the edge of the solar
 

2183
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,950
the journey from the edge of the solar
system to get to us now

2184
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
system to get to us now
 

2185
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,950
system to get to us now
you know we were rather primitive back

2186
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:12,960
you know we were rather primitive back
 

2187
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,069
you know we were rather primitive back
then you know we

2188
00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:14,079
then you know we
 

2189
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,670
then you know we
we still didn't have any technology

2190
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:15,680
we still didn't have any technology
 

2191
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,430
we still didn't have any technology
there was no reason to visit you know

2192
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:17,440
there was no reason to visit you know
 

2193
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,510
there was no reason to visit you know
there was grass around and so forth

2194
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:19,520
there was grass around and so forth
 

2195
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,550
there was grass around and so forth
but you know maybe it is a problem uh

2196
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
but you know maybe it is a problem uh
 

2197
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,550
but you know maybe it is a problem uh
so you said ten thousand years as fast

2198
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:24,560
so you said ten thousand years as fast
 

2199
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,390
so you said ten thousand years as fast
so it takes that long tens of thousands

2200
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,400
so it takes that long tens of thousands
 

2201
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,109
so it takes that long tens of thousands
yes tens of thousands a year yeah yeah

2202
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:29,119
yes tens of thousands a year yeah yeah
 

2203
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:29,430
yes tens of thousands a year yeah yeah
and

2204
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
and
 

2205
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,430
and
uh the other thing i should say is you

2206
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,440
uh the other thing i should say is you
 

2207
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,270
uh the other thing i should say is you
know it could be just

2208
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
know it could be just
 

2209
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,390
know it could be just
a a an outer layer of something else

2210
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:36,400
a a an outer layer of something else
 

2211
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,109
a a an outer layer of something else
like

2212
00:37:37,109 --> 00:37:37,119
like
 

2213
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:39,349
like
you know something that was ripped apart

2214
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:39,359
you know something that was ripped apart
 

2215
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,270
you know something that was ripped apart
like a surface of

2216
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,280
like a surface of
 

2217
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,829
like a surface of
an instrument that was and and you can

2218
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:43,839
an instrument that was and and you can
 

2219
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,349
an instrument that was and and you can
have lots of these pieces you know if

2220
00:37:45,349 --> 00:37:45,359
have lots of these pieces you know if
 

2221
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,630
have lots of these pieces you know if
something breaks

2222
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:46,640
something breaks
 

2223
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,069
something breaks
lots of these pieces spread out like

2224
00:37:48,069 --> 00:37:48,079
lots of these pieces spread out like
 

2225
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,069
lots of these pieces spread out like
space junk and

2226
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:50,079
space junk and
 

2227
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,710
space junk and
you know that it could be just space

2228
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:52,720
you know that it could be just space
 

2229
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,670
you know that it could be just space
junk

2230
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:53,680
junk
 

2231
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,790
junk
from an extra from an alien civilization

2232
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:56,800
from an extra from an alien civilization
 

2233
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,910
from an extra from an alien civilization
yes so it's i'm going to tell you about

2234
00:37:59,910 --> 00:37:59,920
yes so it's i'm going to tell you about
 

2235
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,870
yes so it's i'm going to tell you about
space junk

2236
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:00,880
space junk
 

2237
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,190
space junk
let me yes what do you mean by space

2238
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
let me yes what do you mean by space
 

2239
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,230
let me yes what do you mean by space
junk so

2240
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:04,240
junk so
 

2241
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,349
junk so
um i think you know you might ask why

2242
00:38:07,349 --> 00:38:07,359
um i think you know you might ask why
 

2243
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:08,150
um i think you know you might ask why
aren't they

2244
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:08,160
aren't they
 

2245
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,990
aren't they
looking for us one possibility is that

2246
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,000
looking for us one possibility is that
 

2247
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,349
looking for us one possibility is that
we are not interesting like we were

2248
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:11,359
we are not interesting like we were
 

2249
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,950
we are not interesting like we were
talking about

2250
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:12,960
talking about
 

2251
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,270
talking about
another possibility you know if there

2252
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:15,280
another possibility you know if there
 

2253
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,990
another possibility you know if there
are

2254
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:16,000
are
 

2255
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,430
are
millions of or billions of years uh

2256
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:19,440
millions of or billions of years uh
 

2257
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,750
millions of or billions of years uh
into their technological development

2258
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
into their technological development
 

2259
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,510
into their technological development
they created their own

2260
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:23,520
they created their own
 

2261
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,790
they created their own
their own habitat their own cocoon

2262
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:26,800
their own habitat their own cocoon
 

2263
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,470
their own habitat their own cocoon
where they feel comfortable they have

2264
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,480
where they feel comfortable they have
 

2265
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,990
where they feel comfortable they have
everything they need

2266
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,000
everything they need
 

2267
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,470
everything they need
and it it's risky for them to establish

2268
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,480
and it it's risky for them to establish
 

2269
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,750
and it it's risky for them to establish
communication with

2270
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:33,760
communication with
 

2271
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,950
communication with
other so they have their own cocoon and

2272
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:36,960
other so they have their own cocoon and
 

2273
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,310
other so they have their own cocoon and
they close off

2274
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:38,320
they close off
 

2275
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,710
they close off
they don't care about anything else now

2276
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:40,720
they don't care about anything else now
 

2277
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,230
they don't care about anything else now
in that case you might say oh

2278
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:42,240
in that case you might say oh
 

2279
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,910
in that case you might say oh
so how can we find about them if they

2280
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
so how can we find about them if they
 

2281
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,670
so how can we find about them if they
are closed off

2282
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:45,680
are closed off
 

2283
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,230
are closed off
the answer is they still have to deposit

2284
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:48,240
the answer is they still have to deposit
 

2285
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,030
the answer is they still have to deposit
trash

2286
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,040
trash
 

2287
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,030
trash
right that's that is something from the

2288
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,040
right that's that is something from the
 

2289
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,310
right that's that is something from the
law of thermodynamics

2290
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
law of thermodynamics
 

2291
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,870
law of thermodynamics
there must be some production of trash

2292
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:54,880
there must be some production of trash
 

2293
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,430
there must be some production of trash

you know we can still find about them
 

2297
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,150
you know we can still find about them
just like investigative journalists

2298
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:00,160
just like investigative journalists
 

2299
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,710
just like investigative journalists
going through the trash cans of

by looking at the front it's fascinating

2308
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:10,079
by looking at the front it's fascinating
 

2309
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,270
by looking at the front it's fascinating
to think you know if

2310
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
to think you know if
 

2311
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,990
to think you know if
if we are the ants in this picture if we

2312
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:14,000
if we are the ants in this picture if we
 

2313

if we are the ants in this picture if we
if this thing is a water bottle

2314
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
if this thing is a water bottle
 

2315
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,589
if this thing is a water bottle
or if it's like a smartphone like where

2316
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:19,599
or if it's like a smartphone like where
 

2317
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,069
or if it's like a smartphone like where
where on the spectrum of possible

2318
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:22,079
where on the spectrum of possible
 

2319
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:22,950
where on the spectrum of possible
objects

2320
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:22,960
objects
 

2321
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,150
objects
of space because there's a lot of

2322
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:24,160
of space because there's a lot of
 

2323
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,470
of space because there's a lot of
interesting trash

2324

interesting trash
 

2325
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,030
interesting trash
like how interesting is this trash but

2326
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
like how interesting is this trash but
 

2327
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,630
like how interesting is this trash but
imagine a caveman

2328
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
imagine a caveman
 

2329
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,190
imagine a caveman
seeing a cellphone the caveman would

2330
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:33,200
seeing a cellphone the caveman would
 

2331
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,470
seeing a cellphone the caveman would
think since the caveman

2332
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:34,480
think since the caveman
 

2333
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,310
think since the caveman
played with rocks all of his life he

2334
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:36,320
played with rocks all of his life he
 

2335
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,589
played with rocks all of his life he
would say it's a rock

2336
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:37,599
would say it's a rock
 

2337
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,390
would say it's a rock
just like my fellow astronomers said yes

2338
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
just like my fellow astronomers said yes
 

2339
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,349
just like my fellow astronomers said yes
right exactly

2340
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:41,359
right exactly
 

2341
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,510
right exactly
that's brilliantly put actually as a

00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
that's brilliantly put actually as a

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,030
that's brilliantly put actually as a
scientist do you hope it's a water

2344
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:45,040
scientist do you hope it's a water
 

2345
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,270
scientist do you hope it's a water
bottle or a smartphone because a smart

2346
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:47,280
bottle or a smartphone because a smart
 

2347
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,109
bottle or a smartphone because a smart
i hope it's even more than a smartphone

2348
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:49,119
i hope it's even more than a smartphone
 

2349
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,190
i hope it's even more than a smartphone
i hope that it's something that is

2350
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,200
i hope that it's something that is
 

2351
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,109
i hope that it's something that is
really sophisticated and funny

2352
00:39:53,109 --> 00:39:53,119
really sophisticated and funny
 

2353
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:55,190
really sophisticated and funny
yeah see i'm the opposite i i feel like

2354
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
yeah see i'm the opposite i i feel like
 

2355
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,710
yeah see i'm the opposite i i feel like
i hope it's a water bottle

2356
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
i hope it's a water bottle
 

2357
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,349
i hope it's a water bottle
because at least we have a hope with our

2358
00:39:59,349 --> 00:39:59,359
because at least we have a hope with our
 

2359
00:39:59,359 --> 00:39:59,990
because at least we have a hope with our
current

2360

current
 

2361
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,069
current
set of skills to understand it yeah

2362
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:02,079
set of skills to understand it yeah
 

2363
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,990
set of skills to understand it yeah
caveman has no way of understanding the

2364
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:04,000
caveman has no way of understanding the
 

2365
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,910
caveman has no way of understanding the
smartphone it's like it will be

2366
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:05,920
smartphone it's like it will be
 

2367
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:08,069
smartphone it's like it will be
like i feel like a caveman has more to

2368
00:40:08,069 --> 00:40:08,079
like i feel like a caveman has more to
 

2369
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,990
like i feel like a caveman has more to
learn from the plastic water bottle than

2370
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,000
learn from the plastic water bottle than
 

2371
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,910
learn from the plastic water bottle than
they do from the smartphone but suppose

2372
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
they do from the smartphone but suppose
 

2373
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,030
they do from the smartphone but suppose
we figure it out

2374
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:13,040
we figure it out
 

2375
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,589
we figure it out
if we if we for example come close to it

2376
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:15,599
if we if we for example come close to it
 

2377
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:16,790
if we if we for example come close to it
and and learn

2378
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:16,800
and and learn
 

2379
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,390
and and learn
what it's made of and i guess the

2380
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
what it's made of and i guess the
 

2381
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,950
what it's made of and i guess the
smartphone is full of like thousands of

2382
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:20,960
smartphone is full of like thousands of
 

2383
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,710
smartphone is full of like thousands of
different technologies that we could

2384
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:22,720
different technologies that we could
 

2385
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,309
different technologies that we could
probably pick at do you have a sense of

2386
00:40:26,309 --> 00:40:26,319
probably pick at do you have a sense of
 

2387
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:27,670
probably pick at do you have a sense of
where

2388
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:27,680
where
 

2389
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:31,270
where
a hypothesis of where

2390
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280
a hypothesis of where
 

2391
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,349
a hypothesis of where
is the cocoon that it might have come

2392
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:33,359
is the cocoon that it might have come
 

2393
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:34,710
is the cocoon that it might have come
from

2394
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:34,720
from
 

2395
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,990
from
no because uh okay so first of

2396
00:40:37,990 --> 00:40:38,000
no because uh okay so first of
 

2397
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,150
no because uh okay so first of
all you know the solar system the

2398
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:40,160
all you know the solar system the
 

2399
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,150
all you know the solar system the
outermost edge of the solar system is

2400
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
outermost edge of the solar system is
 

2401
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,670
outermost edge of the solar system is
called the oort cloud

2402
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:43,680
called the oort cloud
 

2403
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,190
called the oort cloud
it's a cloud of icy rocks

2404
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:47,200
it's a cloud of icy rocks
 

2405
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,230
it's a cloud of icy rocks
um of different sizes

2406
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:50,240
um of different sizes
 

2407
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,870
um of different sizes
that were left over from the formation

2408
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:52,880
that were left over from the formation
 

2409
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,910
that were left over from the formation
of the solar system

2410
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:53,920
of the solar system
 

2411
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,670
of the solar system
yes and it it's thought to be roughly

2412
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:57,680
yes and it it's thought to be roughly
 

2413
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:01,030
yes and it it's thought to be roughly
a ball or a sphere and it's halfway the

2414
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
a ball or a sphere and it's halfway the
 

2415
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,030
a ball or a sphere and it's halfway the
extent of it is roughly halfway to the

2416
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040
extent of it is roughly halfway to the
 

2417
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:03,670
extent of it is roughly halfway to the
nearest

2418
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
nearest
 

2419
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,349
nearest
star okay so you can imagine

2420
00:41:07,349 --> 00:41:07,359
star okay so you can imagine
 

2421
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:10,470
star okay so you can imagine
each planetary system basically

2422
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:10,480
each planetary system basically
 

2423
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,390
each planetary system basically
touching uh the oort clouds of those

2424
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:14,400
touching uh the oort clouds of those
 

2425
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,710
touching uh the oort clouds of those
stars that are near us are touching each

2426
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:16,720
stars that are near us are touching each
 

2427
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,510
stars that are near us are touching each
other

2428
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
other
 

2429
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,870
other
space is full of these

2430
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:20,880
space is full of these
 

2431
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,349
space is full of these
billiard balls that are very densely

2432
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
billiard balls that are very densely
 

2433
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:23,910
billiard balls that are very densely
packed

2434
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:23,920
packed
 

2435
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,349
packed
yes and what that means is any object

2436
00:41:27,349 --> 00:41:27,359
yes and what that means is any object
 

2437
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:27,990
yes and what that means is any object
that you see

2438
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:28,000
that you see
 

2439
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,430
that you see
irrespective whether it came from the

2440
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,440
irrespective whether it came from the
 

2441
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,349
irrespective whether it came from the
local standard so we said that this

2442
00:41:31,349 --> 00:41:31,359
local standard so we said that this
 

2443
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,030
local standard so we said that this
object is special because it came from a

2444
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:33,040
object is special because it came from a
 

2445
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,630
object is special because it came from a
local standard of rest but even if it

2446
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:34,640
local standard of rest but even if it
 

2447
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,430
local standard of rest but even if it
didn't

2448
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:35,440
didn't
 

2449
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,109
didn't
you would never be able to trace where

2450
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:37,119
you would never be able to trace where
 

2451
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,430
you would never be able to trace where
it came from because

2452
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:39,440
it came from because
 

2453
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,150
it came from because
all these old clouds overlap so if you

2454
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,160
all these old clouds overlap so if you
 

2455
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:42,470
all these old clouds overlap so if you
take

2456
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:42,480
take
 

2457
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,309
take
some direction in the sky you will cross

2458
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:46,319
some direction in the sky you will cross
 

2459
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,470
some direction in the sky you will cross
as many stars as you have in that

2460
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:48,480
as many stars as you have in that
 

2461
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,510
as many stars as you have in that
direction like

2462
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,520
direction like
 

2463
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,670
direction like
there is no way to tell which old cloud

2464
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:51,680
there is no way to tell which old cloud
 

2465
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,790
there is no way to tell which old cloud
it came from so yes

2466
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:52,800
it came from so yes
 

2467
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,470
it came from so yes
i i didn't realize how densely packed

2468
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:54,480
i i didn't realize how densely packed
 

2469
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,990
i i didn't realize how densely packed
everything was uh yeah

2470
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:56,000
everything was uh yeah
 

2471
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,990
everything was uh yeah
from the perspective of the work cloud

2472
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,000
from the perspective of the work cloud
 

2473
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,430
from the perspective of the work cloud
and that's really interesting so

2474
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
and that's really interesting so
 

2475
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,030
and that's really interesting so
yeah it could be it could be nearby it

2476
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
yeah it could be it could be nearby it
 

2477
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,109
yeah it could be it could be nearby it
could be very far away yeah we have no

2478
00:42:03,109 --> 00:42:03,119
could be very far away yeah we have no
 

2479
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,910
could be very far away yeah we have no
clue

2480
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:03,920
clue
 

2481
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,430
clue
you said cocoon that and you kind of uh

2482
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:09,440
you said cocoon that and you kind of uh
 

2483
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,750
you said cocoon that and you kind of uh
uh paint uh i think in the book i've

2484
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
uh paint uh i think in the book i've
 

2485
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,510
uh paint uh i think in the book i've
read a lot of your articles too on

2486
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
read a lot of your articles too on
 

2487
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,109
read a lot of your articles too on
scientific american which are brilliant

2488
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:15,119
scientific american which are brilliant
 

2489
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,470
scientific american which are brilliant
so i'm kind of mixing things up in my

2490
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:16,480
so i'm kind of mixing things up in my
 

2491
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,589
so i'm kind of mixing things up in my
head a little bit

2492
00:42:17,589 --> 00:42:17,599
head a little bit
 

2493
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,190
head a little bit
but there's uh what does that

2494
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,200
but there's uh what does that
 

2495
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,309
but there's uh what does that
cocoon look like what is the

2496
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:22,319
cocoon look like what is the
 

2497
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,470
cocoon look like what is the
civilization that's able to harness

2498
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480
civilization that's able to harness
 

2499
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,349
civilization that's able to harness
the power of multiple suns for example

2500
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:27,359
the power of multiple suns for example
 

2501
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:28,069
the power of multiple suns for example
um

2502
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:28,079
um
 

2503
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:29,750
um
look like they give when you imagine

2504
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:29,760
look like they give when you imagine
 

2505
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,670
look like they give when you imagine
possible civilizations that are

2506
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
possible civilizations that are
 

2507
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,990
possible civilizations that are
a million years more advanced than us

2508
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,000
a million years more advanced than us
 

2509
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,670
a million years more advanced than us
what do you think that actually like

2510
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:35,680
what do you think that actually like
 

2511
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,470
what do you think that actually like
looks like i think it's very different

2512
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:38,480
looks like i think it's very different
 

2513
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,750
looks like i think it's very different
than we can imagine

2514
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:39,760
than we can imagine
 

2515
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,069
than we can imagine
uh by the way i should start from the

2516
00:42:42,069 --> 00:42:42,079
uh by the way i should start from the
 

2517
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:42,790
uh by the way i should start from the
point that

2518
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:42,800
point that
 

2519
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,510
point that
even biological life you know just

2520
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:45,520
even biological life you know just
 

2521
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:46,950
even biological life you know just
without technology

2522
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:46,960
without technology
 

2523
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,910
without technology
getting into the game uh could look like

2524
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:49,920
getting into the game uh could look like
 

2525
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,069
getting into the game uh could look like
something we have never seen before

2526
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:52,079
something we have never seen before
 

2527
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,309
something we have never seen before
take for example the nearest star which

2528
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:54,319
take for example the nearest star which
 

2529
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:55,910
take for example the nearest star which
is proxima centauri

2530
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:55,920
is proxima centauri
 

2531
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,390
is proxima centauri
it's four and a quarter light years away

2532
00:42:58,390 --> 00:42:58,400
it's four and a quarter light years away
 

2533
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,990
it's four and a quarter light years away
so they will know

2534
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:00,000
so they will know
 

2535
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,030
so they will know
about the results of the 2016 elections

2536
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
about the results of the 2016 elections
 

2537
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,109
about the results of the 2016 elections
only next month in february 2021 yes

2538
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
only next month in february 2021 yes
 

2539
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,390
only next month in february 2021 yes
it's very far away um but

2540
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:10,400
it's very far away um but
 

2541
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,349
it's very far away um but
if you think about it um you know this

2542
00:43:13,349 --> 00:43:13,359
if you think about it um you know this
 

2543
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:13,750
if you think about it um you know this
this

2544
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
this
 

2545
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,270
this
uh star is a is a dwarf star

2546
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,280
uh star is a is a dwarf star
 

2547
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,870
uh star is a is a dwarf star
and it's much cooler than it's uh

2548
00:43:20,870 --> 00:43:20,880
and it's much cooler than it's uh
 

2549
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,430
and it's much cooler than it's uh
twice as cold as the sun okay and it

2550
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:23,440
twice as cold as the sun okay and it
 

2551
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,990
twice as cold as the sun okay and it
emits mostly infrared radiation

2552
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:26,000
emits mostly infrared radiation
 

2553
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,589
emits mostly infrared radiation
so if there are any creatures on

2554
00:43:29,589 --> 00:43:29,599
so if there are any creatures on
 

2555
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:32,470
so if there are any creatures on
the planet close to it that is habitable

2556
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,480
the planet close to it that is habitable
 

2557
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,069
the planet close to it that is habitable
which is called proxima b

2558
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:34,079
which is called proxima b
 

2559
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,990
which is called proxima b
there is a planet in the habitable zone

2560
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:36,000
there is a planet in the habitable zone
 

2561
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,990
there is a planet in the habitable zone
in the zone just at the right distance

2562
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,000
in the zone just at the right distance
 

2563
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,309
in the zone just at the right distance
where

2564
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:38,319
where
 

2565
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,910
where
in principle liquid water can be on the

2566
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:39,920
in principle liquid water can be on the
 

2567
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:42,950
in principle liquid water can be on the
surface if there are any animals there

2568
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
surface if there are any animals there
 

2569
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,750
surface if there are any animals there
they have infrared eyes because our eyes

2570
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:45,760
they have infrared eyes because our eyes
 

2571
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:46,309
they have infrared eyes because our eyes
was

2572
00:43:46,309 --> 00:43:46,319
was
 

2573
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,270
was
designed to be sensitive to where most

designed to be sensitive to where most
of the sunlight

2576
00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:50,079
of the sunlight
 

2577
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,270
of the sunlight
is in the visible range but proxima

2578
00:43:53,270 --> 00:43:53,280
is in the visible range but proxima
 

2579
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,670
is in the visible range but proxima
centaurium is mostly infrared so

2580
00:43:55,670 --> 00:43:55,680
centaurium is mostly infrared so
 

2581
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,589
centaurium is mostly infrared so
you're not the nearest to see each other

2582
00:43:57,589 --> 00:43:57,599
you're not the nearest to see each other
 

2583
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,270
you're not the nearest to see each other
in the nearest star system

2584
00:43:59,270 --> 00:43:59,280
in the nearest star system
 

2585
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,069
in the nearest star system
these animals would be quite strange

2586
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
these animals would be quite strange
 

2587
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,030
these animals would be quite strange
they would have

2588
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:03,040
they would have
 

2589
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,750
they would have
eyes that are detectors of infrared very

2590
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
eyes that are detectors of infrared very
 

2591
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,030
eyes that are detectors of infrared very
different from ours

2592
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:07,040
different from ours
 

2593
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,069
different from ours
moreover this planet proxima b faces the

2594
00:44:10,069 --> 00:44:10,079
moreover this planet proxima b faces the
 

2595
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:10,550
moreover this planet proxima b faces the
star

star
 

2597
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,950
star
always with the same side so it has a

2598
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
always with the same side so it has a
 

2599
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,230
always with the same side so it has a
permanent dayside

2600

permanent dayside
 

2601
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:17,030
permanent dayside
and a permanent night side and obviously

2602
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
and a permanent night side and obviously
 

2603
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,390
and a permanent night side and obviously
the creatures that would

2604
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:18,400
the creatures that would
 

2605
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,550
the creatures that would
evolve on the permanent dayside which is

2606
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:20,560
evolve on the permanent dayside which is
 

2607
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,430
evolve on the permanent dayside which is
much warmer

2608
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:21,440
much warmer
 

2609
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,190
much warmer
would be quite different than those on

2610
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:23,200
would be quite different than those on
 

2611
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,630
would be quite different than those on
the permanent night side

the permanent night side
 

2613
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,550
the permanent night side
between them there would be a permanent

between them there would be a permanent
 

2615
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,750
between them there would be a permanent
sunset

on this on this trip so you know these

2630
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
on this on this trip so you know these
 

2631
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,030
on this on this trip so you know these
worlds are out of

2632
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:45,040
worlds are out of
 

2633
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,109
worlds are out of
our imagination just even the individual

2634

creatures this
the sensor suite that they're operating

2638
00:44:49,990 --> 00:44:50,000
the sensor suite that they're operating
 

2639
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,349
the sensor suite that they're operating
with might be very different very

2640
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:51,359
with might be very different very
 

2641
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:52,630
with might be very different very
different so i think when we

2642
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:52,640
different so i think when we
 

2643
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,230
different so i think when we
see something like that we would be

2644
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:54,240
see something like that we would be
 

2645
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,390
see something like that we would be
shocked not to speak about seeing

2646
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
shocked not to speak about seeing
 

2647
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,349
shocked not to speak about seeing
technology now

2648
00:44:57,349 --> 00:44:57,359
technology now
 

2649
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,069
technology now
so i i don't even dare to imagine you

2650
00:45:00,069 --> 00:45:00,079
so i i don't even dare to imagine you
 

2651
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:00,630
so i i don't even dare to imagine you
know

00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,640
know
 

2653
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,589
know
uh and i think you know obviously we can

2654
00:45:03,589 --> 00:45:03,599
uh and i think you know obviously we can
 

2655
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:04,550
uh and i think you know obviously we can
bury our head

2656
00:45:04,550 --> 00:45:04,560
bury our head
 

2657
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,750
bury our head
in the sand and say it's never aliens

like many of my colleagues say and it's
 

2661
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,430
like many of my colleagues say and it's
a self-fulfilling

recognition
 

2733
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,270
recognition
that's not the purpose of science the

2734
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:29,280
that's not the purpose of science the
 

2735
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,390
that's not the purpose of science the
purpose is to figure out what nature is

2736
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
purpose is to figure out what nature is
 

2737
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,470
purpose is to figure out what nature is
right and in the process of doing that

2738
00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:34,480
right and in the process of doing that
 

2739
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,910
right and in the process of doing that
it's a learning experience

2740
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:35,920
it's a learning experience
 

2741
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,309
it's a learning experience
you make mistakes you know einstein made

2742
00:46:38,309 --> 00:46:38,319
you make mistakes you know einstein made
 

2743
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:40,470
you make mistakes you know einstein made
three mistakes at the end of his career

2744
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,480
three mistakes at the end of his career
 

2745
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,670
three mistakes at the end of his career
he argued that in the 1930s he argued

2746
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:43,680
he argued that in the 1930s he argued
 

2747
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,670
he argued that in the 1930s he argued
that black holes don't exist

2748
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:45,680
that black holes don't exist
 

2749
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,950
that black holes don't exist
gravitational waves don't exist and

2750
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:48,960
gravitational waves don't exist and
 

2751
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,150
gravitational waves don't exist and
quantum mechanics doesn't have spooky

2752
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:52,160
quantum mechanics doesn't have spooky
 

2753

action at a distance
 

2755
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,990
action at a distance
and all three turned out to be wrong

2756
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:56,000
and all three turned out to be wrong
 

2757
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:56,790
and all three turned out to be wrong
okay so

2758
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:56,800
okay so
 

2759
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,470
okay so
the point is that if you work at the

2760
00:46:58,470 --> 00:46:58,480
the point is that if you work at the
 

2761
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:01,030
the point is that if you work at the
frontier of then you make mistakes it's

2762
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:01,040
frontier of then you make mistakes it's
 

2763
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,790
frontier of then you make mistakes it's
inevitable because you can't tell what

2764
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:02,800
inevitable because you can't tell what
 

2765
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,069
inevitable because you can't tell what
is true or not

2766
00:47:04,069 --> 00:47:04,079
is true or not
 

2767
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:06,390
is true or not
and avoiding making mistakes in order to

2768
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:06,400
and avoiding making mistakes in order to
 

2769
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,069
and avoiding making mistakes in order to
preserve your image

2770
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:08,079
preserve your image

00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:10,640
makes you extremely boring okay you will
 

2773
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,470
makes you extremely boring okay you will
get a prize but you will be a

2774

get a prize but you will be a
 

2775
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:15,030
get a prize but you will be a
boring scientist because you will keep

2776
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:15,040
boring scientist because you will keep
 

2777
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,190

2779
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,870
repeating things we already know
if you want to make progress if you want

2780
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
if you want to make progress if you want
 

2781
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,589
if you want to make progress if you want
to innovate you have to take risks

2782
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
to innovate you have to take risks
 

2783
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,829
to innovate you have to take risks
and you have to look at the evidence

2784
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:23,839
and you have to look at the evidence
 

2785
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,910
and you have to look at the evidence
it's a dialogue with nature

2786
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
it's a dialogue with nature
 

2787
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,230
it's a dialogue with nature
you don't know the the truth in advance

2788
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:28,240
you don't know the the truth in advance
 

2789
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,030
you don't know the the truth in advance
you let nature tell you educate you

2790
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:31,040
you let nature tell you educate you
 

2791
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,510
you let nature tell you educate you
and then you you realize that what you

2792
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:33,520
and then you you realize that what you
 

2793
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:34,230
and then you you realize that what you
thought before

2794
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:34,240
thought before
 

2795
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,230
thought before
is incorrect and a lot of my colleagues

2796
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:38,240
is incorrect and a lot of my colleagues
 

2797
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:39,990
is incorrect and a lot of my colleagues
prefer to be in a state where they have

2798
00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:40,000
prefer to be in a state where they have
 

2799
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,430
prefer to be in a state where they have
a monologue you know if you look at

2800
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:41,440
a monologue you know if you look at
 

2801
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,270
a monologue you know if you look at
these people that work on string theory

2802
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
these people that work on string theory
 

2803
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:43,750
these people that work on string theory
yes

2804
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
yes
 

2805
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,150
yes
uh they have a monologue they know what

2806
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:46,160
uh they have a monologue they know what
 

2807
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,030
uh they have a monologue they know what
and in fact

2808
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:47,040
and in fact
 

2809
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:48,950
and in fact
their monologue is centered on

2810
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
their monologue is centered on
 

2811
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,270
their monologue is centered on
anti-deceiter space which we don't live

2812
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:51,280
anti-deceiter space which we don't live
 

2813
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,069
anti-deceiter space which we don't live
in now you know it's to me it's just

2814
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:54,079
in now you know it's to me it's just
 

2815
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,349
in now you know it's to me it's just
like the olympics you know

2816
00:47:55,349 --> 00:47:55,359
like the olympics you know
 

2817
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,589
like the olympics you know
you you define a hundred meters and you

2818
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:57,599
you you define a hundred meters and you
 

2819
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,910
you you define a hundred meters and you
say whoever runs this hundred meters

2820
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
say whoever runs this hundred meters
 

2821
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,549
say whoever runs this hundred meters
is the best athlete the fastest you know

2822
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:02,559
is the best athlete the fastest you know
 

2823
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,349
is the best athlete the fastest you know
and uh

2824
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:03,359
and uh
 

2825
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:04,790
and uh
it's completely arbitrary you could have

2826
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
it's completely arbitrary you could have
 

2827
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,030
it's completely arbitrary you could have
decided it would be 50 meters or 20

2828
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:07,040
decided it would be 50 meters or 20
 

2829
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:07,990
decided it would be 50 meters or 20
meters

2830
00:48:07,990 --> 00:48:08,000
meters
 

2831
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,230
meters
who cares you just measure the ability

2832
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:10,240
who cares you just measure the ability
 

2833
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,190
who cares you just measure the ability
of people this way

2834
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:11,200
of people this way
 

2835
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,670
of people this way
so you define antidecital space as a

2836
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
so you define antidecital space as a
 

2837
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,190
so you define antidecital space as a
space where you do your mathematical

2838
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,200
space where you do your mathematical
 

2839
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,470
space where you do your mathematical
gymnastics

2840
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
gymnastics
 

2841
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,309
gymnastics
and then you find who can do it the best

2842
00:48:18,309 --> 00:48:18,319
and then you find who can do it the best
 

2843
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,990
and then you find who can do it the best
and you give jobs based on that you give

2844
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:20,000
and you give jobs based on that you give
 

2845
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,349
and you give jobs based on that you give
prizes best

2846
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
prizes best
 

2847
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,670
prizes best
but as we said before you know nature

2848
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:23,680
but as we said before you know nature
 

2849
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:24,950
but as we said before you know nature
doesn't care about

2850
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
doesn't care about
 

2851
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,270
doesn't care about
you know the prizes that you give to

2852
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:27,280
you know the prizes that you give to
 

2853
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,230
you know the prizes that you give to
each other

2854
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:28,240
each other
 

2855
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,430
each other
it cares you know it has its own reality

2856
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:31,440
it cares you know it has its own reality
 

2857
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:31,750
it cares you know it has its own reality
and

2858
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:31,760
and
 

2859
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:33,510
and
we should figure it out and it's not

2860
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:33,520
we should figure it out and it's not
 

2861
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,829
we should figure it out and it's not
about us the scientific activity is

2862
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:35,839
about us the scientific activity is
 

2863
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,549
about us the scientific activity is
about

2864
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
about
 

2865
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,710
about
figuring out nature and sometimes we may

2866
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:38,720
figuring out nature and sometimes we may
 

2867
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,470
figuring out nature and sometimes we may
be wrong our image will not

2868
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:40,480
be wrong our image will not
 

2869
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,230
be wrong our image will not
be preserved but it's that's the fun you

2870
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:44,240
be preserved but it's that's the fun you
 

2871
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,829
be preserved but it's that's the fun you
know

2872
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:45,839
know
 

2873
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,870
know
kids explore the world out of curiosity

2874
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
kids explore the world out of curiosity
 

2875
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,270
kids explore the world out of curiosity
and

2876
00:48:49,270 --> 00:48:49,280
and
 

2877
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,910

curiosity and
i don't care about the labels that i

2882
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:54,400
i don't care about the labels that i
 

2883
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,990
i don't care about the labels that i
have in fact

2884
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:56,000
have in fact
 

2885
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,230
have in fact
having tenure is is exactly the

2886
00:48:58,230 --> 00:48:58,240
having tenure is is exactly the
 

2887
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,430
having tenure is is exactly the
opportunity to

something bad happens to these kids when
 

2915
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,510
something bad happens to these kids when
they become tenured professors

2916
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:27,520
they become tenured professors
 

2917
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,750
they become tenured professors
they start to worry about their ego yeah

2918
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:29,760
they start to worry about their ego yeah
 

2919
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,790
they start to worry about their ego yeah
and about themselves

2920
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:30,800
and about themselves
 

2921
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,430
and about themselves
more than about the purpose of science

2922
00:49:33,430 --> 00:49:33,440
more than about the purpose of science
 

2923
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:34,150
more than about the purpose of science
which is

2924
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,160
which is
 

2925
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,309
which is
you know curiosity driven figuring out

2926
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
you know curiosity driven figuring out
 

2927
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,630
you know curiosity driven figuring out
from evidence evidence is the key

2928
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:38,640
from evidence evidence is the key
 

2929
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,670
from evidence evidence is the key
so when an object shows anomalies like

2930
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:41,680
so when an object shows anomalies like
 

2931
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,309
so when an object shows anomalies like
what's the problem discussing you know

2932
00:49:44,309 --> 00:49:44,319
what's the problem discussing you know
 

2933
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,910
what's the problem discussing you know
whether it's artificial or not

2934
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:45,920
whether it's artificial or not
 

2935
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,349
whether it's artificial or not
you know so there was i should tell you

2936
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:47,359
you know so there was i should tell you
 

2937
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,270
you know so there was i should tell you
there was a mainstream

2938
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:49,280
there was a mainstream
 

2939
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,390
there was a mainstream
paper in nature published saying it must

2940
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:52,400

uh you know through experiments and
 

3123
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,829
uh you know through experiments and
experiments really are key it's not just

the nuance
 

3127
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,630

this life sinned
 

3249
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,030
this life sinned
okay and if that life sinned on planets

3250
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:15,040
okay and if that life sinned on planets

3266
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:33,200
it was about that's okay i'm just like
 

3267
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,630
it was about that's okay i'm just like
loading this all in because that's kind

3268
00:55:34,630 --> 00:55:34,640
loading this all in because that's kind
 

3269
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:35,589
loading this all in because that's kind
of brilliant

3270
00:55:35,589 --> 00:55:35,599
of brilliant
 

3271
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,430
of brilliant
so he he was actually already into it's

3272
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:37,440
so he he was actually already into it's
 

3273
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:38,630
so he he was actually already into it's
not just about the stars it's

3274
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:38,640
not just about the stars it's
 

3275
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,069
not just about the stars it's
anticipating that there could be other

3276
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:40,079
anticipating that there could be other
 

3277
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:41,109
anticipating that there could be other
life forms yeah

3278
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:41,119
life forms yeah
 

3279
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,670
life forms yeah
like why if this star if there's other

3280
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
like why if this star if there's other
 

3281
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:44,630
like why if this star if there's other
stars

3282
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:44,640
stars
 

3283
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,710
stars
why would it be special why would our

3284
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:46,720
why would it be special why would our
 

3285
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:47,750
why would it be special why would our
star be special

3286
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:47,760
star be special
 

3287
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,430
star be special
he was making the right argument and he

3288
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:49,440
he was making the right argument and he
 

3289
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,030
he was making the right argument and he
would just follow that

3290
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:51,040
would just follow that
 

3291
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,630
would just follow that
all along to say like there should be

3292
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:52,640
all along to say like there should be
 

3293
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,470
all along to say like there should be
other earth like

3294
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:54,480
other earth like
 

3295
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,309
other earth like
places there should be other life and

3296
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
places there should be other life and
 

3297
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,630
places there should be other life and
then there's different copies of christ

3298
00:55:58,630 --> 00:55:58,640
then there's different copies of christ
 

3299
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:01,430
then there's different copies of christ
yes so that was offensive so i said i

3300
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:01,440
yes so that was offensive so i said i
 

3301
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:03,030
yes so that was offensive so i said i
said to that um

3302
00:56:03,030 --> 00:56:03,040
said to that um
 

3303
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,950
said to that um
i said to that professor i said great

3304
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:04,960
i said to that professor i said great
 

3305
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,630
i said to that professor i said great
you know i wanted to introduce some

3306
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
you know i wanted to introduce some
 

3307
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,270
you know i wanted to introduce some
scientific tone to the discussion

3308
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:09,280
scientific tone to the discussion
 

3309
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,910
scientific tone to the discussion
and i said this is great because now you

3310
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:11,920
and i said this is great because now you
 

3311
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,670
and i said this is great because now you
basically laid the foundation for an

3312
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:13,680
basically laid the foundation for an
 

3313
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,230
basically laid the foundation for an
experimental test of this theology

3314
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:16,240
experimental test of this theology
 

3315
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,950
experimental test of this theology
what is the test we now know that other

3316
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:18,960
what is the test we now know that other
 

3317
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,630
what is the test we now know that other
stars are like the sun

3318
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:20,640
stars are like the sun
 

3319
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,230
stars are like the sun
and we know they have planets like the

3320
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:22,240
and we know they have planets like the
 

3321
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,309
and we know they have planets like the
earth around them so suppose we find

3322
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:24,319
earth around them so suppose we find
 

3323
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,430
earth around them so suppose we find
life there

3324
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:25,440
life there
 

3325
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,630
life there
and we figure out that they sinned

3326
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:28,640
and we figure out that they sinned
 

3327
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,390
and we figure out that they sinned
then we ask them did you witness christ

3328
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:32,400
then we ask them did you witness christ
 

3329
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:35,030
then we ask them did you witness christ
and if they say no it means that this

3330
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:35,040
and if they say no it means that this
 

3331
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,470
and if they say no it means that this
this theology

3332
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:36,480
this theology
 

3333
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,109
this theology
is ruled out so there is an experimental

3334
00:56:39,109 --> 00:56:39,119
is ruled out so there is an experimental
 

3335
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:40,549
is ruled out so there is an experimental
test so this is experimental test number

3336
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
test so this is experimental test number
 

3337
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,190
test so this is experimental test number
one

3338
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:41,200
one
 

3339
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:45,589
one
another experimental test you know

3340
00:56:45,589 --> 00:56:45,599

 

3341
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,270

in the bible you know in the old

3342
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:47,280
in the bible you know in the old
 

3343
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,349
in the bible you know in the old
testament abraham

3344
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:49,359
testament abraham
 

3345
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:53,109
testament abraham
uh was heard the voice

3346
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
uh was heard the voice
 

3347
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,470
uh was heard the voice
the voice of god to sacrifice

3348
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:56,480
the voice of god to sacrifice
 

3349
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,470
the voice of god to sacrifice
his son right only son and

3350
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:00,480
his son right only son and
 

3351
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,030
his son right only son and
that's what the story says now suppose

3352
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:03,040
that's what the story says now suppose
 

3353
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:03,910
that's what the story says now suppose
abraham

3354
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:03,920
abraham
 

3355
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,670
abraham
my name by the way had a voice memo

3356
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:07,680
my name by the way had a voice memo
 

3357
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,309
my name by the way had a voice memo
up on his cell phone yes he could have

3358
00:57:10,309 --> 00:57:10,319
up on his cell phone yes he could have
 

3359
00:57:10,319 --> 00:57:11,349
up on his cell phone yes he could have
pressed this up

3360
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:11,359
pressed this up
 

3361
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,069
pressed this up
and recorded the voice of god and that

3362
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:14,079
and recorded the voice of god and that
 

3363
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:15,910
and recorded the voice of god and that
would have been experimental evidence

3364
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
would have been experimental evidence
 

3365
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,589
would have been experimental evidence
that god exists

3366
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599
that god exists
 

3367
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,630
that god exists
right fortunately he didn't but

3368
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:20,640
right fortunately he didn't but
 

3369
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,430
right fortunately he didn't but
it's an experimental test right there is

3370
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
it's an experimental test right there is
 

3371
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,430
it's an experimental test right there is
a third example i should tell

3372
00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:25,440
a third example i should tell
 

3373
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:28,470
a third example i should tell
and that is elie wiesel attributed this

3374
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:28,480
and that is elie wiesel attributed this
 

3375
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,069
and that is elie wiesel attributed this
story to martin buber

3376
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
story to martin buber
 

3377
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,430
story to martin buber
but it's not clear whether it's true or

3378
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:31,440
but it's not clear whether it's true or
 

3379
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,710
but it's not clear whether it's true or
not at any event the story goes that

3380
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:34,720
not at any event the story goes that
 

3381
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,549
not at any event the story goes that
martin buber you know he was a

3382
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
martin buber you know he was a
 

3383
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,710
martin buber you know he was a
philosopher and he said

3384
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:38,720
philosopher and he said
 

3385
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,910
philosopher and he said
you know the christians argue that jesus

3386
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:41,920
you know the christians argue that jesus
 

3387
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:42,390
you know the christians argue that jesus
you know the

3388
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:42,400
you know the
 

3389
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,589
you know the
the messiah arrived already

3390
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:45,599
the messiah arrived already
 

3391
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,150
the messiah arrived already
and will come back again in the future

3392
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:48,160
and will come back again in the future
 

3393
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,190
and will come back again in the future
the jews

3394
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:49,200
the jews
 

3395
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,309
the jews
argue the messiah never came

3396
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
argue the messiah never came
 

3397
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,750
argue the messiah never came
and will arrive in the future so he said

3398
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:55,760
and will arrive in the future so he said
 

3399
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:59,270
and will arrive in the future so he said
why argue both sides agree

3400
00:57:59,270 --> 00:57:59,280
why argue both sides agree
 

3401
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,950
why argue both sides agree
that the messiah will arrive in the

3402
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
that the messiah will arrive in the
 

3403
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,309
that the messiah will arrive in the
future

3404
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
future
 

3405
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:04,789
future
when the messiah arrives we can ask

3406
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:04,799
when the messiah arrives we can ask
 

3407
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:05,510
when the messiah arrives we can ask
whether

3408
00:58:05,510 --> 00:58:05,520
whether
 

3409
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,109
whether
he or she came before you know like

3410
00:58:09,109 --> 00:58:09,119
he or she came before you know like
 

3411
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,510
he or she came before you know like
visited us and then figure it out and

3412
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
visited us and then figure it out and
 

3413
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,230
visited us and then figure it out and
one side

3414
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:12,240
one side
 

3415
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,630
one side
so again experimental test of a theology

3416
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,640
so again experimental test of a theology
 

3417
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:15,270
so again experimental test of a theology
yes so

3418
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:15,280
yes so
 

3419
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,470
yes so
even theology if it puts

3420
00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:18,480
even theology if it puts
 

3421
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,309
even theology if it puts
a skin in the game you know if it makes

3422
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:20,319
a skin in the game you know if it makes
 

3423
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:22,069
a skin in the game you know if it makes
a prediction could be tested

3424
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:22,079
a prediction could be tested
 

3425
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,349
a prediction could be tested
right so why can't string theories test

3426
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:25,359
right so why can't string theories test
 

3427
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,549
right so why can't string theories test
themselves or why can't

3428

01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:24,319
that would cost
 

3605
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:28,390
that would cost
billions of dollars and whose goal is to

billions of dollars and whose goal is to

billions of dollars and whose goal is to
find

find
 

3609
01:01:29,359 --> 01:01:32,470
find
evidence for oxygen in the atmosphere of

but we know that a planet can have life

3644
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:09,599
but we know that a planet can have life
 

3645

but we know that a planet can have life
without oxygen in the atmosphere because

without oxygen in the atmosphere because

the second problem with this approach is
that you can have oxygen from natural

you can break water molecules and make
 

3657
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,510
you can break water molecules and make
oxygen right so even if you find it

3658
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
oxygen right so even if you find it
 

3659
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:26,069

and
 

3711
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,029
and
i asked you why hilarious because that's

3712
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:19,039
i asked you why hilarious because that's
 

3713
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,670
i asked you why hilarious because that's

i mean that's what you're saying is
 

3717
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,589
i mean that's what you're saying is
quite brilliant i mean uh

3718
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:23,599
quite brilliant i mean uh
 

3719
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:26,390
quite brilliant i mean uh
because it's a really strong signal and

3720
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:26,400
because it's a really strong signal and
 

3721
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:26,789
because it's a really strong signal and
if

3722
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
if
 

3723
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,789
if
life if there's alien civilizations out

01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:28,799
life if there's alien civilizations out
 

3725
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,589
life if there's alien civilizations out
there then they're probably going to be

3726
01:03:31,589 --> 01:03:31,599
there then they're probably going to be
 

3727
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,430
there then they're probably going to be
many of them and they're probably going

01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:33,440
many of them and they're probably going
 

3729
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,190
many of them and they're probably going
to be more advanced than us

to be more advanced than us
and they're probably going to have

01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
and they're probably going to have
 

3733
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,589
and they're probably going to have
something like industrial pollution

3734
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:37,599
something like industrial pollution
 

3735
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,190
something like industrial pollution
which would be a much stronger signal

3736
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
which would be a much stronger signal
 

3737
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:39,829
which would be a much stronger signal
than

3738
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
than
 

3739
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:43,190
than
some basic gas which could have a lot of

3740
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:43,200
some basic gas which could have a lot of
 

3741
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,150
some basic gas which could have a lot of
different explanations

3742
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:44,160
different explanations
 

3743
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:46,630
different explanations
so like somebody like oxygen or i mean i

3744
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,640
so like somebody like oxygen or i mean i
 

3745
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:48,390
so like somebody like oxygen or i mean i
don't

3746
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:48,400
don't
 

3747
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,549
don't
you know uh i mean we could talk about

3748
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:50,559
you know uh i mean we could talk about
 

3749
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:52,710
you know uh i mean we could talk about
signs of life on venus and so on

3750
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:52,720
signs of life on venus and so on
 

3751
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,109
signs of life on venus and so on
but like if you want a strong signal it

3752
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:55,119
but like if you want a strong signal it
 

3753
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:55,750
but like if you want a strong signal it
would be

3754
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:55,760
would be
 

3755

because if they're close enough they

3906

because if they're close enough they
 

3907
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,109
because if they're close enough they
would move the star back and forth and

3908
01:06:37,109 --> 01:06:37,119
would move the star back and forth and
 

3909
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:38,470
would move the star back and forth and
we can detect the signal

we can detect the signal
yes okay and so astronomers

know why jupiter

3920
01:06:51,270 --> 01:06:51,280
know why jupiter
 

3921
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,829
know why jupiter
resides so far from the sun you cannot

3922
01:06:53,829 --> 01:06:53,839
resides so far from the sun you cannot
 

3923
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,589
resides so far from the sun you cannot
have jupiter so close because

3924
01:06:55,589 --> 01:06:55,599
have jupiter so close because
 

3925
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,069
have jupiter so close because
there is this region where ice forms far

3926
01:06:58,069 --> 01:06:58,079
there is this region where ice forms far
 

3927
01:06:58,079 --> 01:06:59,109
there is this region where ice forms far
from the sun

3928
01:06:59,109 --> 01:06:59,119
from the sun
 

3929
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,630
from the sun
and beyond that region is where

3930
01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:00,640
and beyond that region is where
 

3931
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,390
and beyond that region is where
jupiter-like planets can form

3932
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:02,400
jupiter-like planets can form
 

3933
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,390
jupiter-like planets can form
there was a theory behind it which ended

3934
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:04,400
there was a theory behind it which ended
 

3935
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,069
there was a theory behind it which ended
up being wrong by now by today's

3936
01:07:06,069 --> 01:07:06,079
up being wrong by now by today's
 

3937
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:07,109
up being wrong by now by today's
standards but yes

3938
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:07,119
standards but yes
 

3939
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,829
standards but yes
anyway they did not give time on

3940
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:09,839
anyway they did not give time on
 

3941
01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:11,270
anyway they did not give time on
telescopes to search for

3942
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:11,280
telescopes to search for
 

3943
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,910
telescopes to search for
such systems until the first system was

3944
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:13,920
such systems until the first system was
 

3945
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:14,789
such systems until the first system was
discovered

3946
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:14,799
discovered
 

3947
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,430
discovered
four decades after otto struve's paper

3948
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
four decades after otto struve's paper
 

3949
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,069
four decades after otto struve's paper
and the nobel prize was awarded to that

3950
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
and the nobel prize was awarded to that
 

3951
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,710
and the nobel prize was awarded to that
just a couple of years ago yeah and you

3952
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:22,720
just a couple of years ago yeah and you
 

3953
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,150
just a couple of years ago yeah and you
ask yourself okay so

3954
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
ask yourself okay so
 

3955
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,069
ask yourself okay so
you know science still made progress

3956
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
you know science still made progress
 

3957
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,349
you know science still made progress
what's the problem

3958
01:07:27,349 --> 01:07:27,359
what's the problem
 

3959
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,630
what's the problem
the problem is that this baby came out

3960
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:30,640
the problem is that this baby came out
 

3961
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:32,470
the problem is that this baby came out
barely you know and and there was a

3962
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:32,480
barely you know and and there was a
 

3963
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,390
barely you know and and there was a
delay of four decades

3964
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400
delay of four decades
 

3965
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,950
delay of four decades
so the progress was delayed and i wonder

3966
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
so the progress was delayed and i wonder
 

3967
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,710
so the progress was delayed and i wonder
how many babies were not born

3968
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
how many babies were not born
 

3969
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,549
how many babies were not born
because of this resistance so there must

3970
01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:40,559
because of this resistance so there must
 

3971
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:41,990
because of this resistance so there must
be ideas that are as good

3972
01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:42,000
be ideas that are as good
 

3973
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,069
be ideas that are as good
as this one that were suppressed because

3974
01:07:44,069 --> 01:07:44,079
as this one that were suppressed because
 

3975
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,750
as this one that were suppressed because
they were bullied because

3976
01:07:45,750 --> 01:07:45,760
they were bullied because
 

3977
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,029
they were bullied because
uh people ridiculed them

3978
01:07:49,029 --> 01:07:49,039
uh people ridiculed them
 

3979
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,190
uh people ridiculed them
that were actually good ideas and we

3980
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:51,200
that were actually good ideas and we
 

3981
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,870
that were actually good ideas and we
these are missed opportunities babies

3982
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
these are missed opportunities babies
 

3983
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,069
these are missed opportunities babies
that were never born

3984
01:07:54,069 --> 01:07:54,079
that were never born
 

3985
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,109
that were never born
yes and you know i'm willing to push

3986
01:07:57,109 --> 01:07:57,119
yes and you know i'm willing to push
 

3987
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,870
yes and you know i'm willing to push
this frontier of the search for

3988
01:07:58,870 --> 01:07:58,880
this frontier of the search for
 

3989
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:00,150
this frontier of the search for
technologies or

3990
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:00,160
technologies or
 

3991
01:08:00,160 --> 01:08:01,430
technologies or
technological signatures of other

3992
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,440
technological signatures of other
 

3993
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,510
technological signatures of other
civilizations because you know when i

3994
01:08:03,510 --> 01:08:03,520
civilizations because you know when i
 

3995
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:06,069
civilizations because you know when i
was young i was in the military

3996
01:08:06,069 --> 01:08:06,079
was young i was in the military
 

3997
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,109
was young i was in the military
in israel it's obligatory to serve and

3998
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
in israel it's obligatory to serve and
 

3999
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,870
in israel it's obligatory to serve and
there was this saying that you know one

4000
01:08:10,870 --> 01:08:10,880
there was this saying that you know one
 

4001
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:12,549
there was this saying that you know one
of the soldiers sometimes

4002
01:08:12,549 --> 01:08:12,559
of the soldiers sometimes
 

4003
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:15,670
of the soldiers sometimes
has to put his body on the barbed wire

4004
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:15,680
has to put his body on the barbed wire
 

4005
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:18,950
has to put his body on the barbed wire
so that others can go through and

4006
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:18,960
so that others can go through and
 

4007
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,669
so that others can go through and
i'm willing to suffer the pain so that

4008
01:08:21,669 --> 01:08:21,679
i'm willing to suffer the pain so that
 

4009
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:23,430
i'm willing to suffer the pain so that
you know younger people

4010
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:23,440
you know younger people
 

4011
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,110
you know younger people
in the future will be able to speak

4012
01:08:25,110 --> 01:08:25,120
in the future will be able to speak
 

4013
01:08:25,120 --> 01:08:27,189
in the future will be able to speak
freely about the possibility that some

4014
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:27,199
freely about the possibility that some
 

4015
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,110
freely about the possibility that some
of the anomalies we find in the sky

4016
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:29,120
of the anomalies we find in the sky
 

4017
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,590
of the anomalies we find in the sky
yes are due to technological signatures

4018
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
yes are due to technological signatures
 

4019
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,149
yes are due to technological signatures
and it's quite

4020
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:32,159
and it's quite
 

4021
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:34,390
and it's quite
obvious this is why i like like folks in

4022
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:34,400
obvious this is why i like like folks in
 

4023
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:35,910
obvious this is why i like like folks in
the artificial intelligence space

4024
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:35,920
the artificial intelligence space
 

4025
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,709
the artificial intelligence space
elon musk and a few others speak about

4026
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:38,719
elon musk and a few others speak about
 

4027
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:39,269
elon musk and a few others speak about
this

4028
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:39,279
this
 

4029
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:41,430
this
and they look at the long arc they say

4030
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:41,440
and they look at the long arc they say
 

4031
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:42,630
and they look at the long arc they say
like what

4032
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
like what
 

4033
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,709
like what
you know this kind of you know you can

4034
01:08:44,709 --> 01:08:44,719
you know this kind of you know you can
 

4035
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:46,390
you know this kind of you know you can
call it like first principles thinking

4036
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:46,400
call it like first principles thinking
 

4037
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:48,070
call it like first principles thinking
or you can call anything

4038
01:08:48,070 --> 01:08:48,080
or you can call anything
 

4039
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,030
or you can call anything
really is like if we just zoom off from

4040
01:08:51,030 --> 01:08:51,040
really is like if we just zoom off from
 

4041
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:51,669
really is like if we just zoom off from
our

4042
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:51,679
our
 

4043
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,870
our
current bickering and our current like

4044
01:08:54,870 --> 01:08:54,880
current bickering and our current like
 

4045
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,030
current bickering and our current like
discussions in the what science is doing

4046
01:08:57,030 --> 01:08:57,040
discussions in the what science is doing
 

4047
01:08:57,040 --> 01:08:57,349
discussions in the what science is doing
and

4048
01:08:57,349 --> 01:08:57,359
and
 

4049
01:08:57,359 --> 01:08:59,269
and
look at the long arc of the trajectory

4050
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
look at the long arc of the trajectory
 

4051
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:00,630
look at the long arc of the trajectory
we're headed at

4052
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:00,640
we're headed at
 

4053
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,910
we're headed at
which questions are obviously

4054
01:09:03,910 --> 01:09:03,920
which questions are obviously
 

4055
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,269
which questions are obviously
fundamental

4056
01:09:05,269 --> 01:09:05,279
fundamental
 

4057
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:07,749
fundamental
to science and it should be asked and

4058
01:09:07,749 --> 01:09:07,759
to science and it should be asked and
 

4059
01:09:07,759 --> 01:09:09,590
to science and it should be asked and
which is the space of hypotheses we

4060
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:09,600
which is the space of hypotheses we
 

4061
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:10,550
which is the space of hypotheses we
should be exploring

4062
01:09:10,550 --> 01:09:10,560
should be exploring
 

4063
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,229
should be exploring
and like exoplanets is a really good

4064
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:12,239
and like exoplanets is a really good
 

4065
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:14,390
and like exoplanets is a really good
example of one that was like

4066
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:14,400
example of one that was like
 

4067
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,709
example of one that was like
an obvious one i recently talked to

4068
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:16,719
an obvious one i recently talked to
 

4069
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:17,669
an obvious one i recently talked to
sarah seeger

4070
01:09:17,669 --> 01:09:17,679
sarah seeger
 

4071
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:19,189
sarah seeger
and it was very taboo when she was

4072
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
and it was very taboo when she was
 

4073
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:21,030
and it was very taboo when she was
starting out to work on an exoplanet and

4074
01:09:21,030 --> 01:09:21,040
starting out to work on an exoplanet and
 

4075
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,550
starting out to work on an exoplanet and
that was even in the 90s

4076
01:09:22,550 --> 01:09:22,560
that was even in the 90s
 

4077
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,149
that was even in the 90s
yeah and uh like it's obvious

4078
01:09:26,149 --> 01:09:26,159
yeah and uh like it's obvious
 

4079
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:28,309
yeah and uh like it's obvious
should not be a taboo subject and to me

4080
01:09:28,309 --> 01:09:28,319
should not be a taboo subject and to me
 

4081
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,070
should not be a taboo subject and to me
i mean i'm probably ignorant but

4082
01:09:30,070 --> 01:09:30,080
i mean i'm probably ignorant but
 

4083
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,070
i mean i'm probably ignorant but
to me exoplanets seems like it's

4084
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:32,080
to me exoplanets seems like it's
 

4085
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:33,910
to me exoplanets seems like it's
ridiculous that that would ever be a

4086
01:09:33,910 --> 01:09:33,920
ridiculous that that would ever be a
 

4087
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,030
ridiculous that that would ever be a
taboo subject

4088
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:35,040
taboo subject
 

4089
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:38,070
taboo subject
right to not fund to not explore that's

4090
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
right to not fund to not explore that's
 

4091
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:38,630
right to not fund to not explore that's
very

4092
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:38,640
very
 

4093
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,669
very
but even for her it's now taboo to say

4094
01:09:43,669 --> 01:09:43,679
but even for her it's now taboo to say
 

4095
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,309
but even for her it's now taboo to say
like what you know to to look for

4096
01:09:46,309 --> 01:09:46,319
like what you know to to look for
 

4097
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:47,510
like what you know to to look for
industrial pollution

4098
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:47,520
industrial pollution
 

4099
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,430
industrial pollution
right right it's like i find that

4100
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:49,440
right right it's like i find that
 

4101
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,030
right right it's like i find that
ridiculous i'll tell you why

4102
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:51,040
ridiculous i'll tell you why
 

4103
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:52,870
ridiculous i'll tell you why
you take the next step it's ridiculous

4104
01:09:52,870 --> 01:09:52,880
you take the next step it's ridiculous
 

4105
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:55,270
you take the next step it's ridiculous
for another reason yes not because

4106
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:55,280
for another reason yes not because
 

4107
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:56,950
for another reason yes not because
of just the scientific benefits that we

4108
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
of just the scientific benefits that we
 

4109
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,709
of just the scientific benefits that we
might have by exploring it

4110
01:09:58,709 --> 01:09:58,719
might have by exploring it
 

4111
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:01,189
might have by exploring it
but because the public cares about these

4112
01:10:01,189 --> 01:10:01,199
but because the public cares about these
 

4113
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:01,750
but because the public cares about these
questions

4114
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
questions
 

4115
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,790
questions
yes and the public funds science

4116
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,800
yes and the public funds science
 

4117
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,669
yes and the public funds science
so how dare the scientists yes shy away

4118
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
so how dare the scientists yes shy away
 

4119
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:09,350
so how dare the scientists yes shy away
from addressing these questions

4120
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:09,360
from addressing these questions
 

4121
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:12,790
from addressing these questions
if they have the technology to do it

4122
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:12,800
if they have the technology to do it
 

4123
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,709
if they have the technology to do it
it's like saying i don't want to look

4124
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
it's like saying i don't want to look
 

4125
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:15,990
it's like saying i don't want to look
through galileo's telescope

4126
01:10:15,990 --> 01:10:16,000
through galileo's telescope
 

4127
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,510
through galileo's telescope
it's exactly the same you have the

4128
01:10:17,510 --> 01:10:17,520
it's exactly the same you have the
 

4129
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,590
it's exactly the same you have the
technology to explore this question

4130
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:19,600
technology to explore this question
 

4131
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,229
technology to explore this question
to find evidence and you shy away from

4132
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:22,239
to find evidence and you shy away from
 

4133
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:22,790
to find evidence and you shy away from
it

4134
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
it
 

4135
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,950
it
you might ask why do people shy away

4136
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
you might ask why do people shy away
 

4137
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:25,830
you might ask why do people shy away
from it yes

4138
01:10:25,830 --> 01:10:25,840
from it yes
 

4139
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,669
from it yes
and perhaps it's because of the fact

4140
01:10:27,669 --> 01:10:27,679
and perhaps it's because of the fact
 

4141
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:29,350
and perhaps it's because of the fact
that there is science fiction i i'm not

4142
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:29,360
that there is science fiction i i'm not
 

4143
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,790
that there is science fiction i i'm not
a fan of science fiction

4144
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:30,800
a fan of science fiction
 

4145
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,270
a fan of science fiction
because it has an element to it that

4146
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:33,280
because it has an element to it that
 

4147
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:35,110
because it has an element to it that
violates the laws of physics in many of

4148
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
violates the laws of physics in many of
 

4149
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,070
violates the laws of physics in many of
the books and

4150
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:36,080
the books and
 

4151
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,189
the books and
and the films and i cannot enjoy the

4152
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
and the films and i cannot enjoy the
 

4153
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,550
and the films and i cannot enjoy the
these things when i see the laws of

4154
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:40,560
these things when i see the laws of
 

4155
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,310
these things when i see the laws of
physics violated but

4156
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
physics violated but
 

4157
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,390
physics violated but
who cares that the you know the fact

4158
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:44,400
who cares that the you know the fact
 

4159
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:46,630
who cares that the you know the fact
that there is science fiction i mean if

4160
01:10:46,630 --> 01:10:46,640
that there is science fiction i mean if
 

4161
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,470
that there is science fiction i mean if
if you have the scientific methodology

4162
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:48,480
if you have the scientific methodology
 

4163
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,630
if you have the scientific methodology
to address the same subject

4164
01:10:50,630 --> 01:10:50,640
to address the same subject
 

4165
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,790
to address the same subject
i don't care that other people uh you

4166
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:52,800
i don't care that other people uh you
 

4167
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,950
i don't care that other people uh you
know spoke nonsense about this subject

4168
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
know spoke nonsense about this subject
 

4169
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,870
know spoke nonsense about this subject
or said things that make no sense who

4170
01:10:56,870 --> 01:10:56,880
or said things that make no sense who
 

4171
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:59,270
or said things that make no sense who
cares you do your scientific work

4172
01:10:59,270 --> 01:10:59,280
cares you do your scientific work
 

4173
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,830
cares you do your scientific work
just like you explore the dark matter

4174
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:01,840
just like you explore the dark matter
 

4175
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,790
just like you explore the dark matter
you explore the possibility that umuamua

4176
01:11:04,790 --> 01:11:04,800
you explore the possibility that umuamua
 

4177
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:06,950
you explore the possibility that umuamua
is an artifact you just look for

4178
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:06,960
is an artifact you just look for
 

4179
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:07,910
is an artifact you just look for
evidence

4180
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:07,920
evidence
 

4181
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,310
evidence
and try to deduce uh what what it means

4182
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:12,320
and try to deduce uh what what it means
 

4183
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:14,950
and try to deduce uh what what it means
and i have no problem with doing that to

4184
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:14,960
and i have no problem with doing that to
 

4185
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:16,550
and i have no problem with doing that to
me it sounds like any other scientific

4186
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:16,560
me it sounds like any other scientific
 

4187
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:17,590
me it sounds like any other scientific
question that we have

4188
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
question that we have
 

4189
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,510
question that we have
and given the public's interest we have

4190
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:19,520
and given the public's interest we have
 

4191
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,350
and given the public's interest we have
an obligation to do that

4192
01:11:21,350 --> 01:11:21,360
an obligation to do that
 

4193
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,149
an obligation to do that
by the way science to me is not an

4194
01:11:24,149 --> 01:11:24,159
by the way science to me is not an
 

4195
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,590
by the way science to me is not an
occupation of the elite

4196
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:25,600
occupation of the elite
 

4197
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,669
occupation of the elite
it doesn't allow me to feel superior to

4198
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
it doesn't allow me to feel superior to
 

4199
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,189
it doesn't allow me to feel superior to
other humans that are unable to

4200
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:29,199
other humans that are unable to
 

4201
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:30,950
other humans that are unable to
understand the math

4202
01:11:30,950 --> 01:11:30,960
understand the math
 

4203
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:33,189
understand the math
to me it's a it's a way of life you know

4204
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:33,199
to me it's a it's a way of life you know
 

4205
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,189
to me it's a it's a way of life you know
if there is a problem in the faucet or

4206
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:35,199
if there is a problem in the faucet or
 

4207
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,709
if there is a problem in the faucet or
in the pipe

4208
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:36,719
in the pipe
 

4209
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,790
in the pipe
at home i try to figure out what the

4210
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:38,800
at home i try to figure out what the
 

4211
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:39,750
at home i try to figure out what the
problem is and

4212
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:39,760
problem is and
 

4213
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,149
problem is and
with a plumber we figure it out and you

4214
01:11:42,149 --> 01:11:42,159
with a plumber we figure it out and you
 

4215
01:11:42,159 --> 01:11:43,669
with a plumber we figure it out and you
know we look at the clues and

4216
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
know we look at the clues and
 

4217
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:45,830
know we look at the clues and
the same thing in science you know you

4218
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
the same thing in science you know you
 

4219
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,350
the same thing in science you know you
look at the evidence you try to figure

4220
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
look at the evidence you try to figure
 

4221
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:48,630
look at the evidence you try to figure
out what it means

4222
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:48,640
out what it means
 

4223
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,630
out what it means
it's it's common sense in a way and

4224
01:11:52,630 --> 01:11:52,640
it's it's common sense in a way and
 

4225
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,709
it's it's common sense in a way and
it shouldn't be regarded as something

4226
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:54,719
it shouldn't be regarded as something
 

4227
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:56,310
it shouldn't be regarded as something
removed from the public

4228
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
removed from the public
 

4229
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,590
removed from the public
it should be a reflection of the

4230
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:57,600
it should be a reflection of the
 

4231
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,430
it should be a reflection of the
public's interest and

4232
01:11:59,430 --> 01:11:59,440
public's interest and
 

4233
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,590
public's interest and
i think it's actually a crime to resist

4234
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:01,600
i think it's actually a crime to resist
 

4235
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,630
i think it's actually a crime to resist
the public

4236
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:02,640
the public
 

4237
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,270
the public
if the public says i care about this and

4238
01:12:05,270 --> 01:12:05,280
if the public says i care about this and
 

4239
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:07,030
if the public says i care about this and
you say no no that's not sophisticated

that out of those hundreds of thousands

4324
01:13:41,510 --> 01:13:41,520
that out of those hundreds of thousands
 

4325
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:44,830
that out of those hundreds of thousands
of ufo sightings

4326
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:44,840

 

4327
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,590

one is an actual one

4328
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:47,600
one is an actual one
 

4329
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,790
one is an actual one
or some number is an actual sighting of

some alien technology and that we're not
 

4335
01:13:55,840 --> 01:14:01,030
some alien technology and that we're not
um we did not we're too close-minded

4336
01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:01,040
um we did not we're too close-minded
 

4337
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,149
um we did not we're too close-minded
to uh to look and to see

4338
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
to uh to look and to see
 

4339
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,709
to uh to look and to see
i think to answer this question we need

4340
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:06,719
i think to answer this question we need
 

4341
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,270
i think to answer this question we need
better

4342
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:07,280
better
 

4343
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:10,870
better
evidence my starting point

4344
01:14:10,870 --> 01:14:10,880
evidence my starting point
 

4345
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,950
evidence my starting point
as i said out of modesty is that we are

4346
01:14:12,950 --> 01:14:12,960
as i said out of modesty is that we are
 

4347
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:15,510
as i said out of modesty is that we are
not particularly interesting

4348
01:14:15,510 --> 01:14:15,520
not particularly interesting
 

4349
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,270
not particularly interesting
and therefore i would agree i would be

4350
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
and therefore i would agree i would be
 

4351
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,350
and therefore i would agree i would be
hard-pressed to imagine that someone

4352
01:14:19,350 --> 01:14:19,360
hard-pressed to imagine that someone
 

4353
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:21,510
hard-pressed to imagine that someone
wants to really spy on us

4354
01:14:21,510 --> 01:14:21,520
wants to really spy on us
 

4355
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,390
wants to really spy on us
uh so i would think you know as a

4356
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:24,400
uh so i would think you know as a
 

4357
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:25,590
uh so i would think you know as a
starting point that

4358
01:14:25,590 --> 01:14:25,600
starting point that
 

4359
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:27,270
starting point that
we don't deserve attention and we

4360
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:27,280
we don't deserve attention and we
 

4361
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:28,870
we don't deserve attention and we
shouldn't expect

4362
01:14:28,870 --> 01:14:28,880
shouldn't expect
 

4363
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,830
shouldn't expect
someone but who knows now the problem

4364
01:14:31,830 --> 01:14:31,840
someone but who knows now the problem
 

4365
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,390
someone but who knows now the problem
that i have with ufo citing reports

4366
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:34,400
that i have with ufo citing reports
 

4367
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,110
that i have with ufo citing reports
is that you know 50 years ago there were

4368
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,120
is that you know 50 years ago there were
 

4369
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,110
is that you know 50 years ago there were
some reports of fuzzy images you know

4370
01:14:39,110 --> 01:14:39,120
some reports of fuzzy images you know
 

4371
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,149
some reports of fuzzy images you know
sorcerer-like

4372
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:40,159
sorcerer-like
 

4373
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:43,510
sorcerer-like
things uh by now our

4374
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:43,520
things uh by now our
 

4375
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:45,510
things uh by now our
technologies are much better our cameras

4376
01:14:45,510 --> 01:14:45,520
technologies are much better our cameras
 

4377
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,990
technologies are much better our cameras
are much more sensitive

4378
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,000
are much more sensitive
 

4379
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:49,990
are much more sensitive
these fuzzy images should have turned

4380
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,000
these fuzzy images should have turned
 

4381
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,030
these fuzzy images should have turned
into crisp

4382
01:14:51,030 --> 01:14:51,040
into crisp
 

4383
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:53,910
into crisp
clear images of things that we are

4384
01:14:53,910 --> 01:14:53,920
clear images of things that we are
 

4385
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,270
clear images of things that we are
confident about

4386
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:55,280
confident about
 

4387
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,750
confident about
and they haven't turned that way it's

4388
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:57,760
and they haven't turned that way it's
 

4389
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,030
and they haven't turned that way it's
always on the borderline of

4390
01:14:59,030 --> 01:14:59,040
always on the borderline of
 

4391
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:00,229
always on the borderline of
believability

4392
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
believability
 

4393
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,910
believability
and because of that i believe that it

4394
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:01,920
and because of that i believe that it
 

4395
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,430
and because of that i believe that it
might be most likely

4396
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
might be most likely
 

4397
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,590
might be most likely
artifacts of our instruments or some

4398
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:05,600
artifacts of our instruments or some
 

4399
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:06,870
artifacts of our instruments or some
natural phenomena

4400
01:15:06,870 --> 01:15:06,880
natural phenomena
 

4401
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,350
natural phenomena
that we are unable to understand now of

that we are unable to understand now of
course the reason you should you need

4404
01:15:10,709 --> 01:15:10,719
course the reason you should you need
 

4405
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,430
course the reason you should you need
you must

4406
01:15:11,430 --> 01:15:11,440
you must
 

4407
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,790
you must
examine those if for example pilots

4408
01:15:14,790 --> 01:15:14,800
examine those if for example pilots
 

4409
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:16,709
examine those if for example pilots
report about them or

4410
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
report about them or
 

4411
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,830
report about them or
uh the military finds evidence for them

4412
01:15:19,830 --> 01:15:19,840
uh the military finds evidence for them
 

4413
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,750
uh the military finds evidence for them
is because it may pose a national

01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:21,760
is because it may pose a national
 

4415
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:23,750
is because it may pose a national
security threat if another country has

security threat if another country has
technologies

4418
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:24,560
technologies
 

4419
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,550
technologies
that we don't know about and they're

4420
01:15:26,550 --> 01:15:26,560
that we don't know about and they're
 

4421
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,790
that we don't know about and they're
spying on us we need to know about it

4422
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:28,800
spying on us we need to know about it
 

4423
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,229
spying on us we need to know about it
and therefore we should examine

4424
01:15:30,229 --> 01:15:30,239
and therefore we should examine
 

4425
01:15:30,239 --> 01:15:31,990
and therefore we should examine
everything that looks unusual

4426
01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:32,000
everything that looks unusual
 

4427
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,110
everything that looks unusual
but to associate it with an alien

4428
01:15:35,110 --> 01:15:35,120
but to associate it with an alien
 

4429
01:15:35,120 --> 01:15:38,950
but to associate it with an alien
life is a little too far for me

4430
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:38,960
life is a little too far for me
 

4431
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:42,550
life is a little too far for me
until we have evidence that stands up to

4432
01:15:42,550 --> 01:15:42,560
until we have evidence that stands up to
 

4433
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,229
until we have evidence that stands up to
the level of scientific

4434
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
the level of scientific
 

4435
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:46,790
the level of scientific
credence you know that that we are a

4436
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:46,800
credence you know that that we are a
 

4437
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,390
credence you know that that we are a
hundred percent sure

hundred percent sure
 

4439
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:50,709
hundred percent sure
that you know from multiple detectors

4440
01:15:50,709 --> 01:15:50,719
that you know from multiple detectors
 

4441
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,229
that you know from multiple detectors
and you know

4442
01:15:52,229 --> 01:15:52,239
and you know
 

4443
01:15:52,239 --> 01:15:54,470
and you know
through a scientific process now again

4444
01:15:54,470 --> 01:15:54,480
through a scientific process now again
 

4445
01:15:54,480 --> 01:15:56,390
through a scientific process now again
if the scientific community shies away

4446
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
if the scientific community shies away
 

4447
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:57,830
if the scientific community shies away
from these reports

4448
01:15:57,830 --> 01:15:57,840
from these reports
 

4449
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,390
from these reports
we will never have that it's like saying

4450
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:00,400
we will never have that it's like saying
 

4451
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,510
we will never have that it's like saying
i don't want to

4452
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:01,520
i don't want to
 

4453
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,590
i don't want to
take photographs of something because i

4454
01:16:03,590 --> 01:16:03,600
take photographs of something because i
 

4455
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:04,950
take photographs of something because i
know what it is

4456
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:04,960
know what it is
 

4457
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,669
know what it is
then you will never know what it is but

4458
01:16:07,669 --> 01:16:07,679
then you will never know what it is but
 

4459
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:08,550
then you will never know what it is but
i think if

4460
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:08,560
i think if
 

4461
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,390
i think if
if some scientist if grants let's put it

4462
01:16:10,390 --> 01:16:10,400
if some scientist if grants let's put it
 

4463
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,070
if some scientist if grants let's put it
this way if funding will be given to

4464
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:12,080
this way if funding will be given to
 

4465
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,750
this way if funding will be given to
scientists

4466
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:13,760
scientists
 

4467
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,870
scientists
to follow on some of these reports and

4468
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:16,880
to follow on some of these reports and
 

4469
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:18,630
to follow on some of these reports and
use scientific instruments

4470
01:16:18,630 --> 01:16:18,640
use scientific instruments
 

4471
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,030
use scientific instruments
that are capable of detecting those

4472
01:16:21,030 --> 01:16:21,040
that are capable of detecting those
 

4473
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,229
that are capable of detecting those
sightings

4474
01:16:22,229 --> 01:16:22,239
sightings
 

4475
01:16:22,239 --> 01:16:24,149
sightings
with much better resolution with much

4476
01:16:24,149 --> 01:16:24,159
with much better resolution with much
 

4477
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:25,510
with much better resolution with much
better information

4478
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:25,520
better information
 

4479
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:26,870
better information
that would be great because it will

4480
01:16:26,870 --> 01:16:26,880
that would be great because it will
 

4481
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:28,709
that would be great because it will
clarify the matter you know these are

4482
01:16:28,709 --> 01:16:28,719
clarify the matter you know these are
 

4483
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:29,510
clarify the matter you know these are
not

4484
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
not
 

4485
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,030
not
as you said you know hundreds of

4486
01:16:31,030 --> 01:16:31,040
as you said you know hundreds of
 

4487
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,390
as you said you know hundreds of
thousands these are not

4488
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:32,400
thousands these are not
 

4489
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,229
thousands these are not
once-in-a-lifetime events

4490
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:34,239
once-in-a-lifetime events
 

4491
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,229
once-in-a-lifetime events
so it's possible to take scientific

4492
01:16:36,229 --> 01:16:36,239
so it's possible to take scientific
 

4493
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:37,430
so it's possible to take scientific
instrumentation

4494
01:16:37,430 --> 01:16:37,440
instrumentation
 

4495
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:40,790
instrumentation
and explore go to the ocean where the

4496
01:16:40,790 --> 01:16:40,800
and explore go to the ocean where the
 

4497
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,470
and explore go to the ocean where the
you know someone reported that there are

4498
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:42,480
you know someone reported that there are
 

4499
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:45,189
you know someone reported that there are
frequent events that are unusual

4500
01:16:45,189 --> 01:16:45,199
frequent events that are unusual
 

4501
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:47,830
frequent events that are unusual
and check it out yeah do a scientific

4502
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:47,840
and check it out yeah do a scientific
 

4503
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:49,270
and check it out yeah do a scientific
experiment what's the problem why not

4504
01:16:49,270 --> 01:16:49,280
experiment what's the problem why not
 

4505
01:16:49,280 --> 01:16:51,350
experiment what's the problem why not
why only do experiments deep into the

4506
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
why only do experiments deep into the
 

4507
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,630
why only do experiments deep into the
ocean and look at the

4508
01:16:53,630 --> 01:16:53,640
ocean and look at the
 

4509
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:56,470
ocean and look at the
oceanography or do other things you know

4510
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
oceanography or do other things you know
 

4511
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,470
oceanography or do other things you know
we can do scientific investigation of

4512
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:58,480
we can do scientific investigation of
 

4513
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,350
we can do scientific investigation of
these

4514
01:16:59,350 --> 01:16:59,360
these
 

4515
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:01,910
these
sightings and figure out what what they

4516
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:01,920
sightings and figure out what what they
 

4517
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:02,470
sightings and figure out what what they
mean

4518
01:17:02,470 --> 01:17:02,480
mean
 

4519
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:04,709
mean
uh i'm very much in favor of that uh but

4520
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:04,719
uh i'm very much in favor of that uh but
 

4521
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,149
uh i'm very much in favor of that uh but
until we have the evidence

4522
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:06,159
until we have the evidence
 

4523
01:17:06,159 --> 01:17:08,070
until we have the evidence
i would be doubtful as to what they

4524
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
i would be doubtful as to what they
 

4525
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,270
i would be doubtful as to what they
actually mean

4526
01:17:09,270 --> 01:17:09,280
actually mean
 

4527
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:11,669
actually mean
yeah we have to be humble and uh and

4528
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:11,679
yeah we have to be humble and uh and
 

4529
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:12,870
yeah we have to be humble and uh and
acknowledge that we're not that

4530
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:12,880
acknowledge that we're not that
 

4531
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,149
acknowledge that we're not that
interesting

4532
01:17:14,149 --> 01:17:14,159
interesting
 

4533
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:15,910
interesting
it's kind of you're making me realize

4534
01:17:15,910 --> 01:17:15,920
it's kind of you're making me realize
 

4535
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,669
it's kind of you're making me realize
that because it's so taboo that the

4536
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:17,679
that because it's so taboo that the
 

4537
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:19,830
that because it's so taboo that the
people that have the equipment

4538
01:17:19,830 --> 01:17:19,840
people that have the equipment
 

4539
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:22,149
people that have the equipment
uh meaning and when i was just talking

4540
01:17:22,149 --> 01:17:22,159
uh meaning and when i was just talking
 

4541
01:17:22,159 --> 01:17:24,229
uh meaning and when i was just talking
everybody has cameras now

4542
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
everybody has cameras now
 

4543
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:27,830
everybody has cameras now
but to have a large-scale like uh

4544
01:17:27,830 --> 01:17:27,840
but to have a large-scale like uh
 

4545
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:30,950
but to have a large-scale like uh
sensor right network that collects

4546
01:17:30,950 --> 01:17:30,960
sensor right network that collects
 

4547
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:32,790
sensor right network that collects
data regularly collects just like we

4548
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
data regularly collects just like we
 

4549
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,390
data regularly collects just like we
look at the weather we're collecting

4550
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:34,400
look at the weather we're collecting
 

4551
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,189
look at the weather we're collecting
information

4552
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:35,199
information
 

4553
01:17:35,199 --> 01:17:37,030
information
and then we can then x that information

4554
01:17:37,030 --> 01:17:37,040
and then we can then x that information
 

4555
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,470
and then we can then x that information
when there is reports

4556
01:17:38,470 --> 01:17:38,480
when there is reports
 

4557
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:40,630
when there is reports
and like have it not be a taboo thing

4558
01:17:40,630 --> 01:17:40,640
and like have it not be a taboo thing
 

4559
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:42,550
and like have it not be a taboo thing
where there's like millions or billions

4560
01:17:42,550 --> 01:17:42,560
where there's like millions or billions
 

4561
01:17:42,560 --> 01:17:44,550
where there's like millions or billions
of dollars funding this effort

4562
01:17:44,550 --> 01:17:44,560
of dollars funding this effort
 

4563
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,070
of dollars funding this effort
that by the way inspires

4564
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
that by the way inspires
 

4565
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:50,390
that by the way inspires
millions of people this is exactly what

4566
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:50,400
millions of people this is exactly what
 

4567
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,669
millions of people this is exactly what
you're talking about it's like

4568
01:17:51,669 --> 01:17:51,679
you're talking about it's like
 

4569
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:54,470
you're talking about it's like
it's uh the scientific community is

4570
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
it's uh the scientific community is
 

4571
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:57,030
it's uh the scientific community is
afraid of a topic that inspires millions

4572
01:17:57,030 --> 01:17:57,040
afraid of a topic that inspires millions
 

4573
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:58,550
afraid of a topic that inspires millions
of people exactly it's absurd

4574
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
of people exactly it's absurd
 

4575
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:01,350
of people exactly it's absurd
but if you put blinders on your eyes you

4576
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:01,360
but if you put blinders on your eyes you
 

4577
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,470
but if you put blinders on your eyes you
don't see it yeah

4578
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:02,480
don't see it yeah
 

4579
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:05,270
don't see it yeah
right i should say that we do have

4580
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
right i should say that we do have
 

4581
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,790
right i should say that we do have
meteors that we see

4582
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:06,800
meteors that we see
 

4583
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:09,669
meteors that we see
these are rocks that by chance happen to

4584
01:18:09,669 --> 01:18:09,679
these are rocks that by chance happen to
 

4585
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:11,510
these are rocks that by chance happen to
collide with the earth

4586
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:11,520
collide with the earth
 

4587
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,990
collide with the earth
and they if they're small they burn up

4588
01:18:13,990 --> 01:18:14,000
and they if they're small they burn up
 

4589
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,430
and they if they're small they burn up
in the atmosphere but

4590
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:15,440
in the atmosphere but
 

4591
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,149
in the atmosphere but
if they're big enough uh tens of meters

4592
01:18:18,149 --> 01:18:18,159
if they're big enough uh tens of meters
 

4593
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,030
if they're big enough uh tens of meters
or more

4594
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:19,040
or more
 

4595
01:18:19,040 --> 01:18:22,470
or more
hundreds of meters the outer layer burns

4596
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:22,480
hundreds of meters the outer layer burns
 

4597
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,470
hundreds of meters the outer layer burns
up but then the core of the

4598
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:24,480
up but then the core of the
 

4599
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,990
up but then the core of the
object makes it through and this is our

4600
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
object makes it through and this is our
 

4601
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:28,550
object makes it through and this is our
chance

4602
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:28,560
chance
 

4603
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,669
chance
of putting our hands around an object

4604
01:18:31,669 --> 01:18:31,679
of putting our hands around an object
 

4605
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,910
of putting our hands around an object
if this meteor came from interstellar

4606
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:33,920
if this meteor came from interstellar
 

4607
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:35,030
if this meteor came from interstellar
space so

4608
01:18:35,030 --> 01:18:35,040
space so
 

4609
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:38,790
space so
one path of discovery is to search for

4610
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:38,800
one path of discovery is to search for
 

4611
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,430
one path of discovery is to search for
interstellar meteors and with the

4612
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:41,440
interstellar meteors and with the
 

4613
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:43,189
interstellar meteors and with the
student of mine we actually looked

4614
01:18:43,189 --> 01:18:43,199
student of mine we actually looked
 

4615
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:44,390
student of mine we actually looked
through the record and

4616
01:18:44,390 --> 01:18:44,400
through the record and
 

4617
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:46,550
through the record and
we thought that we found one example of

4618
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:46,560
we thought that we found one example of
 

4619
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,390
we thought that we found one example of
a meteor that was reported

4620
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:48,400
a meteor that was reported
 

4621
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,110
a meteor that was reported
that might have come from interstellar

4622
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:51,120
that might have come from interstellar
 

4623
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:51,910
that might have come from interstellar
space

4624
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:51,920
space
 

4625
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,189
space
and another approach is for example to

4626
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:55,199
and another approach is for example to
 

4627
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:56,470
and another approach is for example to
look at the moon

4628
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,480
look at the moon
 

4629
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:58,310
look at the moon
the moon is different from the earth in

4630
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,320
the moon is different from the earth in
 

4631
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,510
the moon is different from the earth in
the sense that it doesn't have an

4632
01:18:59,510 --> 01:18:59,520
the sense that it doesn't have an
 

4633
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:00,470
the sense that it doesn't have an
atmosphere

4634
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:00,480
atmosphere
 

4635
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,669
atmosphere
so objects do not burn up on their way

4636
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
so objects do not burn up on their way
 

4637
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,669
so objects do not burn up on their way
to it it's sort of like a museum it

4638
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
to it it's sort of like a museum it
 

4639
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,270
to it it's sort of like a museum it
collects everything that kind of rocks

4640
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:07,280
collects everything that kind of rocks
 

4641
01:19:07,280 --> 01:19:08,310
collects everything that kind of rocks
from out there

4642
01:19:08,310 --> 01:19:08,320
from out there
 

4643
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,830
from out there
deep space yeah and there is no

4644
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:09,840
deep space yeah and there is no
 

4645
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,750
deep space yeah and there is no
geological activity on the moon

4646
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:11,760
geological activity on the moon
 

4647
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,310
geological activity on the moon
so on earth every 100 million years you

4648
01:19:14,310 --> 01:19:14,320
so on earth every 100 million years you
 

4649
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,350
so on earth every 100 million years you
know we could have had

4650
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
know we could have had
 

4651
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,510
know we could have had
computer terminals on earth that could

4652
01:19:17,510 --> 01:19:17,520
computer terminals on earth that could
 

4653
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:19,910
computer terminals on earth that could
have been a civilization like ours

4654
01:19:19,910 --> 01:19:19,920
have been a civilization like ours
 

4655
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:22,390
have been a civilization like ours
with electronic equipment yes more than

4656
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
with electronic equipment yes more than
 

4657
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,149
with electronic equipment yes more than
100 million years ago

4658
01:19:24,149 --> 01:19:24,159
100 million years ago
 

4659
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,149
100 million years ago
and it's completely lost you cannot

4660
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:26,159
and it's completely lost you cannot
 

4661
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:27,910
and it's completely lost you cannot
excavate and find the

4662
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
excavate and find the
 

4663
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,189
excavate and find the
evidence for it because in

4664
01:19:29,189 --> 01:19:29,199
evidence for it because in
 

4665
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:31,750
evidence for it because in
archaeological digs because the earth

4666
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:31,760
archaeological digs because the earth
 

4667
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,630
archaeological digs because the earth
is being mixed on these time scales and

4668
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:34,640
is being mixed on these time scales and
 

4669
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:36,390
is being mixed on these time scales and
everything that was on the surface more

4670
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
everything that was on the surface more
 

4671
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,830
everything that was on the surface more
than 100 million years ago

4672
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:37,840
than 100 million years ago
 

4673
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:39,750
than 100 million years ago
is buried deep inside the earth right

4674
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
is buried deep inside the earth right
 

4675
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,030
is buried deep inside the earth right
now because of geological activity

4676
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
now because of geological activity
 

4677
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,470
now because of geological activity
fascinating you think about by the way

4678
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:42,480
fascinating you think about by the way
 

4679
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:42,790
fascinating you think about by the way
yeah

4680
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:42,800
yeah
 

4681
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,350
yeah
but on the moon this doesn't happen the

4682
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:45,360
but on the moon this doesn't happen the
 

4683
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,110
but on the moon this doesn't happen the
only thing that happens on the moon is

4684
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
only thing that happens on the moon is
 

4685
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,070
only thing that happens on the moon is
you have objects impacting the moon and

4686
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
you have objects impacting the moon and
 

4687
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:50,630
you have objects impacting the moon and
they go

4688
01:19:50,630 --> 01:19:50,640
they go
 

4689
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,430
they go
10 meters deep so they produce some dust

4690
01:19:53,430 --> 01:19:53,440
10 meters deep so they produce some dust
 

4691
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:53,830
10 meters deep so they produce some dust
but

4692
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:53,840
but
 

4693
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:55,270
but
the moon keeps everything it's like a

4694
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:55,280
the moon keeps everything it's like a
 

4695
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,550
the moon keeps everything it's like a
museum it keeps everything on the

4696
01:19:56,550 --> 01:19:56,560
museum it keeps everything on the
 

4697
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:57,110
museum it keeps everything on the
surface

4698
01:19:57,110 --> 01:19:57,120
surface
 

4699
01:19:57,120 --> 01:20:00,550
surface
so if we go to the moon i would highly

4700
01:20:00,550 --> 01:20:00,560
so if we go to the moon i would highly
 

4701
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,470
so if we go to the moon i would highly
recommend regarding it as an

4702
01:20:02,470 --> 01:20:02,480
recommend regarding it as an
 

4703
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:03,669
recommend regarding it as an
archaeological

4704
01:20:03,669 --> 01:20:03,679
archaeological
 

4705
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:06,550
archaeological
site yes and looking for objects that

4706
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
site yes and looking for objects that
 

4707
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,430
site yes and looking for objects that
are strange

4708
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:07,440
are strange
 

4709
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,669
are strange
maybe it collected some trash you know

4710
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
maybe it collected some trash you know
 

4711
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,270
maybe it collected some trash you know
from interstellar space

4712
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
from interstellar space
 

4713
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,950
from interstellar space
if we could just linger on the on the

4714
01:20:12,950 --> 01:20:12,960
if we could just linger on the on the
 

4715
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:14,950
if we could just linger on the on the
drake equation for a little bit

4716
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:14,960
drake equation for a little bit
 

4717
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,709
drake equation for a little bit
we kind of talked about there's a lot of

4718
01:20:16,709 --> 01:20:16,719
we kind of talked about there's a lot of
 

4719
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:18,709
we kind of talked about there's a lot of
uncertainty in the parameters

4720
01:20:18,709 --> 01:20:18,719
uncertainty in the parameters
 

4721
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:21,910
uncertainty in the parameters
and and our and in the drake equation

4722
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:21,920
and and our and in the drake equation
 

4723
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,070
and and our and in the drake equation
itself is very limited

4724
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:24,080
itself is very limited
 

4725
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:25,750
itself is very limited
but i think the parameters are

4726
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:25,760
but i think the parameters are
 

4727
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:27,189
but i think the parameters are
interesting in themselves

4728
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
interesting in themselves
 

4729
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:29,270
interesting in themselves
even if it's limited because i think

4730
01:20:29,270 --> 01:20:29,280
even if it's limited because i think
 

4731
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,110
even if it's limited because i think
each one is within the reach of science

4732
01:20:31,110 --> 01:20:31,120
each one is within the reach of science
 

4733
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,430
each one is within the reach of science
right right did you get the evidence for

4734
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:33,440
right right did you get the evidence for
 

4735
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,390
right right did you get the evidence for
uh i mean

4736
01:20:34,390 --> 01:20:34,400
uh i mean
 

4737
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:36,390
uh i mean
one a few i find really interesting

4738
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400
one a few i find really interesting
 

4739
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,590
one a few i find really interesting
could be

4740
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
could be
 

4741
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:40,229
could be
interesting to get your comment on uh so

4742
01:20:40,229 --> 01:20:40,239
interesting to get your comment on uh so
 

4743
01:20:40,239 --> 01:20:41,189
interesting to get your comment on uh so
the one with the most

4744
01:20:41,189 --> 01:20:41,199
the one with the most
 

4745
01:20:41,199 --> 01:20:43,830
the one with the most
variance i i would say from my

4746
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
variance i i would say from my
 

4747
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:45,030
variance i i would say from my
perspective is the

4748
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:45,040
perspective is the
 

4749
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,750
perspective is the
length that civilizations last however

4750
01:20:47,750 --> 01:20:47,760
length that civilizations last however
 

4751
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:49,830
length that civilizations last however
you define it and the drake equation is

4752
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:49,840
you define it and the drake equation is
 

4753
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,189
you define it and the drake equation is
the length of how long you're

4754
01:20:51,189 --> 01:20:51,199
the length of how long you're
 

4755
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,950
the length of how long you're
communicating yeah just like

4756
01:20:52,950 --> 01:20:52,960
communicating yeah just like
 

4757
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,950
communicating yeah just like
transmitting just like you said that

4758
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
transmitting just like you said that
 

4759
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,470
transmitting just like you said that
that might that's a

4760
01:20:56,470 --> 01:20:56,480
that might that's a
 

4761
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,990
that might that's a
wrong way to think about it because we

4762
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:58,000
wrong way to think about it because we
 

4763
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,070
wrong way to think about it because we
can be detecting some other outputs of

4764
01:21:00,070 --> 01:21:00,080
can be detecting some other outputs of
 

4765
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:01,510
can be detecting some other outputs of
the civilizations etc

4766
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:01,520
the civilizations etc
 

4767
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,830
the civilizations etc
but just if we just define broadly how

4768
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:03,840
but just if we just define broadly how
 

4769
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,070
but just if we just define broadly how
long those civilizations last

4770
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:06,080
long those civilizations last
 

4771
01:21:06,080 --> 01:21:09,270
long those civilizations last
do you have a sense of uh how long

4772
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:09,280
do you have a sense of uh how long
 

4773
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,750
do you have a sense of uh how long
that might last like what what are the

4774
01:21:11,750 --> 01:21:11,760
that might last like what what are the
 

4775
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,669
that might last like what what are the
great filters that might destroy

4776
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
great filters that might destroy
 

4777
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:15,669
great filters that might destroy
civilizations that we should be thinking

4778
01:21:15,669 --> 01:21:15,679
civilizations that we should be thinking
 

4779
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:16,790
civilizations that we should be thinking
about what uh

4780
01:21:16,790 --> 01:21:16,800
about what uh
 

4781
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,830
about what uh
yeah is in and what it how can science

4782
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:19,840
yeah is in and what it how can science
 

4783
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:20,950
yeah is in and what it how can science
give us more hints

4784
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:20,960
give us more hints
 

4785
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:23,990
give us more hints
on this topic so i as i mentioned before

4786
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:24,000
on this topic so i as i mentioned before
 

4787
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,310
on this topic so i as i mentioned before
operate by the copernican principle

4788
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:26,320
operate by the copernican principle
 

4789
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,189
operate by the copernican principle
meaning that

4790
01:21:27,189 --> 01:21:27,199
meaning that
 

4791
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:29,110
meaning that
you know we are not special we don't

4792
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:29,120
you know we are not special we don't
 

4793
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,189
you know we are not special we don't
live in a special place

4794
01:21:31,189 --> 01:21:31,199
live in a special place
 

4795
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,229
live in a special place
and not in a special time and by the way

4796
01:21:34,229 --> 01:21:34,239
and not in a special time and by the way
 

4797
01:21:34,239 --> 01:21:37,189
and not in a special time and by the way
it's just modesty encapsulated in

4798
01:21:37,189 --> 01:21:37,199
it's just modesty encapsulated in
 

4799
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:38,149
it's just modesty encapsulated in
scientific terms

4800
01:21:38,149 --> 01:21:38,159
scientific terms
 

4801
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:40,390
scientific terms
yes right you're saying i'm not special

4802
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
yes right you're saying i'm not special
 

4803
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,149
yes right you're saying i'm not special
you know i find conditions here

4804
01:21:42,149 --> 01:21:42,159
you know i find conditions here
 

4805
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:45,110
you know i find conditions here
they exist everywhere so if you adapt

4806
01:21:45,110 --> 01:21:45,120
they exist everywhere so if you adapt
 

4807
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:47,510
they exist everywhere so if you adapt
the copernican principle

4808
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:47,520
the copernican principle
 

4809
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,709
the copernican principle
you basically say our civilization

4810
01:21:50,709 --> 01:21:50,719
you basically say our civilization
 

4811
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,870
you basically say our civilization
transmitted radio signals for

4812
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:52,880
transmitted radio signals for
 

4813
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:56,629
transmitted radio signals for
100 years roughly so

4814
01:21:56,629 --> 01:21:56,639
100 years roughly so
 

4815
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:58,229
100 years roughly so
probably it would last another hundred

4816
01:21:58,229 --> 01:21:58,239
probably it would last another hundred
 

4817
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:00,470
probably it would last another hundred
or few hundred and that's it

4818
01:22:00,470 --> 01:22:00,480
or few hundred and that's it
 

4819
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:03,430
or few hundred and that's it
because we don't live at a special time

4820
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:03,440
because we don't live at a special time
 

4821
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,709
because we don't live at a special time
so that's

4822
01:22:04,709 --> 01:22:04,719
so that's
 

4823
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,110
so that's
you know well of course if we get our

4824
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,120
you know well of course if we get our
 

4825
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:08,950
you know well of course if we get our
act together

4826
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:08,960
act together
 

4827
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:11,510
act together
and we somehow start to cooperate rather

4828
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:11,520
and we somehow start to cooperate rather
 

4829
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:13,350
and we somehow start to cooperate rather
than fighting each other

4830
01:22:13,350 --> 01:22:13,360
than fighting each other
 

4831
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:15,669
than fighting each other
killing each other you know wasting a

4832
01:22:15,669 --> 01:22:15,679
killing each other you know wasting a
 

4833
01:22:15,679 --> 01:22:17,510
killing each other you know wasting a
lot of resources

4834
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:17,520
lot of resources
 

4835
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,270
lot of resources
on things that would destroy our planet

4836
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:21,280
on things that would destroy our planet
 

4837
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,750
on things that would destroy our planet
maybe we can lengthen that period if we

4838
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:23,760
maybe we can lengthen that period if we
 

4839
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:24,950
maybe we can lengthen that period if we
get smarter

4840
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:24,960
get smarter
 

4841
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:28,310
get smarter
but the the most natural assumption is

4842
01:22:28,310 --> 01:22:28,320
but the the most natural assumption is
 

4843
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,189
but the the most natural assumption is
to say

4844
01:22:29,189 --> 01:22:29,199
to say
 

4845
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,030
to say
that we would live into the future as

4846
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:31,040
that we would live into the future as
 

4847
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,629
that we would live into the future as
much as we lived

much as we lived
 

4849

from the time that we start to develop

because there was a report about

because there was a report about

okay i was like yeah okay so it's no

4892
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:12,719
okay i was like yeah okay so it's no
 

4893
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:13,189
okay i was like yeah okay so it's no
human

4894
01:23:13,189 --> 01:23:13,199
human
 

4895
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:15,830
human
created noise yeah which is always the

4896
01:23:15,830 --> 01:23:15,840
created noise yeah which is always the
 

4897
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,390
created noise yeah which is always the
worry

4898
01:23:16,390 --> 01:23:16,400
worry
 

4899
01:23:16,400 --> 01:23:18,149
worry
because actually the same observatory

4900
01:23:18,149 --> 01:23:18,159
because actually the same observatory
 

4901
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,990
because actually the same observatory
the parks observatory

4902
01:23:19,990 --> 01:23:20,000
the parks observatory
 

4903
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,070
the parks observatory
uh detected a couple of years ago some

4904
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:22,080
uh detected a couple of years ago some
 

4905
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,350
uh detected a couple of years ago some
signal

4906
01:23:23,350 --> 01:23:23,360
signal
 

4907
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:25,270
signal
and then they realized that it comes

4908
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:25,280
and then they realized that it comes
 

4909
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:26,390
and then they realized that it comes
back

4910
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
back
 

4911
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:29,510
back
at lunch lunch time yes and they said

4912
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:29,520
at lunch lunch time yes and they said
 

4913
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:30,790
at lunch lunch time yes and they said
okay what could it be and then they

4914
01:23:30,790 --> 01:23:30,800
okay what could it be and then they
 

4915
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:32,229
okay what could it be and then they
figured out that it must be the

4916
01:23:32,229 --> 01:23:32,239
figured out that it must be the
 

4917
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:33,910
figured out that it must be the
microwave oven in the observatory

4918
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:33,920
microwave oven in the observatory
 

4919
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,629
microwave oven in the observatory
because

4920
01:23:34,629 --> 01:23:34,639
because
 

4921
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:36,790
because
someone was opening it before it

4922
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:36,800
someone was opening it before it
 

4923
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,110
someone was opening it before it
finished and it was creating this radio

4924
01:23:39,110 --> 01:23:39,120
finished and it was creating this radio
 

4925
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:39,750
finished and it was creating this radio
signal

4926
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
signal
 

4927
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:41,590
signal
that they detected with the telescope

4928
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:41,600
that they detected with the telescope
 

4929
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,030
that they detected with the telescope
every lunch time

4930
01:23:43,030 --> 01:23:43,040
every lunch time
 

4931
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:46,070
every lunch time
uh so just a cautionary remark

4932
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:46,080
uh so just a cautionary remark
 

4933
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:49,189
uh so just a cautionary remark
but the reason i think it's human-made

4934
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:49,199
but the reason i think it's human-made
 

4935
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,510
but the reason i think it's human-made
without getting to the technical details

4936
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
without getting to the technical details
 

4937
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:52,709
without getting to the technical details
is because

4938
01:23:52,709 --> 01:23:52,719
is because
 

4939
01:23:52,719 --> 01:23:55,189
is because
of this very short window by which we

4940
01:23:55,189 --> 01:23:55,199
of this very short window by which we
 

4941
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:57,030
of this very short window by which we
were transmitting radio signals out of

4942
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:57,040
were transmitting radio signals out of
 

4943
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,310
were transmitting radio signals out of
the lifetime of the earth

4944
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
the lifetime of the earth
 

4945
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:01,110
the lifetime of the earth
you know as i said 100 years out of four

4946
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:01,120
you know as i said 100 years out of four
 

4947
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:01,669
you know as i said 100 years out of four
and a half

4948
01:24:01,669 --> 01:24:01,679
and a half
 

4949
01:24:01,679 --> 01:24:03,910
and a half
billion years that the earth existed so

4950
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:03,920
billion years that the earth existed so
 

4951
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:05,350
billion years that the earth existed so
what's the chance that another

4952
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:05,360
what's the chance that another
 

4953
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:08,229
what's the chance that another
civilization a twin civilization of ours

4954
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:08,239
civilization a twin civilization of ours
 

4955
01:24:08,239 --> 01:24:10,709
civilization a twin civilization of ours
is transmitting radio signals exactly at

4956
01:24:10,709 --> 01:24:10,719
is transmitting radio signals exactly at
 

4957
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:12,470
is transmitting radio signals exactly at
the time that we are looking

4958
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:12,480
the time that we are looking
 

4959
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:15,430
the time that we are looking
with our radio telescopes yeah ten to

4960
01:24:15,430 --> 01:24:15,440
with our radio telescopes yeah ten to
 

4961
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,550
with our radio telescopes yeah ten to
the minus

4962
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:16,560
the minus
 

4963
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:18,870
the minus
seven you know so and the other the

4964
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:18,880
seven you know so and the other the
 

4965
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:20,470
seven you know so and the other the
other argument i have that is

4966
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:20,480
other argument i have that is
 

4967
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,510
other argument i have that is
uh is that they detected it in a very

4968
01:24:23,510 --> 01:24:23,520
uh is that they detected it in a very
 

4969
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,229
uh is that they detected it in a very
narrow band of frequencies and that

4970
01:24:26,229 --> 01:24:26,239
narrow band of frequencies and that
 

4971
01:24:26,239 --> 01:24:27,350
narrow band of frequencies and that
makes it

4972
01:24:27,350 --> 01:24:27,360
makes it
 

4973
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,030
makes it
i'm not you know it cannot be through

4974
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
i'm not you know it cannot be through
 

4975
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:30,390
i'm not you know it cannot be through
natural processes

4976
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:30,400
natural processes
 

4977
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:33,669
natural processes
a very narrow band just like some

4978
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:33,679
a very narrow band just like some
 

4979
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:37,110
a very narrow band just like some
radio transmissions that we produce

4980
01:24:37,110 --> 01:24:37,120
radio transmissions that we produce
 

4981
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,590
radio transmissions that we produce
but if it were to come from the

4982
01:24:39,590 --> 01:24:39,600
but if it were to come from the
 

4983
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,750
but if it were to come from the
habitable zone from a transmitter on the

4984
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:41,760
habitable zone from a transmitter on the
 

4985
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,350
habitable zone from a transmitter on the
surface of proxima b

4986
01:24:43,350 --> 01:24:43,360
surface of proxima b
 

4987
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,590
surface of proxima b
this is the planet that orbits proxima

4988
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
this is the planet that orbits proxima
 

4989
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:46,870
this is the planet that orbits proxima
centauri

4990
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:46,880
centauri
 

4991
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,709
centauri
then i calculated that the frequency

4992
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
then i calculated that the frequency
 

4993
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,470
then i calculated that the frequency
would drift

4994
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:50,480
would drift
 

4995
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:52,149
would drift
through the doppler effect you know just

4996
01:24:52,149 --> 01:24:52,159
through the doppler effect you know just
 

4997
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:54,709
through the doppler effect you know just
like when you hear a siren

4998
01:24:54,709 --> 01:24:54,719
like when you hear a siren
 

4999
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:56,629
like when you hear a siren
uh on the street you know when the car

5000
01:24:56,629 --> 01:24:56,639
uh on the street you know when the car
 

5001
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:59,350
uh on the street you know when the car
approaches you it has a different pitch

5002
01:24:59,350 --> 01:24:59,360
approaches you it has a different pitch
 

5003
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,270
approaches you it has a different pitch
than when it goes recedes away from you

5004
01:25:01,270 --> 01:25:01,280
than when it goes recedes away from you
 

5005
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:02,950
than when it goes recedes away from you
that's the doppler effect

5006
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
that's the doppler effect
 

5007
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,590
that's the doppler effect
and when the planet orbits the star

5008
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:05,600
and when the planet orbits the star
 

5009
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,110
and when the planet orbits the star
proxima centauri

5010
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:07,120
proxima centauri
 

5011
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:10,470
proxima centauri
you would see or detect a different

5012
01:25:10,470 --> 01:25:10,480
you would see or detect a different
 

5013
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,550
you would see or detect a different
frequency when the planet approaches us

5014
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:12,560
frequency when the planet approaches us
 

5015
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,550
frequency when the planet approaches us
as compared to when it recedes so there

5016
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
as compared to when it recedes so there
 

5017
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,550
as compared to when it recedes so there
should be a frequency drift

5018
01:25:16,550 --> 01:25:16,560
should be a frequency drift
 

5019
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,070
should be a frequency drift
just because of the motion of the planet

5020
01:25:20,070 --> 01:25:20,080
just because of the motion of the planet
 

5021
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,790
just because of the motion of the planet
and i calculated that it it it must be

5022
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:22,800
and i calculated that it it it must be
 

5023
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:24,629
and i calculated that it it it must be
much bigger than

5024
01:25:24,629 --> 01:25:24,639
much bigger than
 

5025
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,510
much bigger than
then observed so it cannot just be a

5026
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:27,520
then observed so it cannot just be a
 

5027
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,189
then observed so it cannot just be a
transmitter sitting on the planet

5028
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:29,199
transmitter sitting on the planet
 

5029
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,870
transmitter sitting on the planet
and sending another direction a radio

5030
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:30,880
and sending another direction a radio
 

5031
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,790
and sending another direction a radio
signal unless they want

5032
01:25:32,790 --> 01:25:32,800
signal unless they want
 

5033
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,070
signal unless they want
to cancel the doppler effect but then

5034
01:25:36,070 --> 01:25:36,080
to cancel the doppler effect but then
 

5035
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:37,270
to cancel the doppler effect but then
they need to know about

5036
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
they need to know about
 

5037
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,030
they need to know about
us because in a different direction it

5038
01:25:39,030 --> 01:25:39,040
us because in a different direction it
 

5039
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,310
us because in a different direction it
will not be canceled only in our

5040
01:25:40,310 --> 01:25:40,320
will not be canceled only in our
 

5041
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:41,669
will not be canceled only in our
direction they can cancel it

5042
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:41,679
direction they can cancel it
 

5043
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:44,950
direction they can cancel it
perfectly so there is

5044
01:25:44,950 --> 01:25:44,960
perfectly so there is
 

5045
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,070
perfectly so there is
this direction of proxima centauri but

5046
01:25:48,070 --> 01:25:48,080
this direction of proxima centauri but
 

5047
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:50,390
this direction of proxima centauri but
i have a problem imagining a transmitter

5048
01:25:50,390 --> 01:25:50,400
i have a problem imagining a transmitter
 

5049
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:51,350
i have a problem imagining a transmitter
on the surface

5050
01:25:51,350 --> 01:25:51,360
on the surface
 

5051
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:53,189
on the surface
of a planet in the habitable zone

5052
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:53,199
of a planet in the habitable zone
 

5053
01:25:53,199 --> 01:25:55,350
of a planet in the habitable zone
emitting it

5054
01:25:55,350 --> 01:25:55,360
emitting it
 

5055
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:58,070
emitting it
but my main issue is really with the

5056
01:25:58,070 --> 01:25:58,080
but my main issue is really with the
 

5057
01:25:58,080 --> 01:25:59,510
but my main issue is really with the
likelihood

5058
01:25:59,510 --> 01:25:59,520
likelihood
 

5059
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:02,070
likelihood
given what we know about ourselves right

5060
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,080
given what we know about ourselves right
 

5061
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:03,430
given what we know about ourselves right
in terms of the durations the

5062
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:03,440
in terms of the durations the
 

5063
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:06,950
in terms of the durations the
civilization the copernican principle

5064
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:06,960

 

5065
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:08,709

so nevertheless this particular signal

5066
01:26:08,709 --> 01:26:08,719
so nevertheless this particular signal
 

5067
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:10,950
so nevertheless this particular signal
is likely to be uh human interference

5068
01:26:10,950 --> 01:26:10,960
is likely to be uh human interference
 

5069
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:11,830
is likely to be uh human interference
perhaps but

5070
01:26:11,830 --> 01:26:11,840
perhaps but
 

5071
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,189
perhaps but
um yeah do you find the proxima be

5072
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
um yeah do you find the proxima be
 

5073
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:17,270
um yeah do you find the proxima be
interesting or the the more general

5074
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:17,280
interesting or the the more general
 

5075
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,550
interesting or the the more general
question is

5076
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:18,560
question is
 

5077
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:21,590
question is
do you think we humans will

5078
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:21,600
do you think we humans will
 

5079
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:25,510
do you think we humans will
venture out into outside our solar

5080
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,520
venture out into outside our solar
 

5081
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:26,709
venture out into outside our solar

that would allow us to leave the solar

5092
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
that would allow us to leave the solar
 

5093
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,990
that would allow us to leave the solar
system and visit the nearest

when the first humans left africa so so

5132
01:27:26,310 --> 01:27:26,320
when the first humans left africa so so
 

5133
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:26,950
when the first humans left africa so so
that they would

5134
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:26,960
that they would
 

5135
01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,510
that they would
arrive there now yes and you know that

5136
01:27:29,510 --> 01:27:29,520
arrive there now yes and you know that
 

5137
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,350
arrive there now yes and you know that
that's a long time to wait

5138
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:31,360
that's a long time to wait
 

5139
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,270
that's a long time to wait
so yuri wanted to do it within our

5140
01:27:33,270 --> 01:27:33,280
so yuri wanted to do it within our
 

5141
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:35,910
so yuri wanted to do it within our
lifetime yes 10 20 years meaning

5142
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:35,920
lifetime yes 10 20 years meaning
 

5143
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,590
lifetime yes 10 20 years meaning
it has to move at a fraction of the

5144
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:37,600
it has to move at a fraction of the
 

5145
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,510
it has to move at a fraction of the
speed of light so can we send a

5146
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
speed of light so can we send a
 

5147
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,430
speed of light so can we send a
spacecraft that would be

5148
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
spacecraft that would be
 

5149
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:42,870
spacecraft that would be
moving at the fraction of the speed of

5150
01:27:42,870 --> 01:27:42,880
moving at the fraction of the speed of
 

5151
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:45,270
moving at the fraction of the speed of
light and i said let me look into that

5152
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:45,280
light and i said let me look into that
 

5153
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:46,870
light and i said let me look into that
for six months

5154
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:46,880
for six months
 

5155
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,110
for six months
and with my students and postdocs we

5156
01:27:49,110 --> 01:27:49,120
and with my students and postdocs we
 

5157
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,790
and with my students and postdocs we
arrived to the conclusion that the only

5158
01:27:50,790 --> 01:27:50,800
arrived to the conclusion that the only
 

5159
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,550
arrived to the conclusion that the only
technology that can do that

5160
01:27:52,550 --> 01:27:52,560
technology that can do that
 

5161
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:54,790
technology that can do that
is the light sale technology where can

5162
01:27:54,790 --> 01:27:54,800
is the light sale technology where can
 

5163
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:55,590
is the light sale technology where can
you explain it

5164
01:27:55,590 --> 01:27:55,600
you explain it
 

5165
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:58,470
you explain it
uh you basically produce a very powerful

5166
01:27:58,470 --> 01:27:58,480
uh you basically produce a very powerful
 

5167
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,229
uh you basically produce a very powerful
laser beam

5168
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
laser beam
 

5169
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:04,149
laser beam
on earth so you can collect sunlight

5170
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:04,159
on earth so you can collect sunlight
 

5171
01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:07,990
on earth so you can collect sunlight
with photovoltaic cells or whatever

5172
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:08,000
with photovoltaic cells or whatever
 

5173
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:12,149
with photovoltaic cells or whatever
and then convert it into

5174
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159

 

5175
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,550

stored energy and then produce a very

5176
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:14,560
stored energy and then produce a very
 

5177
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,070
stored energy and then produce a very
powerful laser beam that is

5178
01:28:16,070 --> 01:28:16,080
powerful laser beam that is
 

5179
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:19,590
powerful laser beam that is
100 gigawatts and

5180
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
100 gigawatts and
 

5181
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,790
100 gigawatts and
focus it on a sail in space

5182
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
focus it on a sail in space
 

5183
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,470
focus it on a sail in space
that is roughly the size of a person

5184
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:26,480
that is roughly the size of a person
 

5185
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,430
that is roughly the size of a person
a couple of meters or a few meters that

5186
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,440
a couple of meters or a few meters that
 

5187
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,950
a couple of meters or a few meters that
weighs only a gram

5188
01:28:30,950 --> 01:28:30,960
weighs only a gram
 

5189
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:34,310
weighs only a gram
or a few grams very thin

5190
01:28:34,310 --> 01:28:34,320
or a few grams very thin
 

5191
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,590
or a few grams very thin
and through the math you can show that

5192
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:37,600
and through the math you can show that
 

5193
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,830
and through the math you can show that
you can propel such a cell if you shine

5194
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:39,840
you can propel such a cell if you shine
 

5195
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:41,350
you can propel such a cell if you shine
on it for a few minutes

5196
01:28:41,350 --> 01:28:41,360
on it for a few minutes
 

5197
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:43,030
on it for a few minutes
it will traverse the distance that is

5198
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:43,040
it will traverse the distance that is
 

5199
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:44,790
it will traverse the distance that is
five times the distance to the moon

5200
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
five times the distance to the moon
 

5201
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,470
five times the distance to the moon
and it will get to a fifth of the speed

5202
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
and it will get to a fifth of the speed
 

5203
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,390
and it will get to a fifth of the speed
of light sounds

5204
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:48,400
of light sounds
 

5205
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:50,390
of light sounds
crazy but i've talked to a bunch of

5206
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:50,400
crazy but i've talked to a bunch of
 

5207
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:52,149
crazy but i've talked to a bunch of
people and they're like i know it sounds

5208
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:52,159
people and they're like i know it sounds
 

5209
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,990
people and they're like i know it sounds
crazy but it's actually

5210
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
crazy but it's actually
 

5211
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,189
crazy but it's actually
it will work this is one of those i

5212
01:28:57,189 --> 01:28:57,199
it will work this is one of those i
 

5213
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:59,189
it will work this is one of those i
it's just beautiful i mean this is this

5214
01:28:59,189 --> 01:28:59,199
it's just beautiful i mean this is this
 

5215
01:28:59,199 --> 01:29:00,229
it's just beautiful i mean this is this
is science and

01:29:39,510 --> 01:29:39,520
military threats come from hovering
 

5253
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,750
military threats come from hovering
above the surface of the earth right

5254
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:41,760
above the surface of the earth right
 

5255
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,950
above the surface of the earth right
and we live on a two-dimensional surface

5256
01:29:44,950 --> 01:29:44,960
and we live on a two-dimensional surface
 

5257
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,470
and we live on a two-dimensional surface
we live on the surface of the earth

5258
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:46,480
we live on the surface of the earth
 

5259
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,990
we live on the surface of the earth
but space is all about the third

5260
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:48,000
but space is all about the third
 

5261
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:49,990
but space is all about the third
dimension getting far from error

5262
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
dimension getting far from error
 

5263
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,870
dimension getting far from error
so if you go to mars or you go to a star

5264
01:29:52,870 --> 01:29:52,880
so if you go to mars or you go to a star
 

5265
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:53,830
so if you go to mars or you go to a star
another star

5266
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
another star
 

5267
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:55,990

5271
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,470
talking about
space is all about you know feeling that

5272
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:00,480
space is all about you know feeling that
 

5273

space is all about you know feeling that
you know we are one civilization in fact

5274
01:30:03,110 --> 01:30:03,120

yeah so why would we be worried that the
 

5285
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,550
yeah so why would we be worried that the
space race will lead

5286
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:14,560
space race will lead
 

5287
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,229
space race will lead

know there's some it does
in our discourse about it the space race

5292
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:20,320
in our discourse about it the space race
 

5293
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,110
in our discourse about it the space race
is sometimes

5294

and you know nations can sign treaties
first of all there are lots of trees

5342
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:04,320
first of all there are lots of trees
 

5343
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,070
first of all there are lots of trees
that were signed even before the first

5344
01:31:06,070 --> 01:31:06,080
that were signed even before the first
 

5345
01:31:06,080 --> 01:31:07,750
that were signed even before the first
world war and the second world war and

space exploration
 

5361
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:22,470
space exploration
you might still find commercial entities

5362
01:31:22,470 --> 01:31:22,480
you might still find commercial entities
 

5363

that will
 

5365
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:26,470
that will
find a way to get their launches and you

know so
 

5369
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:30,070
know so
i think we should rethink space it has

01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:30,080
i think we should rethink space it has
 

5371
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:31,990
i think we should rethink space it has
nothing to do with national pride

5540
01:34:38,709 --> 01:34:38,719
don't know maybe i'm just a sucker for
 

5541
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:39,189
don't know maybe i'm just a sucker for
it but

5542
01:34:39,189 --> 01:34:39,199
it but
 

5543
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:41,830
it but
it it's really exciting and mars which

5544
01:34:41,830 --> 01:34:41,840
it it's really exciting and mars which
 

5545
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,669
it it's really exciting and mars which
is a new place a new planet

5546
01:34:43,669 --> 01:34:43,679
is a new place a new planet
 

5547
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:46,310
is a new place a new planet
another planet that might have life i

5548
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:46,320
another planet that might have life i
 

5549
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:47,910
another planet that might have life i
mean there's something magical to that

5550
01:34:47,910 --> 01:34:47,920
mean there's something magical to that
 

5551
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,990
mean there's something magical to that
or some traces of previous life you

5552
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
or some traces of previous life you
 

5553
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:51,750
or some traces of previous life you
might think that humans cannot really

5554
01:34:51,750 --> 01:34:51,760
might think that humans cannot really
 

5555
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:52,709
might think that humans cannot really
survive

5556
01:34:52,709 --> 01:34:52,719
survive
 

5557
01:34:52,719 --> 01:34:54,950
survive
and and there are risks by going there

5558
01:34:54,950 --> 01:34:54,960
and and there are risks by going there
 

5559
01:34:54,960 --> 01:34:57,109
and and there are risks by going there
but my point is

5560
01:34:57,109 --> 01:34:57,119
but my point is
 

5561
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:00,229
but my point is
you know we started from africa and we

5562
01:35:00,229 --> 01:35:00,239
you know we started from africa and we
 

5563
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:02,550
you know we started from africa and we
got to apartment buildings in manhattan

5564
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:02,560
got to apartment buildings in manhattan
 

5565
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,149
got to apartment buildings in manhattan
yes right it's a very different

5566
01:35:04,149 --> 01:35:04,159
yes right it's a very different
 

5567
01:35:04,159 --> 01:35:06,149
yes right it's a very different
environment from the jungles to

5568
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:06,159
environment from the jungles to
 

5569
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:08,070
environment from the jungles to
live in an apartment building in you

5570
01:35:08,070 --> 01:35:08,080
live in an apartment building in you
 

5571
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:09,669
live in an apartment building in you
know a small cubicle

5572
01:35:09,669 --> 01:35:09,679
know a small cubicle
 

5573
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:12,629
know a small cubicle
um and you know it took tens of

5574
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:12,639
um and you know it took tens of
 

5575
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:13,990
um and you know it took tens of
thousands of years but

5576
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:14,000
thousands of years but
 

5577
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,709
thousands of years but
humans adapted right so why couldn't

5578
01:35:16,709 --> 01:35:16,719
humans adapted right so why couldn't
 

5579
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:17,350
humans adapted right so why couldn't
humans

5580
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:17,360
humans
 

5581
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,510
humans
also make the leap and adapt to a

5582
01:35:19,510 --> 01:35:19,520
also make the leap and adapt to a
 

5583
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:21,590
also make the leap and adapt to a
habitat in space you know that

5584
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:21,600
habitat in space you know that
 

5585
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:24,149
habitat in space you know that
now you can build a platform that would

5586
01:35:24,149 --> 01:35:24,159
now you can build a platform that would
 

5587
01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:24,709
now you can build a platform that would
look like

5588
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:24,719
look like
 

5589
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,950
look like
an apartment building in the bronx or

5590
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:26,960
an apartment building in the bronx or
 

5591
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:28,390
an apartment building in the bronx or
somewhere

5592
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:28,400
somewhere
 

5593
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,790
somewhere
but have inside of it everything that

5594
01:35:30,790 --> 01:35:30,800
but have inside of it everything that
 

5595
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:32,070
but have inside of it everything that
humans need

5596
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
humans need
 

5597
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,310
humans need
yes and it just like the space station

5598
01:35:34,310 --> 01:35:34,320
yes and it just like the space station
 

5599
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,189
yes and it just like the space station
but bigger

5600
01:35:35,189 --> 01:35:35,199
but bigger
 

5601
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:37,350
but bigger
and it will be a platform in space and

5602
01:35:37,350 --> 01:35:37,360
and it will be a platform in space and
 

5603
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,189
and it will be a platform in space and
the advantage of that

5604
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:39,199
the advantage of that
 

5605
01:35:39,199 --> 01:35:42,229
the advantage of that
is if something bad happens on earth you

5606
01:35:42,229 --> 01:35:42,239
is if something bad happens on earth you
 

5607
01:35:42,239 --> 01:35:43,109
is if something bad happens on earth you
have that

5608
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:43,119
have that
 

5609
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:46,310
have that
complex where humans live and you can

5610
01:35:46,310 --> 01:35:46,320
complex where humans live and you can
 

5611
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:48,070
complex where humans live and you can
also move it back and forth depending on

5612
01:35:48,070 --> 01:35:48,080
also move it back and forth depending on
 

5613
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,149
also move it back and forth depending on
how bright the sun gets

5614
01:35:50,149 --> 01:35:50,159
how bright the sun gets
 

5615
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:52,390
how bright the sun gets
because you know within within a billion

5616
01:35:52,390 --> 01:35:52,400
because you know within within a billion
 

5617
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,990
because you know within within a billion
years

5618
01:35:53,990 --> 01:35:54,000
years
 

5619
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,070
years
within a billion years the sun would be

5620
01:35:56,070 --> 01:35:56,080
within a billion years the sun would be
 

5621
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:57,189
within a billion years the sun would be
too hot

5622
01:35:57,189 --> 01:35:57,199
too hot
 

5623
01:35:57,199 --> 01:35:59,510
too hot
and it will boil off all the oceans on

5624
01:35:59,510 --> 01:35:59,520
and it will boil off all the oceans on
 

5625
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,270
and it will boil off all the oceans on
earth so we cannot stay here for more

5626
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:01,280
earth so we cannot stay here for more
 

5627
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,790
earth so we cannot stay here for more
than a billion years that's for sure

5628
01:36:02,790 --> 01:36:02,800
than a billion years that's for sure
 

5629
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:05,669
than a billion years that's for sure
yes so that's a billion years from now

5630
01:36:05,669 --> 01:36:05,679
yes so that's a billion years from now
 

5631
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:06,149
yes so that's a billion years from now
uh

5632
01:36:06,149 --> 01:36:06,159
uh
 

5633
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:08,870
uh
i prefer like shorter term deadlines and

5634
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
i prefer like shorter term deadlines and
 

5635
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:09,910
i prefer like shorter term deadlines and
so

5636
01:36:09,910 --> 01:36:09,920
so
 

5637
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:11,189
so
and that's i mean there's a lot of

5638
01:36:11,189 --> 01:36:11,199
and that's i mean there's a lot of
 

5639
01:36:11,199 --> 01:36:12,709
and that's i mean there's a lot of
threats that we're facing currently do

5640
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:12,719
threats that we're facing currently do
 

5641
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:13,830
threats that we're facing currently do
you find it exciting

5642
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:13,840
you find it exciting
 

5643
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,870
you find it exciting
the possibility of uh

5644
01:36:16,870 --> 01:36:16,880
the possibility of uh
 

5645
01:36:16,880 --> 01:36:19,189
the possibility of uh
you know uh landing on mars and starting

5646
01:36:19,189 --> 01:36:19,199
you know uh landing on mars and starting
 

5647
01:36:19,199 --> 01:36:20,470
you know uh landing on mars and starting
little like

5648
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:20,480
little like
 

5649
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,870
little like
uh building a manhattan style apartment

5650
01:36:22,870 --> 01:36:22,880
uh building a manhattan style apartment
 

5651
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,229
uh building a manhattan style apartment
building on mars and

5652
01:36:24,229 --> 01:36:24,239
building on mars and
 

5653
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,310
building on mars and
and humans occupying it do you think

5654
01:36:26,310 --> 01:36:26,320
and humans occupying it do you think
 

5655
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,910
and humans occupying it do you think
from a scientific from an engineering

5656
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:27,920
from a scientific from an engineering
 

5657
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:29,669
from a scientific from an engineering
perspective that's uh

5658
01:36:29,669 --> 01:36:29,679
perspective that's uh
 

5659
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:31,750
perspective that's uh
that's a worthy pursuit i think it's

5660
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
that's a worthy pursuit i think it's
 

5661
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:32,790
that's a worthy pursuit i think it's
worthy but

5662
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:32,800
worthy but
 

5663
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,910
worthy but
the real issue that is often uh

5664
01:36:35,910 --> 01:36:35,920
the real issue that is often uh
 

5665
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,109
the real issue that is often uh
underplayed is the risk to the human

5666
01:36:39,109 --> 01:36:39,119
underplayed is the risk to the human
 

5667
01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:41,270
underplayed is the risk to the human
body from cosmic rays

5668
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:41,280
body from cosmic rays
 

5669
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,470
body from cosmic rays
these are energetic particles and we are

5670
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:44,480
these are energetic particles and we are
 

5671
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,149
these are energetic particles and we are
protected from them

5672
01:36:46,149 --> 01:36:46,159
protected from them
 

5673
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:49,430
protected from them
by the magnetic field around the earth

5674
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
by the magnetic field around the earth
 

5675
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,550
by the magnetic field around the earth
that blocks them but if you go to mars

5676
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:52,560
that blocks them but if you go to mars
 

5677
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:54,550
that blocks them but if you go to mars
where there is no such magnetic field to

5678
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:54,560
where there is no such magnetic field to
 

5679
01:36:54,560 --> 01:36:55,750
where there is no such magnetic field to
block them

5680
01:36:55,750 --> 01:36:55,760
block them
 

5681
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,070
block them
then you know a significant fraction of

5682
01:36:58,070 --> 01:36:58,080
then you know a significant fraction of
 

5683
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:59,350
then you know a significant fraction of
the brain cells in your

5684
01:36:59,350 --> 01:36:59,360
the brain cells in your
 

5685
01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:03,350
the brain cells in your
your head will be damaged within a year

5686
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:03,360
your head will be damaged within a year
 

5687
01:37:03,360 --> 01:37:04,950
your head will be damaged within a year
and the consequences of that are not

5688
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,960
and the consequences of that are not
 

5689
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:07,189
and the consequences of that are not
clear i mean

5690
01:37:07,189 --> 01:37:07,199
clear i mean
 

5691
01:37:07,199 --> 01:37:10,229
clear i mean
it's quite possible that humans cannot

5692
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:10,239
it's quite possible that humans cannot
 

5693
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:10,790
it's quite possible that humans cannot
really

5694
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:10,800
really
 

5695
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,350
really
survive on the surface now it may mean

5696
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:13,360
survive on the surface now it may mean
 

5697
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,470
survive on the surface now it may mean
that we need to dig

5698
01:37:14,470 --> 01:37:14,480
that we need to dig
 

5699
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,750
that we need to dig
tunnels uh go underground or create some

5700
01:37:17,750 --> 01:37:17,760
tunnels uh go underground or create some
 

5701
01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:19,430
tunnels uh go underground or create some
protection

5702
01:37:19,430 --> 01:37:19,440
protection
 

5703
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,510
protection
this is something that can be engineered

5704
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:21,520
this is something that can be engineered
 

5705
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,669
this is something that can be engineered
yes uh and you know we can start from

5706
01:37:23,669 --> 01:37:23,679
yes uh and you know we can start from
 

5707
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:24,870
yes uh and you know we can start from
the moon and then move

5708
01:37:24,870 --> 01:37:24,880
the moon and then move
 

5709
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:26,390
the moon and then move
to mars that would be a natural

5710
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:26,400
to mars that would be a natural
 

5711
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,709
to mars that would be a natural
progression but it's a big

5712
01:37:28,709 --> 01:37:28,719
progression but it's a big
 

5713
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,270
progression but it's a big
uh issue that needs to be dealt with i

5714
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:31,280
uh issue that needs to be dealt with i
 

5715
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:32,229
uh issue that needs to be dealt with i
don't think

5716
01:37:32,229 --> 01:37:32,239
don't think
 

5717
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:34,870
don't think
you know each showstopper i think we can

5718
01:37:34,870 --> 01:37:34,880
you know each showstopper i think we can
 

5719
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:36,149
you know each showstopper i think we can
overcome it but

5720
01:37:36,149 --> 01:37:36,159
overcome it but
 

5721
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:38,149
overcome it but
you know just like anything in science

5722
01:37:38,149 --> 01:37:38,159
you know just like anything in science
 

5723
01:37:38,159 --> 01:37:39,590
you know just like anything in science
and technology you have to work on it

5724
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
and technology you have to work on it
 

5725
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,830
and technology you have to work on it
for a while figure out solutions

5726
01:37:41,830 --> 01:37:41,840
for a while figure out solutions
 

5727
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:44,870
for a while figure out solutions
and but it's not as rosy as elon musk

5728
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:44,880
and but it's not as rosy as elon musk
 

5729
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:45,430
and but it's not as rosy as elon musk
talks about

5730
01:37:45,430 --> 01:37:45,440
talks about
 

5731
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,830
talks about
i mean elon musk can obviously be

5732
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:47,840
i mean elon musk can obviously be
 

5733
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,030
i mean elon musk can obviously be
optimistic

5734
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:49,040
optimistic
 

5735
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:50,790
optimistic
i think eventually it will boil down to

5736
01:37:50,790 --> 01:37:50,800
i think eventually it will boil down to
 

5737
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:52,629
i think eventually it will boil down to
figuring out um

5738
01:37:52,629 --> 01:37:52,639
figuring out um
 

5739
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:54,629
figuring out um
how to cope with this risk the health

5740
01:37:54,629 --> 01:37:54,639
how to cope with this risk the health
 

5741
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:55,669
how to cope with this risk the health
risk yeah i mean

5742
01:37:55,669 --> 01:37:55,679
risk yeah i mean
 

5743
01:37:55,679 --> 01:37:59,350
risk yeah i mean
uh in defense of optimism i i find that

5744
01:37:59,350 --> 01:37:59,360
uh in defense of optimism i i find that
 

5745
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,669
uh in defense of optimism i i find that
there's a at least a correlation if not

5746
01:38:01,669 --> 01:38:01,679
there's a at least a correlation if not
 

5747
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:03,350
there's a at least a correlation if not
their best friends is optimism and

5748
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
their best friends is optimism and
 

5749
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:05,030
their best friends is optimism and
open-mindedness

5750
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:05,040
open-mindedness
 

5751
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:09,109
open-mindedness
is uh

5752
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:09,119

 

5753
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,910

it's a necessary it's preconditioned to

it's a necessary it's preconditioned to
 

5755

5756
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
to do
 

5757
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:15,990
to do
to try crazy things and in that sense

5758
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:16,000
to try crazy things and in that sense
 

5759
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,229
to try crazy things and in that sense
there the sense i have about going to

5760
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:18,239
there the sense i have about going to
 

5761
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:19,750
there the sense i have about going to
mars if we use

5762
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:19,760
mars if we use
 

5763
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:23,430
mars if we use
today's logic of what kind of

5764
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:23,440
today's logic of what kind of
 

5765
01:38:23,440 --> 01:38:26,470
today's logic of what kind of
benefits we'll get from that we're never

5766
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:26,480
benefits we'll get from that we're never
 

5767
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:28,149
benefits we'll get from that we're never
going to go

5768
01:38:28,149 --> 01:38:28,159
going to go
 

5769
01:38:28,159 --> 01:38:31,510
going to go
and make most decisions we make in life

5770
01:38:31,510 --> 01:38:31,520
and make most decisions we make in life
 

5771
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:33,189
and make most decisions we make in life
most decisions we've made as a human

5772
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:33,199
most decisions we've made as a human
 

5773
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:35,669
most decisions we've made as a human
species are irrational

5774
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:35,679
species are irrational
 

5775
01:38:35,679 --> 01:38:38,950
species are irrational
if you just if you look at just today

5776
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
if you just if you look at just today
 

5777
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,750
if you just if you look at just today
but if you look at the long arc and the

5778
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:41,760
but if you look at the long arc and the
 

5779
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,149
but if you look at the long arc and the
possibilities that it might bring just

5780
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:44,159
possibilities that it might bring just
 

5781
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:44,470
possibilities that it might bring just
like

5782
01:38:44,470 --> 01:38:44,480
like
 

5783
01:38:44,480 --> 01:38:48,310
like
humans left europe and yeah europe and

5784
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:48,320
humans left europe and yeah europe and
 

5785
01:38:48,320 --> 01:38:50,310
humans left europe and yeah europe and
yeah and by the way it was destroyed

5786
01:38:50,310 --> 01:38:50,320
yeah and by the way it was destroyed
 

5787
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:52,550
yeah and by the way it was destroyed
everybody and but it was a commercial

5788
01:38:52,550 --> 01:38:52,560
everybody and but it was a commercial
 

5789
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,550
everybody and but it was a commercial
interest that drove that for trade

5790
01:38:56,550 --> 01:38:56,560
interest that drove that for trade
 

5791
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,149
interest that drove that for trade
and you know it might happen again in

5792
01:38:58,149 --> 01:38:58,159
and you know it might happen again in
 

5793
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:00,070
and you know it might happen again in
this context you have people like jeff

5794
01:39:00,070 --> 01:39:00,080
this context you have people like jeff
 

5795
01:39:00,080 --> 01:39:01,510
this context you have people like jeff
bezos and elon musk that are

5796
01:39:01,510 --> 01:39:01,520
bezos and elon musk that are
 

5797
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:03,270
bezos and elon musk that are
commercially driven to go to space

5798
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,280
commercially driven to go to space
 

5799
01:39:03,280 --> 01:39:05,750
commercially driven to go to space
yes but it doesn't mean that what we

5800
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:05,760
yes but it doesn't mean that what we
 

5801
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:07,189
yes but it doesn't mean that what we
will ultimately

5802
01:39:07,189 --> 01:39:07,199
will ultimately
 

5803
01:39:07,199 --> 01:39:09,910
will ultimately
find is not new worlds you know that

5804
01:39:09,910 --> 01:39:09,920
find is not new worlds you know that
 

5805
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:10,870
find is not new worlds you know that
have nothing

5806
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:10,880
have nothing
 

5807
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:13,430
have nothing
you know much have much more to offer

5808
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:13,440
you know much have much more to offer
 

5809
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:14,629
you know much have much more to offer
than just commercial

5810
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:14,639
than just commercial
 

5811
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:17,510
than just commercial
interests and uh as a side effect almost

5812
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:17,520
interests and uh as a side effect almost
 

5813
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:18,149
interests and uh as a side effect almost
right yeah

5814
01:39:18,149 --> 01:39:18,159
right yeah
 

5815
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:20,709
right yeah
yeah and then that's why i think you

5816
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
yeah and then that's why i think you
 

5817
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,149
yeah and then that's why i think you
know we should be open-minded and

5818
01:39:22,149 --> 01:39:22,159
know we should be open-minded and
 

5819
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:22,870
know we should be open-minded and
explore

5820
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:22,880
explore
 

5821
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:25,669
explore
and however at the same time because of

5822
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
and however at the same time because of
 

5823
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:27,430
and however at the same time because of
the reasons you pointed out

5824
01:39:27,430 --> 01:39:27,440
the reasons you pointed out
 

5825
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,350
the reasons you pointed out
uh i'm not optimistic that we will

5826
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:29,360
uh i'm not optimistic that we will
 

5827
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:31,270
uh i'm not optimistic that we will
survive more than a few centuries into

5828
01:39:31,270 --> 01:39:31,280
survive more than a few centuries into
 

5829
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:32,070
survive more than a few centuries into
the future

5830
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,080
the future
 

5831
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,229
the future
because people do not think long term

5832
01:39:34,229 --> 01:39:34,239
because people do not think long term
 

5833
01:39:34,239 --> 01:39:36,229
because people do not think long term
and that means that we will

5834
01:39:36,229 --> 01:39:36,239
and that means that we will
 

5835
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:38,229
and that means that we will
only survive for the short term i don't

5836
01:39:38,229 --> 01:39:38,239
only survive for the short term i don't
 

5837
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:39,270
only survive for the short term i don't
know if you have

5838
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,280
know if you have
 

5839
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,189
know if you have
thoughts about this but what are the

5840
01:39:41,189 --> 01:39:41,199
thoughts about this but what are the
 

5841
01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:43,750
thoughts about this but what are the
things that worry the most about

5842
01:39:43,750 --> 01:39:43,760
things that worry the most about
 

5843
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,510
things that worry the most about
uh from the great perspective of the

5844
01:39:45,510 --> 01:39:45,520
uh from the great perspective of the
 

5845
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:46,790
uh from the great perspective of the
universe which is the great

5846
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:46,800
universe which is the great
 

5847
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,790
universe which is the great

civilizations
but for our own species here uh

but for our own species here uh
 

5853
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,790
but for our own species here uh
like what are the things that worry the

like what are the things that worry the
 

5855

like what are the things that worry the
most yeah the thing that worries me the

most yeah the thing that worries me the
 

5857
01:39:56,960 --> 01:39:58,870
most yeah the thing that worries me the
most is that people pay attention to how

most is that people pay attention to how
 

5859

5866
01:40:11,430 --> 01:40:11,440
keep your eyes on the ball not on the
 

5867
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,709
keep your eyes on the ball not on the
audience

5868
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
audience
 

5869
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:14,870
audience
the problem is we keep our eyes on the

5870
01:40:14,870 --> 01:40:14,880
the problem is we keep our eyes on the
 

5871
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,709
the problem is we keep our eyes on the
audience most of the time

5872
01:40:16,709 --> 01:40:16,719
audience most of the time
 

5873
01:40:16,719 --> 01:40:18,709
audience most of the time
yes let's keep our eyes on the ball and

5874
01:40:18,709 --> 01:40:18,719
yes let's keep our eyes on the ball and
 

5875
01:40:18,719 --> 01:40:20,390
yes let's keep our eyes on the ball and
what does that mean first of all in

5876
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
what does that mean first of all in
 

5877
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:21,590
what does that mean first of all in
context of science

5878
01:40:21,590 --> 01:40:21,600
context of science
 

5879
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:23,990
context of science
it means pay attention to the evidence

5880
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
it means pay attention to the evidence
 

5881
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:24,950
it means pay attention to the evidence
when the evidence

5882
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:24,960
when the evidence
 

5883
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:28,709
when the evidence
looks strange then we should figure it

5884
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:28,719
looks strange then we should figure it
 

5885
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:29,270
looks strange then we should figure it
out

5886
01:40:29,270 --> 01:40:29,280
out
 

5887
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,990

01:40:31,990 --> 01:40:32,000
you know i went to a seminar about
 

5889
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:33,910
you know i went to a seminar about
umuamua at harvard

mainstream conservative
 

5895
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:42,550
mainstream conservative
would never say anything that would

5896
01:40:42,550 --> 01:40:42,560
would never say anything that would
 

5897
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:44,149
would never say anything that would
deviate from

5898
01:40:44,149 --> 01:40:44,159
deviate from
 

5899
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,709
deviate from
what everyone else is thinking said to

5900
01:40:46,709 --> 01:40:46,719
what everyone else is thinking said to
 

5901
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,629
what everyone else is thinking said to
me after the seminar

5902
01:40:48,629 --> 01:40:48,639
me after the seminar
 

5903
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:51,669
me after the seminar
i wish this object never existed

5904
01:40:51,669 --> 01:40:51,679
i wish this object never existed
 

5905
01:40:51,679 --> 01:40:53,990
i wish this object never existed
now to me i mean i just couldn't hear

5906
01:40:53,990 --> 01:40:54,000
now to me i mean i just couldn't hear
 

5907
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,109
now to me i mean i just couldn't hear
that

5908
01:40:55,109 --> 01:40:55,119
that
 

5909
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:57,669
that
what do you mean nature is whatever it

5910
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
what do you mean nature is whatever it
 

5911
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:59,510
what do you mean nature is whatever it
is you have to pay attention to it you

5912
01:40:59,510 --> 01:40:59,520
is you have to pay attention to it you
 

5913
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,830
is you have to pay attention to it you
you cannot say i you know you cannot

5914
01:41:01,830 --> 01:41:01,840
you cannot say i you know you cannot
 

5915
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:03,189
you cannot say i you know you cannot
bury your head in this

5916
01:41:03,189 --> 01:41:03,199
bury your head in this
 

5917
01:41:03,199 --> 01:41:05,109
bury your head in this
i mean you should bless nature for

5918
01:41:05,109 --> 01:41:05,119
i mean you should bless nature for
 

5919
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,709
i mean you should bless nature for
giving you clues about things that you

5920
01:41:06,709 --> 01:41:06,719
giving you clues about things that you
 

5921
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,149
giving you clues about things that you
haven't expected yes

5922
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:08,159
haven't expected yes
 

5923
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,390
haven't expected yes
and i think that's the biggest fault

5924
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
and i think that's the biggest fault
 

5925
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,590
and i think that's the biggest fault
that we are

5926
01:41:11,590 --> 01:41:11,600
that we are
 

5927
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,149
that we are
looking for confirmations of things we

5928
01:41:14,149 --> 01:41:14,159
looking for confirmations of things we
 

5929
01:41:14,159 --> 01:41:15,350
looking for confirmations of things we
already know

5930
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
already know
 

5931
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:19,510
already know
so that we can maintain our pride

5932
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:19,520
so that we can maintain our pride
 

5933
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:22,149
so that we can maintain our pride
that we already knew it and maintain our

5934
01:41:22,149 --> 01:41:22,159
that we already knew it and maintain our
 

5935
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,910
that we already knew it and maintain our
image not make mistakes because we

5936
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
image not make mistakes because we
 

5937
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:25,510
image not make mistakes because we
already knew it therefore we

5938
01:41:25,510 --> 01:41:25,520
already knew it therefore we
 

5939
01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,470
already knew it therefore we
expected the right thing yes but science

5940
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:28,480
expected the right thing yes but science
 

5941
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:30,310
expected the right thing yes but science
is a learning experience and sometimes

5942
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:30,320
is a learning experience and sometimes
 

5943
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,270
is a learning experience and sometimes
you're wrong

5944
01:41:31,270 --> 01:41:31,280
you're wrong
 

5945
01:41:31,280 --> 01:41:33,189
you're wrong
and let's learn from those mistakes and

5946
01:41:33,189 --> 01:41:33,199
and let's learn from those mistakes and
 

5947
01:41:33,199 --> 01:41:34,709
and let's learn from those mistakes and
what's the problem about that

5948
01:41:34,709 --> 01:41:34,719
what's the problem about that
 

5949
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,350
what's the problem about that
why is why do we have to get you know

5950
01:41:37,350 --> 01:41:37,360
why is why do we have to get you know
 

5951
01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:38,149
why is why do we have to get you know
prizes

5952
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
prizes
 

5953
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,470
prizes
and why do we get to be honored and

5954
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:40,480
and why do we get to be honored and
 

5955
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,990
and why do we get to be honored and
maintain our image

5956
01:41:41,990 --> 01:41:42,000
maintain our image
 

5957
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,910
maintain our image
when the actual objective of science is

5958
01:41:43,910 --> 01:41:43,920
when the actual objective of science is
 

5959
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:45,350
when the actual objective of science is
learning about nature

5960
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:45,360
learning about nature
 

5961
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:47,510
learning about nature
and like you you've talked about

5962
01:41:47,510 --> 01:41:47,520
and like you you've talked about
 

5963
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:48,950
and like you you've talked about
anomalies in this case

5964
01:41:48,950 --> 01:41:48,960
anomalies in this case
 

5965
01:41:48,960 --> 01:41:51,430
anomalies in this case
are actually are not things that are

5966
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:51,440
are actually are not things that are
 

5967
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:53,910
are actually are not things that are
unfortunate and to be ignored are

5968
01:41:53,910 --> 01:41:53,920
unfortunate and to be ignored are
 

5969
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:56,149
unfortunate and to be ignored are
in fact gifts and should be the focus of

5970
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
in fact gifts and should be the focus of
 

5971
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,990
in fact gifts and should be the focus of
science exactly because that's the way

5972
01:41:57,990 --> 01:41:58,000
science exactly because that's the way
 

5973
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,990
science exactly because that's the way
for us to improve our understanding if

5974
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
for us to improve our understanding if
 

5975
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,830
for us to improve our understanding if
you look at quantum mechanics nobody

5976
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:01,840
you look at quantum mechanics nobody
 

5977
01:42:01,840 --> 01:42:03,270
you look at quantum mechanics nobody
dreamed about it

5978
01:42:03,270 --> 01:42:03,280
dreamed about it
 

5979
01:42:03,280 --> 01:42:05,910
dreamed about it
and it was revolutionary and we still

5980
01:42:05,910 --> 01:42:05,920
and it was revolutionary and we still
 

5981
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:08,149
and it was revolutionary and we still
don't fully understand it it's a pain

5982
01:42:08,149 --> 01:42:08,159
don't fully understand it it's a pain
 

5983
01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:10,229
don't fully understand it it's a pain
for us to figure out so why do you so i

5984
01:42:10,229 --> 01:42:10,239
for us to figure out so why do you so i
 

5985
01:42:10,239 --> 01:42:11,350
for us to figure out so why do you so i
understand from the science

5986
01:42:11,350 --> 01:42:11,360
understand from the science
 

5987
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:13,030
understand from the science
from the perspective that's holding our

5988
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,040
from the perspective that's holding our
 

5989
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:14,709
from the perspective that's holding our
science back

5990
01:42:14,709 --> 01:42:14,719
science back
 

5991
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:16,870
science back
why do you have a sense that that's also

5992
01:42:16,870 --> 01:42:16,880
why do you have a sense that that's also
 

5993
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:17,910
why do you have a sense that that's also
something

5994
01:42:17,910 --> 01:42:17,920
something
 

5995
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,109
something
that might be uh a problem for us in

5996
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:21,119
that might be uh a problem for us in
 

5997
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:21,750
that might be uh a problem for us in
terms of

5998
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:21,760
terms of
 

5999
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,669
terms of
the survival of human civilization

6000
01:42:23,669 --> 01:42:23,679
the survival of human civilization
 

6001
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,510
the survival of human civilization
because when you look at society

6002
01:42:25,510 --> 01:42:25,520
because when you look at society
 

6003
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:29,350
because when you look at society
it operates by the same principles

6004
01:42:29,350 --> 01:42:29,360
it operates by the same principles
 

6005
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,629
it operates by the same principles
there is uh people look for affirmation

6006
01:42:32,629 --> 01:42:32,639
there is uh people look for affirmation
 

6007
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:37,189
there is uh people look for affirmation
by groups and they

6008
01:42:37,189 --> 01:42:37,199
by groups and they
 

6009
01:42:37,199 --> 01:42:39,270
by groups and they
you know people segregate into herds

6010
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,280
you know people segregate into herds
 

6011
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,950
you know people segregate into herds
that think like them especially these

6012
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:40,960
that think like them especially these
 

6013
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:41,990
that think like them especially these
days when social media

6014
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
days when social media
 

6015
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,390
days when social media
is so strong you can find your support

you can say crazy things as long as
 

6025
01:42:50,560 --> 01:42:52,229
you can say crazy things as long as
there are enough people supporting what

will happen to society because we're
 

6039

right so pascal had this wager about god

6150
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:03,440
right so pascal had this wager about god
 

6151
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:04,790
right so pascal had this wager about god
and by the way there are interesting

6152
01:45:04,790 --> 01:45:04,800
and by the way there are interesting
 

6153
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,030
and by the way there are interesting
connections between theology

6154
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:07,040
connections between theology
 

6155
01:45:07,040 --> 01:45:08,790
connections between theology
and the search for extraterrestrial life

6156
01:45:08,790 --> 01:45:08,800
and the search for extraterrestrial life
 

6157
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,310
and the search for extraterrestrial life
you know it's possible that

6158
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:10,320
you know it's possible that
 

6159
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:13,350
you know it's possible that
you know we were planted on this planet

6160
01:45:13,350 --> 01:45:13,360
you know we were planted on this planet
 

6161
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:15,510
you know we were planted on this planet
by another civilization that's you know

6162
01:45:15,510 --> 01:45:15,520
by another civilization that's you know
 

6163
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,709
by another civilization that's you know
we attribute

6164
01:45:16,709 --> 01:45:16,719
we attribute
 

6165
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:18,950
we attribute
to god powers that are that belong

6166
01:45:18,950 --> 01:45:18,960
to god powers that are that belong
 

6167
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:21,270
to god powers that are that belong
really to technological civilization

6168
01:45:21,270 --> 01:45:21,280
really to technological civilization
 

6169
01:45:21,280 --> 01:45:24,470
really to technological civilization
uh but putting that aside uh pascal

6170
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
uh but putting that aside uh pascal
 

6171
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,669
uh but putting that aside uh pascal
basically said

6172
01:45:25,669 --> 01:45:25,679
basically said
 

6173
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:27,189
basically said
you know let's there are two

6174
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:27,199
you know let's there are two
 

6175
01:45:27,199 --> 01:45:29,669
you know let's there are two
possibilities either god exists or not

6176
01:45:29,669 --> 01:45:29,679
possibilities either god exists or not
 

6177
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:33,270
possibilities either god exists or not
right and if god exists

6178
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
right and if god exists
 

6179
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,350
right and if god exists
you know the consequences are quite

6180
01:45:35,350 --> 01:45:35,360
you know the consequences are quite
 

6181
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:36,709
you know the consequences are quite
significant

6182
01:45:36,709 --> 01:45:36,719
significant
 

6183
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:38,629
significant
and therefore you know we should we

6184
01:45:38,629 --> 01:45:38,639
and therefore you know we should we
 

6185
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:40,870
and therefore you know we should we
should consider that possibility

6186
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:40,880
should consider that possibility
 

6187
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,229
should consider that possibility
differently than equal weight to both

6188
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
differently than equal weight to both
 

6189
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:45,030
differently than equal weight to both
possibilities

6190
01:45:45,030 --> 01:45:45,040
possibilities
 

6191
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:49,030
possibilities
and uh i suggest that we do the same

6192
01:45:49,030 --> 01:45:49,040
and uh i suggest that we do the same
 

6193
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,350
and uh i suggest that we do the same
with omua mua or

6194
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:51,360
with omua mua or
 

6195
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,629
with omua mua or
other technological signatures that we

6196
01:45:54,629 --> 01:45:54,639
other technological signatures that we
 

6197
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,229
other technological signatures that we
uh keep in mind the consequences

6198
01:45:58,229 --> 01:45:58,239
uh keep in mind the consequences
 

6199
01:45:58,239 --> 01:46:00,550
uh keep in mind the consequences
and therefore pay more attention to that

6200
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,560
and therefore pay more attention to that
 

6201
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:01,750
and therefore pay more attention to that
possibility now

6202
01:46:01,750 --> 01:46:01,760
possibility now
 

6203
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,030
possibility now
some people say extraordinary claims

6204
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:05,040
some people say extraordinary claims
 

6205
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,830
some people say extraordinary claims
require extraordinary evidence my point

6206
01:46:07,830 --> 01:46:07,840
require extraordinary evidence my point
 

6207
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:08,390
require extraordinary evidence my point
is that

6208
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:08,400
is that
 

6209
01:46:08,400 --> 01:46:11,350
is that
the term extraordinary is really

6210
01:46:11,350 --> 01:46:11,360
the term extraordinary is really
 

6211
01:46:11,360 --> 01:46:11,990
the term extraordinary is really
subjective

6212
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:12,000
subjective
 

6213
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:15,430
subjective
you know for one person a black hole is

6214
01:46:15,430 --> 01:46:15,440
you know for one person a black hole is
 

6215
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,590
you know for one person a black hole is
extraordinary for another

6216
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:17,600
extraordinary for another
 

6217
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:18,950
extraordinary for another
you know it's just a consequence of

6218
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:18,960
you know it's just a consequence of
 

6219
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,709
you know it's just a consequence of
einstein's theory of gravity

6220
01:46:20,709 --> 01:46:20,719
einstein's theory of gravity
 

6221
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:23,669
einstein's theory of gravity
yeah it's nothing extraordinary yeah the

6222
01:46:23,669 --> 01:46:23,679
yeah it's nothing extraordinary yeah the
 

6223
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:25,750
yeah it's nothing extraordinary yeah the
same about the type of dark matter

6224
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:25,760
same about the type of dark matter
 

6225
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,149
same about the type of dark matter
anything so we should leave the

6226
01:46:28,149 --> 01:46:28,159
anything so we should leave the
 

6227
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:29,350
anything so we should leave the
extraordinary

6228
01:46:29,350 --> 01:46:29,360
extraordinary
 

6229
01:46:29,360 --> 01:46:33,270
extraordinary
part of that sentence just keep evidence

6230
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:33,280
part of that sentence just keep evidence
 

6231
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:33,750
part of that sentence just keep evidence
okay

6232
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:33,760
okay
 

6233
01:46:33,760 --> 01:46:36,790
okay
so let's be guided by evidence and

6234
01:46:36,790 --> 01:46:36,800
so let's be guided by evidence and
 

6235
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,790
so let's be guided by evidence and
even even if we have extraordinary

6236
01:46:38,790 --> 01:46:38,800
even even if we have extraordinary
 

6237
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,229
even even if we have extraordinary
claims you know let's not

6238
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:40,239
claims you know let's not
 

6239
01:46:40,239 --> 01:46:42,629
claims you know let's not
dismiss them because the evidence is not

6240
01:46:42,629 --> 01:46:42,639
dismiss them because the evidence is not
 

6241
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:43,990
dismiss them because the evidence is not
extraordinary enough because

6242
01:46:43,990 --> 01:46:44,000
extraordinary enough because
 

6243
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,550
extraordinary enough because
if we have an image of something and it

6244
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:46,560
if we have an image of something and it
 

6245
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,470
if we have an image of something and it
looks really strange and we say oh the

6246
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:48,480
looks really strange and we say oh the
 

6247
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:49,990
looks really strange and we say oh the
image is not sufficiently

6248
01:46:49,990 --> 01:46:50,000
image is not sufficiently
 

6249
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:51,910
image is not sufficiently
sharp therefore we should not even pay

6250
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:51,920
sharp therefore we should not even pay
 

6251
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,430
sharp therefore we should not even pay
attention to this image or not even

6252
01:46:53,430 --> 01:46:53,440
attention to this image or not even
 

6253
01:46:53,440 --> 01:46:54,470
attention to this image or not even
consider

6254
01:46:54,470 --> 01:46:54,480
consider
 

6255
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,390
consider
i think that's a mistake yes what we

6256
01:46:56,390 --> 01:46:56,400
i think that's a mistake yes what we
 

6257
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:57,590
i think that's a mistake yes what we
should do is say

6258
01:46:57,590 --> 01:46:57,600
should do is say
 

6259
01:46:57,600 --> 01:46:58,790
should do is say
look there is some evidence for

6260
01:46:58,790 --> 01:46:58,800
look there is some evidence for
 

6261
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:01,270
look there is some evidence for
something unusual let's try

6262
01:47:01,270 --> 01:47:01,280
something unusual let's try
 

6263
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:02,950
something unusual let's try
and build instruments that will give us

6264
01:47:02,950 --> 01:47:02,960
and build instruments that will give us
 

6265
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:04,709
and build instruments that will give us
a better image

6266
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:04,719
a better image
 

6267
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:06,950
a better image
and if you just dismiss extraordinary

6268
01:47:06,950 --> 01:47:06,960
and if you just dismiss extraordinary
 

6269
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:07,830
and if you just dismiss extraordinary
claims

6270
01:47:07,830 --> 01:47:07,840
claims
 

6271
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:09,430
claims
because the you consider them

6272
01:47:09,430 --> 01:47:09,440
because the you consider them
 

6273
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:11,510
because the you consider them
extraordinary you avoid

6274
01:47:11,510 --> 01:47:11,520
extraordinary you avoid
 

6275
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,430
extraordinary you avoid
discovering things that you haven't

6276
01:47:13,430 --> 01:47:13,440
discovering things that you haven't
 

6277
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,149
discovering things that you haven't
expected and so

6278
01:47:16,149 --> 01:47:16,159
expected and so
 

6279
01:47:16,159 --> 01:47:18,629
expected and so
i believe that along the history of

6280
01:47:18,629 --> 01:47:18,639
i believe that along the history of
 

6281
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:19,910
i believe that along the history of
astronomy there are many missed

6282
01:47:19,910 --> 01:47:19,920
astronomy there are many missed
 

6283
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:20,870
astronomy there are many missed
opportunities

6284
01:47:20,870 --> 01:47:20,880
opportunities
 

6285
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:22,629
opportunities
and i speak about astronomy but i'm sure

6286
01:47:22,629 --> 01:47:22,639
and i speak about astronomy but i'm sure
 

6287
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:24,310
and i speak about astronomy but i'm sure
in other fields it's also true i mean

6288
01:47:24,310 --> 01:47:24,320
in other fields it's also true i mean
 

6289
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:24,950
in other fields it's also true i mean
this is

6290
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:24,960
this is
 

6291
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:27,669
this is
my expertise for example you know the

6292
01:47:27,669 --> 01:47:27,679
my expertise for example you know the
 

6293
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:29,669
my expertise for example you know the
astrophysical journal which is the main

6294
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:29,679
astrophysical journal which is the main
 

6295
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,189
astrophysical journal which is the main
primary publication in astrophysics

6296
01:47:33,189 --> 01:47:33,199
primary publication in astrophysics
 

6297
01:47:33,199 --> 01:47:35,910
primary publication in astrophysics
uh if you go you go beyond before the

6298
01:47:35,910 --> 01:47:35,920
uh if you go you go beyond before the
 

6299
01:47:35,920 --> 01:47:38,310
uh if you go you go beyond before the
1980s there are images that were posted

6300
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:38,320
1980s there are images that were posted
 

6301
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:39,990
1980s there are images that were posted
in the astrophysical journal

6302
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:40,000
in the astrophysical journal
 

6303
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,830
in the astrophysical journal
of giant arcs you know arcs of light

6304
01:47:43,830 --> 01:47:43,840
of giant arcs you know arcs of light
 

6305
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,830
of giant arcs you know arcs of light
surrounding clusters of galaxies and

6306
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:47,840
surrounding clusters of galaxies and
 

6307
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:50,070
surrounding clusters of galaxies and
you know you can find it in printed

6308
01:47:50,070 --> 01:47:50,080
you know you can find it in printed
 

6309
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:51,510
you know you can find it in printed
versions of the astrophysical journal

6310
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:51,520
versions of the astrophysical journal
 

6311
01:47:51,520 --> 01:47:52,390
versions of the astrophysical journal
people just ignore

6312
01:47:52,390 --> 01:47:52,400
people just ignore
 

6313
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:55,109
people just ignore
they put the image they see the arc they

6314
01:47:55,109 --> 01:47:55,119
they put the image they see the arc they
 

6315
01:47:55,119 --> 01:47:55,910
they put the image they see the arc they
say

6316
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:55,920
say
 

6317
01:47:55,920 --> 01:47:58,470
say
who knows what it is and just ignore it

6318
01:47:58,470 --> 01:47:58,480
who knows what it is and just ignore it
 

6319
01:47:58,480 --> 01:47:59,030
who knows what it is and just ignore it
and then

6320
01:47:59,030 --> 01:47:59,040
and then
 

6321
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:01,350
and then
in the 1980s the subject of

6322
01:48:01,350 --> 01:48:01,360
in the 1980s the subject of
 

6323
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:04,390
in the 1980s the subject of
gravitational lensing became popular

6324
01:48:04,390 --> 01:48:04,400
gravitational lensing became popular
 

6325
01:48:04,400 --> 01:48:08,149
gravitational lensing became popular
and the idea is that you can deflect

6326
01:48:08,149 --> 01:48:08,159
and the idea is that you can deflect
 

6327
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:12,310
and the idea is that you can deflect
light by the force of gravity and

6328
01:48:12,310 --> 01:48:12,320
light by the force of gravity and
 

6329
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:14,390
light by the force of gravity and
then you can put the source behind the

6330
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:14,400
then you can put the source behind the
 

6331
01:48:14,400 --> 01:48:15,910
then you can put the source behind the
cluster of galaxies and then you will

6332
01:48:15,910 --> 01:48:15,920
cluster of galaxies and then you will
 

6333
01:48:15,920 --> 01:48:17,109
cluster of galaxies and then you will
get these arcs

6334
01:48:17,109 --> 01:48:17,119
get these arcs
 

6335
01:48:17,119 --> 01:48:19,750
get these arcs
and actually einstein predicted it uh in

6336
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:19,760
and actually einstein predicted it uh in
 

6337
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,270
and actually einstein predicted it uh in
1940 and

6338
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:21,280
1940 and
 

6339
01:48:21,280 --> 01:48:24,470
1940 and
you know so these things were expected

6340
01:48:24,470 --> 01:48:24,480
you know so these things were expected
 

6341
01:48:24,480 --> 01:48:25,109
you know so these things were expected
but

6342
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:25,119
but
 

6343
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,870
but
people just had them in the images

6344
01:48:26,870 --> 01:48:26,880
people just had them in the images
 

6345
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,470
people just had them in the images
didn't pay attention so i'm sure there

6346
01:48:28,470 --> 01:48:28,480
didn't pay attention so i'm sure there
 

6347
01:48:28,480 --> 01:48:30,229
didn't pay attention so i'm sure there
are lost opportunities sometimes you

6348
01:48:30,229 --> 01:48:30,239
are lost opportunities sometimes you
 

6349
01:48:30,239 --> 01:48:30,790
are lost opportunities sometimes you
even in

6350
01:48:30,790 --> 01:48:30,800
even in
 

6351
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,270
even in
existing data you have things that are

6352
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:33,280
existing data you have things that are
 

6353
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:34,550
existing data you have things that are
unusual and

6354
01:48:34,550 --> 01:48:34,560
unusual and
 

6355
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,229
unusual and

exceptional and are not being addressed
 

6357
01:48:38,239 --> 01:48:40,070
exceptional and are not being addressed
yeah you actually i think you have the

6358
01:48:40,070 --> 01:48:40,080
yeah you actually i think you have the
 

6359
01:48:40,080 --> 01:48:41,350
yeah you actually i think you have the
article uh

6360
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:41,360
article uh
 

6361
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:43,430
article uh
the data is not enough from from quite a

6362
01:48:43,430 --> 01:48:43,440
the data is not enough from from quite a
 

6363
01:48:43,440 --> 01:48:44,950
the data is not enough from from quite a
few years ago

6364
01:48:44,950 --> 01:48:44,960
few years ago
 

6365
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:46,709
few years ago
will you talk let's do you know we can

6366
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:46,719
will you talk let's do you know we can
 

6367
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:48,709
will you talk let's do you know we can
go back to the 70s and 80s but we can go

6368
01:48:48,709 --> 01:48:48,719
go back to the 70s and 80s but we can go
 

6369
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:50,709
go back to the 70s and 80s but we can go
also to the mayan civilization

6370
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:50,719
also to the mayan civilization
 

6371
01:48:50,719 --> 01:48:52,470
also to the mayan civilization
right the mayan civilization basically

6372
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:52,480
right the mayan civilization basically
 

6373
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,229
right the mayan civilization basically
believed in astrology that

6374
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:54,239
believed in astrology that
 

6375
01:48:54,239 --> 01:48:56,870
believed in astrology that
you can forecast the outcome of a war

6376
01:48:56,870 --> 01:48:56,880
you can forecast the outcome of a war
 

6377
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:58,709
you can forecast the outcome of a war
based on the position of the planets

6378
01:48:58,709 --> 01:48:58,719
based on the position of the planets
 

6379
01:48:58,719 --> 01:49:01,270
based on the position of the planets
yes and and they had you know

6380
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:01,280
yes and and they had you know
 

6381
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:02,709
yes and and they had you know
astronomers in their

6382
01:49:02,709 --> 01:49:02,719
astronomers in their
 

6383
01:49:02,719 --> 01:49:06,550
astronomers in their
culture had the highest social status

6384
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560
culture had the highest social status
 

6385
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,270
culture had the highest social status
they were priests yes they were elevated

6386
01:49:09,270 --> 01:49:09,280
they were priests yes they were elevated
 

6387
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:11,030
they were priests yes they were elevated
and the reason was that they helped

6388
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,040
and the reason was that they helped
 

6389
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:13,830
and the reason was that they helped
politicians decide when to go to war

6390
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:13,840
politicians decide when to go to war
 

6391
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:16,070
politicians decide when to go to war
because they would tell the politicians

6392
01:49:16,070 --> 01:49:16,080
because they would tell the politicians
 

6393
01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:17,350
because they would tell the politicians
you know the planets would be in this

6394
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:17,360
you know the planets would be in this
 

6395
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:18,310
you know the planets would be in this
configuration

6396
01:49:18,310 --> 01:49:18,320
configuration
 

6397
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:19,910
configuration
it's a better chance for you to win the

6398
01:49:19,910 --> 01:49:19,920
it's a better chance for you to win the
 

6399
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:21,830
it's a better chance for you to win the
war yes go to war

6400
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:21,840
war yes go to war
 

6401
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:24,070
war yes go to war
and in retrospect they you know they

6402
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:24,080
and in retrospect they you know they
 

6403
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:26,390
and in retrospect they you know they
collected wonderful data

6404
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:26,400
collected wonderful data
 

6405
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:28,790
collected wonderful data
but misinterpreted it because we now

6406
01:49:28,790 --> 01:49:28,800
but misinterpreted it because we now
 

6407
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,790
but misinterpreted it because we now
know that the position of venus

6408
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:30,800
know that the position of venus
 

6409
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:34,070
know that the position of venus
or jupiter or whatever has nothing to do

6410
01:49:34,070 --> 01:49:34,080
or jupiter or whatever has nothing to do
 

6411
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:36,470
or jupiter or whatever has nothing to do
with the outcome of world war one which

6412
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
with the outcome of world war one which
 

6413
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,109
with the outcome of world war one which
you know it

6414
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:37,119
you know it
 

6415
01:49:37,119 --> 01:49:40,470
you know it
has nothing to do and uh so we can have

6416
01:49:40,470 --> 01:49:40,480
has nothing to do and uh so we can have
 

6417
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,430
has nothing to do and uh so we can have
a prejudice

6418
01:49:41,430 --> 01:49:41,440
a prejudice
 

6419
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,390
a prejudice
and collect data without actually doing

6420
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:44,400
and collect data without actually doing
 

6421
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,229
and collect data without actually doing
the right thing with it

6422
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:46,239
the right thing with it
 

6423
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,070
the right thing with it
that's such a pisces thing to say i

6424
01:49:48,070 --> 01:49:48,080
that's such a pisces thing to say i
 

6425
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:50,350
that's such a pisces thing to say i
looked up what your astrological sign is

6426
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:50,360
looked up what your astrological sign is
 

6427
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:53,669
looked up what your astrological sign is
[Laughter]

6428
01:49:53,669 --> 01:49:53,679
[Laughter]
 

6429
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:55,830
[Laughter]
well so you mentioned einstein predicted

6430
01:49:55,830 --> 01:49:55,840
well so you mentioned einstein predicted
 

6431
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,430
well so you mentioned einstein predicted
that black holes don't exist

6432
01:49:57,430 --> 01:49:57,440
that black holes don't exist
 

6433
01:49:57,440 --> 01:50:01,510
that black holes don't exist
or just or exist in nature

6434
01:50:01,510 --> 01:50:01,520
or just or exist in nature
 

6435
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:03,189
or just or exist in nature
when einstein came up with his theory of

6436
01:50:03,189 --> 01:50:03,199
when einstein came up with his theory of
 

6437
01:50:03,199 --> 01:50:06,310
when einstein came up with his theory of
gravity in 1915 november 1915

6438
01:50:06,310 --> 01:50:06,320
gravity in 1915 november 1915
 

6439
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:09,830
gravity in 1915 november 1915
a few months later another physicist

6440
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
a few months later another physicist
 

6441
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,030
a few months later another physicist
carl schwarzschild

6442
01:50:11,030 --> 01:50:11,040
carl schwarzschild
 

6443
01:50:11,040 --> 01:50:13,109
carl schwarzschild
he was the director of the potsdam

6444
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:13,119
he was the director of the potsdam
 

6445
01:50:13,119 --> 01:50:14,790
he was the director of the potsdam
observatory but he was a patriot a

6446
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:14,800
observatory but he was a patriot a
 

6447
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,910
observatory but he was a patriot a
german patriot

6448
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:15,920
german patriot
 

6449
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,669
german patriot
so he went into the first world war

6450
01:50:17,669 --> 01:50:17,679
so he went into the first world war
 

6451
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:19,510
so he went into the first world war
fighting for germany but

6452
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:19,520
fighting for germany but
 

6453
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,990
fighting for germany but
while he was at the front he sent a

6454
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:22,000
while he was at the front he sent a
 

6455
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,669
while he was at the front he sent a
postcard to einstein saying you know a

6456
01:50:23,669 --> 01:50:23,679
postcard to einstein saying you know a
 

6457
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:24,950
postcard to einstein saying you know a
few months after the theory was

6458
01:50:24,950 --> 01:50:24,960
few months after the theory was
 

6459
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:25,669
few months after the theory was
developed

6460
01:50:25,669 --> 01:50:25,679
developed
 

6461
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:27,270
developed
saying actually i found a solution to

6462
01:50:27,270 --> 01:50:27,280
saying actually i found a solution to
 

6463
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:29,030
saying actually i found a solution to
your equations

6464
01:50:29,030 --> 01:50:29,040
your equations
 

6465
01:50:29,040 --> 01:50:31,350
your equations
and that was a black hole solution and

6466
01:50:31,350 --> 01:50:31,360
and that was a black hole solution and
 

6467
01:50:31,360 --> 01:50:33,510
and that was a black hole solution and
then he died a few months later

6468
01:50:33,510 --> 01:50:33,520
then he died a few months later
 

6469
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,310
then he died a few months later
and einstein was a pacifist and he

6470
01:50:36,310 --> 01:50:36,320
and einstein was a pacifist and he
 

6471
01:50:36,320 --> 01:50:37,990
and einstein was a pacifist and he
survived so the the lesson from this

6472
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:38,000
survived so the the lesson from this
 

6473
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,149
survived so the the lesson from this
story is that if you want to work out

6474
01:50:40,149 --> 01:50:40,159
story is that if you want to work out
 

6475
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:42,149
story is that if you want to work out
the consequences of a theory

6476
01:50:42,149 --> 01:50:42,159
the consequences of a theory
 

6477
01:50:42,159 --> 01:50:45,430
the consequences of a theory
you better wear pacifist but

6478
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:45,440
you better wear pacifist but
 

6479
01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:48,149
you better wear pacifist but
but the point is that this solution was

6480
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:48,159
but the point is that this solution was
 

6481
01:50:48,159 --> 01:50:48,709
but the point is that this solution was
known

6482
01:50:48,709 --> 01:50:48,719
known
 

6483
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:50,550
known
shortly after einstein came up with his

6484
01:50:50,550 --> 01:50:50,560
shortly after einstein came up with his
 

6485
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,310
shortly after einstein came up with his
theory but in

6486
01:50:52,310 --> 01:50:52,320
theory but in
 

6487
01:50:52,320 --> 01:50:55,910
theory but in
but in 1939 einstein wrote a paper

6488
01:50:55,910 --> 01:50:55,920
but in 1939 einstein wrote a paper
 

6489
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,229
but in 1939 einstein wrote a paper
in the analysis of mathematics saying

6490
01:50:58,229 --> 01:50:58,239
in the analysis of mathematics saying
 

6491
01:50:58,239 --> 01:50:59,990
in the analysis of mathematics saying
even though the solution exists

6492
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:00,000
even though the solution exists
 

6493
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:02,390
even though the solution exists
i don't think it's realized in nature

6494
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:02,400
i don't think it's realized in nature
 

6495
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,830
i don't think it's realized in nature
and his argument was

6496
01:51:03,830 --> 01:51:03,840
and his argument was
 

6497
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,870
and his argument was
if you imagine a star collapsing

6498
01:51:06,870 --> 01:51:06,880
if you imagine a star collapsing
 

6499
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:09,510
if you imagine a star collapsing
stars often spin and the spin will

6500
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:09,520
stars often spin and the spin will
 

6501
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,270
stars often spin and the spin will
prevent them from making a black hole

6502
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,280
prevent them from making a black hole
 

6503
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:14,070
prevent them from making a black hole
collapsing to a point so i mean can you

6504
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:14,080
collapsing to a point so i mean can you
 

6505
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,030
collapsing to a point so i mean can you
maybe

6506
01:51:15,030 --> 01:51:15,040
maybe
 

6507
01:51:15,040 --> 01:51:18,390
maybe
one of the many things you uh you have

6508
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:18,400
one of the many things you uh you have
 

6509
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,589
one of the many things you uh you have
work on you're an expert in as black

6510
01:51:21,589 --> 01:51:21,599
work on you're an expert in as black
 

6511
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:23,350
work on you're an expert in as black
holes can you first say what are black

6512
01:51:23,350 --> 01:51:23,360
holes can you first say what are black
 

6513
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:23,990
holes can you first say what are black
holes

6514
01:51:23,990 --> 01:51:24,000
holes
 

6515
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:26,550
holes
and second how do we know that they

6516
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:26,560

you could board a spaceship that will
take you into a black hole would you do

6591
01:52:37,119 --> 01:52:40,229

as a matter of principle yeah my wife

6592
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:40,239
as a matter of principle yeah my wife
 

6593
01:52:40,239 --> 01:52:42,070
as a matter of principle yeah my wife
asked me when we got married

6594
01:52:42,070 --> 01:52:42,080
asked me when we got married
 

6595
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:45,270
asked me when we got married
and i uh honor that and i told you

6596
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
and i uh honor that and i told you
 

6597
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:46,870
and i uh honor that and i told you
offline i need to get married just like

she's such a woman

6600
01:52:48,149 --> 01:52:48,159
she's such a woman
 

6601
01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:50,229
she's such a woman
she truly is a special agent well she

6602
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:50,239
she truly is a special agent well she
 

6603
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:51,910
she truly is a special agent well she
she was wise enough to recognize the

6604
01:52:51,910 --> 01:52:51,920
she was wise enough to recognize the
 

6605
01:52:51,920 --> 01:52:52,629
she was wise enough to recognize the
risk

6606
01:52:52,629 --> 01:52:52,639
risk
 

6607
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:55,750
risk
but um it saves me time and it also

6608
01:52:55,750 --> 01:52:55,760
but um it saves me time and it also
 

6609
01:52:55,760 --> 01:52:57,669
but um it saves me time and it also
keeps me away from crowds you know i

6610
01:52:57,669 --> 01:52:57,679
keeps me away from crowds you know i
 

6611
01:52:57,679 --> 01:52:58,310
keeps me away from crowds you know i
don't

6612
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,320
don't
 

6613
01:52:58,320 --> 01:53:01,669
don't
have the uh notion of what

6614
01:53:01,669 --> 01:53:01,679
have the uh notion of what
 

6615
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:03,430
have the uh notion of what
a lot of other people think so i can

6616
01:53:03,430 --> 01:53:03,440
a lot of other people think so i can
 

6617
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:04,950
a lot of other people think so i can
think independently think exactly yeah

6618
01:53:04,950 --> 01:53:04,960
think independently think exactly yeah
 

6619
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:05,750
think independently think exactly yeah
exactly

6620
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:05,760
exactly
 

6621
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,030
exactly
but uh putting so i was surprised to

6622
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:09,040
but uh putting so i was surprised to
 

6623
01:53:09,040 --> 01:53:10,310
but uh putting so i was surprised to
hear that for students

6624
01:53:10,310 --> 01:53:10,320
hear that for students
 

6625
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,910
hear that for students
it's extremely important to share

6626
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:11,920
it's extremely important to share
 

6627
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:13,430
it's extremely important to share
experiences even if they go on a

6628
01:53:13,430 --> 01:53:13,440
experiences even if they go on a
 

6629
01:53:13,440 --> 01:53:14,310
experiences even if they go on a
spaceship with

6630
01:53:14,310 --> 01:53:14,320
spaceship with
 

6631
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:17,270
spaceship with
aliens they still want to brag about it

6632
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:17,280
aliens they still want to brag about it
 

6633
01:53:17,280 --> 01:53:18,070
aliens they still want to brag about it
rather than

6634
01:53:18,070 --> 01:53:18,080
rather than
 

6635
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,910
rather than
look around and see what's going on this

6636
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:19,920
look around and see what's going on this
 

6637
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:21,189
look around and see what's going on this
is not an option when you go to the

6638
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,199
is not an option when you go to the
 

6639
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:22,950
is not an option when you go to the
black hole is exactly the point

6640
01:53:22,950 --> 01:53:22,960
black hole is exactly the point
 

6641
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:24,950
black hole is exactly the point
so for the black hole they said no

6642
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
so for the black hole they said no
 

6643
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,950
so for the black hole they said no
because there obviously you can find

6644
01:53:26,950 --> 01:53:26,960
because there obviously you can find
 

6645
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:27,669
because there obviously you can find
your death

6646
01:53:27,669 --> 01:53:27,679
your death
 

6647
01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:30,790
your death
after uh you get into it and you

6648
01:53:30,790 --> 01:53:30,800
after uh you get into it and you
 

6649
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:32,870
after uh you get into it and you
you can crash into singularity there is

6650
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:32,880
you can crash into singularity there is
 

6651
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:34,870
you can crash into singularity there is
this singularity in the center so

6652
01:53:34,870 --> 01:53:34,880
this singularity in the center so
 

6653
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,350
this singularity in the center so
inside the event horizon we know that

6654
01:53:37,350 --> 01:53:37,360
inside the event horizon we know that
 

6655
01:53:37,360 --> 01:53:39,669
inside the event horizon we know that
all the matter collects

6656
01:53:39,669 --> 01:53:39,679
all the matter collects
 

6657
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:42,870
all the matter collects
at a point now we can't

6658
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:42,880
at a point now we can't
 

6659
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:44,870
at a point now we can't
really predict what happens at the

6660
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:44,880
really predict what happens at the
 

6661
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,030
really predict what happens at the
singularity because einstein's theory

6662
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:47,040
singularity because einstein's theory
 

6663
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:48,310
singularity because einstein's theory
breaks down

6664
01:53:48,310 --> 01:53:48,320
breaks down
 

6665
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:49,910
breaks down
and we know why it breaks down because

6666
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:49,920
and we know why it breaks down because
 

6667
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,830
and we know why it breaks down because
it doesn't have quantum mechanics that

6668
01:53:51,830 --> 01:53:51,840
it doesn't have quantum mechanics that
 

6669
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:54,149
it doesn't have quantum mechanics that
talks about small distances

6670
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:54,159
talks about small distances
 

6671
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:56,310
talks about small distances
we don't have a theory that unifies

6672
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:56,320
we don't have a theory that unifies
 

6673
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:58,870
we don't have a theory that unifies
quantum mechanics and gravity

6674
01:53:58,870 --> 01:53:58,880
quantum mechanics and gravity
 

6675
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:01,910
quantum mechanics and gravity
so that it will predict what happens in

6676
01:54:01,910 --> 01:54:01,920
so that it will predict what happens in
 

6677
01:54:01,920 --> 01:54:03,189
so that it will predict what happens in
near a singularity

6678
01:54:03,189 --> 01:54:03,199
near a singularity
 

6679
01:54:03,199 --> 01:54:05,589
near a singularity
and in fact you know i once a couple of

01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:05,599
and in fact you know i once a couple of
 

6681
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:06,950
and in fact you know i once a couple of
years ago i had

6682
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:06,960
years ago i had
 

6683
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:10,550
years ago i had
a flood in my basement i mean

6684
01:54:10,550 --> 01:54:10,560
a flood in my basement i mean
 

6685
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,750
a flood in my basement i mean
and i i invited the plumber to come over

6686
01:54:13,750 --> 01:54:13,760
and i i invited the plumber to come over
 

6687
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:14,070
and i i invited the plumber to come over
and

6688
01:54:14,070 --> 01:54:14,080
and
 

6689
01:54:14,080 --> 01:54:16,950
and
and figure out and and we found that the

6690
01:54:16,950 --> 01:54:16,960
and figure out and and we found that the
 

6691
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:17,830
and figure out and and we found that the
sewer was

6692
01:54:17,830 --> 01:54:17,840
sewer was
 

6693
01:54:17,840 --> 01:54:21,109
sewer was
clogged because of three

6694
01:54:21,109 --> 01:54:21,119
clogged because of three
 

6695
01:54:21,119 --> 01:54:23,589
clogged because of three
roots that got into it and we solved the

6696
01:54:23,589 --> 01:54:23,599
roots that got into it and we solved the
 

6697
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:24,629
roots that got into it and we solved the
problem

6698
01:54:24,629 --> 01:54:24,639
problem
 

6699
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,070
problem
but then i i thought to myself

6700
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
but then i i thought to myself
 

6701
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:29,990
but then i i thought to myself
well isn't that what happens to the

6702
01:54:29,990 --> 01:54:30,000
well isn't that what happens to the
 

6703
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,030
well isn't that what happens to the
singularity of a black hole because

6704
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:33,040
singularity of a black hole because
 

6705
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:34,950
singularity of a black hole because
the question is where does the matter go

6706
01:54:34,950 --> 01:54:34,960
the question is where does the matter go
 

6707
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,109
the question is where does the matter go
you know if you know in the case of

6708
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:37,119
you know if you know in the case of
 

6709
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:39,510
you know if you know in the case of
a home i never thought about it but the

6710
01:54:39,510 --> 01:54:39,520
a home i never thought about it but the
 

6711
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:41,109
a home i never thought about it but the
water all the water that we use

6712
01:54:41,109 --> 01:54:41,119
water all the water that we use
 

6713
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:43,350
water all the water that we use
goes in you know through the sewer to

6714
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:43,360
goes in you know through the sewer to
 

6715
01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:45,510
goes in you know through the sewer to
some reservoir somewhere

6716
01:54:45,510 --> 01:54:45,520
some reservoir somewhere
 

6717
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:47,669
some reservoir somewhere
and the question is what happens inside

6718
01:54:47,669 --> 01:54:47,679
and the question is what happens inside
 

6719
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:49,030
and the question is what happens inside
a black hole and

6720
01:54:49,030 --> 01:54:49,040
a black hole and
 

6721
01:54:49,040 --> 01:54:50,790
a black hole and
one possibility is that there is an

6722
01:54:50,790 --> 01:54:50,800
one possibility is that there is an
 

6723
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:52,629
one possibility is that there is an
object in the middle just like a star

6724
01:54:52,629 --> 01:54:52,639
object in the middle just like a star
 

6725
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,390
object in the middle just like a star
you know and everything collects there

6726
01:54:54,390 --> 01:54:54,400
you know and everything collects there
 

6727
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:56,629
you know and everything collects there
and the object has the maximum density

6728
01:54:56,629 --> 01:54:56,639
and the object has the maximum density
 

6729
01:54:56,639 --> 01:54:58,070
and the object has the maximum density
that we can imagine like

6730
01:54:58,070 --> 01:54:58,080
that we can imagine like
 

6731
01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:00,310
that we can imagine like
planck densities it's the ultimate

6732
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:00,320
planck densities it's the ultimate
 

6733
01:55:00,320 --> 01:55:02,709
planck densities it's the ultimate
density that you can have

6734
01:55:02,709 --> 01:55:02,719
density that you can have
 

6735
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:05,350
density that you can have
where gravity is as strong as all the

6736
01:55:05,350 --> 01:55:05,360
where gravity is as strong as all the
 

6737
01:55:05,360 --> 01:55:06,629
where gravity is as strong as all the
other forces

6738
01:55:06,629 --> 01:55:06,639
other forces
 

6739
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:10,070
other forces
um so you can imagine this object very

6740
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
um so you can imagine this object very
 

6741
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,990
um so you can imagine this object very
dense object at the center that collects

6742
01:55:11,990 --> 01:55:12,000
dense object at the center that collects
 

6743
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,189
dense object at the center that collects
all the matter

6744
01:55:13,189 --> 01:55:13,199
all the matter
 

6745
01:55:13,199 --> 01:55:14,790
all the matter
another possibility is that there is

6746
01:55:14,790 --> 01:55:14,800
another possibility is that there is
 

6747
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:17,270
another possibility is that there is
some tunnel just like the sewer it takes

6748
01:55:17,270 --> 01:55:17,280
some tunnel just like the sewer it takes
 

6749
01:55:17,280 --> 01:55:19,669
some tunnel just like the sewer it takes
the matter into another place

6750
01:55:19,669 --> 01:55:19,679
the matter into another place
 

6751
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:22,149
the matter into another place
and we don't know the answer where but i

6752
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:22,159
and we don't know the answer where but i
 

6753
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:24,070
and we don't know the answer where but i

uh admitting my our ignorance it's a
 

6759
01:55:27,119 --> 01:55:28,550
uh admitting my our ignorance it's a
fascinating question what happens to the

6760
01:55:28,550 --> 01:55:28,560
fascinating question what happens to the
 

6761
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:30,310
fascinating question what happens to the
method that goes into black hole

6762

method that goes into black hole
 

6763

summarize and i said
 

6787
01:55:52,080 --> 01:55:55,750
summarize and i said
that i wish we could go on a field trip

said
 

6811
01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:16,310
said
you have an ulterior motive for sending

6812
01:56:16,310 --> 01:56:16,320
you have an ulterior motive for sending
 

6813
01:56:16,320 --> 01:56:18,470
you have an ulterior motive for sending
us into a black hole

6814
01:56:18,470 --> 01:56:18,480
us into a black hole
 

6815
01:56:18,480 --> 01:56:23,669
us into a black hole
uh which i didn't deny but at any event

6816
01:56:23,669 --> 01:56:23,679

 

6817
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:28,149

yes that's true that's true can you say

6818
01:56:28,149 --> 01:56:28,159
yes that's true that's true can you say
 

6819
01:56:28,159 --> 01:56:32,550
yes that's true that's true can you say
why we know that black holes exist

6820
01:56:32,550 --> 01:56:32,560
why we know that black holes exist
 

6821
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:35,990
why we know that black holes exist
right so um it's an interesting

6822
01:56:35,990 --> 01:56:36,000
right so um it's an interesting
 

6823
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,350
right so um it's an interesting
question because black holes were

6824
01:56:37,350 --> 01:56:37,360
question because black holes were
 

6825
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:40,709
question because black holes were
considered a theoretical construct

6826
01:56:40,709 --> 01:56:40,719
considered a theoretical construct
 

6827
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:42,629
considered a theoretical construct
and einstein even denied their existence

6828
01:56:42,629 --> 01:56:42,639
and einstein even denied their existence
 

6829
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:44,470
and einstein even denied their existence
in 1939

6830
01:56:44,470 --> 01:56:44,480
in 1939
 

6831
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:48,669
in 1939
uh but then um in the 19 in the mid

6832
01:56:48,669 --> 01:56:48,679
uh but then um in the 19 in the mid
 

6833
01:56:48,679 --> 01:56:52,950
uh but then um in the 19 in the mid
1960s uh quasars were discovered

6834
01:56:52,950 --> 01:56:52,960
1960s uh quasars were discovered
 

6835
01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,709
1960s uh quasars were discovered
these are very bright sources of flight

6836
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:56,719
these are very bright sources of flight
 

6837
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:58,629
these are very bright sources of flight
a hundred times brighter than their host

6838
01:56:58,629 --> 01:56:58,639
a hundred times brighter than their host
 

6839
01:56:58,639 --> 01:56:59,830
a hundred times brighter than their host

the gas uh
 

6861
01:57:25,520 --> 01:57:28,629
the gas uh
falls towards the black holes uh just

falls towards the black holes uh just
 

6863
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:29,589
falls towards the black holes uh just
like water

6864
01:57:29,589 --> 01:57:29,599
like water
 

6865
01:57:29,599 --> 01:57:32,709
like water
um you know running down the the sink

01:57:32,709 --> 01:57:32,719
um you know running down the the sink
 

6867
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:36,229
um you know running down the the sink
uh the gas swirls

6868
01:57:36,229 --> 01:57:36,239
uh the gas swirls
 

6869
01:57:36,239 --> 01:57:39,270
uh the gas swirls
and then rubs against itself

6870
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:39,280
and then rubs against itself
 

6871
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:42,550
and then rubs against itself
and heats up and shines very brightly

6872
01:57:42,550 --> 01:57:42,560
and heats up and shines very brightly
 

6873
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:44,470
and heats up and shines very brightly
because it's very hot close to the black

6874
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:44,480
because it's very hot close to the black
 

6875
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:45,270
because it's very hot close to the black
hole

by viscous by viscosity it it it

6878
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:48,320
by viscous by viscosity it it it
 

6879
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,870
by viscous by viscosity it it it
heats up uh and in in the case of black

6880
01:57:50,870 --> 01:57:50,880
heats up uh and in in the case of black
 

6881
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:52,310
heats up uh and in in the case of black
holes it's the turbulence

6882
01:57:52,310 --> 01:57:52,320
holes it's the turbulence
 

6883
01:57:52,320 --> 01:57:54,470
holes it's the turbulence
the turbulent viscosity that causes it

6884
01:57:54,470 --> 01:57:54,480
the turbulent viscosity that causes it
 

6885
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:55,589
the turbulent viscosity that causes it
to heat up

6886
01:57:55,589 --> 01:57:55,599
to heat up
 

6887
01:57:55,599 --> 01:57:58,310
to heat up
so um we get these very bright sources

6888
01:57:58,310 --> 01:57:58,320
so um we get these very bright sources
 

6889
01:57:58,320 --> 01:57:58,870
so um we get these very bright sources
of light

6890
01:57:58,870 --> 01:57:58,880
of light
 

6891
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:00,550
of light
just from black holes that are supposed

6892
01:58:00,550 --> 01:58:00,560
just from black holes that are supposed
 

6893
01:58:00,560 --> 01:58:02,790
just from black holes that are supposed
to be dark you know nothing escapes from

6894
01:58:02,790 --> 01:58:02,800
to be dark you know nothing escapes from
 

6895
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:03,990
to be dark you know nothing escapes from
them but

6896
01:58:03,990 --> 01:58:04,000
them but
 

6897
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,030
them but
they create a violent environment where

6898
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:07,040
they create a violent environment where
 

6899
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:09,030
they create a violent environment where
gas moves close to the speed of light

6900
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:09,040
gas moves close to the speed of light
 

6901
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:11,270
gas moves close to the speed of light
light and therefore shines very brightly

6902
01:58:11,270 --> 01:58:11,280
light and therefore shines very brightly
 

6903
01:58:11,280 --> 01:58:12,870
light and therefore shines very brightly
much more than any other source

6904
01:58:12,870 --> 01:58:12,880
much more than any other source
 

6905
01:58:12,880 --> 01:58:15,750
much more than any other source
in the sky and we can see these quasars

6906
01:58:15,750 --> 01:58:15,760
in the sky and we can see these quasars
 

6907
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:17,510
in the sky and we can see these quasars
all the way to the edge of the universe

6908
01:58:17,510 --> 01:58:17,520
all the way to the edge of the universe
 

6909
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:19,350
all the way to the edge of the universe
so we have evidence now that when the

01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
than a billion years after the big bang
 

6933
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:44,550
than a billion years after the big bang
you already have a billion times the

you already have a billion times the
 

6935
01:58:44,560 --> 01:58:47,270
you already have a billion times the
mass of the sun in these black holes and

mass of the sun in these black holes and
 

6937
01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:49,589
mass of the sun in these black holes and
the answer is presumably there are very

02:00:05,270 --> 02:00:05,280
enough
 

7005
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,830
enough
detector like ligo you can detect these

7006
02:00:07,830 --> 02:00:07,840
detector like ligo you can detect these
 

7007
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:09,109
detector like ligo you can detect these
waves and

7008
02:00:09,109 --> 02:00:09,119
waves and
 

7009
02:00:09,119 --> 02:00:11,510
waves and
so it was not just the message that we

7010
02:00:11,510 --> 02:00:11,520
so it was not just the message that we
 

7011
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:12,550
so it was not just the message that we
received for the first time

7012
02:00:12,550 --> 02:00:12,560
received for the first time
 

7013
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:13,910
received for the first time
gravitational waves

7014
02:00:13,910 --> 02:00:13,920
gravitational waves
 

7015
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,390
gravitational waves
but it was the messenger so there are

7016
02:00:16,390 --> 02:00:16,400
but it was the messenger so there are
 

7017
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:18,310
but it was the messenger so there are
two aspects to it one is the messenger

7018
02:00:18,310 --> 02:00:18,320
two aspects to it one is the messenger
 

7019
02:00:18,320 --> 02:00:19,750
two aspects to it one is the messenger
which is gravitational wave for the

7020
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:19,760
which is gravitational wave for the
 

7021
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:21,750
which is gravitational wave for the
first time were detected directly

7022
02:00:21,750 --> 02:00:21,760
first time were detected directly
 

7023
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,149
first time were detected directly
and the second was the message which was

7024
02:00:24,149 --> 02:00:24,159
and the second was the message which was
 

7025
02:00:24,159 --> 02:00:26,070
and the second was the message which was
a collision of two black holes

7026
02:00:26,070 --> 02:00:26,080
a collision of two black holes
 

7027
02:00:26,080 --> 02:00:28,470
a collision of two black holes
because we could see the pattern of the

7028
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,480
because we could see the pattern of the
 

7029
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:29,990
because we could see the pattern of the
ripples in space and time

7030
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:30,000
ripples in space and time
 

7031
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:33,030
ripples in space and time
and it was fully consistent with the

7032
02:00:33,030 --> 02:00:33,040
and it was fully consistent with the
 

7033
02:00:33,040 --> 02:00:35,189
and it was fully consistent with the
prediction that schwarz had made for

7034
02:00:35,189 --> 02:00:35,199
prediction that schwarz had made for
 

7035
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,350
prediction that schwarz had made for
how a black the space time around the

7036
02:00:37,350 --> 02:00:37,360
how a black the space time around the
 

7037
02:00:37,360 --> 02:00:38,870
how a black the space time around the
black hole is because when two black

7038
02:00:38,870 --> 02:00:38,880
black hole is because when two black
 

7039
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:39,350
black hole is because when two black
holes

7040
02:00:39,350 --> 02:00:39,360
holes
 

7041
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:42,390
holes
collide you can sort of map

7042
02:00:42,390 --> 02:00:42,400
collide you can sort of map
 

7043
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:44,629
collide you can sort of map
from the message that you get you can

7044
02:00:44,629 --> 02:00:44,639
from the message that you get you can
 

7045
02:00:44,639 --> 02:00:46,629
from the message that you get you can
reconstruct what what really happened

7046
02:00:46,629 --> 02:00:46,639
reconstruct what what really happened
 

7047
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:48,310
reconstruct what what really happened
and it's fully consistent

7048
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:48,320
and it's fully consistent
 

7049
02:00:48,320 --> 02:00:51,830
and it's fully consistent
and in 2017 and

7050
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:51,840
and in 2017 and
 

7051
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:54,950
and in 2017 and
2020 there's two nobel prizes that's

7052
02:00:54,950 --> 02:00:54,960
2020 there's two nobel prizes that's
 

7053
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:55,270
2020 there's two nobel prizes that's
right

7054
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:55,280
right
 

7055
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:58,550
right
uh uh that had uh to do with the

7056
02:00:58,550 --> 02:00:58,560
uh uh that had uh to do with the
 

7057
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:01,350
uh uh that had uh to do with the
black holes can you maybe describe in

7058
02:01:01,350 --> 02:01:01,360
black holes can you maybe describe in
 

7059
02:01:01,360 --> 02:01:02,390
black holes can you maybe describe in
the same

7060
02:01:02,390 --> 02:01:02,400
the same
 

7061
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:03,910
the same
masterful way that you already been

02:01:03,910 --> 02:01:03,920
masterful way that you already been
 

7063
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:06,229
masterful way that you already been
doing uh what those nobel prizes were

7064
02:01:06,229 --> 02:01:06,239
doing uh what those nobel prizes were
 

7065
02:01:06,239 --> 02:01:09,109
doing uh what those nobel prizes were
given for yeah so the 2017 was given for

7066
02:01:09,109 --> 02:01:09,119
given for yeah so the 2017 was given for
 

7067
02:01:09,119 --> 02:01:11,990
given for yeah so the 2017 was given for
the ligo collaboration for discovering

and the 2020 nobel prize in physics
 

7075
02:01:20,480 --> 02:01:24,310
and the 2020 nobel prize in physics
was given for uh two things one

7076
02:01:24,310 --> 02:01:24,320
was given for uh two things one
 

7077
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:26,790
was given for uh two things one
was theoretical work that was done by

7078
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:26,800
was theoretical work that was done by
 

7079
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:29,430
was theoretical work that was done by
roger penrose in the 1960s

demonstrating that black holes are
 

7083
02:01:32,080 --> 02:01:32,950
demonstrating that black holes are
inevitable

inevitable
 

7085
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,950
inevitable
when stars collapse and

7086
02:01:36,950 --> 02:01:36,960
when stars collapse and
 

7087
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,709
when stars collapse and
it was mostly mathematical work and

7088
02:01:38,709 --> 02:01:38,719
it was mostly mathematical work and
 

7089
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,070
it was mostly mathematical work and
actually stephen hawking

7090
02:01:40,070 --> 02:01:40,080
actually stephen hawking
 

7091
02:01:40,080 --> 02:01:43,669
actually stephen hawking
uh also contributed significantly to

7092
02:01:43,669 --> 02:01:43,679
uh also contributed significantly to
 

7093
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:44,149
uh also contributed significantly to
that

7094
02:01:44,149 --> 02:01:44,159
that
 

7095
02:01:44,159 --> 02:01:47,030
that
frontier and unfortunately he is not

7096
02:01:47,030 --> 02:01:47,040
frontier and unfortunately he is not
 

7097
02:01:47,040 --> 02:01:49,350
frontier and unfortunately he is not
alive so he could not be honored

7098
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:49,360
alive so he could not be honored
 

7099
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:52,870
alive so he could not be honored
so penrose received it on his own

7100
02:01:52,870 --> 02:01:52,880
so penrose received it on his own
 

7101
02:01:52,880 --> 02:01:56,149
so penrose received it on his own
and then two other astronomers received

7102
02:01:56,149 --> 02:01:56,159
and then two other astronomers received
 

7103
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:57,510
and then two other astronomers received
it as well

7104
02:01:57,510 --> 02:01:57,520
it as well
 

7105
02:01:57,520 --> 02:02:00,229
it as well
andrea guez and reinhard genzel and they

7106
02:02:00,229 --> 02:02:00,239
andrea guez and reinhard genzel and they
 

7107
02:02:00,239 --> 02:02:02,550
andrea guez and reinhard genzel and they
provided conclusive evidence

7108
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:02,560
provided conclusive evidence
 

7109
02:02:02,560 --> 02:02:04,310
provided conclusive evidence
that there is a black hole at the center

7110
02:02:04,310 --> 02:02:04,320
that there is a black hole at the center
 

7111
02:02:04,320 --> 02:02:06,629
that there is a black hole at the center
of the milky way galaxy

7112
02:02:06,629 --> 02:02:06,639
of the milky way galaxy
 

7113
02:02:06,639 --> 02:02:09,669
of the milky way galaxy
that weighs about 4 million times the

7114
02:02:09,669 --> 02:02:09,679
that weighs about 4 million times the
 

7115
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:11,109
that weighs about 4 million times the
mass of the sun

7116
02:02:11,109 --> 02:02:11,119
mass of the sun
 

7117
02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:12,629
mass of the sun
and they found the evidence from the

7118
02:02:12,629 --> 02:02:12,639
and they found the evidence from the
 

7119
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:14,950
and they found the evidence from the
motion of stars very close to the black

7120
02:02:14,950 --> 02:02:14,960
motion of stars very close to the black
 

7121
02:02:14,960 --> 02:02:15,510

7123
02:02:15,520 --> 02:02:17,350
hole
just like we see the planets moving

7124
02:02:17,350 --> 02:02:17,360
just like we see the planets moving
 

7125
02:02:17,360 --> 02:02:19,669
just like we see the planets moving
around the sun there are stars close to

7126
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:19,679
around the sun there are stars close to
 

7127
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:21,270
around the sun there are stars close to
the center of the galaxy

7128
02:02:21,270 --> 02:02:21,280
the center of the galaxy
 

7129
02:02:21,280 --> 02:02:23,030
the center of the galaxy
and they are orbiting at very high

7130
02:02:23,030 --> 02:02:23,040
and they are orbiting at very high
 

7131
02:02:23,040 --> 02:02:24,709
and they are orbiting at very high
speeds of order

7132
02:02:24,709 --> 02:02:24,719
speeds of order
 

7133
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:26,629

thousands of miles per second per second
 

7137
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:33,189
thousands of miles per second per second
uh think about it yeah which

7138
02:02:33,189 --> 02:02:33,199
uh think about it yeah which
 

7139
02:02:33,199 --> 02:02:35,430
uh think about it yeah which
uh can only be induced at those

7140
02:02:35,430 --> 02:02:35,440
uh can only be induced at those
 

7141
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:36,229
uh can only be induced at those
distances

7142
02:02:36,229 --> 02:02:36,239
distances
 

7143
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:39,750

if there is a four million
 

7145
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:43,589
if there is a four million
solar mass object that is extremely

compact
 

7149
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:47,030
compact
and the only thing that is compatible

7150
02:02:47,030 --> 02:02:47,040
and the only thing that is compatible
 

7151
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:48,149
and the only thing that is compatible
with the constraints is

7152
02:02:48,149 --> 02:02:48,159
with the constraints is
 

7153
02:02:48,159 --> 02:02:51,750
with the constraints is
a black hole and

7154
02:02:51,750 --> 02:02:51,760

 

7155
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:54,229

they actually made a movie of the motion

7156
02:02:54,229 --> 02:02:54,239
they actually made a movie of the motion
 

7157
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:56,149
they actually made a movie of the motion
of these stars around the center

7158
02:02:56,149 --> 02:02:56,159
of these stars around the center
 

7159
02:02:56,159 --> 02:02:58,310
of these stars around the center
one of them moves around the center over

7160
02:02:58,310 --> 02:02:58,320
one of them moves around the center over
 

7161
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,229
one of them moves around the center over
a decade you know six

7162
02:03:00,229 --> 02:03:00,239
a decade you know six
 

7163
02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:02,790
a decade you know six
over time scales that we can monitor and

7164
02:03:02,790 --> 02:03:02,800
over time scales that we can monitor and
 

7165
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:03,669
over time scales that we can monitor and
um

7166
02:03:03,669 --> 02:03:03,679
um
 

7167
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:06,870
um
it was a breakthrough in a way um

7168
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:06,880
it was a breakthrough in a way um
 

7169
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,990
it was a breakthrough in a way um
so combining ligo with

7170
02:03:09,990 --> 02:03:10,000
so combining ligo with
 

7171
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:12,070
so combining ligo with
uh the detection of a black hole at the

7172
02:03:12,070 --> 02:03:12,080
uh the detection of a black hole at the
 

7173
02:03:12,080 --> 02:03:13,990
uh the detection of a black hole at the
center of the milky way and and in many

7174
02:03:13,990 --> 02:03:14,000
center of the milky way and and in many
 

7175
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,589
center of the milky way and and in many
other galaxies like quasars uh you know

7176
02:03:17,589 --> 02:03:17,599
other galaxies like quasars uh you know
 

7177
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:20,709
other galaxies like quasars uh you know
now i would say

7178
02:03:20,709 --> 02:03:20,719
now i would say
 

7179
02:03:20,719 --> 02:03:23,270
now i would say
black hole research is vogue you know

7180
02:03:23,270 --> 02:03:23,280
black hole research is vogue you know
 

7181
02:03:23,280 --> 02:03:25,030
black hole research is vogue you know
it's it's very much in fashion

7182
02:03:25,030 --> 02:03:25,040
it's it's very much in fashion
 

7183
02:03:25,040 --> 02:03:27,589
it's it's very much in fashion
you know we saw it back in 2016 when we

7184
02:03:27,589 --> 02:03:27,599
you know we saw it back in 2016 when we
 

7185
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:28,229
you know we saw it back in 2016 when we
established

7186
02:03:28,229 --> 02:03:28,239
established
 

7187
02:03:28,239 --> 02:03:31,430

the black hole initiative yes you kind
of saw

7190
02:03:32,229 --> 02:03:32,239
of saw
 

7191
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:35,589
of saw
that there is this excitement about in

black holes
 

7197
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:41,109
black holes
which are probably one of the most

7198
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:41,119
which are probably one of the most
 

7199
02:03:41,119 --> 02:03:42,709
which are probably one of the most
fascinating objects in the universe i

02:03:42,709 --> 02:03:42,719
fascinating objects in the universe i
 

7201
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:43,589
fascinating objects in the universe i

it's up there uh they're both terrifying
and beautiful

7206

of the physics that we know about this
 

7211
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:52,550
of the physics that we know about this
universe i should say the re

you know the question is where is the
 

7215
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:56,470
you know the question is where is the
nearest black hole can we visit it

7216
02:03:56,470 --> 02:03:56,480
nearest black hole can we visit it
 

7217
02:03:56,480 --> 02:03:59,750
nearest black hole can we visit it
and you know i wrote a paper with my

7218
02:03:59,750 --> 02:03:59,760
and you know i wrote a paper with my
 

7219
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:01,030
and you know i wrote a paper with my
undergraduate student

7220

amir siraj suggesting that perhaps

7222
02:04:04,310 --> 02:04:04,320
amir siraj suggesting that perhaps
 

7223
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,830
amir siraj suggesting that perhaps
you know there could be if there is one

7224
02:04:05,830 --> 02:04:05,840
you know there could be if there is one
 

7225
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,229
you know there could be if there is one
in the solar system we can detect it

7226
02:04:08,229 --> 02:04:08,239
in the solar system we can detect it
 

7227
02:04:08,239 --> 02:04:10,870
in the solar system we can detect it
because um i don't know if you heard but

7228
02:04:10,870 --> 02:04:10,880
because um i don't know if you heard but
 

7229
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:13,990
because um i don't know if you heard but
there is a claim that maybe there is a

7230
02:04:13,990 --> 02:04:14,000
there is a claim that maybe there is a
 

7231
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:17,830
there is a claim that maybe there is a
planet nine in the solar system uh

7232
02:04:17,830 --> 02:04:17,840
planet nine in the solar system uh
 

7233
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:19,830
planet nine in the solar system uh
because we see some anomalies at the

7234
02:04:19,830 --> 02:04:19,840
because we see some anomalies at the
 

7235
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:21,589
because we see some anomalies at the
outer parts of the solar system so some

7236
02:04:21,589 --> 02:04:21,599
outer parts of the solar system so some
 

7237
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:23,510
outer parts of the solar system so some
people suggested maybe there is a planet

7238
02:04:23,510 --> 02:04:23,520
people suggested maybe there is a planet
 

7239
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:24,629
people suggested maybe there is a planet
out there that

7240
02:04:24,629 --> 02:04:24,639
out there that
 

7241
02:04:24,639 --> 02:04:27,830
out there that
was not yet detected so people searched

7242
02:04:27,830 --> 02:04:27,840
was not yet detected so people searched
 

7243
02:04:27,840 --> 02:04:29,430
was not yet detected so people searched
for it didn't find it

7244
02:04:29,430 --> 02:04:29,440
for it didn't find it
 

7245
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:31,270
for it didn't find it
it weighs roughly five times the mass of

7246
02:04:31,270 --> 02:04:31,280
it weighs roughly five times the mass of
 

7247
02:04:31,280 --> 02:04:33,750
it weighs roughly five times the mass of
the earth and we said okay maybe you

7248
02:04:33,750 --> 02:04:33,760
the earth and we said okay maybe you
 

7249
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:36,390
the earth and we said okay maybe you
can't find it because it's a black hole

7250
02:04:36,390 --> 02:04:36,400
can't find it because it's a black hole
 

7251
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,149
can't find it because it's a black hole
that was formed early in the universe

7252
02:04:38,149 --> 02:04:38,159
that was formed early in the universe
 

7253
02:04:38,159 --> 02:04:40,790
that was formed early in the universe
is that part so where do you stand up it

7254
02:04:40,790 --> 02:04:40,800
is that part so where do you stand up it
 

7255
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,550
is that part so where do you stand up it
could be that the dark matter is made of

7256
02:04:42,550 --> 02:04:42,560
could be that the dark matter is made of
 

7257
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,149
could be that the dark matter is made of
black holes of this mass you know we

7258
02:04:44,149 --> 02:04:44,159
black holes of this mass you know we
 

7259
02:04:44,159 --> 02:04:45,430
black holes of this mass you know we
don't know what the dark matter is made

7260
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:45,440
don't know what the dark matter is made
 

7261
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,229
don't know what the dark matter is made
of you could

7262
02:04:46,229 --> 02:04:46,239
of you could
 

7263
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:48,950
of you could
it could be the black holes so we said

7264
02:04:48,950 --> 02:04:48,960
it could be the black holes so we said
 

7265
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:51,030
it could be the black holes so we said
but there is an experimental way to test

7266
02:04:51,030 --> 02:04:51,040
but there is an experimental way to test
 

7267
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:51,750
but there is an experimental way to test
it

7268
02:04:51,750 --> 02:04:51,760
it
 

7269
02:04:51,760 --> 02:04:55,030
it
and the way to do it is because uh

7270
02:04:55,030 --> 02:04:55,040
and the way to do it is because uh
 

7271
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:58,550
and the way to do it is because uh
is there is the oort cloud of icy

7272
02:04:58,550 --> 02:04:58,560
is there is the oort cloud of icy
 

7273
02:04:58,560 --> 02:05:01,589
is there is the oort cloud of icy
rocks in the outer solar system and if

7274
02:05:01,589 --> 02:05:01,599
rocks in the outer solar system and if
 

7275
02:05:01,599 --> 02:05:04,470
rocks in the outer solar system and if
you imagine a black hole there

7276
02:05:04,470 --> 02:05:04,480
you imagine a black hole there
 

7277
02:05:04,480 --> 02:05:06,149
you imagine a black hole there
every now and then a rock will pass

7278
02:05:06,149 --> 02:05:06,159
every now and then a rock will pass
 

7279
02:05:06,159 --> 02:05:08,069
every now and then a rock will pass
close enough to the black hole

7280
02:05:08,069 --> 02:05:08,079
close enough to the black hole
 

7281
02:05:08,079 --> 02:05:10,310
close enough to the black hole
to be disrupted by the very strong

7282
02:05:10,310 --> 02:05:10,320
to be disrupted by the very strong
 

7283
02:05:10,320 --> 02:05:11,109
to be disrupted by the very strong
gravity

7284
02:05:11,109 --> 02:05:11,119
gravity
 

7285
02:05:11,119 --> 02:05:12,790
gravity
close to the black hole and that would

7286
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:12,800
close to the black hole and that would
 

7287
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:15,350
close to the black hole and that would
produce a flare that you can observe

7288
02:05:15,350 --> 02:05:15,360
produce a flare that you can observe
 

7289
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:17,350
produce a flare that you can observe
and we calculated how frequently these

7290
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:17,360
and we calculated how frequently these
 

7291
02:05:17,360 --> 02:05:18,870
and we calculated how frequently these
flares should occur

7292
02:05:18,870 --> 02:05:18,880
flares should occur
 

7293
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:20,870
flares should occur
and with lsst on the vera rubin

7294
02:05:20,870 --> 02:05:20,880
and with lsst on the vera rubin
 

7295
02:05:20,880 --> 02:05:22,310
and with lsst on the vera rubin
observatory we found that you can

7296
02:05:22,310 --> 02:05:22,320
observatory we found that you can
 

7297
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:23,109
observatory we found that you can
actually

7298
02:05:23,109 --> 02:05:23,119
actually
 

7299
02:05:23,119 --> 02:05:25,109
actually
test this hypothesis that's brilliant

7300
02:05:25,109 --> 02:05:25,119
test this hypothesis that's brilliant
 

7301
02:05:25,119 --> 02:05:27,109
test this hypothesis that's brilliant
and if you don't see flares

7302
02:05:27,109 --> 02:05:27,119
and if you don't see flares
 

7303
02:05:27,119 --> 02:05:29,189
and if you don't see flares
then you can put limits on the existence

7304
02:05:29,189 --> 02:05:29,199
then you can put limits on the existence
 

7305
02:05:29,199 --> 02:05:31,189
then you can put limits on the existence
of a black hole in the solar system

7306
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:31,199
of a black hole in the solar system
 

7307
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:32,950
of a black hole in the solar system
it would be extremely exciting if there

7308
02:05:32,950 --> 02:05:32,960
it would be extremely exciting if there
 

7309
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:35,030
it would be extremely exciting if there
was a black hole if planet nine was a

7310
02:05:35,030 --> 02:05:35,040
was a black hole if planet nine was a
 

7311
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:36,390
was a black hole if planet nine was a
black hole because

7312
02:05:36,390 --> 02:05:36,400
black hole because
 

7313
02:05:36,400 --> 02:05:38,390
black hole because
we could visit it you know and we can

7314
02:05:38,390 --> 02:05:38,400
we could visit it you know and we can
 

7315
02:05:38,400 --> 02:05:40,629
we could visit it you know and we can
examine it

7316
02:05:40,629 --> 02:05:40,639
examine it
 

7317
02:05:40,639 --> 02:05:43,350
examine it
and it will not be a matter of you know

7318
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:43,360
and it will not be a matter of you know
 

7319
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:46,069
and it will not be a matter of you know
an object that is very removed from us

7320
02:05:46,069 --> 02:05:46,079
an object that is very removed from us
 

7321
02:05:46,079 --> 02:05:47,910
an object that is very removed from us
another thing i should say is it's

7322
02:05:47,910 --> 02:05:47,920
another thing i should say is it's
 

7323
02:05:47,920 --> 02:05:49,510
another thing i should say is it's
possible that the black hole affected

7324
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:49,520
possible that the black hole affected
 

7325
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:51,430
possible that the black hole affected
life on earth

7326
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:51,440
life on earth
 

7327
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:53,589
life on earth
uh the black hole at the center of the

7328
02:05:53,589 --> 02:05:53,599
uh the black hole at the center of the
 

7329
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:55,669
uh the black hole at the center of the
milky way

7330
02:05:55,669 --> 02:05:55,679
milky way
 

7331
02:05:55,679 --> 02:05:58,550
milky way
how you know that black hole right now

7332
02:05:58,550 --> 02:05:58,560
how you know that black hole right now
 

7333
02:05:58,560 --> 02:05:59,430
how you know that black hole right now
is dormant

7334
02:05:59,430 --> 02:05:59,440
is dormant
 

7335
02:05:59,440 --> 02:06:02,870
is dormant
it's very faint but we know that it

7336
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:02,880
it's very faint but we know that it
 

7337
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:04,149
it's very faint but we know that it
flares

7338
02:06:04,149 --> 02:06:04,159
flares
 

7339
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:06,390
flares
when a star like the sun comes close to

7340
02:06:06,390 --> 02:06:06,400
when a star like the sun comes close to
 

7341
02:06:06,400 --> 02:06:07,430
when a star like the sun comes close to
it

7342
02:06:07,430 --> 02:06:07,440
it
 

7343
02:06:07,440 --> 02:06:09,910
it
the star will be spaghettified basically

7344
02:06:09,910 --> 02:06:09,920
the star will be spaghettified basically
 

7345
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:10,550
the star will be spaghettified basically
becomes

7346
02:06:10,550 --> 02:06:10,560
becomes
 

7347
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:13,589
becomes
a stream of gas like a spaghetti

7348
02:06:13,589 --> 02:06:13,599
a stream of gas like a spaghetti
 

7349
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:15,669
a stream of gas like a spaghetti
and then the gas would fall into the

7350
02:06:15,669 --> 02:06:15,679
and then the gas would fall into the
 

7351
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:17,589
and then the gas would fall into the
black hole and there would be a flare

7352
02:06:17,589 --> 02:06:17,599
black hole and there would be a flare
 

7353
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:19,910
black hole and there would be a flare
and this process happens once every 10

7354
02:06:19,910 --> 02:06:19,920
and this process happens once every 10
 

7355
02:06:19,920 --> 02:06:21,830
and this process happens once every 10
000 years or so so we expect that

7356
02:06:21,830 --> 02:06:21,840
000 years or so so we expect that
 

7357
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:23,830
000 years or so so we expect that
you know these flares to occur every 10

7358
02:06:23,830 --> 02:06:23,840
you know these flares to occur every 10
 

7359
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,270
you know these flares to occur every 10
000 years

7360
02:06:25,270 --> 02:06:25,280
000 years
 

7361
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:28,149
000 years
but we also see evidence for the

7362
02:06:28,149 --> 02:06:28,159
but we also see evidence for the
 

7363
02:06:28,159 --> 02:06:29,669
but we also see evidence for the
possibility that gas

7364
02:06:29,669 --> 02:06:29,679
possibility that gas
 

7365
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:31,990
possibility that gas
clouds were disrupted by the black hole

7366
02:06:31,990 --> 02:06:32,000
clouds were disrupted by the black hole
 

7367
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,069
clouds were disrupted by the black hole
because the the stars that are close to

7368
02:06:34,069 --> 02:06:34,079
because the the stars that are close to
 

7369
02:06:34,079 --> 02:06:34,950
because the the stars that are close to
the black hole

7370
02:06:34,950 --> 02:06:34,960
the black hole
 

7371
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:38,229
the black hole
are residing in a single or two planes

7372
02:06:38,229 --> 02:06:38,239
are residing in a single or two planes
 

7373
02:06:38,239 --> 02:06:40,069
are residing in a single or two planes
and the only way you can get that is if

7374
02:06:40,069 --> 02:06:40,079
and the only way you can get that is if
 

7375
02:06:40,079 --> 02:06:42,069
and the only way you can get that is if
they formed out of a disk of gas

7376
02:06:42,069 --> 02:06:42,079
they formed out of a disk of gas
 

7377
02:06:42,079 --> 02:06:43,510
they formed out of a disk of gas
just like the planets in the solar

7378
02:06:43,510 --> 02:06:43,520
just like the planets in the solar
 

7379
02:06:43,520 --> 02:06:45,750
just like the planets in the solar
system formed so

7380
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:45,760
system formed so
 

7381
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:48,069
system formed so
there is evidence that gas fell into the

7382
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:48,079
there is evidence that gas fell into the
 

7383
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:49,830
there is evidence that gas fell into the
black hole and powered

7384
02:06:49,830 --> 02:06:49,840
black hole and powered
 

7385
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:53,109
black hole and powered
possibly a flare and these flares

7386
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:53,119
possibly a flare and these flares
 

7387
02:06:53,119 --> 02:06:56,229
possibly a flare and these flares
produce x-rays and ultraviolet radiation

7388
02:06:56,229 --> 02:06:56,239
produce x-rays and ultraviolet radiation
 

7389
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:59,669
produce x-rays and ultraviolet radiation
that could damage life if if the earth

7390
02:06:59,669 --> 02:06:59,679
that could damage life if if the earth
 

7391
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:02,149
that could damage life if if the earth
was close enough to the center of the

7392
02:07:02,149 --> 02:07:02,159
was close enough to the center of the
 

7393
02:07:02,159 --> 02:07:03,510
was close enough to the center of the
galaxy

7394

7395
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,669

where we are right now it's not very

02:07:05,669 --> 02:07:05,679
where we are right now it's not very
 

7397
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:07,030
where we are right now it's not very
risky for us

7398
02:07:07,030 --> 02:07:07,040
risky for us
 

7399
02:07:07,040 --> 02:07:08,790
risky for us
but there is a

system the sun

7406
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:13,840
system the sun
 

7407
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:16,550
system the sun
was closer to the galactic center early

7408
02:07:16,550 --> 02:07:16,560
was closer to the galactic center early
 

7409
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:18,149
was closer to the galactic center early
on and then it migrated

7410
02:07:18,149 --> 02:07:18,159
on and then it migrated
 

7411
02:07:18,159 --> 02:07:22,870
on and then it migrated
outwards so maybe maybe in the early

7412
02:07:22,870 --> 02:07:22,880
outwards so maybe maybe in the early
 

7413
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,870
outwards so maybe maybe in the early
stage of the solar system the conditions

7414
02:07:26,870 --> 02:07:26,880
stage of the solar system the conditions
 

7415
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,109
stage of the solar system the conditions
you know were affected shaped by these

7416
02:07:29,109 --> 02:07:29,119
you know were affected shaped by these
 

7417
02:07:29,119 --> 02:07:29,990
you know were affected shaped by these
flares

7418
02:07:29,990 --> 02:07:30,000
flares
 

7419
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,189
flares
of the black hole at the center of the

7420
02:07:31,189 --> 02:07:31,199
of the black hole at the center of the
 

7421
02:07:31,199 --> 02:07:33,109
of the black hole at the center of the
galaxy and that's why for the first two

7422
02:07:33,109 --> 02:07:33,119
galaxy and that's why for the first two
 

7423
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:34,470
galaxy and that's why for the first two
billion years there wasn't

7424
02:07:34,470 --> 02:07:34,480
billion years there wasn't
 

7425
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:36,149
billion years there wasn't
any oxygen in the atmosphere you know

7426
02:07:36,149 --> 02:07:36,159
any oxygen in the atmosphere you know
 

7427
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:37,669
any oxygen in the atmosphere you know
who knows but

7428
02:07:37,669 --> 02:07:37,679
who knows but
 

7429
02:07:37,679 --> 02:07:40,069
who knows but
um it's just interesting to think that

7430
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:40,079
um it's just interesting to think that
 

7431
02:07:40,079 --> 02:07:41,109
um it's just interesting to think that
you know from a

7432
02:07:41,109 --> 02:07:41,119
you know from a
 

7433
02:07:41,119 --> 02:07:42,950
you know from a
theoretical concept that einstein

7434
02:07:42,950 --> 02:07:42,960
theoretical concept that einstein
 

7435
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,430
theoretical concept that einstein
resisted in 1939

7436
02:07:45,430 --> 02:07:45,440
resisted in 1939
 

7437
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:48,550
resisted in 1939
it may well be that you know black holes

7438
02:07:48,550 --> 02:07:48,560
it may well be that you know black holes
 

7439
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:50,709
it may well be that you know black holes
have influence on our life and that you

7440
02:07:50,709 --> 02:07:50,719
have influence on our life and that you
 

7441
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:52,229
have influence on our life and that you
know it's just like discovering that

7442
02:07:52,229 --> 02:07:52,239
know it's just like discovering that
 

7443
02:07:52,239 --> 02:07:53,189
know it's just like discovering that
some

uh stranger
 

7447
02:07:56,320 --> 02:08:00,709
uh stranger
affected your family and

7448
02:08:00,709 --> 02:08:00,719
affected your family and
 

7449
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:04,069
affected your family and
in a way your life and um you know if

7450
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:04,079
in a way your life and um you know if
 

7451
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:05,430
in a way your life and um you know if
that happens to be the case

7452
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:05,440
that happens to be the case
 

7453
02:08:05,440 --> 02:08:08,149
that happens to be the case
a second nobel prize should be given not

7454
02:08:08,149 --> 02:08:08,159
a second nobel prize should be given not
 

7455
02:08:08,159 --> 02:08:09,109
a second nobel prize should be given not
not for

7456
02:08:09,109 --> 02:08:09,119
not for
 

7457
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:11,109
not for
just the discovery of this black hole at

7458
02:08:11,109 --> 02:08:11,119
just the discovery of this black hole at
 

7459
02:08:11,119 --> 02:08:12,310
just the discovery of this black hole at
the center of the galaxy but

7460
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:12,320
the center of the galaxy but
 

7461
02:08:12,320 --> 02:08:14,709
the center of the galaxy but
perhaps for the nobel prize in chemistry

7462
02:08:14,709 --> 02:08:14,719
perhaps for the nobel prize in chemistry
 

7463
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:16,390
perhaps for the nobel prize in chemistry
for the effect that it had for the

7464
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:16,400
for the effect that it had for the
 

7465
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:18,069
for the effect that it had for the
fact for the for the interplay that

7466
02:08:18,069 --> 02:08:18,079
fact for the for the interplay that
 

7467
02:08:18,079 --> 02:08:20,550
fact for the for the interplay that
resulted in some kind of

7468
02:08:20,550 --> 02:08:20,560
resulted in some kind of
 

7469
02:08:20,560 --> 02:08:23,669
resulted in some kind of
uh yeah so yeah the chemical effect

7470
02:08:23,669 --> 02:08:23,679
uh yeah so yeah the chemical effect
 

7471
02:08:23,679 --> 02:08:25,430
uh yeah so yeah the chemical effect
bio biology i mean all those kinds of

7472
02:08:25,430 --> 02:08:25,440
bio biology i mean all those kinds of
 

7473
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:27,350
bio biology i mean all those kinds of
things in in terms of uh

7474
02:08:27,350 --> 02:08:27,360
things in in terms of uh
 

7475
02:08:27,360 --> 02:08:29,910
things in in terms of uh
the emergence of uh life and the

7476
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
the emergence of uh life and the
 

7477
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:32,069
the emergence of uh life and the
creation of a habitable environment

7478
02:08:32,069 --> 02:08:32,079
creation of a habitable environment
 

7479
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:34,229
creation of a habitable environment
that's so fascinating and of course like

7480
02:08:34,229 --> 02:08:34,239
that's so fascinating and of course like
 

7481
02:08:34,239 --> 02:08:35,430
that's so fascinating and of course like
you said dark matter like

7482
02:08:35,430 --> 02:08:35,440
you said dark matter like
 

7483
02:08:35,440 --> 02:08:37,350
you said dark matter like
black holes have some so they could be

7484
02:08:37,350 --> 02:08:37,360
black holes have some so they could be
 

7485
02:08:37,360 --> 02:08:39,510
black holes have some so they could be
the dark matter in principle yes

7486
02:08:39,510 --> 02:08:39,520
the dark matter in principle yes
 

7487
02:08:39,520 --> 02:08:42,069
the dark matter in principle yes
uh we don't know uh what the dark matter

7488
02:08:42,069 --> 02:08:42,079

you know uh the natural

you know uh the natural

02:10:42,880 --> 02:10:44,870
you know uh the natural
progression of science is based on trial

progression of science is based on trial

and error you know it's
 

7607
02:10:46,239 --> 02:10:47,990
and error you know it's
reporting some results and perhaps

7608
02:10:47,990 --> 02:10:48,000
reporting some results and perhaps
 

7609
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:50,390
reporting some results and perhaps
they're wrong but then other people find

7610
02:10:50,390 --> 02:10:50,400
they're wrong but then other people find
 

7611
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:52,069
they're wrong but then other people find
perhaps better evidence and then you

7612
02:10:52,069 --> 02:10:52,079
perhaps better evidence and then you
 

7613
02:10:52,079 --> 02:10:53,589
perhaps better evidence and then you
figure out what's going on

7614
02:10:53,589 --> 02:10:53,599
figure out what's going on
 

7615
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:55,189
figure out what's going on
and that's the natural way that science

7616
02:10:55,189 --> 02:10:55,199
and that's the natural way that science
 

7617
02:10:55,199 --> 02:10:57,109
and that's the natural way that science
is you know it's a learning experience

7618
02:10:57,109 --> 02:10:57,119
is you know it's a learning experience

is you know it's a learning experience
so if you give the public an image by

7620
02:11:00,069 --> 02:11:00,079
so if you give the public an image by
 

7621
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:00,790
so if you give the public an image by
which

7622
02:11:00,790 --> 02:11:00,800
which
 

7623
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:03,589
which
scientists are always right you know and

7624
02:11:03,589 --> 02:11:03,599
scientists are always right you know and
 

7625
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:04,950
scientists are always right you know and
and you know some of my colleagues say

7626
02:11:04,950 --> 02:11:04,960
and you know some of my colleagues say
 

7627
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:06,069
and you know some of my colleagues say
we must do that

7628
02:11:06,069 --> 02:11:06,079
we must do that
 

7629
02:11:06,079 --> 02:11:07,589
we must do that
because otherwise the public will never

7630
02:11:07,589 --> 02:11:07,599
because otherwise the public will never
 

7631
02:11:07,599 --> 02:11:09,350
because otherwise the public will never
believe us that global warming is really

7632
02:11:09,350 --> 02:11:09,360
believe us that global warming is really
 

7633
02:11:09,360 --> 02:11:10,149
believe us that global warming is really
taking place

7634
02:11:10,149 --> 02:11:10,159
taking place
 

7635
02:11:10,159 --> 02:11:11,589
taking place
right but that's not true because the

7636
02:11:11,589 --> 02:11:11,599
right but that's not true because the
 

7637
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:13,589
right but that's not true because the
public would really believe you

7638
02:11:13,589 --> 02:11:13,599
public would really believe you
 

7639
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:15,589
public would really believe you
if you show the evidence yes so the

7640
02:11:15,589 --> 02:11:15,599
if you show the evidence yes so the
 

7641
02:11:15,599 --> 02:11:17,109
if you show the evidence yes so the
point is you should be sincere when the

7642
02:11:17,109 --> 02:11:17,119
point is you should be sincere when the
 

7643
02:11:17,119 --> 02:11:18,550
point is you should be sincere when the
evidence is not

7644
02:11:18,550 --> 02:11:18,560
evidence is not
 

7645
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:20,069
evidence is not
absolutely clear or where there are

02:11:20,069 --> 02:11:20,079
absolutely clear or where there are

absolutely clear or where there are
disputes about the interpretation of the

disputes about the interpretation of the
 

7649
02:11:21,679 --> 02:11:23,189
disputes about the interpretation of the
evidence we should show us

02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:26,550
evidence we should show us
you know the king is naked okay there is

7652
02:11:26,550 --> 02:11:26,560
you know the king is naked okay there is
 

7653
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:27,910
you know the king is naked okay there is
no point in pretending

7654
02:11:27,910 --> 02:11:27,920
no point in pretending
 

7655
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:30,629
no point in pretending
that the king is dressed yes saying that

that the king is dressed yes saying that
 

7657
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:32,149
that the king is dressed yes saying that
scientists are always right

7658
02:11:32,149 --> 02:11:32,159
scientists are always right
 

7659
02:11:32,159 --> 02:11:35,589
scientists are always right
scientists are wrong frequently and

7660
02:11:35,589 --> 02:11:35,599
scientists are wrong frequently and
 

7661
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:37,430
scientists are wrong frequently and
the only way to make progress is by

7662
02:11:37,430 --> 02:11:37,440
the only way to make progress is by
 

7663
02:11:37,440 --> 02:11:39,430
the only way to make progress is by
evidence giving us

7664
02:11:39,430 --> 02:11:39,440
evidence giving us
 

7665
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:41,990
evidence giving us
the support that we need to make

7666
02:11:41,990 --> 02:11:42,000
the support that we need to make
 

7667
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:44,069
the support that we need to make
airtight arguments so when you say

7668
02:11:44,069 --> 02:11:44,079
airtight arguments so when you say
 

7669
02:11:44,079 --> 02:11:46,390
airtight arguments so when you say
global warming is taking place if the

7670
02:11:46,390 --> 02:11:46,400
global warming is taking place if the
 

7671
02:11:46,400 --> 02:11:47,270
global warming is taking place if the
evidence

7672
02:11:47,270 --> 02:11:47,280
evidence
 

7673
02:11:47,280 --> 02:11:49,430
evidence
is fully supportive if there are no

7674
02:11:49,430 --> 02:11:49,440
is fully supportive if there are no
 

7675
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:51,350
is fully supportive if there are no
holes in the argument

7676
02:11:51,350 --> 02:11:51,360
holes in the argument
 

7677
02:11:51,360 --> 02:11:53,669
holes in the argument
then people will be convinced because

7678
02:11:53,669 --> 02:11:53,679
then people will be convinced because
 

7679
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:55,030
then people will be convinced because
you're not trying to fool them

7680
02:11:55,030 --> 02:11:55,040
you're not trying to fool them
 

7681
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,629
you're not trying to fool them
when the evidence was not complete you

7682
02:11:56,629 --> 02:11:56,639
when the evidence was not complete you
 

7683
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:58,149
when the evidence was not complete you
also show them that the evidence is not

7684
02:11:58,149 --> 02:11:58,159
also show them that the evidence is not
 

7685
02:11:58,159 --> 02:11:59,990
also show them that the evidence is not
complete and when there's holes you show

7686
02:11:59,990 --> 02:12:00,000
complete and when there's holes you show
 

7687
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,270
complete and when there's holes you show
that there's holes and here's the

7688
02:12:01,270 --> 02:12:01,280
that there's holes and here's the
 

7689
02:12:01,280 --> 02:12:03,109
that there's holes and here's the
methodology we're using to try to close

7690
02:12:03,109 --> 02:12:03,119
methodology we're using to try to close
 

7691
02:12:03,119 --> 02:12:03,589
methodology we're using to try to close
those holes

7692
02:12:03,589 --> 02:12:03,599
those holes
 

7693
02:12:03,599 --> 02:12:06,069
those holes
exactly let's be sincere why pretend so

7694
02:12:06,069 --> 02:12:06,079
exactly let's be sincere why pretend so
 

7695
02:12:06,079 --> 02:12:06,790
exactly let's be sincere why pretend so
if there were no

7696
02:12:06,790 --> 02:12:06,800
if there were no
 

7697
02:12:06,800 --> 02:12:08,390
if there were no
in a world where there would there were

7698
02:12:08,390 --> 02:12:08,400
in a world where there would there were
 

7699
02:12:08,400 --> 02:12:10,629
in a world where there would there were
no prizes no honors

7700
02:12:10,629 --> 02:12:10,639
no prizes no honors
 

7701
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:13,589
no prizes no honors
we would act like kids as i said before

7702
02:12:13,589 --> 02:12:13,599
we would act like kids as i said before
 

7703

we would really be
 

7705
02:12:14,960 --> 02:12:16,709
we would really be
focusing on the ball and not on the

7706
02:12:16,709 --> 02:12:16,719
focusing on the ball and not on the
 

7707
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:18,390
focusing on the ball and not on the
audience yeah the prizes

audience yeah the prizes
 

7709
02:12:18,400 --> 02:12:21,109
audience yeah the prizes
get in the way and it's it's so powerful

7710
02:12:21,109 --> 02:12:21,119
get in the way and it's it's so powerful

02:12:24,149 --> 02:12:24,159
do you think in some sense the few
 

7715
02:12:24,159 --> 02:12:26,229
do you think in some sense the few
people have turned down the prize

7716
02:12:26,229 --> 02:12:26,239
people have turned down the prize
 

7717
02:12:26,239 --> 02:12:28,629

the mathematicians to his earlier work
 

7763
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:21,030
the mathematicians to his earlier work
where they dismissed it they didn't

7764
02:13:21,030 --> 02:13:21,040
where they dismissed it they didn't
 

7765
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:22,950
where they dismissed it they didn't
attend to the details and and didn't

uh volumes
 

7777
02:13:32,320 --> 02:13:34,069
uh volumes
about the current scientific culture

7778
02:13:34,069 --> 02:13:34,079
about the current scientific culture
 

7779
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:35,750
about the current scientific culture
which is uh

7780
02:13:35,750 --> 02:13:35,760
which is uh
 

7781
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:39,270
which is uh
based on group think and on

7782
02:13:39,270 --> 02:13:39,280
based on group think and on
 

7783
02:13:39,280 --> 02:13:42,629
based on group think and on
social interaction rather than on the

02:13:45,990 --> 02:13:46,000
and on the evidence in the context of
 

7789
02:13:46,000 --> 02:13:47,830
and on the evidence in the context of
physics so in mathematics there is no

02:13:47,830 --> 02:13:47,840
physics so in mathematics there is no
 

7791
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:49,350
physics so in mathematics there is no
empirical basis

7793
02:13:49,360 --> 02:13:51,270

you're exploring ideas that are

7794
02:13:51,270 --> 02:13:51,280
you're exploring ideas that are
 

7795
02:13:51,280 --> 02:13:52,870
you're exploring ideas that are
logically consistent

7796
02:13:52,870 --> 02:13:52,880
logically consistent
 

7797
02:13:52,880 --> 02:13:56,069
logically consistent
uh but nevertheless there is this uh

7798
02:13:56,069 --> 02:13:56,079
uh but nevertheless there is this uh
 

7799
02:13:56,079 --> 02:13:59,109
uh but nevertheless there is this uh
group thing and i think he was so

7800
02:13:59,109 --> 02:13:59,119
group thing and i think he was so
 

7801
02:13:59,119 --> 02:14:00,709
group thing and i think he was so
frustrated with his past

7802
02:14:00,709 --> 02:14:00,719
frustrated with his past
 

7803
02:14:00,719 --> 02:14:03,030
frustrated with his past
experience that he didn't even bother to

7804
02:14:03,030 --> 02:14:03,040
experience that he didn't even bother to
 

7805
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,790
experience that he didn't even bother to
publish his papers he

7806
02:14:04,790 --> 02:14:04,800
publish his papers he
 

7807
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:07,669
publish his papers he
just posted them on the archive and um

7808
02:14:07,669 --> 02:14:07,679
just posted them on the archive and um
 

7809
02:14:07,679 --> 02:14:08,229
just posted them on the archive and um

02:14:58,880 --> 02:15:00,470
uh from a physics perspective from a
just a philosophical perspective but

02:15:01,669 --> 02:15:01,679
like with the rigor
 

7861
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:03,669
like with the rigor
like proposing different kind of

02:15:03,669 --> 02:15:03,679
like proposing different kind of
 

7863
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,109
like proposing different kind of
hypotheses of how

7864
02:15:05,109 --> 02:15:05,119
hypotheses of how
 

7865
02:15:05,119 --> 02:15:06,790
hypotheses of how
consciousness might be able to emerge in

02:15:06,790 --> 02:15:06,800
consciousness might be able to emerge in
 

7867
02:15:06,800 --> 02:15:08,870
consciousness might be able to emerge in
the brain and it's possible that that is

7868
02:15:08,870 --> 02:15:08,880
the brain and it's possible that that is
 

7869
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:10,310
the brain and it's possible that that is
the thing he's remembered for if you

7870
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:10,320
the thing he's remembered for if you
 

7871
02:15:10,320 --> 02:15:11,830
the thing he's remembered for if you
look hundred years from now

7872
02:15:11,830 --> 02:15:11,840
look hundred years from now
 

7873
02:15:11,840 --> 02:15:14,790
look hundred years from now
right as opposed to the the work in the

7874
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:14,800
right as opposed to the the work in the
 

7875
02:15:14,800 --> 02:15:16,790
right as opposed to the the work in the
black holes which fits into the

7876
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:16,800
black holes which fits into the
 

7877
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:20,310
black holes which fits into the
kind of asp like the

7878
02:15:20,310 --> 02:15:20,320
kind of asp like the
 

7879
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:22,629
kind of asp like the
fits into what the current scientific

7880
02:15:22,629 --> 02:15:22,639
fits into what the current scientific
 

7881
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:23,350
fits into what the current scientific
community

7882
02:15:23,350 --> 02:15:23,360
community
 

7883
02:15:23,360 --> 02:15:27,430
community
uh uh allows to be the the space of what

7884
02:15:27,430 --> 02:15:27,440
uh uh allows to be the the space of what
 

7885
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:27,830
uh uh allows to be the the space of what
is

7886
02:15:27,830 --> 02:15:27,840
is
 

7887
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:29,589
is
and isn't science yeah it's really

7888
02:15:29,589 --> 02:15:29,599
and isn't science yeah it's really
 

7889
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:31,109
and isn't science yeah it's really
interesting to look at people that are

7890
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:31,119
interesting to look at people that are
 

7891
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:32,390
interesting to look at people that are
innovators

7892
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:32,400
innovators
 

7893
02:15:32,400 --> 02:15:35,669
innovators
where in some phases of their career

7894
02:15:35,669 --> 02:15:35,679
where in some phases of their career
 

7895
02:15:35,679 --> 02:15:38,950
where in some phases of their career
their ideas fit into the uh

7896
02:15:38,950 --> 02:15:38,960
their ideas fit into the uh
 

7897
02:15:38,960 --> 02:15:41,189
their ideas fit into the uh
social structure that is around them but

7898
02:15:41,189 --> 02:15:41,199
social structure that is around them but
 

7899
02:15:41,199 --> 02:15:42,390
social structure that is around them but
in other phases

7900
02:15:42,390 --> 02:15:42,400
in other phases
 

7901
02:15:42,400 --> 02:15:45,270
in other phases
it doesn't and when you look at them

7902
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:45,280
it doesn't and when you look at them
 

7903
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:46,790
it doesn't and when you look at them
they just operated the same way

7904
02:15:46,790 --> 02:15:46,800
they just operated the same way
 

7905
02:15:46,800 --> 02:15:47,990
they just operated the same way
throughout

throughout
 

7907
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:51,109
throughout
and it's it says more about their

7908
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:51,119
and it's it says more about their
 

7909
02:15:51,119 --> 02:15:52,709
and it's it says more about their
environment than about them

7910
02:15:52,709 --> 02:15:52,719
environment than about them
 

7911
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:54,310
environment than about them
well yeah i i don't know if you know who

explicit about
 

7923
02:16:02,880 --> 02:16:04,950
explicit about
saying you know being aware which is

something i also recommend
 

7927
02:16:06,239 --> 02:16:07,189
something i also recommend
it's like being aware where the

7928
02:16:07,189 --> 02:16:07,199
it's like being aware where the
 

7929
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:09,430
it's like being aware where the
scientific community stands and doing

7930
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:09,440
scientific community stands and doing
 

7931
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:10,470
scientific community stands and doing
enough to get

7932
02:16:10,470 --> 02:16:10,480
enough to get
 

7933
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:12,550

thinkers
 

7943
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:20,790

is sometimes you have to do some stuff
 

7951
02:16:25,679 --> 02:16:27,350
is sometimes you have to do some stuff
that fits in you publish and you get

7952
02:16:27,350 --> 02:16:27,360
that fits in you publish and you get
 

7953
02:16:27,360 --> 02:16:28,390
that fits in you publish and you get
tenure and all those

7954
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:28,400
tenure and all those
 

7955
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:29,910
tenure and all those
things but the tenure is a great

7956
02:16:29,910 --> 02:16:29,920
things but the tenure is a great
 

7957
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:31,510
things but the tenure is a great
privilege because it allows you

7958
02:16:31,510 --> 02:16:31,520
privilege because it allows you
 

7959
02:16:31,520 --> 02:16:34,070
privilege because it allows you
to in principle explore things that are

not accepted by
 

7963
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:38,790
not accepted by
others and unfortunately it's not being

and
it's a waste of a very precious resource

02:16:45,190 --> 02:16:45,200
it's a waste of a very precious resource
 

7971

it's a waste of a very precious resource
yeah absolutely this space that you kind

uh the theoretical physics community and
 

7989
02:17:05,200 --> 02:17:06,790
uh the theoretical physics community and
the interest in

02:17:13,359 --> 02:17:15,830
with the theory of everything
it's i'm not sure from which direction

this question but how far away are we
 

8001
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:19,910
this question but how far away are we
from

from

02:17:19,920 --> 02:17:22,309
from
arriving at a theory of everything do

arriving at a theory of everything do
 

8005
02:17:22,319 --> 02:17:23,190
arriving at a theory of everything do
you think

you think
 

8007
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:26,950
you think
and uh how would we

8008
02:17:26,950 --> 02:17:26,960
and uh how would we
 

8009
02:17:26,960 --> 02:17:29,990
and uh how would we
how important is it to try to arrive at

02:17:29,990 --> 02:17:30,000
how important is it to try to arrive at

uh at this kind of goal of this
beautiful simple theory that unlocks

02:17:35,030 --> 02:17:35,040
beautiful simple theory that unlocks
 

8017
02:17:35,040 --> 02:17:38,790
beautiful simple theory that unlocks

nature as we know it and
 

8023
02:17:42,399 --> 02:17:46,629
nature as we know it and
you know uh and how what are the kinds

8024
02:17:46,629 --> 02:17:46,639
you know uh and how what are the kinds
 

8025
02:17:46,639 --> 02:17:48,230
you know uh and how what are the kinds

of approaches
 

8027
02:17:48,240 --> 02:17:51,190
of approaches
we need to take to get there yeah so in

8028
02:17:51,190 --> 02:17:51,200
we need to take to get there yeah so in
 

8029
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:53,349
we need to take to get there yeah so in
in physics the biggest challenge is to

8030
02:17:53,349 --> 02:17:53,359
in physics the biggest challenge is to
 

8031
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:56,230
in physics the biggest challenge is to
unify quantum mechanics with gravity

8032
02:17:56,230 --> 02:17:56,240
unify quantum mechanics with gravity
 

8033
02:17:56,240 --> 02:17:59,589
unify quantum mechanics with gravity
and i believe that once we

8034
02:17:59,589 --> 02:17:59,599
and i believe that once we
 

8035
02:17:59,599 --> 02:18:01,509
and i believe that once we
have experimental evidence for how this

8036
02:18:01,509 --> 02:18:01,519
have experimental evidence for how this
 

8037
02:18:01,519 --> 02:18:04,309
have experimental evidence for how this
happens in nature

8038
02:18:04,309 --> 02:18:04,319
happens in nature
 

8039
02:18:04,319 --> 02:18:07,030
happens in nature
in systems that have quantum mechanical

8040
02:18:07,030 --> 02:18:07,040
in systems that have quantum mechanical
 

8041
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,910
in systems that have quantum mechanical
effects but also gravity is important

8042
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:09,920
effects but also gravity is important
 

8043
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:10,389
effects but also gravity is important
then

8044
02:18:10,389 --> 02:18:10,399
then
 

8045
02:18:10,399 --> 02:18:13,990
then
the theory will fall into our lap okay

8046
02:18:13,990 --> 02:18:14,000
the theory will fall into our lap okay
 

8047
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:16,549
the theory will fall into our lap okay
but the mistake that is made by the

8048
02:18:16,549 --> 02:18:16,559
but the mistake that is made by the
 

8049
02:18:16,559 --> 02:18:17,589
but the mistake that is made by the
community right now

8050
02:18:17,589 --> 02:18:17,599
community right now
 

8051
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:21,429
community right now
is to come up uh with the right theory

8052
02:18:21,429 --> 02:18:21,439
is to come up uh with the right theory
 

8053
02:18:21,439 --> 02:18:25,110
is to come up uh with the right theory
from scratch and you know einstein gave

8054
02:18:25,110 --> 02:18:25,120
from scratch and you know einstein gave
 

8055
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:26,549
from scratch and you know einstein gave
the illusion that you can

8056
02:18:26,549 --> 02:18:26,559
the illusion that you can
 

8057
02:18:26,559 --> 02:18:28,549
the illusion that you can
just sit in your office and and

8058
02:18:28,549 --> 02:18:28,559
just sit in your office and and
 

8059
02:18:28,559 --> 02:18:30,389
just sit in your office and and
understand nature you know when he came

8060
02:18:30,389 --> 02:18:30,399
understand nature you know when he came
 

8061
02:18:30,399 --> 02:18:31,910
understand nature you know when he came
up with his

8062
02:18:31,910 --> 02:18:31,920
up with his
 

8063
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:33,990
up with his
general theory of relativity but you

8064
02:18:33,990 --> 02:18:34,000
general theory of relativity but you
 

8065
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,429
general theory of relativity but you
know first of all

8066
02:18:35,429 --> 02:18:35,439
know first of all
 

8067
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:38,469
know first of all
perhaps he was lucky but it's not

8068
02:18:38,469 --> 02:18:38,479
perhaps he was lucky but it's not
 

8069
02:18:38,479 --> 02:18:40,709
perhaps he was lucky but it's not
a rule the rule is that you need

8070
02:18:40,709 --> 02:18:40,719
a rule the rule is that you need
 

8071
02:18:40,719 --> 02:18:42,150
a rule the rule is that you need
evidence to guide you especially when

8072
02:18:42,150 --> 02:18:42,160
evidence to guide you especially when
 

8073
02:18:42,160 --> 02:18:43,910
evidence to guide you especially when
dealing with quantum mechanics which is

8074
02:18:43,910 --> 02:18:43,920
dealing with quantum mechanics which is
 

8075
02:18:43,920 --> 02:18:48,230
dealing with quantum mechanics which is
really not intuitive and

8076
02:18:48,230 --> 02:18:48,240
really not intuitive and
 

8077
02:18:48,240 --> 02:18:51,110
really not intuitive and
so there are two places where the two

8078
02:18:51,110 --> 02:18:51,120
so there are two places where the two
 

8079
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:52,389
so there are two places where the two
theories meet

8080
02:18:52,389 --> 02:18:52,399
theories meet
 

8081
02:18:52,399 --> 02:18:55,349
theories meet
one is black holes and there is a puzzle

8082
02:18:55,349 --> 02:18:55,359
one is black holes and there is a puzzle
 

8083
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:55,750
one is black holes and there is a puzzle
there

8084
02:18:55,750 --> 02:18:55,760
there
 

8085
02:18:55,760 --> 02:18:58,709
there
it's called the information paradox in

8086
02:18:58,709 --> 02:18:58,719
it's called the information paradox in
 

8087
02:18:58,719 --> 02:18:59,910
it's called the information paradox in
principle you can throw

8088
02:18:59,910 --> 02:18:59,920
principle you can throw
 

8089
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:01,910
principle you can throw
the encyclopedia britannica into a black

8090
02:19:01,910 --> 02:19:01,920
the encyclopedia britannica into a black
 

8091
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:05,030
the encyclopedia britannica into a black
hole it's a lot of information

8092
02:19:05,030 --> 02:19:05,040
hole it's a lot of information
 

8093
02:19:05,040 --> 02:19:07,190
hole it's a lot of information
and then it will be gone because a black

8094
02:19:07,190 --> 02:19:07,200
and then it will be gone because a black
 

8095
02:19:07,200 --> 02:19:08,070
and then it will be gone because a black
hole

8096
02:19:08,070 --> 02:19:08,080

02:19:19,110 --> 02:19:19,120
according to einstein but then when
 

8105
02:19:19,120 --> 02:19:19,589
according to einstein but then when
hawking

8106
02:19:19,589 --> 02:19:19,599
hawking
 

8107
02:19:19,599 --> 02:19:22,309
hawking
tried to bring in quantum mechanics to

8108
02:19:22,309 --> 02:19:22,319
tried to bring in quantum mechanics to
 

8109
02:19:22,319 --> 02:19:24,070
tried to bring in quantum mechanics to
the game he realized that

8110
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:24,080
the game he realized that
 

8111
02:19:24,080 --> 02:19:27,030
the game he realized that
black holes have a temperature and they

8112
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:27,040
black holes have a temperature and they
 

8113
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:27,750
black holes have a temperature and they
radiate

8114
02:19:27,750 --> 02:19:27,760
radiate
 

8115
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:30,230
radiate
this is called hawking radiation and it

8116
02:19:30,230 --> 02:19:30,240
this is called hawking radiation and it
 

8117
02:19:30,240 --> 02:19:31,509
this is called hawking radiation and it
was sort of

8118
02:19:31,509 --> 02:19:31,519
was sort of
 

8119
02:19:31,519 --> 02:19:35,429
was sort of
anticipated by

8120
02:19:35,429 --> 02:19:35,439

 

8121
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:38,549

jacob beckenstein before him and hawking

8122
02:19:38,549 --> 02:19:38,559
jacob beckenstein before him and hawking
 

8123
02:19:38,559 --> 02:19:40,150
jacob beckenstein before him and hawking
wanted to prove beckenstein wrong and

8124
02:19:40,150 --> 02:19:40,160
wanted to prove beckenstein wrong and
 

8125
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:42,230
wanted to prove beckenstein wrong and
then figure this out

8126
02:19:42,230 --> 02:19:42,240
then figure this out
 

8127
02:19:42,240 --> 02:19:44,309
then figure this out
and so what it means is black holes

8128
02:19:44,309 --> 02:19:44,319
and so what it means is black holes
 

8129
02:19:44,319 --> 02:19:46,549
and so what it means is black holes
eventually evaporate

8130
02:19:46,549 --> 02:19:46,559
eventually evaporate
 

8131
02:19:46,559 --> 02:19:48,790
eventually evaporate
and they evaporate into radiation that

8132
02:19:48,790 --> 02:19:48,800
and they evaporate into radiation that
 

8133
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,710
and they evaporate into radiation that
doesn't carry this information according

8134
02:19:50,710 --> 02:19:50,720
doesn't carry this information according
 

8135
02:19:50,720 --> 02:19:52,550
doesn't carry this information according
to hawking's calculation

8136
02:19:52,550 --> 02:19:52,560
to hawking's calculation
 

8137
02:19:52,560 --> 02:19:54,389
to hawking's calculation
and then the question is according to

8138
02:19:54,389 --> 02:19:54,399
and then the question is according to
 

8139
02:19:54,399 --> 02:19:56,070
and then the question is according to
quantum mechanics information must be

8140
02:19:56,070 --> 02:19:56,080
quantum mechanics information must be
 

8141
02:19:56,080 --> 02:19:57,110
quantum mechanics information must be
preserved

8142
02:19:57,110 --> 02:19:57,120
preserved
 

8143
02:19:57,120 --> 02:20:00,230
preserved
so where did the information go

8144
02:20:00,230 --> 02:20:00,240
so where did the information go
 

8145
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:03,990
so where did the information go
if uh a black hole is gone and where is

8146
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:04,000
if uh a black hole is gone and where is
 

8147
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:05,710
if uh a black hole is gone and where is
the information that was encoded in the

8148
02:20:05,710 --> 02:20:05,720
the information that was encoded in the
 

8149
02:20:05,720 --> 02:20:07,429
the information that was encoded in the
encyclopedia when

8150
02:20:07,429 --> 02:20:07,439
encyclopedia when
 

8151
02:20:07,439 --> 02:20:10,630
encyclopedia when
it went into the black hole and to that

8152
02:20:10,630 --> 02:20:10,640
it went into the black hole and to that
 

8153
02:20:10,640 --> 02:20:12,230
it went into the black hole and to that
question we don't have an answer yet

8154
02:20:12,230 --> 02:20:12,240
question we don't have an answer yet
 

8155
02:20:12,240 --> 02:20:14,150
question we don't have an answer yet
it's one of those puzzles about black

8156
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,160
it's one of those puzzles about black
 

8157
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:14,870
it's one of those puzzles about black
holes

8158
02:20:14,870 --> 02:20:14,880
holes
 

8159
02:20:14,880 --> 02:20:16,710
holes
and it touches on the interplay between

8160
02:20:16,710 --> 02:20:16,720
and it touches on the interplay between
 

8161
02:20:16,720 --> 02:20:17,910
and it touches on the interplay between
quantum mechanics and

02:20:17,910 --> 02:20:17,920
quantum mechanics and
 

8163
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:21,270
quantum mechanics and
gravity another important question is

02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:21,280
gravity another important question is
 

8165
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:23,349
gravity another important question is
what happened at the beginning of the

the way on that i should say
 

8173
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:32,710
the way on that i should say
you know there are some conjectures

02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:32,720
you know there are some conjectures
 

8175
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:35,510
you know there are some conjectures
uh it's all in principle if we figure it

8176
02:20:35,510 --> 02:20:35,520
uh it's all in principle if we figure it
 

8177
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:37,030
uh it's all in principle if we figure it
out if we have a theory of quantum

8178
02:20:37,030 --> 02:20:37,040
out if we have a theory of quantum

02:20:40,469 --> 02:20:40,479
it's possible to imagine that we will
 

8183
02:20:40,479 --> 02:20:42,710
it's possible to imagine that we will
figure out how to create a universe in

8184
02:20:42,710 --> 02:20:42,720
figure out how to create a universe in
 

8185
02:20:42,720 --> 02:20:44,230
figure out how to create a universe in
the laboratory

02:20:44,240 --> 02:20:46,790
the laboratory
by irritating the vacuum you might

8188
02:20:46,790 --> 02:20:46,800
by irritating the vacuum you might

02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:47,270
by irritating the vacuum you might
create

8190
02:20:47,270 --> 02:20:47,280
create
 

8191
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:50,710
create
a baby universe and if we do that

8192
02:20:50,710 --> 02:20:50,720
a baby universe and if we do that
 

8193
02:20:50,720 --> 02:20:52,309
a baby universe and if we do that
it will offer a solution to what

8194
02:20:52,309 --> 02:20:52,319
it will offer a solution to what
 

8195
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:54,230
it will offer a solution to what
happened before the big bang perhaps the

8196
02:20:54,230 --> 02:20:54,240
happened before the big bang perhaps the
 

8197
02:20:54,240 --> 02:20:54,950
happened before the big bang perhaps the
big bang

emerged from the laboratory of another
 

8201
02:20:57,200 --> 02:20:59,110
emerged from the laboratory of another
civilization so it's like

8202
02:20:59,110 --> 02:20:59,120
civilization so it's like
 

8203
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:01,830
civilization so it's like
baby universes are being born out of

8204
02:21:01,830 --> 02:21:01,840
baby universes are being born out of
 

8205
02:21:01,840 --> 02:21:03,270
baby universes are being born out of
laboratories

8206
02:21:03,270 --> 02:21:03,280
laboratories
 

8207
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:05,270
laboratories
and inside the baby universe you have a

8208
02:21:05,270 --> 02:21:05,280
and inside the baby universe you have a
 

8209
02:21:05,280 --> 02:21:06,389
and inside the baby universe you have a
civilization that

8210
02:21:06,389 --> 02:21:06,399
civilization that
 

8211
02:21:06,399 --> 02:21:08,950
civilization that
brings to existence a new baby universe

8212
02:21:08,950 --> 02:21:08,960
brings to existence a new baby universe
 

8213
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:09,510
brings to existence a new baby universe
just like

8214
02:21:09,510 --> 02:21:09,520
just like
 

8215
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:11,110
just like
humans right we have babies and they

8216
02:21:11,110 --> 02:21:11,120
humans right we have babies and they
 

8217
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:13,590
humans right we have babies and they
make babies so in principle that would

8218
02:21:13,590 --> 02:21:13,600
make babies so in principle that would
 

8219
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:15,510
make babies so in principle that would
solve the problem of

8220
02:21:15,510 --> 02:21:15,520
solve the problem of
 

8221
02:21:15,520 --> 02:21:18,950
solve the problem of
why there was a big bang and also what

8222
02:21:18,950 --> 02:21:18,960
why there was a big bang and also what
 

8223
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:20,710
why there was a big bang and also what
happened before the big bang yes so we

8224
02:21:20,710 --> 02:21:20,720
happened before the big bang yes so we
 

8225
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:21,270
happened before the big bang yes so we
came

8226
02:21:21,270 --> 02:21:21,280
came
 

8227
02:21:21,280 --> 02:21:24,550
came
our umbilical cord is connected to a

of a civilization that produced our
 

8233
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:28,550
of a civilization that produced our

quantum gravity you know it's uh it's

8236
02:21:31,510 --> 02:21:31,520
quantum gravity you know it's uh it's
 

8237
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,510
quantum gravity you know it's uh it's
it's baby big bang's all the way down

8238
02:21:33,510 --> 02:21:33,520
it's baby big bang's all the way down
 

8239

it's baby big bang's all the way down
it's

it's
 

8241
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,710
it's
just big bangs all the way up so if we

8242
02:21:36,710 --> 02:21:36,720
just big bangs all the way up so if we
 

8243
02:21:36,720 --> 02:21:38,309
just big bangs all the way up so if we
collect data about how the universe

8244
02:21:38,309 --> 02:21:38,319
collect data about how the universe
 

8245
02:21:38,319 --> 02:21:40,309
collect data about how the universe
started we could potentially test

8246
02:21:40,309 --> 02:21:40,319
started we could potentially test
 

8247
02:21:40,319 --> 02:21:43,590
started we could potentially test
theories of or it can educate us about

8248
02:21:43,590 --> 02:21:43,600
theories of or it can educate us about
 

8249
02:21:43,600 --> 02:21:45,030
theories of or it can educate us about
how to unify quantum mechanics and

8250
02:21:45,030 --> 02:21:45,040
how to unify quantum mechanics and
 

8251
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:45,510
how to unify quantum mechanics and
gravity

8252
02:21:45,510 --> 02:21:45,520
gravity
 

8253
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:47,510
gravity
if we if we get any information about

8254
02:21:47,510 --> 02:21:47,520
if we if we get any information about
 

8255
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:49,110
if we if we get any information about
what happens near the singularity of a

8256
02:21:49,110 --> 02:21:49,120
what happens near the singularity of a
 

8257
02:21:49,120 --> 02:21:50,469
what happens near the singularity of a
black hole

8258
02:21:50,469 --> 02:21:50,479
black hole
 

8259
02:21:50,479 --> 02:21:53,590
black hole
you know if we yeah if we get a sense of

8260
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:53,600
you know if we yeah if we get a sense of
 

8261
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:56,309
you know if we yeah if we get a sense of
you know somehow we learn what happens

8262
02:21:56,309 --> 02:21:56,319
you know somehow we learn what happens
 

8263
02:21:56,319 --> 02:21:57,830
you know somehow we learn what happens
in this thing that would educate

8264
02:21:57,830 --> 02:21:57,840
in this thing that would educate
 

8265
02:21:57,840 --> 02:21:59,990
in this thing that would educate
so there are places where we can search

8266
02:21:59,990 --> 02:22:00,000
so there are places where we can search
 

8267
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:01,590
so there are places where we can search
for evidence

8268
02:22:01,590 --> 02:22:01,600
for evidence
 

8269
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:03,670
for evidence
but it's very challenging i should say

8270
02:22:03,670 --> 02:22:03,680
but it's very challenging i should say
 

8271
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:05,349
but it's very challenging i should say
and my point is

8272
02:22:05,349 --> 02:22:05,359
and my point is
 

8273
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:06,870
and my point is
you know the string theories they

8274
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:06,880
you know the string theories they
 

8275
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:08,630
you know the string theories they
decided that they know

8276
02:22:08,630 --> 02:22:08,640
decided that they know
 

8277
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:10,469
decided that they know
how to approach the problem that they

8278
02:22:10,469 --> 02:22:10,479
how to approach the problem that they
 

8279
02:22:10,479 --> 02:22:12,230
how to approach the problem that they
don't have a single

8280
02:22:12,230 --> 02:22:12,240
don't have a single
 

8281
02:22:12,240 --> 02:22:15,429
don't have a single
theory there is a multitude of theories

8282
02:22:15,429 --> 02:22:15,439
theory there is a multitude of theories
 

8283
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:16,469
theory there is a multitude of theories
and it's not

8284
02:22:16,469 --> 02:22:16,479
and it's not
 

8285
02:22:16,479 --> 02:22:18,550
and it's not
tightly constrained and they cannot make

8286
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:18,560
tightly constrained and they cannot make
 

8287
02:22:18,560 --> 02:22:19,590
tightly constrained and they cannot make
predictions about

8288
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:19,600
predictions about
 

8289
02:22:19,600 --> 02:22:21,429
predictions about
black holes or about the beginning of

8290
02:22:21,429 --> 02:22:21,439
black holes or about the beginning of
 

8291
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:23,429
black holes or about the beginning of
the universe so so at the moment i say

8292
02:22:23,429 --> 02:22:23,439
the universe so so at the moment i say
 

8293
02:22:23,439 --> 02:22:24,550
the universe so so at the moment i say
we're at a loss

8294
02:22:24,550 --> 02:22:24,560
we're at a loss
 

8295
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:27,190
we're at a loss
and the the way i feel about this

8296
02:22:27,190 --> 02:22:27,200
and the the way i feel about this
 

8297
02:22:27,200 --> 02:22:28,950
and the the way i feel about this
concept of the theory of everything

8298
02:22:28,950 --> 02:22:28,960
concept of the theory of everything
 

8299
02:22:28,960 --> 02:22:31,830
concept of the theory of everything
we should wait until we get enough

8300
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:31,840
we should wait until we get enough
 

8301
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:32,870
we should wait until we get enough
evidence to guide us

8302
02:22:32,870 --> 02:22:32,880
evidence to guide us
 

8303
02:22:32,880 --> 02:22:34,469
evidence to guide us
and until then you know there are many

8304
02:22:34,469 --> 02:22:34,479
and until then you know there are many
 

8305
02:22:34,479 --> 02:22:36,309
and until then you know there are many
important problems that we can address

8306
02:22:36,309 --> 02:22:36,319
important problems that we can address
 

8307
02:22:36,319 --> 02:22:39,349
important problems that we can address
you know why why bang our head against

8308
02:22:39,349 --> 02:22:39,359
you know why why bang our head against
 

8309
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:40,630
you know why why bang our head against
the wall

8310
02:22:40,630 --> 02:22:40,640
the wall
 

8311
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:42,469
the wall
on a problem for which we have no

8312
02:22:42,469 --> 02:22:42,479
on a problem for which we have no
 

8313
02:22:42,479 --> 02:22:44,309
on a problem for which we have no
guidance right we don't have a

8314
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:44,319
guidance right we don't have a
 

8315
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:45,910
guidance right we don't have a
good dance partner in terms of evidence

8316
02:22:45,910 --> 02:22:45,920
good dance partner in terms of evidence
 

8317
02:22:45,920 --> 02:22:47,830
good dance partner in terms of evidence
there's not exactly i mean it'd be

8318
02:22:47,830 --> 02:22:47,840
there's not exactly i mean it'd be
 

8319
02:22:47,840 --> 02:22:48,630
there's not exactly i mean it'd be
interesting

8320
02:22:48,630 --> 02:22:48,640
interesting
 

8321
02:22:48,640 --> 02:22:50,790
interesting
just like you said i mean the lab is one

8322
02:22:50,790 --> 02:22:50,800
just like you said i mean the lab is one
 

8323
02:22:50,800 --> 02:22:53,830
just like you said i mean the lab is one
place to create

8324
02:22:53,830 --> 02:22:53,840

 

8325
02:22:53,840 --> 02:22:56,150

universes or black holes but it'd be

8326
02:22:56,150 --> 02:22:56,160
universes or black holes but it'd be
 

8327
02:22:56,160 --> 02:22:57,750
universes or black holes but it'd be
fascinating if there's indeed a black

8328
02:22:57,750 --> 02:22:57,760
fascinating if there's indeed a black
 

8329
02:22:57,760 --> 02:23:00,070
fascinating if there's indeed a black
hole in our solar system that you can

8330
02:23:00,070 --> 02:23:00,080
hole in our solar system that you can
 

8331
02:23:00,080 --> 02:23:01,750
hole in our solar system that you can
interact with so the problem with the

8332
02:23:01,750 --> 02:23:01,760
interact with so the problem with the
 

8333
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:03,429
interact with so the problem with the
origin of the universe

8334
02:23:03,429 --> 02:23:03,439
origin of the universe
 

8335
02:23:03,439 --> 02:23:05,349
origin of the universe
is all you can do is collect data about

8336
02:23:05,349 --> 02:23:05,359
is all you can do is collect data about
 

8337
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:07,590
is all you can do is collect data about
it right you can't interact with it

8338
02:23:07,590 --> 02:23:07,600
it right you can't interact with it
 

8339
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:09,190
it right you can't interact with it
well you can for example detect

8340
02:23:09,190 --> 02:23:09,200
well you can for example detect
 

8341
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:11,190
well you can for example detect
gravitational waves that

8342
02:23:11,190 --> 02:23:11,200
gravitational waves that
 

8343
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:13,510
gravitational waves that
emerged from that and you know there is

8344
02:23:13,510 --> 02:23:13,520
emerged from that and you know there is
 

8345
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:15,030
emerged from that and you know there is
an effort to do that and that could

8346
02:23:15,030 --> 02:23:15,040
an effort to do that and that could
 

8347
02:23:15,040 --> 02:23:16,950
an effort to do that and that could
potentially tell us something

8348
02:23:16,950 --> 02:23:16,960
potentially tell us something
 

8349
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:20,070
potentially tell us something
but um yeah uh it's a challenge

8350
02:23:20,070 --> 02:23:20,080
but um yeah uh it's a challenge
 

8351
02:23:20,080 --> 02:23:23,349
but um yeah uh it's a challenge
and that's why we're stuck so i should

8352
02:23:23,349 --> 02:23:23,359
and that's why we're stuck so i should
 

8353
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:23,830
and that's why we're stuck so i should
say

8354
02:23:23,830 --> 02:23:23,840
say
 

8355
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:26,630
say
despite what physicists portray that you

8356
02:23:26,630 --> 02:23:26,640
despite what physicists portray that you
 

8357
02:23:26,640 --> 02:23:28,070
despite what physicists portray that you
know we live through an ex

8358
02:23:28,070 --> 02:23:28,080
know we live through an ex
 

8359
02:23:28,080 --> 02:23:30,309
know we live through an ex
exceptional growth in our understanding

8360
02:23:30,309 --> 02:23:30,319
exceptional growth in our understanding
 

8361
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:31,349
exceptional growth in our understanding
of the universe

8362
02:23:31,349 --> 02:23:31,359
of the universe
 

8363
02:23:31,359 --> 02:23:33,510
of the universe
we're actually pretty much stuck i would

8364
02:23:33,510 --> 02:23:33,520
we're actually pretty much stuck i would
 

8365
02:23:33,520 --> 02:23:35,510
we're actually pretty much stuck i would
say because we don't know the nature

8366
02:23:35,510 --> 02:23:35,520
say because we don't know the nature
 

8367
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:37,429
say because we don't know the nature
of the dark matter most of the matter in

8368
02:23:37,429 --> 02:23:37,439
of the dark matter most of the matter in
 

8369
02:23:37,439 --> 02:23:39,910
of the dark matter most of the matter in
the universe we don't know what it is

8370
02:23:39,910 --> 02:23:39,920
the universe we don't know what it is
 

8371
02:23:39,920 --> 02:23:41,110
the universe we don't know what it is
and we don't know how the universe

8372
02:23:41,110 --> 02:23:41,120
and we don't know how the universe
 

8373
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:43,030
and we don't know how the universe
started we don't know what happens in

8374
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:43,040
started we don't know what happens in
 

8375
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:43,990
started we don't know what happens in
this

8376
02:23:43,990 --> 02:23:44,000
this
 

8377
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,070
this
in the interior of a black hole because

8378
02:23:46,070 --> 02:23:46,080
in the interior of a black hole because
 

8379
02:23:46,080 --> 02:23:47,510
in the interior of a black hole because
you've thought quite a bit about dark

8380
02:23:47,510 --> 02:23:47,520
you've thought quite a bit about dark
 

8381
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:48,469
you've thought quite a bit about dark
matter as well

8382
02:23:48,469 --> 02:23:48,479
matter as well
 

8383
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:50,230
matter as well
is do you have any kind of hypothesis

8384
02:23:50,230 --> 02:23:50,240
is do you have any kind of hypothesis
 

8385
02:23:50,240 --> 02:23:51,510
is do you have any kind of hypothesis
interesting hypothesis we already

8386
02:23:51,510 --> 02:23:51,520
interesting hypothesis we already
 

8387
02:23:51,520 --> 02:23:52,790
interesting hypothesis we already
mentioned

8388
02:23:52,790 --> 02:23:52,800
mentioned
 

8389
02:23:52,800 --> 02:23:55,349
mentioned
a few about what is dark matter and what

8390
02:23:55,349 --> 02:23:55,359
a few about what is dark matter and what
 

8391
02:23:55,359 --> 02:23:56,389
a few about what is dark matter and what
are the

8392
02:23:56,389 --> 02:23:56,399
are the
 

8393
02:23:56,399 --> 02:23:59,830
are the
uh possible paths that we could take to

8394
02:23:59,830 --> 02:23:59,840
uh possible paths that we could take to
 

8395
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:01,510
uh possible paths that we could take to
unlock the mystery of dark

8396
02:24:01,510 --> 02:24:01,520
unlock the mystery of dark
 

8397
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,349
unlock the mystery of dark
what is dark matter yeah so what we need

8398
02:24:03,349 --> 02:24:03,359
what is dark matter yeah so what we need
 

8399
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:04,870
what is dark matter yeah so what we need
is some anomalies

8400
02:24:04,870 --> 02:24:04,880
is some anomalies
 

8401
02:24:04,880 --> 02:24:07,190
is some anomalies
that would hint what the nature of the

8402
02:24:07,190 --> 02:24:07,200
that would hint what the nature of the
 

8403
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:08,230
that would hint what the nature of the
dark matter is

8404
02:24:08,230 --> 02:24:08,240
dark matter is
 

8405
02:24:08,240 --> 02:24:09,910
dark matter is
or to detect it in the laboratory there

8406
02:24:09,910 --> 02:24:09,920
or to detect it in the laboratory there
 

8407
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:11,750
or to detect it in the laboratory there
are lots of laboratory experiments

8408
02:24:11,750 --> 02:24:11,760
are lots of laboratory experiments
 

8409
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,750
are lots of laboratory experiments
searching but it's like searching for a

8410
02:24:13,750 --> 02:24:13,760
searching but it's like searching for a
 

8411
02:24:13,760 --> 02:24:15,349
searching but it's like searching for a
needle in a haystack because there's so

8412
02:24:15,349 --> 02:24:15,359
needle in a haystack because there's so
 

8413
02:24:15,359 --> 02:24:16,950
needle in a haystack because there's so
many possibilities for the

8414
02:24:16,950 --> 02:24:16,960
many possibilities for the
 

8415
02:24:16,960 --> 02:24:19,990
many possibilities for the
type of particle that it may be um

8416
02:24:19,990 --> 02:24:20,000
type of particle that it may be um
 

8417
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:21,670
type of particle that it may be um
but maybe at some point you know we'll

8418
02:24:21,670 --> 02:24:21,680
but maybe at some point you know we'll
 

8419
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:23,429
but maybe at some point you know we'll
find either a particle

8420
02:24:23,429 --> 02:24:23,439
find either a particle
 

8421
02:24:23,439 --> 02:24:25,190
find either a particle
or black holes as the dark matter or

8422
02:24:25,190 --> 02:24:25,200
or black holes as the dark matter or
 

8423
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,469
or black holes as the dark matter or
something else

8424
02:24:26,469 --> 02:24:26,479
something else
 

8425
02:24:26,479 --> 02:24:29,190
something else
but you also may be sorry to interrupt

8426
02:24:29,190 --> 02:24:29,200
but you also may be sorry to interrupt
 

8427
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:31,270
but you also may be sorry to interrupt
to comment about what is dark matter

8428
02:24:31,270 --> 02:24:31,280
to comment about what is dark matter
 

8429
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:33,030
to comment about what is dark matter
like what it's just the name we're

8430
02:24:33,030 --> 02:24:33,040
like what it's just the name we're
 

8431
02:24:33,040 --> 02:24:34,710
like what it's just the name we're
assigned to what

8432
02:24:34,710 --> 02:24:34,720
assigned to what
 

8433
02:24:34,720 --> 02:24:36,710
assigned to what
so most of the community believes that

8434
02:24:36,710 --> 02:24:36,720
so most of the community believes that
 

8435
02:24:36,720 --> 02:24:39,429
so most of the community believes that
it's a particle

8436
02:24:39,429 --> 02:24:39,439
it's a particle
 

8437
02:24:39,439 --> 02:24:41,830
it's a particle
that we haven't yet detected it doesn't

8438
02:24:41,830 --> 02:24:41,840
that we haven't yet detected it doesn't
 

8439
02:24:41,840 --> 02:24:43,349
that we haven't yet detected it doesn't
interact with light so

8440
02:24:43,349 --> 02:24:43,359
interact with light so
 

8441
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:45,990
interact with light so
it's dark but the question is what does

8442
02:24:45,990 --> 02:24:46,000
it's dark but the question is what does
 

8443
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,110
it's dark but the question is what does
it interact with

8444
02:24:47,110 --> 02:24:47,120
it interact with
 

8445
02:24:47,120 --> 02:24:49,910
it interact with
and how can we find it and for many

8446
02:24:49,910 --> 02:24:49,920
and how can we find it and for many
 

8447
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,270
and how can we find it and for many
years

8448
02:24:51,270 --> 02:24:51,280
years
 

8449
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:53,270
years
physicists were guided by the idea that

8450
02:24:53,270 --> 02:24:53,280
physicists were guided by the idea that
 

8451
02:24:53,280 --> 02:24:55,349
physicists were guided by the idea that
it's some extension of the standard

8452
02:24:55,349 --> 02:24:55,359
it's some extension of the standard
 

8453
02:24:55,359 --> 02:24:56,950
it's some extension of the standard
model of particle physics

8454
02:24:56,950 --> 02:24:56,960
model of particle physics
 

8455
02:24:56,960 --> 02:24:59,510
model of particle physics
but then they said oh we will find some

8456
02:24:59,510 --> 02:24:59,520
but then they said oh we will find some
 

8457
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:00,150
but then they said oh we will find some
clues

8458
02:25:00,150 --> 02:25:00,160
clues
 

8459
02:25:00,160 --> 02:25:02,389
clues
from the large hadron collider about its

02:25:02,389 --> 02:25:02,399
from the large hadron collider about its

nature
 

8463
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:05,429

or maybe it's related to supersymmetry

8464
02:25:05,429 --> 02:25:05,439
or maybe it's related to supersymmetry

or maybe it's related to supersymmetry
which is a new symmetry that we haven't

8466
02:25:07,190 --> 02:25:07,200
which is a new symmetry that we haven't
 

8467
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:08,710
which is a new symmetry that we haven't
found any evidence for

02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,720
found any evidence for
 

8469
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:10,710
found any evidence for

in both cases the large hadron collider
 

8471
02:25:10,720 --> 02:25:12,550
in both cases the large hadron collider
did not give us any clues

8472
02:25:12,550 --> 02:25:12,560
did not give us any clues
 

8473
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:15,429
did not give us any clues
and other people searched for specific

and other people searched for specific
 

8475
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:17,190

types of particles in the laboratory and
 

8477
02:25:17,200 --> 02:25:19,110

a couple of years ago actually around
 

8481
02:25:22,240 --> 02:25:24,469
a couple of years ago actually around
the time that i worked on umuamua

the time that i worked on umuamua
i also worked on the possibility that

02:25:27,270 --> 02:25:27,280
i also worked on the possibility that
 

8485
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:28,950
i also worked on the possibility that
the dark matter particles may have a

02:25:33,510 --> 02:25:33,520
charge which is a speculation but
 

8491
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,389
charge which is a speculation but
nobody complained about it and you know

8492
02:25:36,389 --> 02:25:36,399
nobody complained about it and you know
 

8493
02:25:36,399 --> 02:25:38,230
nobody complained about it and you know
it was published and

8494
02:25:38,230 --> 02:25:38,240
it was published and
 

8495
02:25:38,240 --> 02:25:40,790
it was published and
i regard it more as of speculation than

8496
02:25:40,790 --> 02:25:40,800
i regard it more as of speculation than
 

8497
02:25:40,800 --> 02:25:43,429
i regard it more as of speculation than
the artificial origin of umuah

the artificial origin of umuah
 

8499
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:46,950
the artificial origin of umuah
and to me i apply you know as far as i'm

8500
02:25:46,950 --> 02:25:46,960
and to me i apply you know as far as i'm
 

8501
02:25:46,960 --> 02:25:48,550
and to me i apply you know as far as i'm
concerned i applied the same scientific

8502
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:48,560
concerned i applied the same scientific
 

8503
02:25:48,560 --> 02:25:50,790
concerned i applied the same scientific
tools in both cases there is an anomaly

8504
02:25:50,790 --> 02:25:50,800
tools in both cases there is an anomaly
 

8505
02:25:50,800 --> 02:25:51,590
tools in both cases there is an anomaly
that

8506
02:25:51,590 --> 02:25:51,600
that
 

8507
02:25:51,600 --> 02:25:53,910
that
led me to that discussion which has to

8508
02:25:53,910 --> 02:25:53,920
led me to that discussion which has to
 

8509
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:54,870
led me to that discussion which has to
do with the

8510

do with the
 

8511
02:25:54,880 --> 02:25:56,550
do with the
hydrogen being called in the early

universe more than we expected so we
 

8515
02:25:58,160 --> 02:25:58,950
universe more than we expected so we
suggested

8516
02:25:58,950 --> 02:25:58,960
suggested
 

8517
02:25:58,960 --> 02:26:00,469
suggested
maybe the dark matter particles have

8518
02:26:00,469 --> 02:26:00,479
maybe the dark matter particles have
 

8519
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:02,230
maybe the dark matter particles have
some small charge

8520
02:26:02,230 --> 02:26:02,240
some small charge
 

8521
02:26:02,240 --> 02:26:05,110
some small charge
but you deal with anomalies by exploring

8522
02:26:05,110 --> 02:26:05,120
but you deal with anomalies by exploring
 

8523
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:06,950
but you deal with anomalies by exploring
possibilities that's the only way to do

possibilities that's the only way to do
 

8525
02:26:06,960 --> 02:26:07,510
possibilities that's the only way to do
it and then

8526
02:26:07,510 --> 02:26:07,520
it and then
 

8527
02:26:07,520 --> 02:26:11,349
it and then
collecting more data to check those and

8528
02:26:11,349 --> 02:26:11,359
collecting more data to check those and
 

8529

definitely um well first i should

02:27:18,150 --> 02:27:18,160
definitely um well first i should

definitely um well first i should
confess that i enjoy working with young

people much more than with senor

02:27:23,270 --> 02:27:23,280
people much more than with senor
 

8595
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:25,270
people much more than with senor
and the reason is they don't carry a

and the reason is they don't carry a
 

8597
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:26,950
and the reason is they don't carry a

yes they're not so self-centered they're

8600
02:27:29,590 --> 02:27:29,600
yes they're not so self-centered they're
 

8601

open
 

8603
02:27:30,080 --> 02:27:33,830
open
to exploration uh my advice i mean one

8604
02:27:33,830 --> 02:27:33,840
to exploration uh my advice i mean one
 

8605
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:34,309
to exploration uh my advice i mean one
of the

8606
02:27:34,309 --> 02:27:34,319
of the
 

8607
02:27:34,319 --> 02:27:37,110
of the
lessons that took me a while to learn

8608
02:27:37,110 --> 02:27:37,120
lessons that took me a while to learn
 

8609
02:27:37,120 --> 02:27:37,590
lessons that took me a while to learn
and

8610
02:27:37,590 --> 02:27:37,600
and
 

8611
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,150
and
i should say i i lost important

8612
02:27:40,150 --> 02:27:40,160
i should say i i lost important
 

8613
02:27:40,160 --> 02:27:41,750
i should say i i lost important
opportunities as a result of that so

8614
02:27:41,750 --> 02:27:41,760
opportunities as a result of that so
 

8615
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:44,070
opportunities as a result of that so
that i would regard it as a mistake

8616
02:27:44,070 --> 02:27:44,080
that i would regard it as a mistake
 

8617
02:27:44,080 --> 02:27:48,070
that i would regard it as a mistake
on my behalf was to believe experts

intellectual work
 

8801
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:22,230
intellectual work
was to work on physics because that was

8802
02:31:22,230 --> 02:31:22,240
was to work on physics because that was
 

8803
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,070
was to work on physics because that was
the closest to philosophy

8804

the closest to philosophy
 

8805
02:31:24,080 --> 02:31:26,230
the closest to philosophy
and i was good at physics so they

8806
02:31:26,230 --> 02:31:26,240
and i was good at physics so they
 

8807
02:31:26,240 --> 02:31:27,990
and i was good at physics so they
admitted me to an elite program

8889
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:51,110
of the astronomy department
at harvard but at that point it became

8890
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:51,120
at harvard but at that point it became
 

8891
02:32:51,120 --> 02:32:51,990
at harvard but at that point it became
clear to me that i'm

8892

clear to me that i'm
 

8893

there are many philosophical questions
 

8899
02:32:58,399 --> 02:33:00,309
there are many philosophical questions
in astrophysics that we can address

8900
02:33:00,309 --> 02:33:00,319
in astrophysics that we can address
 

8901
02:33:00,319 --> 02:33:02,389
in astrophysics that we can address
but i'm still very different than my

assign
 

9305
02:39:56,960 --> 02:39:59,110
assign
meaning for our existence because you

9306
02:39:59,110 --> 02:39:59,120
meaning for our existence because you
 

9307
02:39:59,120 --> 02:39:59,990
meaning for our existence because you
know we

9308
02:39:59,990 --> 02:40:00,000
know we
 

9309
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,590
know we
as a civilization we will eventually

9310
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:01,600
as a civilization we will eventually
 

9311
02:40:01,600 --> 02:40:03,670
as a civilization we will eventually
perish you know and
