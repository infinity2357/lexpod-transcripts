as it uh pans out how much variation in

as it uh pans out how much variation in
 

83
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,070
as it uh pans out how much variation in
the outcomes of that evolution do you

84
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:22,080
the outcomes of that evolution do you
 

85
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,190
the outcomes of that evolution do you
think we would see

86
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:23,200
think we would see
 

87
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,149
think we would see
now we should say that you are a

88
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:26,159
now we should say that you are a
 

89
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,350
now we should say that you are a
computer scientist

90
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:27,360
computer scientist
 

91
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,270
computer scientist
that's actually not such a bad question

92
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:29,280
that's actually not such a bad question
 

93
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,429
that's actually not such a bad question
for computer scientists because

94
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:31,439
for computer scientists because
 

95
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,590
for computer scientists because
we are building simulations of these

96
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:33,600
we are building simulations of these
 

97
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,149
we are building simulations of these
things and we are simulating evolution

98
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:36,159
things and we are simulating evolution
 

99
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,510
things and we are simulating evolution
and that's a difficult question to

100
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
and that's a difficult question to
 

101
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,109
and that's a difficult question to
answer in biology but we can build a

102
00:01:39,109 --> 00:01:39,119
answer in biology but we can build a
 

103
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,710
answer in biology but we can build a
computational model

104
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:40,720
computational model
 

105
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,630
computational model
and run it million times and actually

106
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:42,640
and run it million times and actually
 

107
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,310
and run it million times and actually
answer that question how much variation

108
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:44,320
answer that question how much variation
 

109
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,630
answer that question how much variation
do we see when we when we simulate it

110
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,640
do we see when we when we simulate it
 

111
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,270
do we see when we when we simulate it
uh and um you know that's a little bit

112
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:49,280
uh and um you know that's a little bit
 

113
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,190
uh and um you know that's a little bit
beyond what we can do today but

114
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
beyond what we can do today but
 

115
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,870
beyond what we can do today but
but i think that we will see some

116
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:52,880
but i think that we will see some
 

117
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,510
but i think that we will see some
regularities and it took evolution also

118
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
regularities and it took evolution also
 

119
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,830
regularities and it took evolution also
a really long time to get started and

120
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:57,840
a really long time to get started and
 

121
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,789
a really long time to get started and
then things

122
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:58,799
then things
 

123
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,190
then things
accelerated really fast uh towards the

124
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:01,200
accelerated really fast uh towards the
 

125
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,069
accelerated really fast uh towards the
end

126
00:02:02,069 --> 00:02:02,079
end
 

127
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,429
end
but there are things that need to be

128
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
but there are things that need to be
 

129
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,429
but there are things that need to be
discovered and they probably will be

130
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
discovered and they probably will be
 

131
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:08,469
discovered and they probably will be
over and over again like manipulation

132
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
over and over again like manipulation
 

133
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,830
over and over again like manipulation
uh of objects uh opposable thumbs and

134
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:11,840
uh of objects uh opposable thumbs and
 

135
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,670
uh of objects uh opposable thumbs and
um and also some way to communicate

136
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:15,680
um and also some way to communicate
 

137
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,670
um and also some way to communicate
uh maybe orally like whether you have

138
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:17,680
uh maybe orally like whether you have
 

139
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,270
uh maybe orally like whether you have
speech it might be some other kind of

140
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:19,280
speech it might be some other kind of
 

141
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,710
speech it might be some other kind of
sound

142
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:20,720
sound
 

143
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,510

and and decision making but also vision

144
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:23,520
and and decision making but also vision
 

145
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:23,990
and and decision making but also vision
uh

146
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,000
uh
 

147
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,790
uh
i has evolved many times various vision

148
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:26,800
i has evolved many times various vision
 

149
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,990
i has evolved many times various vision
systems have evolved

150
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,000
systems have evolved
 

151
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,710
systems have evolved
so we would see those kinds of solutions

152
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
so we would see those kinds of solutions
 

153
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,350
so we would see those kinds of solutions
i believe

154
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
i believe
 

155
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,430
i believe
emerge over and over again they may look

156
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,440
emerge over and over again they may look
 

157
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,630
emerge over and over again they may look
a little different but they

158
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
a little different but they
 

159
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,550
a little different but they
they get the job done the really

160
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
they get the job done the really
 

161
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,229
they get the job done the really
interesting question is would we have

162
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:38,239
interesting question is would we have
 

163
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,750
interesting question is would we have
primates would we have

164
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:39,760
primates would we have
 

165
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,910
primates would we have
humans or something that resembles

166
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:41,920
humans or something that resembles
 

167
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,869
humans or something that resembles
humans

168
00:02:42,869 --> 00:02:42,879
humans
 

169
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,030
humans
uh and and would that be an apex of

170
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,040
uh and and would that be an apex of
 

171
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,550
uh and and would that be an apex of
evolution after a while

00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:46,560
evolution after a while
 

173
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,070
evolution after a while
uh we don't know where we're going from

174
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:48,080
uh we don't know where we're going from
 

175
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,550
uh we don't know where we're going from
here but we certainly see a lot of tool

176
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:50,560
here but we certainly see a lot of tool
 

177
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,190
here but we certainly see a lot of tool
use and

178
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
use and
 

179
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,350
use and
and building our constructing our

180
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:53,360
and building our constructing our
 

181
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,470
and building our constructing our
environment so

182
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:54,480
environment so
 

183
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,630
environment so
i think that we will get that we get

184
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:56,640
i think that we will get that we get
 

185
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,750
i think that we will get that we get
some

186
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:57,760
some
 

187
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,070
some
evolution producing some agents that can

188
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
evolution producing some agents that can
 

189
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,910
evolution producing some agents that can
do that manipulate the environment and

190
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
do that manipulate the environment and
 

191
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,390
do that manipulate the environment and
build

192
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:02,400
build
 

193
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,509
build
what do you think is special about

194
00:03:03,509 --> 00:03:03,519
what do you think is special about
 

195
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,190
what do you think is special about
humans like if you were running the

196
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:05,200
humans like if you were running the
 

197
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,990
humans like if you were running the
simulation

198
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
simulation
 

199
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,949
simulation
and you observe humans emerge like these

200
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
and you observe humans emerge like these
 

201
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,470
and you observe humans emerge like these
like tool makers they start a fire and

202
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
like tool makers they start a fire and
 

203
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,990
like tool makers they start a fire and
all stuff start running around building

204
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:12,000
all stuff start running around building
 

205
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,509
all stuff start running around building
buildings and then running for president

206
00:03:13,509 --> 00:03:13,519
buildings and then running for president
 

207
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:14,949
buildings and then running for president
all those kinds of things

208
00:03:14,949 --> 00:03:14,959
all those kinds of things
 

209
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,229
all those kinds of things
uh what would be how would you detect

210
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:18,239
uh what would be how would you detect
 

211
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,030
uh what would be how would you detect
that

212
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,040
that
 

213
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,550
that
because you're like really busy as the

214
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
because you're like really busy as the
 

215
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,030
because you're like really busy as the
creator of this evolutionary system

216
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:23,040
creator of this evolutionary system
 

217
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,589
creator of this evolutionary system
so you don't have much time to observe

218
00:03:25,589 --> 00:03:25,599
so you don't have much time to observe
 

219
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,630
so you don't have much time to observe
like detect if

220
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
like detect if
 

221
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,190
like detect if
any cool stuff came up right how would

222
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
any cool stuff came up right how would
 

223
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,110
any cool stuff came up right how would
you detect humans

224
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,120
you detect humans
 

225
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,070
you detect humans
well you are running the simulation so

226
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:34,080
well you are running the simulation so
 

227
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,270
well you are running the simulation so
you also

228
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:35,280
you also
 

229
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,710
you also
put in visualization and measurement

230
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
put in visualization and measurement
 

231
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,589
put in visualization and measurement
techniques there so if you are looking

232
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:41,599
techniques there so if you are looking
 

233
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,309
techniques there so if you are looking
for

234
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
for
 

235
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,430
for
certain things like communication you'll

236
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,440
certain things like communication you'll
 

237
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,190
certain things like communication you'll
have detectors to find out whether

238
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:47,200
have detectors to find out whether
 

239
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,710
have detectors to find out whether
that's happening even if it's a lot

240
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:48,720
that's happening even if it's a lot
 

241
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,229
that's happening even if it's a lot
simulation

242
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:50,239
simulation
 

243
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,550
simulation
and i think that that's that's what what

244
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:52,560
and i think that that's that's what what
 

245
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,429
and i think that that's that's what what
we would do

246
00:03:53,429 --> 00:03:53,439
we would do
 

247
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,270
we would do
we know roughly what we want intelligent

248
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:57,280
we know roughly what we want intelligent
 

249
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,670
we know roughly what we want intelligent
agents that communicate cooperate

250
00:03:59,670 --> 00:03:59,680
agents that communicate cooperate
 

251
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,110
agents that communicate cooperate
manipulate

252
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:01,120
manipulate
 

253
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,190
manipulate
and we would build detections and

254
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
and we would build detections and
 

255
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,429
and we would build detections and
visualizations of those processes

256
00:04:05,429 --> 00:04:05,439
visualizations of those processes
 

257
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,390
visualizations of those processes
yeah it and there's a lot of we have to

258
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
yeah it and there's a lot of we have to
 

259
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,830
yeah it and there's a lot of we have to
run it many times and

260
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
run it many times and
 

261
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,990
run it many times and
we have plenty of time to figure out how

262
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:12,000
we have plenty of time to figure out how
 

263
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,429
we have plenty of time to figure out how
we detect the interesting things

264
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
we detect the interesting things
 

265
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,150
we detect the interesting things
but also i think we do have to run it

266
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:16,160
but also i think we do have to run it
 

267
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,710
but also i think we do have to run it
many times because we don't quite know

268
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:18,720
many times because we don't quite know
 

269
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,349
many times because we don't quite know
what shape those will take and our

270
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:21,359
what shape those will take and our
 

271
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,749
what shape those will take and our
detectors may not be perfect for them

272
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:23,759
detectors may not be perfect for them
 

273
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,189
detectors may not be perfect for them
to begin with well it seems really

274
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,199
to begin with well it seems really
 

275
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,590
to begin with well it seems really
difficult to build the detector of

276
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:27,600
difficult to build the detector of
 

277
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,270
difficult to build the detector of
intelligent or intelligent conv

278

00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:37,199
alien perspective observing earth are
 

283
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,390
alien perspective observing earth are
you sure

284
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
you sure
 

285
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,150
you sure
that they would be able to detect humans

286
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
that they would be able to detect humans
 

287
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,830
that they would be able to detect humans
as the special thing wouldn't they be

288
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:41,840
as the special thing wouldn't they be
 

289
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,670
as the special thing wouldn't they be
already curious about other things

00:04:46,629 --> 00:04:46,639
there's way more insects by body mass i
 

293
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,749
there's way more insects by body mass i
think than humans

294
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:47,759

obviously dolphins is the most

298
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,160
obviously dolphins is the most
 

299
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,390
obviously dolphins is the most
intelligent uh creature on earth

300
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:54,400
intelligent uh creature on earth
 

301
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,070
intelligent uh creature on earth
we all know this so it could be the

302
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,080
we all know this so it could be the
 

303
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,230
we all know this so it could be the
dolphins that they detect

304
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
dolphins that they detect
 

305
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,830
dolphins that they detect
it could be the rockets that we seem to

306
00:04:59,830 --> 00:04:59,840
it could be the rockets that we seem to
 

307
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,270
it could be the rockets that we seem to
be launching that could be the

308
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,280
be launching that could be the
 

309
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,350
be launching that could be the
intelligent creature they detect

310
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:03,360
intelligent creature they detect
 

311
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,550
intelligent creature they detect
uh it could be some other uh trees

312
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:06,560
uh it could be some other uh trees
 

313
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,070
uh it could be some other uh trees
trees have been here a long time i just

314
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
trees have been here a long time i just
 

315
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,550
trees have been here a long time i just
learned that sharks have been here

316
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:10,560
learned that sharks have been here
 

317
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,350
learned that sharks have been here
400 million years and that's longer than

318
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:13,360
400 million years and that's longer than
 

319
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,870
400 million years and that's longer than
trees have been here

320
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:14,880
trees have been here
 

321
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,270
trees have been here
so maybe it's the sharks they go by age

322
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,280
so maybe it's the sharks they go by age
 

323
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,870
so maybe it's the sharks they go by age
like there's a persistent thing

00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:18,880
like there's a persistent thing
 

325
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,710
like there's a persistent thing
like if you survive long enough

326
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:20,720
like if you survive long enough
 

327
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,230
like if you survive long enough
especially through the mass extinctions

328
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:22,240
especially through the mass extinctions
 

329
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,110
especially through the mass extinctions
that could be the

330
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,120
that could be the
 

331
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,350
that could be the
the thing your detector is uh detecting

332
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
the thing your detector is uh detecting
 

333
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,749
the thing your detector is uh detecting
humans have been here for a short time

334
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
humans have been here for a short time
 

335
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,590
humans have been here for a short time
and we're just creating a lot of

336
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:29,600
and we're just creating a lot of
 

337
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,909
and we're just creating a lot of
pollution but so is the other creatures

338
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:31,919
pollution but so is the other creatures
 

339
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,390
pollution but so is the other creatures
i don't know you do you think you'd be

340
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:34,400
i don't know you do you think you'd be
 

341
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,070
i don't know you do you think you'd be
able to detect humans like how would you

342
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,080
able to detect humans like how would you
 

343
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,590
able to detect humans like how would you
go about detecting

344
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:37,600
go about detecting
 

345
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,510
go about detecting
in the computational sense maybe we can

346
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:39,520
in the computational sense maybe we can
 

347
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,790
in the computational sense maybe we can
leave humans behind

348
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:40,800
leave humans behind
 

349
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,469
leave humans behind
in the computational sense detect

350
00:05:42,469 --> 00:05:42,479
in the computational sense detect
 

351
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,070
in the computational sense detect
interesting things

352
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:46,080
interesting things
 

353
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,749
interesting things
do you basically have to have a strict

354
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
do you basically have to have a strict
 

355
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,990
do you basically have to have a strict
objective function by which you measure

356
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:50,000
objective function by which you measure
 

357
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,230
objective function by which you measure
the performance of a system or can you

358
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
the performance of a system or can you
 

359
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,990
the performance of a system or can you
find curiosities and

360
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,000
find curiosities and
 

361
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,469
find curiosities and
interesting things yeah well i think

362
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:56,479
interesting things yeah well i think
 

363
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,950
interesting things yeah well i think
that the first

364
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
that the first
 

365
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,590
that the first
measurement would be to detect how much

366
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:01,600
measurement would be to detect how much
 

367
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,029
measurement would be to detect how much
of an effect you can have in your

368
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:03,039
of an effect you can have in your
 

369
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:04,390
of an effect you can have in your
environment so if you look at

370
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,400
environment so if you look at
 

371
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,510
environment so if you look at
look around we have cities and that is

372
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:07,520
look around we have cities and that is
 

373
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,950
look around we have cities and that is
constructed environments and that's

374
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:08,960
constructed environments and that's
 

375
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,029
constructed environments and that's
where a lot of people live most people

376
00:06:11,029 --> 00:06:11,039
where a lot of people live most people
 

377
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,909
where a lot of people live most people
live

378
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
live
 

379
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,390
live
so that would be a good sign of

380
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:14,400
so that would be a good sign of
 

381
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,550
so that would be a good sign of
intelligence that you

382
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:16,560
intelligence that you
 

383
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,909
intelligence that you
don't just live in an environment but

384
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:17,919
don't just live in an environment but
 

385
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,070
don't just live in an environment but
you construct it to your liking yeah

386
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,080
you construct it to your liking yeah
 

387
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,830
you construct it to your liking yeah
and that's something pretty unique i

388
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
and that's something pretty unique i
 

389
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,070
and that's something pretty unique i
mean certainly birds build nests

390
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,080
mean certainly birds build nests
 

391
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,350
mean certainly birds build nests
but they don't build quite cities

392
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:25,360
but they don't build quite cities
 

393
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,909
but they don't build quite cities
termites build mounds and ice and things

394
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:27,919
termites build mounds and ice and things
 

395
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,870
termites build mounds and ice and things
like that

396
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:28,880
like that
 

397
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,950
like that
but the complexity of the human

398
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
but the complexity of the human
 

399
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,950
but the complexity of the human
construction cities i think would stand

400
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:32,960
construction cities i think would stand
 

401
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,510
construction cities i think would stand
out

402
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:33,520
out
 

403
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,110
out
even to an external observer of course

404
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
even to an external observer of course
 

405
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,150
even to an external observer of course
that's what a human would say

406
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,160
that's what a human would say
 

407
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,749
that's what a human would say
yeah and you know you can certainly say

408
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:39,759
yeah and you know you can certainly say
 

409
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,070
yeah and you know you can certainly say
that sharks are really smart because

410
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,080
that sharks are really smart because
 

411
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,430
that sharks are really smart because
they've been around so long and they

412
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
they've been around so long and they
 

413
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,950
they've been around so long and they
haven't destroyed the environment

414
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:44,960
haven't destroyed the environment
 

415
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,790
haven't destroyed the environment
which humans are about to do which is

416
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
which humans are about to do which is
 

417
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,309
which humans are about to do which is
not a very smart thing

418
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:48,319
not a very smart thing
 

419
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,430
not a very smart thing
uh but we'll get over it i believe

420
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:51,440
uh but we'll get over it i believe
 

421
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,309
uh but we'll get over it i believe
uh and and we can get over it by doing

422
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:54,319
uh and and we can get over it by doing
 

423
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:55,830
uh and and we can get over it by doing
some construction that actually is

424
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
some construction that actually is
 

425
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,469
some construction that actually is
benign

426
00:06:56,469 --> 00:06:56,479
benign
 

427
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,550
benign
uh and maybe even enhances uh the um

428
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:00,560
uh and maybe even enhances uh the um
 

429
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,870
uh and maybe even enhances uh the um
resilience of nature so you mentioned

430
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:02,880
resilience of nature so you mentioned
 

431
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,029
resilience of nature so you mentioned
that this simulation that we run over

432
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:05,039
that this simulation that we run over
 

433
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,990
that this simulation that we run over
and over might

434
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
and over might
 

435
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,270
and over might
start so it's a slow start so do you

436
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:09,280
start so it's a slow start so do you
 

437
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,070
start so it's a slow start so do you
think uh

438
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
think uh
 

439
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,790
think uh
how unlikely first of all i don't know

440
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:12,800
how unlikely first of all i don't know
 

441
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,070
how unlikely first of all i don't know
if you think about this kind of stuff

442
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,080
if you think about this kind of stuff
 

443
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,790
if you think about this kind of stuff
but

444
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
but
 

445
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,070
but
how unlikely is step number zero

446
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,080
how unlikely is step number zero
 

447
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,110
how unlikely is step number zero
which is the springing up like the

448
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,120
which is the springing up like the
 

449
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,950
which is the springing up like the
origin of life on earth

450
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:22,960
origin of life on earth
 

451
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,469
origin of life on earth
and second how unlikely

452
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:26,479
and second how unlikely
 

453
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,350
and second how unlikely
is the anything interesting happening

454
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,360
is the anything interesting happening
 

455
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,390
is the anything interesting happening
beyond that

456
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,400
beyond that
 

457
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,309
beyond that
sort of like the start that that creates

458
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:34,319
sort of like the start that that creates
 

459
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,070
sort of like the start that that creates
all the rich complexity that we see on

460
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,080
all the rich complexity that we see on
 

461
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,350
all the rich complexity that we see on
earth today yeah

462
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
earth today yeah
 

463
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,710
earth today yeah
there are people who are working on

464
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:38,720
there are people who are working on
 

465
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,629
there are people who are working on
exactly that problem uh

466
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:40,639
exactly that problem uh
 

467
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,029
exactly that problem uh
from primordial soup how do you actually

468
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:43,039
from primordial soup how do you actually
 

469
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,749
from primordial soup how do you actually
get self-replicating yeah molecules

470
00:07:45,749 --> 00:07:45,759
get self-replicating yeah molecules
 

471
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,110
get self-replicating yeah molecules
and they are very close uh with a little

472
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
and they are very close uh with a little
 

473
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,909
and they are very close uh with a little
bit of help you can make that happen

474
00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:51,919
bit of help you can make that happen
 

475
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,749
bit of help you can make that happen
so we of course we know what we want so

476
00:07:55,749 --> 00:07:55,759
so we of course we know what we want so
 

477
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,430
so we of course we know what we want so
they can set up the conditions and try

478
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:57,440
they can set up the conditions and try
 

479
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,070
they can set up the conditions and try
out conditions

480
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,080
out conditions
 

481
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,430
out conditions
that are conducive to that for evolution

482
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:01,440
that are conducive to that for evolution
 

483
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,550
that are conducive to that for evolution
to discover that

484
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:02,560
to discover that
 

485
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,189
to discover that
that took a long time for us to recreate

486
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:05,199
that took a long time for us to recreate
 

487
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,589
that took a long time for us to recreate
it probably won't take that long

488
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:07,599
it probably won't take that long
 

489
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,710
it probably won't take that long
and the next steps from there um

490
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:10,720
and the next steps from there um
 

491
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,869
and the next steps from there um
i think also with some hand-holding i

492
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:12,879
i think also with some hand-holding i
 

493
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,790
i think also with some hand-holding i
think we can make that happen

494
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:14,800
think we can make that happen
 

495
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,749
think we can make that happen
um but if with evolution what was really

496
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
um but if with evolution what was really
 

497
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,230
um but if with evolution what was really
fascinating was eventually the

498
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,240
fascinating was eventually the
 

499
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,710
fascinating was eventually the
runaway evolution of the brain that

500
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:22,720
runaway evolution of the brain that
 

501
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,430
runaway evolution of the brain that
created

502
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:23,440
created
 

503
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,830
created
humans and created well also other

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:25,840
humans and created well also other
 

505
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,029
humans and created well also other
higher animals

506
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,039
higher animals
 

507
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,309

that that was something that happened

508
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:28,319
that that was something that happened
 

509
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,550
that that was something that happened
really fast and

510
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,560
really fast and
 

511
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,029
really fast and
that's a big question is that something

512
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:33,039
that's a big question is that something
 

513
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,029
that's a big question is that something
replicable is that something that

514
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:35,039
replicable is that something that
 

515
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,949
replicable is that something that
can happen and if it happens does it go

516
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
can happen and if it happens does it go
 

517
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:39,110
can happen and if it happens does it go
in the same direction

518
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,120
in the same direction
 

519
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,269
in the same direction
that is a big question to ask even in

520
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:41,279
that is a big question to ask even in
 

521
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,469
that is a big question to ask even in
computational

522
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
computational
 

523
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,350

possible to

526
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:46,720
possible to
 

527
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,310
possible to
come up here create an experiment where

528
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
come up here create an experiment where
 

529
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,910
come up here create an experiment where
we look at the primordial soup and the

530
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:49,920
we look at the primordial soup and the
 

531
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,030
we look at the primordial soup and the
first couple of steps

00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,040
first couple of steps
 

533
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,590
first couple of steps
of multicellular organisms even but to

534
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:53,600
of multicellular organisms even but to
 

535
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,350
of multicellular organisms even but to
get something as complex as the brain

536
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:57,360

 

537
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,870

we don't quite know the conditions for

538
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
we don't quite know the conditions for
 

539
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,350
we don't quite know the conditions for
that and how to even get started and

540
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:01,360
that and how to even get started and
 

541
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,790
that and how to even get started and
whether we can get this kind of runaway

542
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
whether we can get this kind of runaway
 

543
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,829
whether we can get this kind of runaway
evolution happening

544
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839

 

545
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,030

from a detector perspective

00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:09,040
from a detector perspective
 

547
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,030
from a detector perspective
if we're observing this evolution what

548
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,040
if we're observing this evolution what
 

549
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,550
if we're observing this evolution what
do you think is the brain what do you

550
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
do you think is the brain what do you
 

551
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,590
do you think is the brain what do you
think is the

552
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
think is the
 

553
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,310
think is the
let's say what is intelligence so in

554
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:16,320
let's say what is intelligence so in
 

555
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,750
let's say what is intelligence so in
terms of the thing that makes humans

556
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
terms of the thing that makes humans
 

557
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,949
terms of the thing that makes humans
special we seem to be able to reason

558
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
special we seem to be able to reason
 

559
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,670
special we seem to be able to reason
we seem to be able to communicate but

560
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
we seem to be able to communicate but
 

561
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,509
we seem to be able to communicate but
the core of that is this

562
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
the core of that is this
 

563
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,070
the core of that is this
something in the broad category we might

564
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
something in the broad category we might
 

565
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,590
something in the broad category we might
call intelligence

566
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:29,600
call intelligence
 

567
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,829
call intelligence
so it's uh if you put your computer

568
00:09:31,829 --> 00:09:31,839
so it's uh if you put your computer
 

569
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,430
so it's uh if you put your computer
scientists add on

570
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:33,440
scientists add on
 

571
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,630
scientists add on
uh is their favorite ways you like to

572
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:36,640
uh is their favorite ways you like to
 

573
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,590
uh is their favorite ways you like to
think about

574
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:37,600
think about
 

575
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,269
think about
that question of what is intelligence

576
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
that question of what is intelligence
 

577
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,550
that question of what is intelligence
well my goal is to create

578
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:44,560
well my goal is to create
 

579
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,230
well my goal is to create
agents that are that are intelligent

580
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
agents that are that are intelligent
 

581
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,350
agents that are that are intelligent
not to define what and and that that is

582
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:51,360
not to define what and and that that is
 

583
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,710
not to define what and and that that is
a way of defining it

584
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
a way of defining it
 

585
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,670
a way of defining it
and that means that it's some kind of an

586
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:55,680
and that means that it's some kind of an
 

587
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,030
and that means that it's some kind of an
um

588
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
um
 

589
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,550
um
object or or a program um

590
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:00,560
object or or a program um
 

591
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,710
object or or a program um
that has limited sensory and uh

592
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
that has limited sensory and uh
 

593
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,110
that has limited sensory and uh
effective capabilities interacting with

594
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,120
effective capabilities interacting with
 

595
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,150
effective capabilities interacting with
the world

596
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:08,160
the world
 

597
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,389
the world
and then also a mechanism for making

598
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:10,399
and then also a mechanism for making
 

599
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,670
and then also a mechanism for making
decisions

600
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:11,680
decisions
 

601
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,550
decisions
so with limited abilities like that can

602
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
so with limited abilities like that can
 

603
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,030
so with limited abilities like that can
it

604
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,040
it
 

605
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,630
it
survive um survival is the simplest goal

606
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
survive um survival is the simplest goal
 

607
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,269
survive um survival is the simplest goal
but it could

608
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:19,279
but it could
 

609
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,630
but it could
you could also give it other goals can

610
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:20,640
you could also give it other goals can
 

611
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,949
you could also give it other goals can
it multiply can it solve problems that

612
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
it multiply can it solve problems that
 

613
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:23,990
it multiply can it solve problems that
you give it

614
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
you give it
 

615
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,230
you give it
uh and that is quite a bit less than

616
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
uh and that is quite a bit less than
 

617
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,069
uh and that is quite a bit less than
human intelligence there are

618
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
human intelligence there are
 

619
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,590
human intelligence there are
animals would be intelligent of course

620
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
animals would be intelligent of course
 

621
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,310
animals would be intelligent of course
with that definition and you might have

622
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
with that definition and you might have
 

623
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,230
with that definition and you might have
even even some other forms of of life

624
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:34,240
even even some other forms of of life
 

625
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,150
even even some other forms of of life
even so what

626
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:36,160
even so what
 

627
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,230
even so what
so intelligence in that sense is a

628
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:38,240
so intelligence in that sense is a
 

629
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,750
so intelligence in that sense is a
survival um

630
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:39,760
survival um
 

631
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,949
survival um

do you think death mortality is

638
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:50,240
do you think death mortality is
 

639
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,269
do you think death mortality is
fundamental

640
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
fundamental
 

641
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,990
fundamental
to an agent so like there's a i don't

672
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:21,519
the dangers that are out there
 

673
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,670
the dangers that are out there
but like understand that this ride ends

674
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:23,680
but like understand that this ride ends
 

675
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,110
but like understand that this ride ends
eventually yeah

676
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:25,120
eventually yeah
 

677
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,470
eventually yeah
and that in itself is the most is a

678
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:28,480
and that in itself is the most is a
 

679
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,630
and that in itself is the most is a
is the force behind all of the creative

680
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
is the force behind all of the creative
 

681
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,470
is the force behind all of the creative
efforts of human nature yeah that's

682
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:32,480
efforts of human nature yeah that's
 

683
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,509
efforts of human nature yeah that's
that's the philosophy

684
00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:33,519
that's the philosophy
 

685
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,190
that's the philosophy
i think that makes sense a lot of sense

686
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
i think that makes sense a lot of sense
 

687
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,190
i think that makes sense a lot of sense
i mean animals probably don't think of

688
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:37,200
i mean animals probably don't think of
 

689
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,470
i mean animals probably don't think of
death the same way

690
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:38,480
death the same way
 

691
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,069
death the same way
but humans know that your time is

692
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:40,079
but humans know that your time is
 

693
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,110
but humans know that your time is
limited and you want to make it count

694
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,120
limited and you want to make it count
 

695
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,310
limited and you want to make it count
and you can make account in many

696
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:44,320
and you can make account in many
 

697
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,310
and you can make account in many
different ways but i think that has a

698
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
different ways but i think that has a
 

699
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,230
different ways but i think that has a
lot to do with creativity and the need

700
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,240
lot to do with creativity and the need
 

701
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,190
lot to do with creativity and the need
for humans

702
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:49,200
for humans
 

703
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,550
for humans
to do something beyond just surviving

704
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:52,560
to do something beyond just surviving
 

705
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,790
to do something beyond just surviving
and now going from that simple

706
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:54,800
and now going from that simple
 

707
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,470
and now going from that simple
definition to something that's

708
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:56,480
definition to something that's
 

709
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,150
definition to something that's
the next level i think that that could

710
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:58,160
the next level i think that that could
 

711
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,790
the next level i think that that could
be a second decision a second level of

712
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
be a second decision a second level of
 

713
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,150
be a second decision a second level of
definition that

714
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,160
definition that
 

715
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,470
definition that
um intelligence means something and you

716
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:04,480
um intelligence means something and you
 

717
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,350
um intelligence means something and you
do something that

718
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
do something that
 

719
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,430
do something that
stays behind you that's more than uh

720
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:07,440
stays behind you that's more than uh
 

721
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,629
stays behind you that's more than uh
your

722
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:08,639
your
 

723
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,949
your
existence um something you create

724
00:12:10,949 --> 00:12:10,959
existence um something you create
 

725
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:11,670
existence um something you create
something that

726
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:11,680
something that
 

727
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,829
something that
um is useful for others is useful in the

728
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
um is useful for others is useful in the
 

729
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,990
um is useful for others is useful in the
future not just for yourself

730
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
future not just for yourself
 

731
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,350
future not just for yourself
and i think that that's a nice

732
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
and i think that that's a nice
 

733
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,269
and i think that that's a nice
definition of intelligence in a

734
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:19,279
definition of intelligence in a
 

735
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,230
definition of intelligence in a
next level uh and it's also nice because

736
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:22,240
next level uh and it's also nice because
 

737
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,350
next level uh and it's also nice because
it doesn't require

738
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:23,360
it doesn't require
 

739
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,269
it doesn't require
that they are humans or biological they

740
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
that they are humans or biological they
 

741
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,870
that they are humans or biological they
could be artificial

742
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:26,880
could be artificial
 

743
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,949
could be artificial
agents that intelligence they could they

744
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:28,959
agents that intelligence they could they
 

745
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,230
agents that intelligence they could they
could achieve those kind of goals

746
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:30,240
could achieve those kind of goals
 

747
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,350
could achieve those kind of goals
so particular agent the uh the ripple

748
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:33,360
so particular agent the uh the ripple
 

749
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,310
so particular agent the uh the ripple
effects of

750
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:34,320
effects of
 

751
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,389
effects of
of their existence on the entirety of

752
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
of their existence on the entirety of
 

753
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,509
of their existence on the entirety of
the system

754
00:12:37,509 --> 00:12:37,519
the system
 

755
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,350
the system
is significant so like they leave a

756
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:39,360
is significant so like they leave a
 

757
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,590
is significant so like they leave a
trace where there's like uh

758
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:41,600
trace where there's like uh
 

759
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,829
trace where there's like uh
yeah like ripple effects it's the but

760
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:43,839
yeah like ripple effects it's the but
 

761
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,190
yeah like ripple effects it's the but
see then you go back to the

762
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
see then you go back to the
 

763
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,190
see then you go back to the
the butterfly with the flap of a wing

764
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,200
the butterfly with the flap of a wing
 

765
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,430
the butterfly with the flap of a wing
and then you can uh trace a lot of uh

766
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:49,440
and then you can uh trace a lot of uh
 

767
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,509
and then you can uh trace a lot of uh
like nuclear wars and all the conflicts

768
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,519
like nuclear wars and all the conflicts
 

769
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,629
like nuclear wars and all the conflicts
of human history

770
00:12:52,629 --> 00:12:52,639
of human history
 

771
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,470
of human history
somehow connected to that one butterfly

772
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:54,480
somehow connected to that one butterfly
 

773
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,670
somehow connected to that one butterfly
that created all the

774
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:55,680
that created all the
 

775
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,190
that created all the
the chaos so maybe that's not

776
00:12:59,190 --> 00:12:59,200
the chaos so maybe that's not
 

777
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,750
the chaos so maybe that's not
maybe that's a very poetic way to think

778
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:01,760
maybe that's a very poetic way to think
 

779
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,509
maybe that's a very poetic way to think
uh that's something we humans in a

780
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:03,519
uh that's something we humans in a
 

781
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,509
uh that's something we humans in a
human-centric way want to

782
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
human-centric way want to
 

783
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,949
human-centric way want to
hope we have this impact

784
00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
hope we have this impact
 

785
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,949
hope we have this impact
like that is the the the secondary

786
00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:10,959
like that is the the the secondary
 

787
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,389
like that is the the the secondary
effect of our intelligence we've

788
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
effect of our intelligence we've
 

789
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,389
effect of our intelligence we've
had the long-lasting impact on the world

790
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:14,399
had the long-lasting impact on the world
 

791
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,629
had the long-lasting impact on the world
but maybe the entirety

792
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:16,639
but maybe the entirety
 

793
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,310
but maybe the entirety
of physics in the universe

794
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:20,320
of physics in the universe
 

795
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,550
of physics in the universe
has a very long lasting effect sure but

796
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
has a very long lasting effect sure but
 

797
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,350
has a very long lasting effect sure but
you can also think of it what if um like

798
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:27,360
you can also think of it what if um like
 

799
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,870
you can also think of it what if um like
the wonderful life what if you're not

800
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:28,880
the wonderful life what if you're not
 

801
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,990
the wonderful life what if you're not
here will somebody else do this is it

802
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:32,000
here will somebody else do this is it
 

803
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,829
here will somebody else do this is it
is it something that you actually

804
00:13:33,829 --> 00:13:33,839
is it something that you actually
 

805
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,350
is it something that you actually
contributed because you had something

806
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:35,360
contributed because you had something
 

807
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,389
contributed because you had something
unique to compute

808
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
unique to compute
 

809
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,790
unique to compute
that contribute that's a pretty high bar

810
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:38,800
that contribute that's a pretty high bar
 

811
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,150
that contribute that's a pretty high bar
though uniqueness

812
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,160
though uniqueness
 

813
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,430
though uniqueness
yeah yeah so you know you have to be

814
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
yeah yeah so you know you have to be
 

815
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,430
yeah yeah so you know you have to be
mozart or something to actually reach

816
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:45,440
mozart or something to actually reach
 

817
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,350
mozart or something to actually reach
that level that nobody would have

818
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:47,360
that level that nobody would have
 

819
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,350
that level that nobody would have
developed that but other people might

820
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,360
developed that but other people might
 

821
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,870
developed that but other people might
have solved this equation

822
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
have solved this equation
 

823
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,910
have solved this equation
um if you didn't do it

824
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:53,920
um if you didn't do it
 

825
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,949
um if you didn't do it
but but also within limited scope i mean

826
00:13:56,949 --> 00:13:56,959
but but also within limited scope i mean
 

827
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,310
but but also within limited scope i mean
during your lifetime or next year

828
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,320
during your lifetime or next year
 

829
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,750
during your lifetime or next year
you could contribute something that

830
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
you could contribute something that
 

831
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,389
you could contribute something that
unique that other people did not see

832
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
unique that other people did not see
 

833
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,509
unique that other people did not see
and um and then that could change

834
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
and um and then that could change
 

835
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,949
and um and then that could change
the way things move forward for a while

00:14:10,949 --> 00:14:10,959
the way things move forward for a while
 

837
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,910
the way things move forward for a while
uh so i don't think we have to be mozart

838
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
uh so i don't think we have to be mozart
 

839
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:14,310
uh so i don't think we have to be mozart
to be

840
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
to be
 

841
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,910
to be
called intelligence but we have this

842
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
called intelligence but we have this
 

843
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,509
called intelligence but we have this
local effect that is

844
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:17,519
local effect that is
 

845
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,269
local effect that is
changing if you weren't there that would

846
00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:19,279
changing if you weren't there that would
 

847
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,710
changing if you weren't there that would
not have happened and it's a positive

848
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:20,720
not have happened and it's a positive
 

849
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,150
not have happened and it's a positive
effect of course you want it to be a

850
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,160
effect of course you want it to be a
 

851
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,670
effect of course you want it to be a
positive effect do you think it's

852
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:23,680
positive effect do you think it's
 

853
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,910
positive effect do you think it's
possible to engineer in

854
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:25,920
possible to engineer in
 

855
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,829

00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:28,839
to uh computational agents a fear of
 

857
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,470

like uh does that make any
 

861
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,710
like uh does that make any
any sense so there's a very trivial

any sense so there's a very trivial
 

863
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,069

you could just code in a parameter which
 

867
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,230
you could just code in a parameter which
is how long the life ends but

is how long the life ends but

sometimes you can have a like a a fear

00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
sometimes you can have a like a a fear

is a normal response which is a little

922
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
is a normal response which is a little
 

923
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,350

and and it's emotion so now the question

926
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
and and it's emotion so now the question
 

927
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,990
and and it's emotion so now the question
is what good are emotions i mean they

928
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
is what good are emotions i mean they
 

929
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,030
is what good are emotions i mean they
are quite

dimensions of emotions
 

935
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,670
dimensions of emotions
and they probably do serve as survival

and fear of death might be a really good

940
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
and fear of death might be a really good
 

941
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,269

emotion when you are in danger that you

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,470
emotion when you are in danger that you
recognize it

944
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:02,480
recognize it
 

945
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,230
recognize it
even even if it's not logically

00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
even even if it's not logically
 

947
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,629

may be able to recognize the situation
 

955

may be able to recognize the situation
is dangerous and this fear

956
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:13,680
is dangerous and this fear
 

957
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,590
is dangerous and this fear
kicks in and you all of a sudden

958
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:15,600
kicks in and you all of a sudden
 

959
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,749
kicks in and you all of a sudden
perceive the facts that are important

960
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
perceive the facts that are important
 

961
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,509
perceive the facts that are important
for that and i think that's generally is

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:19,519
for that and i think that's generally is
 

963
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,590
for that and i think that's generally is
the role of emotions is it allows you to

964
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
the role of emotions is it allows you to
 

965
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,389
the role of emotions is it allows you to
focus

966
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
focus
 

967
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,389
focus
what's relevant uh for your situation

968
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
what's relevant uh for your situation
 

969
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,230
what's relevant uh for your situation
and maybe if fear of death plays the

970
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:26,240
and maybe if fear of death plays the
 

971
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,430
and maybe if fear of death plays the
same kind of role

972
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:27,440
same kind of role
 

973
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,269
same kind of role
uh but if it consumes you and it's

974
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:29,279
uh but if it consumes you and it's
 

975
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,470
uh but if it consumes you and it's
something that you think

976
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
something that you think
 

977
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,910
something that you think
in normal life when you don't have to

978
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
in normal life when you don't have to
 

979
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,430
in normal life when you don't have to
then it's not healthy and then it's not

980
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:33,440
then it's not healthy and then it's not
 

981
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,310
then it's not healthy and then it's not
productive

982
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:34,320
productive
 

983
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,790

yeah but it's fascinating to think how

984
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:36,800
yeah but it's fascinating to think how
 

985
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,749
yeah but it's fascinating to think how
to uh

986
00:16:37,749 --> 00:16:37,759
to uh
 

987
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,710
to uh
incorporate emotion into a computational

00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
incorporate emotion into a computational
 

989
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,590
incorporate emotion into a computational
agent

990
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
agent
 

991
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,350
agent
it almost seems like a silly statement

992
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
it almost seems like a silly statement
 

993
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,110
it almost seems like a silly statement
to make

994
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
to make
 

995
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,069
to make
but it perhaps seems silly because we

996
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
but it perhaps seems silly because we
 

997
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,910
but it perhaps seems silly because we
have such a poor understanding of the

emotion of fear of uh

1002
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
emotion of fear of uh
 

1003
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,150
emotion of fear of uh
i think at the core of it is another

1004
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
i think at the core of it is another
 

1005
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,269
i think at the core of it is another
word that we know

1006
00:16:59,269 --> 00:16:59,279
word that we know
 

1007
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,350
word that we know
nothing about but say a lot which is

1008
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:01,360
nothing about but say a lot which is
 

1009
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,670
nothing about but say a lot which is
consciousness

1010
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:03,680
consciousness
 

1011
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,510
consciousness
do you ever in your work or like maybe

1012
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:07,520
do you ever in your work or like maybe
 

1013
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,829
do you ever in your work or like maybe
on a coffee break think about what the

1014
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:09,839
on a coffee break think about what the
 

1015
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,789
on a coffee break think about what the
heck is this thing

1016
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
heck is this thing
 

1017
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,870
heck is this thing
consciousness and is it at all useful in

1018
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
consciousness and is it at all useful in
 

1019
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,870
consciousness and is it at all useful in
our thinking about ai systems

1020
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:14,880
our thinking about ai systems
 

1021
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,230
our thinking about ai systems
yes it is an important question

1022
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:18,240
yes it is an important question
 

1023
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,829
yes it is an important question
you can build representations and

1024
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:21,839
you can build representations and
 

1025
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,949
you can build representations and
functions

1026
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
functions
 

1027
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,350
functions
i think into these agents that act like

1028
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:25,360
i think into these agents that act like
 

1029
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,630
i think into these agents that act like
emotions

1030
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
emotions
 

1031
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,950
emotions
and consciousness perhaps so i mentioned

1032
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
and consciousness perhaps so i mentioned
 

1033
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,150
and consciousness perhaps so i mentioned
emotions being something that allow you

1034
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,160
emotions being something that allow you
 

1035
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,070
emotions being something that allow you
to focus and pay attention

1036
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,080
to focus and pay attention
 

1037
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,669
to focus and pay attention
filter out what's important yeah you can

1038
00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:35,679
filter out what's important yeah you can
 

1039
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,390
filter out what's important yeah you can
have that kind of a filter mechanism

1040
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
have that kind of a filter mechanism
 

1041
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,909
have that kind of a filter mechanism
and you can it puts you in a different

1042
00:17:39,909 --> 00:17:39,919
and you can it puts you in a different
 

1043
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,669
and you can it puts you in a different
state your computation is in a different

1044
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
state your computation is in a different
 

1045
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,270
state your computation is in a different
state certain things don't really get

1046
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,280
state certain things don't really get
 

1047
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,230
state certain things don't really get
through and others

1048
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
through and others
 

1049
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,909
through and others
are heightened now you label that box

1050
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
are heightened now you label that box
 

1051
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,270
are heightened now you label that box
emotion i don't know if that means it's

1052
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,280
emotion i don't know if that means it's
 

1053
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,630
emotion i don't know if that means it's
an emotion but it acts

1054
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:50,640
an emotion but it acts
 

1055
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,549
an emotion but it acts
very much like we understand what

1056
00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:52,559
very much like we understand what
 

1057
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,150
very much like we understand what
emotions are

1058
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:54,160
emotions are
 

1059
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,070
emotions are
and we actually did some work like that

1060
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:56,080
and we actually did some work like that
 

1061
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,430
and we actually did some work like that
um modeling

1062
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
um modeling
 

1063
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,390
um modeling
hyenas who were trying to steal a kill

1064
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:00,400
hyenas who were trying to steal a kill
 

1065
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,070
hyenas who were trying to steal a kill
from lions

1066
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:02,080
from lions
 

1067
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,310
from lions
which happens in africa i mean hyenas

1068
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:04,320
which happens in africa i mean hyenas
 

1069
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,110
which happens in africa i mean hyenas
are

1070
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,120
are
 

1071
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,029
are
quite intelligent but not really

1072
00:18:07,029 --> 00:18:07,039
quite intelligent but not really
 

1073
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,230
quite intelligent but not really
intelligent

1074
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
intelligent
 

1075
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,470
intelligent
and they they have this behavior that's

1076
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
and they they have this behavior that's
 

1077
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,990
and they they have this behavior that's
more complex than anything else they do

1078
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,000
more complex than anything else they do
 

1079
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,990
more complex than anything else they do
they can band together if there's

1080
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
they can band together if there's
 

1081
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,789
they can band together if there's
about 30 of them or so uh they can uh

1082
00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:18,799
about 30 of them or so uh they can uh
 

1083
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,390
about 30 of them or so uh they can uh
coordinate their effort so that they

1084
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:20,400
coordinate their effort so that they
 

1085
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,390
coordinate their effort so that they
push the lions away from a kill

1086
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:22,400
push the lions away from a kill
 

1087
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,990
push the lions away from a kill
even though the lions are so strong that

1088
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
even though the lions are so strong that
 

1089
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,510
even though the lions are so strong that
they could kill a lion

1090
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:25,520
they could kill a lion
 

1091
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,390
they could kill a lion
kill a hyena by by striking with a paw

1092
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:28,400
kill a hyena by by striking with a paw
 

1093
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,830
kill a hyena by by striking with a paw
but when they work together and

1094
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:29,840
but when they work together and
 

1095
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,990
but when they work together and
precisely time this attack the lions

1096
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:32,000
precisely time this attack the lions
 

1097
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,990
precisely time this attack the lions
will leave and they get the kill

1098
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:34,000
will leave and they get the kill
 

1099
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,150
will leave and they get the kill
and probably there are some

1100
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:38,160
and probably there are some
 

1101
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,470
and probably there are some
states like emotions that the hyenas go

1102
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:40,480
states like emotions that the hyenas go
 

1103
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,230
states like emotions that the hyenas go
through the first they

1104
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:42,240
through the first they
 

1105
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,909
through the first they
they call for reinforcements they really

1106
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
they call for reinforcements they really
 

1107
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,350
they call for reinforcements they really
want that kill but there's not enough of

1108
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:45,360
want that kill but there's not enough of
 

1109
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,110
want that kill but there's not enough of
them so they vocalize and

1110
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:47,120
them so they vocalize and
 

1111
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,470
them so they vocalize and
there's more peop more people more

1112
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:48,480
there's more peop more people more
 

1113
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,789
there's more peop more people more
hyenas that come around

1114
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:50,799
hyenas that come around
 

1115
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,310
hyenas that come around
and then they have two emotions they're

1116
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:52,320
and then they have two emotions they're
 

1117
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,230
and then they have two emotions they're
very afraid of the lion

1118
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:54,240
very afraid of the lion
 

1119
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,070
very afraid of the lion
so they want to stay away but they also

1120
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,080
so they want to stay away but they also
 

1121
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,990
so they want to stay away but they also
have a strong affiliation

1122
00:18:57,990 --> 00:18:58,000
have a strong affiliation
 

1123
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,549
have a strong affiliation
between each other and then this is the

1124
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
between each other and then this is the
 

1125
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,390
between each other and then this is the
balance of the two emotions and

1126
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:02,400
balance of the two emotions and
 

1127
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,110
balance of the two emotions and
and also yes they also want the kill so

1128
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,120
and also yes they also want the kill so
 

1129
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,950
and also yes they also want the kill so
it's both rebelled and attractive and

1130
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:06,960
it's both rebelled and attractive and
 

1131
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,470
it's both rebelled and attractive and
then but then this

1132
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:08,480
then but then this
 

1133
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,710
then but then this
affiliation eventually is so strong that

1134
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:10,720
affiliation eventually is so strong that
 

1135
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,310
affiliation eventually is so strong that
when they move they move together they

1136
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
when they move they move together they
 

1137
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,350
when they move they move together they
act as a unit

1138
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,360
act as a unit
 

1139
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,270
act as a unit
and they they can perform that function

1140
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:15,280
and they they can perform that function
 

1141
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,549
and they they can perform that function
so there's an

1142
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
so there's an
 

1143
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,870
so there's an
interesting behavior that seems to

1144
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
interesting behavior that seems to
 

1145
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,710
interesting behavior that seems to
depend on these emotions

1146
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:20,720
depend on these emotions
 

1147
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,029
depend on these emotions
strongly and makes it possible um

1148
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:23,039
strongly and makes it possible um
 

1149
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,150
strongly and makes it possible um
important reactions

1150
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:24,160
important reactions
 

1151
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,669
important reactions
and i think a cr a critical

1152
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:27,679
and i think a cr a critical
 

1153
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,750
and i think a cr a critical
aspect of that the way you're describing

1154
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:29,760
aspect of that the way you're describing
 

1155
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,110
aspect of that the way you're describing
is emotion there is

1156
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
is emotion there is
 

1157
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,230
is emotion there is
a mechanism of social communication

1158
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:34,240
a mechanism of social communication
 

1159
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,270
a mechanism of social communication
of a social interaction maybe that

1160
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,280
of a social interaction maybe that
 

1161
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,750
of a social interaction maybe that
maybe humans won't even be that

1162
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:39,760
maybe humans won't even be that
 

1163
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,950
maybe humans won't even be that
intelligent or most

1164
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:40,960
intelligent or most
 

1165
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,310
intelligent or most
things we think of as intelligent

1166
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
things we think of as intelligent
 

1167
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,150
things we think of as intelligent
wouldn't be that intelligent without

1168
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
wouldn't be that intelligent without
 

1169
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,950
wouldn't be that intelligent without
the social component of interaction

1170
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:46,960
the social component of interaction
 

1171
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,750
the social component of interaction
maybe most

1172
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:47,760
maybe most
 

1173
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,150
maybe most
much of our intelligence is essentially

1174
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
much of our intelligence is essentially
 

1175
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,789
much of our intelligence is essentially
in our growth of social interaction

1176
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:52,799
in our growth of social interaction
 

1177
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,710
in our growth of social interaction
and maybe for the creation of

1178
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
and maybe for the creation of
 

1179
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,070
and maybe for the creation of
intelligent agents we have to be

1180
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:56,080
intelligent agents we have to be
 

1181
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,029
intelligent agents we have to be
creating

1182
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,039
creating

yes fundamentally social systems yes i i

1184
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
yes fundamentally social systems yes i i
 

1185
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,029
yes fundamentally social systems yes i i
strongly believe that's true

1186
00:20:01,029 --> 00:20:01,039
strongly believe that's true
 

1187
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,549
strongly believe that's true
and uh yes the uh communication is

1188
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
and uh yes the uh communication is
 

1189
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,830
and uh yes the uh communication is
multifaceted i mean

1190
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:05,840
multifaceted i mean
 

1191
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,990
multifaceted i mean
they they vocalize and call for friends

1192
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,000
they they vocalize and call for friends
 

1193
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,110
they they vocalize and call for friends
but they also

1194
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,120
but they also
 

1195
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,110
but they also
rub against each other and they push and

1196
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,120
rub against each other and they push and
 

1197
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,390
rub against each other and they push and
they do all kinds of

1198
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
they do all kinds of
 

1199
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,270
they do all kinds of
gestures and so on so they known act

1200
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:15,280
gestures and so on so they known act
 

1201
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,190
gestures and so on so they known act
alone and i don't think people act alone

1202
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,200
alone and i don't think people act alone
 

1203
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,510
alone and i don't think people act alone
uh very much either at least normal most

1204
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:19,520
uh very much either at least normal most
 

1205
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,029
uh very much either at least normal most
of the time

1206
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:21,039
of the time
 

1207
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,750
of the time
and social systems are so strong for

1208
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
and social systems are so strong for
 

1209
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,950

that i think we build everything on top

1212
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:27,120
that i think we build everything on top
 

1213
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,350
that i think we build everything on top
of these kind of structures and

1214
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:29,360
of these kind of structures and
 

1215
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,710
of these kind of structures and
one interesting theory around that

1216
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
one interesting theory around that
 

1217
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,990
one interesting theory around that
bigger this theory for instance for

1218
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:32,000
bigger this theory for instance for
 

1219
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,669
bigger this theory for instance for
language but language origins is

1220
00:20:33,669 --> 00:20:33,679
language but language origins is
 

1221
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,350
language but language origins is
that where did language come from and

1222
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:37,360
that where did language come from and
 

1223
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,070
that where did language come from and
and it's a plausible theory that first

1224
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:40,080
and it's a plausible theory that first
 

1225
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,750
and it's a plausible theory that first
came social systems that

1226
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:41,760
came social systems that
 

1227
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,110
came social systems that
you have different roles in a society

1228
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:45,120
you have different roles in a society
 

1229
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,270
you have different roles in a society
and then those roles are exchangeable

1230
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
and then those roles are exchangeable
 

1231
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,470
and then those roles are exchangeable
that you know i scratch

1232
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:48,480
that you know i scratch
 

1233
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,310
that you know i scratch
your back you scratch my back you can

1234
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:50,320
your back you scratch my back you can
 

1235
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,510
your back you scratch my back you can
exchange roles

1236
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:51,520
exchange roles
 

1237
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,350
exchange roles
and once you have the brain structures

1238
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:53,360
and once you have the brain structures
 

1239
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,950
and once you have the brain structures
that allow you to understand actions in

1240
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:54,960
that allow you to understand actions in
 

1241
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,190
that allow you to understand actions in
terms of roles that can be changed

1242
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:57,200
terms of roles that can be changed
 

1243
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,190
terms of roles that can be changed
that's the basis for language for

1244
00:20:59,190 --> 00:20:59,200
that's the basis for language for
 

1245
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,110
that's the basis for language for
grammar and now you can start

1246
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,120
grammar and now you can start
 

1247
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,750
grammar and now you can start
using symbols to refer to uh objects in

1248
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:03,760
using symbols to refer to uh objects in
 

1249
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,710
using symbols to refer to uh objects in
the world

1250
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:04,720
the world
 

1251
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,510
the world
and you have this flexible structure so

1252
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:07,520
and you have this flexible structure so
 

1253
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,270
and you have this flexible structure so
there's a social structure

1254
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
there's a social structure
 

1255
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,110
there's a social structure
that's fundament fundamental for

1256
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:11,120
that's fundament fundamental for
 

1257
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,390
that's fundament fundamental for
language to develop

1258
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
language to develop
 

1259
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,230
language to develop
now again then you have language you can

1260
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
now again then you have language you can
 

1261
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,590
now again then you have language you can
you can refer to things that are not

1262
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:15,600
you can refer to things that are not
 

1263
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,149
you can refer to things that are not
here

1264
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
here
 

1265
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,110
here
right now and that allows you to then

1266
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:19,120
right now and that allows you to then
 

1267
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,830
right now and that allows you to then
build all the

1268
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:19,840
build all the
 

1269
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,070
build all the
all the good stuff about uh planning for

1270
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:22,080
all the good stuff about uh planning for
 

1271
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,950
all the good stuff about uh planning for
instance and

1272
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:22,960
instance and
 

1273
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,950
instance and
building things and so on so yeah i

1274
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:24,960
building things and so on so yeah i
 

1275
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,230
building things and so on so yeah i
think that very strongly

1276
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:26,240
think that very strongly
 

1277
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,430
think that very strongly
uh humans are social and that gives us

1278
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
uh humans are social and that gives us
 

1279
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,789
uh humans are social and that gives us
ability to structure the world

1280
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:32,799
ability to structure the world
 

1281
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:35,029
ability to structure the world
but also as a society we can do so much

1282
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:35,039
but also as a society we can do so much
 

1283
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,070
but also as a society we can do so much
more because we don't

1284
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:36,080
more because we don't
 

1285
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,510
more because we don't
one person does not have to do

1286
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:37,520
one person does not have to do
 

1287
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,590
one person does not have to do
everything you can have different roles

1288
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:39,600
everything you can have different roles
 

1289
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,909
everything you can have different roles
and together achieve a lot more and

1290
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:41,919
and together achieve a lot more and
 

1291
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,110
and together achieve a lot more and
that's also something we see in

1292
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
that's also something we see in
 

1293
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,870
that's also something we see in
computational simulations today i mean

1294
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
computational simulations today i mean
 

1295
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,710
computational simulations today i mean
we have multi-agent systems that

1296
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:46,720
we have multi-agent systems that
 

1297
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,029
we have multi-agent systems that
can perform tasks this fascinating uh

1298
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:49,039
can perform tasks this fascinating uh
 

1299
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,789
can perform tasks this fascinating uh
demonstration marco dorico i think it

1300
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
demonstration marco dorico i think it
 

1301
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:51,270
demonstration marco dorico i think it
was

1302
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:51,280
was
 

1303
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,350
was
um these robots little robots that had

1304
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:53,360
um these robots little robots that had
 

1305
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,710
um these robots little robots that had
to navigate through an environment and

1306
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
to navigate through an environment and
 

1307
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,510
to navigate through an environment and
there were

1308
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:55,520
there were
 

1309
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,590
there were
there were things that are dangerous

1310
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:57,600
there were things that are dangerous
 

1311
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,710
there were things that are dangerous
like maybe a

1312
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:58,720
like maybe a
 

1313
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,510
like maybe a
a big chasm or some kind of groove a

1314
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:01,520
a big chasm or some kind of groove a
 

1315
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,070
a big chasm or some kind of groove a
hole

1316
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
hole
 

1317
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,830
hole
and they could not get across it but if

1318
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:03,840
and they could not get across it but if
 

1319
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,190
and they could not get across it but if
they grab each other

1320
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:05,200
they grab each other
 

1321
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,669
they grab each other
with their gripper they formed a robot

1322
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:07,679
with their gripper they formed a robot
 

1323
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,110
with their gripper they formed a robot
that was much longer on

1324
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:09,120
that was much longer on
 

1325
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,190
that was much longer on
the team and this way they could get

1326
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:11,200
the team and this way they could get
 

1327
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,310
the team and this way they could get
across that yeah

1328
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:12,320
across that yeah
 

1329
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,110
across that yeah
so this is a great example of how

1330
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,120
so this is a great example of how
 

1331
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,710
so this is a great example of how
together we can achieve things we

1332
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
together we can achieve things we
 

1333
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,549
together we can achieve things we
couldn't otherwise like the hyenas

1334
00:22:18,549 --> 00:22:18,559
couldn't otherwise like the hyenas
 

1335
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,390
couldn't otherwise like the hyenas
you know alone they couldn't but as a

1336
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:20,400
you know alone they couldn't but as a
 

1337
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,470
you know alone they couldn't but as a
team they could uh and i think humans do

1338
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:22,480
team they could uh and i think humans do
 

1339
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,750
team they could uh and i think humans do
that all the time we're really good at

1340
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:23,760
that all the time we're really good at
 

1341
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,710
that all the time we're really good at
that

1342
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:24,720
that
 

1343
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,230
that
yeah and the way you describe the the

1344
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:26,240
yeah and the way you describe the the
 

1345
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,909
yeah and the way you describe the the
system of hyenas

1346
00:22:27,909 --> 00:22:27,919
system of hyenas
 

1347
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,070
system of hyenas
it almost sounds algorithmic like the

1348
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:30,080
it almost sounds algorithmic like the
 

1349
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,510
it almost sounds algorithmic like the
the problem with humans is they're so

1350
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:31,520
the problem with humans is they're so
 

1351
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,789
the problem with humans is they're so
complex

1352
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:32,799
complex
 

1353
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,110
complex
it's hard to think of them as algorithms

1354
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,120
it's hard to think of them as algorithms
 

1355
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,230
it's hard to think of them as algorithms
but with hyenas

1356
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
but with hyenas
 

1357
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,430
but with hyenas
there's a it's simple enough to where it

1358
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
there's a it's simple enough to where it
 

1359
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,190
there's a it's simple enough to where it
feels like

1360
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,200
feels like
 

1361
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,190
feels like
um at least hopeful that it's possible

1362
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:43,200
um at least hopeful that it's possible
 

1363
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,710
um at least hopeful that it's possible
to create

1364
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:44,720
to create
 

1365
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,549
to create
computational systems that mimic that

1366
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:48,559
computational systems that mimic that
 

1367
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,430
computational systems that mimic that
yeah that's exactly why why we looked at

1368
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:51,440
yeah that's exactly why why we looked at
 

1369
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:51,830
yeah that's exactly why why we looked at
that

1370
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:51,840
that
 

1371
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,549
that
as opposed to humans um like i said they

1372
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
as opposed to humans um like i said they
 

1373
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:55,909
as opposed to humans um like i said they
are intelligent but they are not quite

1374
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:55,919
are intelligent but they are not quite
 

1375
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,029
are intelligent but they are not quite
as intelligent

1376
00:22:57,029 --> 00:22:57,039
as intelligent
 

1377
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,070
as intelligent
intelligent as say baboons which would

1378
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,080
intelligent as say baboons which would
 

1379
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,510
intelligent as say baboons which would
learn a lot and would be much more

1380
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:01,520
learn a lot and would be much more
 

1381
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,110
learn a lot and would be much more
flexible that hyenas

1382
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:03,120
flexible that hyenas
 

1383
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,669
flexible that hyenas
are relatively rigid in what they can do

1384
00:23:05,669 --> 00:23:05,679
are relatively rigid in what they can do
 

1385
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,430
are relatively rigid in what they can do
and therefore you could look at this

1386
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:07,440
and therefore you could look at this
 

1387
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,510
and therefore you could look at this
behavior like this is a breakthrough in

1388
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
behavior like this is a breakthrough in
 

1389
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,950
behavior like this is a breakthrough in
evolution about to happen

1390
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
evolution about to happen
 

1391
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,789
evolution about to happen
yes that they've discovered something

1392
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
yes that they've discovered something
 

1393
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,830
yes that they've discovered something
about social structures communication

1394
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
about social structures communication
 

1395
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,470
about social structures communication
about cooperation and and it might then

1396
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:18,480
about cooperation and and it might then
 

1397
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,990
about cooperation and and it might then
spill over to other things too

1398
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,000
spill over to other things too
 

1399
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,549
spill over to other things too
yeah in thousands of years in the future

1400
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:22,559
yeah in thousands of years in the future
 

1401
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,029
yeah in thousands of years in the future
yeah

1402
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
yeah
 

1403
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,470
yeah
i think the problem with baboons and

1404
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:24,480
i think the problem with baboons and
 

1405
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,470
i think the problem with baboons and
humans is probably too much is going on

1406
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:26,480
humans is probably too much is going on
 

1407
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,750
humans is probably too much is going on
inside the head

1408
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:27,760
inside the head
 

1409
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,350
inside the head
we won't be able to measure it if we're

1410
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
we won't be able to measure it if we're
 

1411
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,029
we won't be able to measure it if we're
observing the system with hyenas is

1412
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:31,039
observing the system with hyenas is
 

1413
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,390
observing the system with hyenas is
probably

1414
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:32,400
probably
 

1415
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,029
probably
easier to observe the actual decision

1416
00:23:35,029 --> 00:23:35,039
easier to observe the actual decision
 

1417
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,870
easier to observe the actual decision
making and the various

1418
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:36,880
making and the various
 

1419
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,110
making and the various
motivations that are involved yeah they

1420
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
motivations that are involved yeah they
 

1421
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:39,909
motivations that are involved yeah they
are visible

1422
00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:39,919
are visible
 

1423
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,029
are visible
and we can even um quantify possibly

1424
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:43,039
and we can even um quantify possibly
 

1425
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,070
and we can even um quantify possibly
their

1426
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,080
their
 

1427
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,110
their
emotional state because they leave

1428
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:47,120
emotional state because they leave
 

1429
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,149
emotional state because they leave
droppings behind

droppings behind
 

1431
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,830
droppings behind
and there are chemicals there that can

1432
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:49,840
and there are chemicals there that can
 

1433
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,430
and there are chemicals there that can
be associated with uh

1434
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:51,440
be associated with uh
 

1435
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,430
be associated with uh
with neurotransmitters and we can

1436
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:53,440
with neurotransmitters and we can
 

1437
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,029
with neurotransmitters and we can
separate what emotions they might have

1438
00:23:57,029 --> 00:23:57,039
separate what emotions they might have
 

1439
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,149
separate what emotions they might have
experienced in the last 24 hours yeah

i i think that evolution computation is

1458
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
i i think that evolution computation is
 

1459
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,630
i i think that evolution computation is
the most amazing method so what

1460
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:20,640
the most amazing method so what
 

1461
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,070
the most amazing method so what
fascinates me

1462
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
fascinates me
 

1463
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,789
fascinates me
most is that with computers is that you

1464
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:24,799
most is that with computers is that you
 

1465
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,830
most is that with computers is that you
can

1466
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:25,840
can
 

1467
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,590
can
you can get more out than you put in i

1468
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:27,600
you can get more out than you put in i
 

1469
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,750
you can get more out than you put in i
mean you can write a piece of code

1470
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:29,760
mean you can write a piece of code
 

1471
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,549
mean you can write a piece of code
and your machine does what you told it i

1472
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
and your machine does what you told it i
 

1473
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,110
and your machine does what you told it i
mean

1474
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
mean
 

1475
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,029
mean
this happened to me in my freshman year

1476
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:35,039
this happened to me in my freshman year
 

1477
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,950
this happened to me in my freshman year
i it did something very simple and i was

1478
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
i it did something very simple and i was
 

1479
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,710
i it did something very simple and i was
just amazed i was blown away that it

1480
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:38,720
just amazed i was blown away that it
 

1481
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,110
just amazed i was blown away that it
would

1482
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,120
would
 

1483
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,870
would
it would get the number and it would

1484
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:40,880
it would get the number and it would
 

1485
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,630
it would get the number and it would
compute the result and i didn't have to

1486
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
compute the result and i didn't have to
 

1487
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,990
compute the result and i didn't have to
do it myself

1488
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:44,000
do it myself
 

1489
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,390
do it myself
very simple but if you push that a

1490
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:46,400
very simple but if you push that a
 

1491
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,430
very simple but if you push that a
little further

1492
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:47,440
little further
 

1493
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,590
little further
you can have machines that learn and

1494
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:49,600
you can have machines that learn and
 

1495
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,430
you can have machines that learn and
they might learn patterns

1496
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
they might learn patterns
 

1497
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,269
they might learn patterns
and already say deep learning neural

1498
00:24:53,269 --> 00:24:53,279
and already say deep learning neural
 

1499
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,909
and already say deep learning neural
networks they can learn to recognize

1500
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:55,919
networks they can learn to recognize
 

1501
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,430
networks they can learn to recognize
objects sounds um patterns that humans

1502
00:24:59,430 --> 00:24:59,440
objects sounds um patterns that humans
 

1503
00:24:59,440 --> 00:24:59,990
objects sounds um patterns that humans
have trouble

1504
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
have trouble
 

1505
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,830
have trouble
with and sometimes they do it better

1506
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
with and sometimes they do it better
 

1507
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,149
with and sometimes they do it better
than humans and that's so fascinating

1508
00:25:04,149 --> 00:25:04,159
than humans and that's so fascinating
 

1509
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:05,990
than humans and that's so fascinating
and now if you take that one more step

1510
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:06,000
and now if you take that one more step
 

1511
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,350
and now if you take that one more step
you get something like evolution

1512
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:07,360
you get something like evolution
 

1513
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,070
you get something like evolution
algorithms

1514
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
algorithms
 

1515
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,310
algorithms
that discover things they create things

1516
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:10,320
that discover things they create things
 

1517
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,149
that discover things they create things
they come up with solutions that you did

1518
00:25:12,149 --> 00:25:12,159
they come up with solutions that you did
 

1519
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,350
they come up with solutions that you did
not think of

1520
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:13,360
not think of
 

1521
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,510
not think of
and that just blows me away it's so

1522
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,520
and that just blows me away it's so
 

1523
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,870
and that just blows me away it's so
great that we can build

1524
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:16,880
great that we can build
 

1525
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,909
great that we can build
systems algorithms that can be in some

1526
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
systems algorithms that can be in some
 

1527
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,549
systems algorithms that can be in some
sense

1528
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:20,559
sense
 

1529
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:21,750
sense
smarter than we are that they can

1530
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:21,760
smarter than we are that they can
 

1531
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,710
smarter than we are that they can
discover solutions that we might miss

1532
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:24,720
discover solutions that we might miss
 

1533
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,230
discover solutions that we might miss
a lot of times it is because we have as

1534
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:26,240
a lot of times it is because we have as
 

1535
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,310
a lot of times it is because we have as
humans we have certain biases we expect

1536
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
humans we have certain biases we expect
 

1537
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,909
humans we have certain biases we expect
the solutions to be a certain way

1538
00:25:29,909 --> 00:25:29,919
the solutions to be a certain way
 

1539
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,750
the solutions to be a certain way
and you don't put those biases into the

1540
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:31,760
and you don't put those biases into the
 

1541
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,110
and you don't put those biases into the
algorithm so they are more free to

1542
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
algorithm so they are more free to
 

1543
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,909
algorithm so they are more free to
explore

1544
00:25:33,909 --> 00:25:33,919
explore
 

1545
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,070
explore
and evolution is just absolutely

1546
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,080
and evolution is just absolutely
 

1547
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,669
and evolution is just absolutely
fantastic explorer

1548
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:37,679
fantastic explorer
 

1549
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,269
fantastic explorer
and that's what what really is

1550
00:25:39,269 --> 00:25:39,279
and that's what what really is
 

1551
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,390
and that's what what really is
fascinating yeah i think uh

1552
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
fascinating yeah i think uh
 

1553
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,990
fascinating yeah i think uh
i get made fun of a bit because i

1554
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
i get made fun of a bit because i
 

1555
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,830
i get made fun of a bit because i
currently don't have any kids

1556
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:45,840
currently don't have any kids
 

1557
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,190
currently don't have any kids
but you mentioned programs i mean

1558
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,200
but you mentioned programs i mean
 

1559
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,669
but you mentioned programs i mean
um do you have kids yeah so maybe you

1560
00:25:51,669 --> 00:25:51,679
um do you have kids yeah so maybe you
 

1561
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,430
um do you have kids yeah so maybe you
could speak to this but there's a magic

1562
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:53,440
could speak to this but there's a magic
 

1563
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,549
could speak to this but there's a magic
to the creation

1564
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:54,559
to the creation
 

1565
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,470
to the creation
creative process like i uh with spot

1566
00:25:58,470 --> 00:25:58,480
creative process like i uh with spot
 

1567
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,310
creative process like i uh with spot
the boston dynamic spot but really any

1568
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,320
the boston dynamic spot but really any
 

1569
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,310
the boston dynamic spot but really any
robot that i've ever worked on

1570
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:02,320
robot that i've ever worked on
 

1571
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,070
robot that i've ever worked on
it just feels like the similar kind of

1572
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
it just feels like the similar kind of
 

1573
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,549
it just feels like the similar kind of
joy i imagine i would have as a father

1574
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:06,559
joy i imagine i would have as a father
 

1575
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,789
joy i imagine i would have as a father
not the same perhaps level but like the

1576
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
not the same perhaps level but like the
 

1577
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,950
not the same perhaps level but like the
same kind of wonderment like

1578
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:10,960
same kind of wonderment like
 

1579
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,310
same kind of wonderment like
exactly this which is like you know what

1580
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:14,320
exactly this which is like you know what
 

1581
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,750
exactly this which is like you know what
you had to do

1582
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:15,760
you had to do
 

1583
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,430
you had to do
initially uh to get this thing going

1584
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:19,440
initially uh to get this thing going
 

1585
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,590
initially uh to get this thing going
let's speak on the computer science side

1586
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:21,600
let's speak on the computer science side
 

1587
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,750
let's speak on the computer science side
like what the program looks like

1588
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:23,760
like what the program looks like
 

1589
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,110
like what the program looks like
but something about it uh doing

1590
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:27,120
but something about it uh doing
 

1591
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,669
but something about it uh doing
more than what the program was written

1592
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
more than what the program was written
 

1593
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:30,870
more than what the program was written
on paper

1594
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:30,880
on paper
 

1595
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,510
on paper
is like that somehow connects to the

1596
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:33,520
is like that somehow connects to the
 

1597
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,549
is like that somehow connects to the
magic

1598
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:34,559
magic
 

1599
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,110
magic
of this entire universe like that's

1600
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,120
of this entire universe like that's
 

1601
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,190
of this entire universe like that's
that's like i i feel like i found god

1602
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:39,200
that's like i i feel like i found god
 

1603
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,149
that's like i i feel like i found god
every time i like it's like uh because

1604
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
every time i like it's like uh because
 

1605
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,110
every time i like it's like uh because
you're you've really

1606
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
you're you've really
 

1607
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,909
you're you've really
created something that's living yeah

1608
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:45,919
created something that's living yeah
 

1609
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:46,630
created something that's living yeah
even if it's

1610
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:46,640
even if it's
 

1611
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:47,750
even if it's
it has a life of its own has the

1612
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:47,760
it has a life of its own has the
 

1613
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,510
it has a life of its own has the
intelligence of its own it's beyond what

1614
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:49,520
intelligence of its own it's beyond what
 

1615
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,950
intelligence of its own it's beyond what
you actually thought

1616
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:50,960
you actually thought
 

1617
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,870
you actually thought
yeah and that is i think it's exactly

1618
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:52,880
yeah and that is i think it's exactly
 

1619
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,110
yeah and that is i think it's exactly
spot on that's exactly what it's about

1620
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
spot on that's exactly what it's about
 

1621
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,269
spot on that's exactly what it's about
uh you created something and has a

1622
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:57,279
uh you created something and has a
 

1623
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,470
uh you created something and has a
ability to

1624
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
ability to
 

1625
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,870
ability to
uh live its life and and do good things

1626
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:00,880
uh live its life and and do good things
 

1627
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,750
uh live its life and and do good things
and um

1628
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:01,760
and um
 

1629
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,430
and um
you just gave it a starting point so in

1630
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:03,440
you just gave it a starting point so in
 

1631
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,110
you just gave it a starting point so in
that sense i think it's that may be part

1632
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
that sense i think it's that may be part
 

1633
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,669
that sense i think it's that may be part
of the joy actually

1634
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:07,679
of the joy actually
 

1635
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,510
of the joy actually
uh you see but you mentioned creativity

1636
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
uh you see but you mentioned creativity
 

1637
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,950
uh you see but you mentioned creativity
in this context uh

1638
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
in this context uh
 

1639
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,390
in this context uh
especially in the context of

1640
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
especially in the context of
 

1641
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,149
especially in the context of
evolutionary computation

1642
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
evolutionary computation
 

1643
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,710
evolutionary computation
so you know we don't often think of

1644
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
so you know we don't often think of
 

1645
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,389
so you know we don't often think of
algorithms as creative

1646
00:27:18,389 --> 00:27:18,399
algorithms as creative
 

1647
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,269
algorithms as creative
so how do you think about creativity

1648
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
so how do you think about creativity
 

1649
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,310
so how do you think about creativity
yeah

1650
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:22,320
yeah
 

1651
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,950
yeah
algorithms absolutely can be creative um

1652
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:24,960

but if you can control everything it's
 

1703
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,230
but if you can control everything it's
too much and it turns out that we don't

1704
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:14,240
too much and it turns out that we don't
 

1705
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,990

actually know very much about it
so we built a system evolution

1708
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:18,720
so we built a system evolution
 

1709
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,230
so we built a system evolution

and let this system explore recipes

1716
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:27,440
and let this system explore recipes
 

1717
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,549
and let this system explore recipes
on its own and initially now we were

1718
00:28:30,549 --> 00:28:30,559
on its own and initially now we were
 

1719
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,750
on its own and initially now we were
focusing on light

1720
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
focusing on light
 

1721
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,950
focusing on light
uh how strong what wavelengths how long

1722
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:34,960
uh how strong what wavelengths how long
 

1723
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,310
uh how strong what wavelengths how long
the light was on

1724
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:36,320
the light was on
 

1725
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,950
the light was on
um and we put some boundaries which we

1726
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:38,960
um and we put some boundaries which we
 

1727
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,149
um and we put some boundaries which we
thought were reasonable

1728
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:40,159
thought were reasonable
 

1729
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,029
thought were reasonable
for instance that there was um at least

1730
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
for instance that there was um at least
 

1731
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,269
for instance that there was um at least
six hours of darkness like night because

1732
00:28:45,269 --> 00:28:45,279
six hours of darkness like night because
 

1733
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,190
six hours of darkness like night because
that's what we have in the world

1734
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:47,200
that's what we have in the world
 

1735
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,110
that's what we have in the world
and very quickly um the system evolution

1736
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:51,120
and very quickly um the system evolution
 

1737
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,149
and very quickly um the system evolution
pushed all the recipes to that limit uh

1738
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:54,159
pushed all the recipes to that limit uh
 

1739
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:55,590
pushed all the recipes to that limit uh
we were trying to grow basil

1740
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:55,600
we were trying to grow basil
 

1741
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,710
we were trying to grow basil
um and we had initially have some 200

1742
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
um and we had initially have some 200
 

1743
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,149
um and we had initially have some 200
300 recipes

1744
00:29:00,149 --> 00:29:00,159
300 recipes
 

1745
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,630
300 recipes
exploration as well as known recipes but

1746
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:02,640
exploration as well as known recipes but
 

1747
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,389
exploration as well as known recipes but
but now we are going beyond that and

1748
00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:04,399
but now we are going beyond that and
 

1749
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,549
but now we are going beyond that and
everything was like pushed at that limit

1750
00:29:06,549 --> 00:29:06,559
everything was like pushed at that limit
 

1751
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,029
everything was like pushed at that limit
so

1752
00:29:07,029 --> 00:29:07,039
so
 

1753
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,470
so
we look at it and say well you know we

1754
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
we look at it and say well you know we
 

1755
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,310
we look at it and say well you know we
can easily just change it let's have it

1756
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:10,320
can easily just change it let's have it
 

1757
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,950
can easily just change it let's have it
your way

1758
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:10,960
your way
 

1759
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,029
your way
and it turns out uh the system

1760
00:29:13,029 --> 00:29:13,039
and it turns out uh the system
 

1761
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:14,950
and it turns out uh the system
discovered that bazel does not need to

1762
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
discovered that bazel does not need to
 

1763
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,990
discovered that bazel does not need to
sleep

1764
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:16,000
sleep
 

1765
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,510
sleep
uh 24 hours lights on and it will thrive

1766
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:19,520
uh 24 hours lights on and it will thrive
 

1767
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,669
uh 24 hours lights on and it will thrive
it will be bigger it will be tastier and

1768
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:21,679
it will be bigger it will be tastier and
 

1769
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:23,830
it will be bigger it will be tastier and
this was a big surprise

1770
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
this was a big surprise
 

1771
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,669
this was a big surprise
not just to us but also the biologists

1772
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679
not just to us but also the biologists
 

1773
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:26,950
not just to us but also the biologists
in the team

1774
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
in the team
 

1775
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,070
in the team
that anticipated that this is some

1776
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:30,080
that anticipated that this is some
 

1777
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,950
that anticipated that this is some
constraints that

1778
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:30,960
constraints that
 

1779
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,029
constraints that
that are in the world for a reason it

1780
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
that are in the world for a reason it
 

1781
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,029
that are in the world for a reason it
turns out that evolution did not have

1782
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:35,039
turns out that evolution did not have
 

1783
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,070
turns out that evolution did not have
the same bias

1784
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:36,080
the same bias
 

1785
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,909
the same bias
and therefore it discovered something

1786
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
and therefore it discovered something
 

1787
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,750
and therefore it discovered something
that was creative it was surprising it

1788
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:39,760
that was creative it was surprising it
 

1789
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,430
that was creative it was surprising it
was useful and it was new

1790
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:41,440
was useful and it was new
 

1791
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,269
was useful and it was new
that's fascinating to think about like

1792
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:43,279
that's fascinating to think about like
 

1793
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,510
that's fascinating to think about like
the things we think that are fundamental

1794
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:45,520
the things we think that are fundamental
 

1795
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,389
the things we think that are fundamental
to

00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:46,399
to

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,549
to

00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
living systems on earth today whether
 

1799
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,149
living systems on earth today whether
they're actually fundamental or they

1800
00:29:50,149 --> 00:29:50,159
they're actually fundamental or they
 

1801
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:51,190
they're actually fundamental or they
somehow shape

1802
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:51,200
somehow shape
 

1803
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,990
somehow shape
uh fit the constraints of the system and

1804
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:54,000
uh fit the constraints of the system and
 

1805
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,269
uh fit the constraints of the system and
all we'll have to do is just remove the

1806
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:55,279
all we'll have to do is just remove the
 

1807
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,470
all we'll have to do is just remove the

1809
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,510

do you ever think about um

00:29:59,510 --> 00:29:59,520
do you ever think about um

senses it's just the weird little like
 

1853
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,710

1855
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,510

add much more computational power the uh

add much more computational power the uh
 

1859
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:56,630
add much more computational power the uh

um well at first i'd like to comment on

1872
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
um well at first i'd like to comment on
 

1873
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,789
um well at first i'd like to comment on
on that like

1874
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:12,799
on that like
 

1875
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:15,669
on that like
changing the inputs uh to human brain uh

1876
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:15,679
changing the inputs uh to human brain uh
 

1877
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:16,310
changing the inputs uh to human brain uh
yes and

1878
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:16,320
yes and
 

1879
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,549
yes and
flexibility of of the brain i think

1880
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
flexibility of of the brain i think
 

1881
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,430
flexibility of of the brain i think
there's a lot

1882
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
there's a lot
 

1883
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,590
there's a lot
of that uh there are experiments that

1884
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:21,600
of that uh there are experiments that
 

1885
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,750
of that uh there are experiments that
are done in animals like megan kasir

1886
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:23,760
are done in animals like megan kasir
 

1887
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,029
are done in animals like megan kasir
um the mit is switching the um auditory

1888
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:27,039
um the mit is switching the um auditory
 

1889
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,310
um the mit is switching the um auditory
and visual

1890
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320

information and going going to the wrong
 

1893
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,950
information and going going to the wrong
part of the cortex and the animal

1894
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:32,960
part of the cortex and the animal
 

1895
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,509
part of the cortex and the animal
was still able to hear and perceive the

1896
00:31:35,509 --> 00:31:35,519
was still able to hear and perceive the
 

1897
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,549
was still able to hear and perceive the
visual environment

1898
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,559
visual environment

and there are kids that are born with

1900
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:40,000
and there are kids that are born with
 

1901
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,389
and there are kids that are born with
severe disorders and sometimes they have

1902
00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:42,399
severe disorders and sometimes they have
 

1903
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,029
severe disorders and sometimes they have
to remove

1904
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:43,039
to remove
 

1905
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,269
to remove
half of the brain like one half and they

1906
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:45,279
half of the brain like one half and they
 

1907
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,029
half of the brain like one half and they
still grow up they have the functions

1908
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:47,039
still grow up they have the functions
 

1909
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,230
still grow up they have the functions
migrate to the other parts

1910
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
migrate to the other parts
 

1911
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,310
migrate to the other parts
there's a lot of flexibility like that

1912
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:50,320
there's a lot of flexibility like that
 

1913
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,750
there's a lot of flexibility like that
so i think it's quite possible to

1914
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
so i think it's quite possible to
 

1915
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,590
so i think it's quite possible to
hook up the brain with different kinds

1916
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:55,600
hook up the brain with different kinds
 

1917
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,590
hook up the brain with different kinds
of sensors for instance

1918
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:57,600
of sensors for instance
 

1919
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,750
of sensors for instance
and something that we don't even quite

1920
00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
and something that we don't even quite
 

1921
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,190
and something that we don't even quite
understand or have today

1922
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
understand or have today
 

1923
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,110
understand or have today
on different kind of wavelengths or or

1924
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:03,120
on different kind of wavelengths or or
 

1925
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,549
on different kind of wavelengths or or
whatever they are um

1926
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:04,559
whatever they are um
 

1927
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,909
whatever they are um
and then the brain can learn to make

1928
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
and then the brain can learn to make
 

1929
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,310
and then the brain can learn to make
sense of it and that i think

1930
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,320
sense of it and that i think
 

1931
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,630
sense of it and that i think
is um this good hope that these

1932
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:10,640
is um this good hope that these
 

1933
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,630
is um this good hope that these
prosthetic devices for instance work

1934
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:12,640
prosthetic devices for instance work
 

1935
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,950
prosthetic devices for instance work
not because we make them so good and so

1936
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:14,960
not because we make them so good and so
 

1937
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,029
not because we make them so good and so
easy to use but the brain adapts to them

1938
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
easy to use but the brain adapts to them
 

1939
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:17,509
easy to use but the brain adapts to them
and can

1940
00:32:17,509 --> 00:32:17,519
and can
 

1941
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,710
and can
learn to take advantage of them um and

1942
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
learn to take advantage of them um and
 

1943
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,630
learn to take advantage of them um and
so in that sense if there's a trouble a

1944
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
so in that sense if there's a trouble a
 

1945
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,389
so in that sense if there's a trouble a
problem i think that brain

1946
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
problem i think that brain
 

1947
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,630
problem i think that brain
can be used to correct it now going

1948
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:26,640
can be used to correct it now going
 

1949
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,389
can be used to correct it now going
beyond what we have today can you get

1950
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:28,399
beyond what we have today can you get
 

1951
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,110
beyond what we have today can you get
smarter

1952
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,120
smarter
 

1953
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,509
smarter
that's really much harder to do uh

1954
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:31,519
that's really much harder to do uh
 

1955
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,470
that's really much harder to do uh
giving

1956
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:32,480
giving
 

1957
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,789
giving
the brain more more input probably might

1958
00:32:34,789 --> 00:32:34,799
the brain more more input probably might
 

1959
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:35,990
the brain more more input probably might
overwhelm it it would

1960
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,000
overwhelm it it would
 

1961
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,590
overwhelm it it would
have to learn to filter it and focus um

1962
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
have to learn to filter it and focus um
 

1963
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,830
have to learn to filter it and focus um
and in order to use the information

1964
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:41,840
and in order to use the information
 

1965
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,269
and in order to use the information
effectively

1966
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
effectively
 

1967
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,870
effectively
and augmenting intelligence with some

1968
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:46,880
and augmenting intelligence with some
 

1969
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,110
and augmenting intelligence with some
kind of external devices like that

1970
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:49,120
kind of external devices like that
 

1971
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,990
kind of external devices like that
might be difficult uh i think but

1972
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:52,000
might be difficult uh i think but
 

1973
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,350
might be difficult uh i think but
replacing what's lost

1974
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:53,360
replacing what's lost
 

1975
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,470
replacing what's lost
i think is quite possible right so our

1976
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:56,480
i think is quite possible right so our
 

1977
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,590
i think is quite possible right so our
intuition

1978
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:57,600
intuition
 

1979
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,669
intuition
allows us to sort of imagine that we can

1980
00:32:59,669 --> 00:32:59,679
allows us to sort of imagine that we can
 

1981
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,430
allows us to sort of imagine that we can
replace what's been lost

1982
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:01,440
replace what's been lost
 

1983
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,669
replace what's been lost
but expansion beyond what we have i mean

1984
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:03,679
but expansion beyond what we have i mean
 

1985
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:05,269
but expansion beyond what we have i mean
we are already one of the most

1986
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
we are already one of the most
 

1987
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:06,950
we are already one of the most
if not the most intelligent things on

1988
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:06,960
if not the most intelligent things on
 

1989
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,269
if not the most intelligent things on
this earth right so it's hard to imagine

1990
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:11,279
this earth right so it's hard to imagine
 

1991
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,990
this earth right so it's hard to imagine
um if the brain can hold up with an

1992
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
um if the brain can hold up with an
 

1993
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,509
um if the brain can hold up with an
order of magnitude greater set of

1994
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:15,519
order of magnitude greater set of
 

1995
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,470
order of magnitude greater set of
information

1996
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:16,480
information
 

1997
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,509
information
thrown at it if it can do if you can

1998
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
thrown at it if it can do if you can
 

1999
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:20,630
thrown at it if it can do if you can
reason through that

2000
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:20,640
reason through that
 

2001
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,230
reason through that
part of me this is the russian thing i

2002
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
part of me this is the russian thing i
 

2003
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,549
part of me this is the russian thing i
think is uh i tend to think that the

2004
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:24,559
think is uh i tend to think that the
 

2005
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,070
think is uh i tend to think that the
limitations is where the

2006
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:26,080
limitations is where the
 

2007
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,110
limitations is where the
the superpower is that

2008
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:29,120
the superpower is that
 

2009
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,029
the superpower is that
you know immortality and uh

2010
00:33:33,029 --> 00:33:33,039
you know immortality and uh
 

2011
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,870
you know immortality and uh
huge increase in bandwidth of uh

2012
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:36,880
huge increase in bandwidth of uh
 

2013
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,750
huge increase in bandwidth of uh

the brain is not going to produce

2016
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:41,200
the brain is not going to produce
 

2017
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,549
the brain is not going to produce
greater intelligence

2018
00:33:42,549 --> 00:33:42,559
greater intelligence
 

2019
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,950
greater intelligence
it might produce lesser intelligence so

2020
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:44,960
it might produce lesser intelligence so
 

2021
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,950
it might produce lesser intelligence so
i don't know there's something about

2022
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:46,960
i don't know there's something about
 

2023
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,029
i don't know there's something about
the scarcity being essential

2024
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:51,039
the scarcity being essential
 

2025
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,110
the scarcity being essential
to uh um fitness or performance

2026
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:55,120
to uh um fitness or performance
 

2027
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,789
to uh um fitness or performance
but that could be just because we're so

2028
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:56,799
but that could be just because we're so
 

2029
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,149
but that could be just because we're so
uh

2030
00:33:58,149 --> 00:33:58,159
uh
 

2031
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,310
uh
limited no exactly you make do with what

2032
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:00,320
limited no exactly you make do with what
 

2033
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,509
limited no exactly you make do with what
you have but you can

2034
00:34:01,509 --> 00:34:01,519
you have but you can
 

2035
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,830
you have but you can
uh you don't have to pipe it directly to

2036
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:03,840
uh you don't have to pipe it directly to
 

2037
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,509
uh you don't have to pipe it directly to
the brain i mean we already have

2038
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:05,519
the brain i mean we already have
 

2039
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,310
the brain i mean we already have
devices like phones where we can look up

2040
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
devices like phones where we can look up
 

2041
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,669
devices like phones where we can look up
information at any point

2042
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:09,679
information at any point
 

2043
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,589
information at any point
yeah and that can make us more

2044
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:11,599
yeah and that can make us more
 

2045
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,589
yeah and that can make us more
productive you don't have to argue about

2046
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:13,599
productive you don't have to argue about
 

2047
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,629
productive you don't have to argue about
i don't know what happened in that

2048
00:34:14,629 --> 00:34:14,639
i don't know what happened in that
 

2049
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,470
i don't know what happened in that
baseball game or whatever it is because

2050
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:16,480
baseball game or whatever it is because
 

2051
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,829
baseball game or whatever it is because
you can look it up right away and i

2052
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
you can look it up right away and i
 

2053
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,750
you can look it up right away and i
think in that sense

2054
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:19,760
think in that sense
 

2055
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,230
think in that sense
we can learn to utilize tools and that's

2056
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:22,240
we can learn to utilize tools and that's
 

2057
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,950
we can learn to utilize tools and that's
what we

2058
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:22,960
what we
 

2059
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,589
what we
we have been doing for a long long time

2060
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:25,599
we have been doing for a long long time
 

2061
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,230
we have been doing for a long long time
um

2062
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:26,240
um
 

2063
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,230
um
so and we are already the brain is

2064
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
so and we are already the brain is
 

2065
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,550
so and we are already the brain is
already drinking from the water

2066
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:30,560
already drinking from the water
 

2067
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,430
already drinking from the water
fire hose like vision there's way more

2068
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:33,440
fire hose like vision there's way more
 

2069
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:33,990
fire hose like vision there's way more
information

2070
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
information
 

2071
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,589
information
in the vision that we actually process

2072
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
in the vision that we actually process
 

2073
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,109
in the vision that we actually process
so brain is already good at

2074
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:37,119
so brain is already good at
 

2075
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,470
so brain is already good at
identifying what matters yeah and

2076
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:40,480
identifying what matters yeah and
 

2077
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,869
identifying what matters yeah and
that we can switch that from vision to

2078
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:42,879
that we can switch that from vision to
 

2079
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,310
that we can switch that from vision to
some other wavelength or some other kind

2080
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:44,320
some other wavelength or some other kind
 

2081
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,069
some other wavelength or some other kind
of modality but i think that the same

2082
00:34:46,069 --> 00:34:46,079
of modality but i think that the same
 

2083
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:47,750
of modality but i think that the same
processing principles probably still

2084
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:47,760
processing principles probably still
 

2085
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,190
processing principles probably still
apply uh but

2086
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,200
apply uh but
 

2087
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,389
apply uh but
but also indeed this uh ability to

2088
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
but also indeed this uh ability to
 

2089
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,550
but also indeed this uh ability to
uh have information more accessible and

2090
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
uh have information more accessible and
 

2091
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,909
uh have information more accessible and
more relevant i think

2092
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:55,919
more relevant i think
 

2093
00:34:55,919 --> 00:34:58,630
more relevant i think
can enhance what we do i mean kids today

2094
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
can enhance what we do i mean kids today
 

2095
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,349
can enhance what we do i mean kids today
at school

2096
00:34:59,349 --> 00:34:59,359
at school
 

2097
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,829
at school
they learn about dna i mean things that

2098
00:35:01,829 --> 00:35:01,839
they learn about dna i mean things that
 

2099
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,550
they learn about dna i mean things that
we discovered just a couple of years ago

2100
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:04,560
we discovered just a couple of years ago
 

2101
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,710
we discovered just a couple of years ago
and it's already common knowledge and we

2102
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:06,720
and it's already common knowledge and we
 

2103
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,870
and it's already common knowledge and we
are building on it and we don't see

2104
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:08,880
are building on it and we don't see
 

2105
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,390
are building on it and we don't see
a problem where um where

2106
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:12,400
a problem where um where
 

2107
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,150
a problem where um where
there's too much information that we can

2108
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,160
there's too much information that we can
 

2109
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,910
there's too much information that we can
absorb and learn maybe people become a

2110
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:15,920
absorb and learn maybe people become a
 

2111
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,030
absorb and learn maybe people become a
little bit more

2112
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,040
little bit more
 

2113
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,670
little bit more
narrow in what they know they are in one

2114
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,680
narrow in what they know they are in one
 

2115
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,790
narrow in what they know they are in one
field

2116
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:20,800
field
 

2117
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,950
field
but this information that we have

2118
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:22,960
but this information that we have
 

2119
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,030
but this information that we have
accumulated it is passed on and people

2120
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,040
accumulated it is passed on and people
 

2121
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,150
accumulated it is passed on and people
are picking up on it

2122
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:26,160
are picking up on it
 

2123
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,990
are picking up on it
and they are building on it so it's not

2124
00:35:27,990 --> 00:35:28,000
and they are building on it so it's not
 

2125
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,190
and they are building on it so it's not
like we have reached the point of

2126
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:29,200
like we have reached the point of
 

2127
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,470
like we have reached the point of
saturation

2128
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,480
saturation
 

2129
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,870
saturation
um we have still this process that

2130
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:32,880
um we have still this process that
 

2131
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,390
um we have still this process that
allows us to be selective

2132
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:34,400
allows us to be selective
 

2133
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,630
allows us to be selective
and decide what's interesting um i think

2134
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:36,640
and decide what's interesting um i think
 

2135
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,430
and decide what's interesting um i think
still works

2136
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:37,440
still works
 

2137
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,109
still works
even even with the more information we

2138
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:39,119
even even with the more information we
 

2139
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,349
even even with the more information we
have today yeah it's fascinating to

2140
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
have today yeah it's fascinating to
 

2141
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,030
have today yeah it's fascinating to
think about

2142
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:43,040
think about
 

2143
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,630
think about
like wikipedia becoming a sensor like uh

2144
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:46,640
like wikipedia becoming a sensor like uh
 

2145
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,310
like wikipedia becoming a sensor like uh
so the fire hose of information from

2146
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:48,320
so the fire hose of information from
 

2147
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,750
so the fire hose of information from
wikipedia so it's like you

2148
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:49,760
wikipedia so it's like you
 

2149
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,750
wikipedia so it's like you
integrate it directly into the brain to

2150
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:51,760
integrate it directly into the brain to
 

2151
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,030
integrate it directly into the brain to
where you're thinking like you're

2152
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:53,040
where you're thinking like you're
 

2153
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,710
where you're thinking like you're
observing the world with all of

2154
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:54,720
observing the world with all of
 

2155
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,710
observing the world with all of
wikipedia directly piping into your

2156
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:56,720
wikipedia directly piping into your
 

2157
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,750
wikipedia directly piping into your
brain

2158
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:57,760
brain
 

2159
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,710
brain
so like when i see a light i immediately

2160
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
so like when i see a light i immediately
 

2161
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,390
so like when i see a light i immediately
have like the history of

2162
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:02,400
have like the history of
 

2163
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,150
have like the history of
who invented electricity like integrated

2164
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
who invented electricity like integrated
 

2165
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,950
who invented electricity like integrated
very quickly into so just the way you

2166
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
very quickly into so just the way you
 

2167
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,310
very quickly into so just the way you
think about the world might be very

2168
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:10,320
think about the world might be very
 

2169
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,109
think about the world might be very
interesting

2170
00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:11,119
interesting
 

2171
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,230
interesting
if you can integrate that kind of

2172
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,240
if you can integrate that kind of
 

2173
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,710
if you can integrate that kind of
information what are your thoughts if i

2174
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:14,720
information what are your thoughts if i
 

2175
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,510
information what are your thoughts if i
could ask

2176
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
could ask
 

2177
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,430
could ask
uh on uh early steps on that on the

2178
00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:19,440
uh on uh early steps on that on the
 

2179
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,870
uh on uh early steps on that on the
neurolink side i don't know if you got a

2180
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:20,880
neurolink side i don't know if you got a
 

2181
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,750
neurolink side i don't know if you got a
chance to see but

2182
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
chance to see but
 

2183
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,109
chance to see but
uh there's a monkey playing pong

2184
00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:25,119
uh there's a monkey playing pong
 

2185
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,790
uh there's a monkey playing pong
yeah through the brain computer

2186
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:26,800
yeah through the brain computer
 

2187
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,710
yeah through the brain computer
interface and uh

2188
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:28,720
interface and uh
 

2189
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,790
interface and uh
the dream there is sort of you're

2190
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:30,800
the dream there is sort of you're
 

2191
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,670
the dream there is sort of you're
already replacing the thumbs essentially

2192
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:33,680
already replacing the thumbs essentially
 

2193
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,829
already replacing the thumbs essentially
that you would use to play video game

2194
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:35,839
that you would use to play video game
 

2195
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:37,750
that you would use to play video game
the dream is to be able to

2196
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:37,760
the dream is to be able to
 

2197
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,589
the dream is to be able to
increase further the the interface by

2198
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:41,599
increase further the the interface by
 

2199
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,270
increase further the the interface by
which you interact with the computer

2200
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
which you interact with the computer
 

2201
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,790
which you interact with the computer
are you impressed by this are you

2202
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:44,800
are you impressed by this are you
 

2203
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,710
are you impressed by this are you
worried about this what are your

2204
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:46,720
worried about this what are your
 

2205
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,910
worried about this what are your
thoughts as a human

2206
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:47,920
thoughts as a human
 

2207
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,270
thoughts as a human
i think it's wonderful i think it's

2208
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,280
i think it's wonderful i think it's
 

2209
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,030
i think it's wonderful i think it's
great that we could we could do

2210
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,040
great that we could we could do
 

2211
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,870
great that we could we could do
something like that i mean you can

2212
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
something like that i mean you can
 

2213
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,190
something like that i mean you can
there are devices that read your eeg for

2214
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,200
there are devices that read your eeg for
 

2215
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,069
there are devices that read your eeg for
instance

2216
00:36:56,069 --> 00:36:56,079
instance
 

2217
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,109
instance
and and you and humans can learn um

2218
00:36:59,109 --> 00:36:59,119
and and you and humans can learn um
 

2219
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,670
and and you and humans can learn um
to control things using using just their

2220
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
to control things using using just their
 

2221
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,150
to control things using using just their
thoughts

2222
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
thoughts
 

2223
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,230
thoughts
in that sense and i i don't think it's

2224
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240
in that sense and i i don't think it's
 

2225
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,670
in that sense and i i don't think it's
that different i mean those signals

2226
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
that different i mean those signals
 

2227
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,190
that different i mean those signals
would go to limbs they would go to

2228
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,200
would go to limbs they would go to
 

2229
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,990
would go to limbs they would go to
thumbs

2230
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
thumbs
 

2231
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,710
thumbs
uh now the same signals go through a

2232
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
uh now the same signals go through a
 

2233
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,750
uh now the same signals go through a
sensor to some computing system

2234
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:13,760
sensor to some computing system
 

2235
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,829
sensor to some computing system
it still probably has to be built on

2236
00:37:15,829 --> 00:37:15,839
it still probably has to be built on
 

2237
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,109
it still probably has to be built on
human terms

2238
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:17,119
human terms
 

2239
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,430
human terms
uh not to overwhelm them but but utilize

uh not to overwhelm them but but utilize
what's there and sense the right kind of

what's there and sense the right kind of
 

2243
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,790
what's there and sense the right kind of

2244
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
um
 

2245
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,430
um
patterns that are easy to generate but

2246
00:37:25,430 --> 00:37:25,440
patterns that are easy to generate but
 

2247
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,069
patterns that are easy to generate but
oh that

2248
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,079
oh that
 

2249
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,390
oh that
i think is really quite possible and and

2250
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:28,400
i think is really quite possible and and
 

2251
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,990
i think is really quite possible and and
wonderful and could be very much more

00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
wonderful and could be very much more

00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,160
is there so you mentioned surprising

00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320
uh creativity is there something you
 

2261
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,390
uh creativity is there something you
already mentioned a few examples but

2262
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:40,400
already mentioned a few examples but
 

2263
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,910
already mentioned a few examples but
is there something that jumps out at you

is there something that jumps out at you
 

2265
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,550
is there something that jumps out at you
as was particularly surprising

the final solutions but
maybe things have even discarded is

maybe things have even discarded is
 

2279
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,310
maybe things have even discarded is
there something that just jumps to mind

2280
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
there something that just jumps to mind
 

2281
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,030
there something that just jumps to mind
it it happens all the time i mean

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,430
evolution is so
creative uh so good at discovering

taking advantage of something that you
 

2293
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,470
taking advantage of something that you
didn't think was there like a bug in the

didn't think was there like a bug in the
 

2295
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,910
didn't think was there like a bug in the

software for instance
 

2297
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,589

a lot of there's a great paper uh the

a lot of there's a great paper uh the
 

2299
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,030
a lot of there's a great paper uh the
community put it together

community put it together
 

2301
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,349
community put it together
about uh surprising anecdotes about

this one team

2368
00:39:26,069 --> 00:39:26,079
this one team
 

2369
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,630
this one team
evolved a neural network to make these

2370
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:28,640
evolved a neural network to make these
 

2371
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,510
evolved a neural network to make these

moves
 

2373
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,550
moves
uh and um they set it up the evolution

2374
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:32,560
uh and um they set it up the evolution
 

2375
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,069
uh and um they set it up the evolution
they didn't really know what would come

2376
00:39:34,069 --> 00:39:34,079
they didn't really know what would come
 

2377
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,190
they didn't really know what would come
out

out
 

2379
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,710
out
but it turned out that they did really

2380
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:36,720
but it turned out that they did really
 

2381
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,910
but it turned out that they did really
well evolution actually won the

2382
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:37,920
well evolution actually won the
 

2383
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,790
well evolution actually won the
tournament

2384
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:38,800
tournament
 

2385
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,870
tournament
and most of the time when it won it went

2386
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:40,880
and most of the time when it won it went
 

2387
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,310
and most of the time when it won it went
because the other teams

2388
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,320
because the other teams
 

2389
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,550
because the other teams
crashed and then when we look at it like

2390
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:44,560
crashed and then when we look at it like
 

2391
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,589
crashed and then when we look at it like
what was going on

2392
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
what was going on
 

2393
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,190
what was going on
was that evolution discovered that if it

2394
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,200
was that evolution discovered that if it
 

2395
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,510
was that evolution discovered that if it
makes a move that's really really far

2396
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:49,520
makes a move that's really really far
 

2397
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:49,990
makes a move that's really really far
away

2398
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:50,000
away
 

2399
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,349
away
like millions of squares away

2400
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:53,359
like millions of squares away
 

2401
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,230
like millions of squares away
the other teams the other programs just

2402
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:56,240
the other teams the other programs just
 

2403
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,750
the other teams the other programs just
expanded memory

2404
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:57,760
expanded memory
 

2405
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,430
expanded memory
in order to take that into account until

2406
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
in order to take that into account until
 

2407
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,190
in order to take that into account until
they ran out of memory and crashed

2408
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,200
they ran out of memory and crashed
 

2409
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,589
they ran out of memory and crashed
and then you win a tournament by

2410
00:40:03,589 --> 00:40:03,599
and then you win a tournament by
 

2411
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,670
and then you win a tournament by
crushing all your opponents

2412
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
crushing all your opponents
 

2413
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,109
crushing all your opponents
i think that's quite a profound example

2414
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:09,119
i think that's quite a profound example
 

2415
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,390
i think that's quite a profound example
which it probably applies to most

2416
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:12,400
which it probably applies to most
 

2417
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,829
which it probably applies to most
games from even a game theoretic

2418
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
games from even a game theoretic
 

2419
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,870
games from even a game theoretic
perspective

2420
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:16,880
perspective
 

2421
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,790
perspective
that sometimes to win you don't have to

2422
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:18,800
that sometimes to win you don't have to
 

2423
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,150
that sometimes to win you don't have to
be

2424
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:20,160
be
 

2425
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,790
be
better within the rules of the game you

2426
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
better within the rules of the game you
 

2427
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,390
better within the rules of the game you
have to come up with ways to

2428
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:24,400
have to come up with ways to
 

2429
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,750
have to come up with ways to
break your opponent's uh

2430
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:27,760
break your opponent's uh
 

2431

some hack where the brain just is not um

2436
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:36,400
some hack where the brain just is not um
 

2437
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,190
some hack where the brain just is not um
you're basically uh how would you put it

2438
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
you're basically uh how would you put it
 

2439
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,390
you're basically uh how would you put it
you're

2440
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,400
you're
 

2441
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,950
you're
the you're going outside the constraints

2442
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
the you're going outside the constraints
 

2443
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,470
the you're going outside the constraints
of where the brain is able to

2444
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
of where the brain is able to
 

2445
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,910
of where the brain is able to
to function expectations of your

2446
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:45,920
to function expectations of your
 

2447
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,150
to function expectations of your
opponent i mean yeah this was even

2448
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
opponent i mean yeah this was even
 

2449
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,150
opponent i mean yeah this was even
kasparov pointed that out that when the

2450
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:50,160
kasparov pointed that out that when the
 

2451
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,829
kasparov pointed that out that when the
blue was playing against kasparov that

2452
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:51,839
blue was playing against kasparov that
 

2453
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:52,950
blue was playing against kasparov that
it was not playing

2454
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:52,960
it was not playing
 

2455
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,910
it was not playing
the same way as kasparov expected uh and

2456
00:40:55,910 --> 00:40:55,920
the same way as kasparov expected uh and
 

2457
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,190
the same way as kasparov expected uh and
this has to do with

2458
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:57,200
this has to do with
 

2459
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,790
this has to do with
you know being not having the same

2460
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:58,800
you know being not having the same
 

2461
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,710
you know being not having the same
biases uh

2462
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:00,720
biases uh
 

2463
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,790
biases uh
and that's that's really one of the

2464
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:02,800
and that's that's really one of the
 

2465
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,710
and that's that's really one of the
strengths of of the

2466
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:04,720
strengths of of the
 

2467
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,270
strengths of of the
ai approach yeah can you at a high level

2468
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:07,280
ai approach yeah can you at a high level
 

2469
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,150
ai approach yeah can you at a high level
say

2470
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:08,160
say
 

2471
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,550
say
what are the basic mechanisms of

2472
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:10,560
what are the basic mechanisms of
 

2473
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,990
what are the basic mechanisms of
evolutionary computation

2474
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
evolutionary computation
 

2475
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,030
evolutionary computation
algorithms that use something that

2476
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:15,040
algorithms that use something that
 

2477
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,510
algorithms that use something that
could be called an evolutionary approach

2478
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
could be called an evolutionary approach
 

2479
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,030
could be called an evolutionary approach
like how does it work

2480
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
like how does it work
 

2481
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,589
like how does it work
uh what are the connections to the it's

2482
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
uh what are the connections to the it's
 

2483
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,349
uh what are the connections to the it's
what are the echoes of the connection to

2484
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:23,359
what are the echoes of the connection to
 

2485
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:24,710
what are the echoes of the connection to
is biological

2486
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:24,720
is biological
 

2487
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,390
is biological
a lot of these algorithms really do take

2488
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:26,400
a lot of these algorithms really do take
 

2489
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,870
a lot of these algorithms really do take
motivation from biology but they are

2490
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:28,880
motivation from biology but they are
 

2491
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,190
motivation from biology but they are
carry catches you try to essentialize it

2492
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:31,200
carry catches you try to essentialize it
 

2493
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,550
carry catches you try to essentialize it
and take the elements that

2494
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:32,560
and take the elements that
 

2495
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,550
and take the elements that
you believe matter so in evolution

2496
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:34,560
you believe matter so in evolution
 

2497
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,829
you believe matter so in evolution
computation

2498
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:35,839
computation
 

2499
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,309
computation
it is the creation of variation and then

2500
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:38,319
it is the creation of variation and then
 

2501
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:39,190
it is the creation of variation and then
the selection

2502
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:39,200
the selection
 

2503
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,750
the selection
upon that so the creation of variation

2504
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:41,760
upon that so the creation of variation
 

2505
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,190
upon that so the creation of variation
you have to have some mechanism that

2506
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
you have to have some mechanism that
 

2507
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,790
you have to have some mechanism that
allow you to create new individuals that

2508
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:44,800
allow you to create new individuals that
 

2509
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,990
allow you to create new individuals that
are very different from

2510
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,000
are very different from
 

2511
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,349
are very different from
what you already have that's the

2512
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:47,359
what you already have that's the
 

2513
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,510
what you already have that's the
creativity part and then you have to

2514
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:49,520
creativity part and then you have to
 

2515
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,190
creativity part and then you have to
have some way of measuring how well they

2516
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,200
have some way of measuring how well they
 

2517
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,750
have some way of measuring how well they
are doing

2518
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:51,760
are doing
 

2519
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,390
are doing
uh and using the uh that measure to

2520
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:54,400
uh and using the uh that measure to
 

2521
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,190
uh and using the uh that measure to
select

2522
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
select
 

2523
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,190
select
uh who goes to the next generation and

2524
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
uh who goes to the next generation and
 

2525
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,790
uh who goes to the next generation and
you continue so first you

2526
00:41:58,790 --> 00:41:58,800
you continue so first you
 

2527
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,710
you continue so first you
also you have to have some kind of

2528
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,720
also you have to have some kind of
 

2529
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,990
also you have to have some kind of
digital representation

2530
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:02,000
digital representation
 

2531
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,750
digital representation
of an individual that can be then

2532
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:03,760
of an individual that can be then
 

2533
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,829
of an individual that can be then
modified so i guess humans

2534
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:05,839
modified so i guess humans
 

2535
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:08,790
modified so i guess humans
i mean biological systems have dna and

2536
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:08,800
i mean biological systems have dna and
 

2537
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,910
i mean biological systems have dna and
all those kinds of things and so you

2538
00:42:09,910 --> 00:42:09,920
all those kinds of things and so you
 

2539
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,309
all those kinds of things and so you
have to have similar kind of encodings

2540
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:12,319
have to have similar kind of encodings
 

2541
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,309
have to have similar kind of encodings
in a computer program yes and that is a

2542
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:14,319
in a computer program yes and that is a
 

2543
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:15,990
in a computer program yes and that is a
big question how do you encode

2544
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
big question how do you encode
 

2545
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,390
big question how do you encode
these individuals so there's a genotype

2546
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
these individuals so there's a genotype
 

2547
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,990
these individuals so there's a genotype
which is that encoding and then

2548
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,000
which is that encoding and then
 

2549
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,910
which is that encoding and then
a decoding mechanism just gives you the

2550
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:21,920
a decoding mechanism just gives you the
 

2551
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,309
a decoding mechanism just gives you the
phenotype which is the actual individual

2552
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:24,319
phenotype which is the actual individual
 

2553
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:24,950
phenotype which is the actual individual
that then

2554
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:24,960
that then
 

2555
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,270
that then
performs the task and in an environment

2556
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:29,280
performs the task and in an environment
 

2557
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,670
performs the task and in an environment
can be evaluated how good it is so even

2558
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
can be evaluated how good it is so even
 

2559
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,349
can be evaluated how good it is so even
that mapping is a big question and how

2560
00:42:33,349 --> 00:42:33,359
that mapping is a big question and how
 

2561
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,790
that mapping is a big question and how
do you do it

2562
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:34,800
do you do it
 

2563
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,950
do you do it
but typically the representations are

2564
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:36,960
but typically the representations are
 

2565
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,550
but typically the representations are
either they are strings of numbers or

2566
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:38,560
either they are strings of numbers or
 

2567
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:40,470
either they are strings of numbers or
they are some kind of trees those are

2568
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:40,480
they are some kind of trees those are
 

2569
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,150
they are some kind of trees those are
something we know very well in computer

2570
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:42,160
something we know very well in computer
 

2571
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,309
something we know very well in computer
science and we try to do that but they

2572
00:42:44,309 --> 00:42:44,319
science and we try to do that but they
 

2573
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,790
science and we try to do that but they
and you know dna in some sense is also a

2574
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:46,800
and you know dna in some sense is also a
 

2575
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:47,510
and you know dna in some sense is also a
sequence

2576
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
sequence
 

2577
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,550
sequence
um and it's a string um

2578
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
um and it's a string um
 

2579
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,870
um and it's a string um
so it's not that far from it but dna

2580
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:52,880
so it's not that far from it but dna
 

2581
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,710
so it's not that far from it but dna
also has many other aspects

2582
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
also has many other aspects
 

2583
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,069
also has many other aspects
that we don't take into account

2584
00:42:56,069 --> 00:42:56,079
that we don't take into account
 

2585
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,109
that we don't take into account
necessarily like this folding and

2586
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,119
necessarily like this folding and
 

2587
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,270
necessarily like this folding and
and interactions that are other than

2588
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:01,280
and interactions that are other than
 

2589
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,510
and interactions that are other than
just the sequence itself

2590
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:03,520
just the sequence itself
 

2591
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,150
just the sequence itself
and lots of that is not yet captured and

2592
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:06,160
and lots of that is not yet captured and
 

2593
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,829
and lots of that is not yet captured and
we don't know whether they are

2594
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:07,839
we don't know whether they are
 

2595
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,950
we don't know whether they are
really crucial um evolution biological

2596
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
really crucial um evolution biological
 

2597
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,470
really crucial um evolution biological
evolution has produced

2598
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
evolution has produced
 

2599
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,910
evolution has produced
wonderful things but if you look at them

2600
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:15,920
wonderful things but if you look at them
 

2601
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,750
wonderful things but if you look at them
it's not necessarily the case that every

2602
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
it's not necessarily the case that every
 

2603
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,670
it's not necessarily the case that every
piece is irreplaceable

2604
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:19,680
piece is irreplaceable
 

2605
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,150
piece is irreplaceable
and essential there's a lot of baggage

2606
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:22,160
and essential there's a lot of baggage
 

2607
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,750
and essential there's a lot of baggage
because you have to construct it and it

2608
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:23,760
because you have to construct it and it
 

2609
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,510
because you have to construct it and it
has to go through various stages and we

2610
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:25,520
has to go through various stages and we
 

2611
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,230
has to go through various stages and we
still have

2612
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:26,240
still have
 

2613
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,710
still have
appendiciti appendix and we have

2614
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
appendiciti appendix and we have
 

2615
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,150
appendiciti appendix and we have
tailbones and things like that that are

2616
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:30,160
tailbones and things like that that are
 

2617
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,270
tailbones and things like that that are
not really that useful

2618
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
not really that useful
 

2619
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,430
not really that useful
if you try to explain them now it would

2620
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
if you try to explain them now it would
 

2621
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,390
if you try to explain them now it would
make no sense

2622
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:34,400
make no sense
 

2623
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,190
make no sense
very hard but if you think of us as

2624
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
very hard but if you think of us as
 

2625
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,630
very hard but if you think of us as
productive evolution you can see where

2626
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:38,640
productive evolution you can see where
 

2627
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:39,990
productive evolution you can see where
they came from they were useful

2628
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,000
they came from they were useful
 

2629
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,829
they came from they were useful
at one point perhaps and and no longer

2630
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:41,839
at one point perhaps and and no longer
 

2631
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:43,349
at one point perhaps and and no longer
are but they're still there

2632
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:43,359
are but they're still there
 

2633
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,710
are but they're still there
so um that process is complex

2634
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:46,720
so um that process is complex
 

2635
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,190
so um that process is complex
uh and your representation should

2636
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:49,200
uh and your representation should
 

2637
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,390
uh and your representation should
support it

2638
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:50,400
support it
 

2639
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,390
support it
uh and that is quite difficult

2640
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,400
uh and that is quite difficult
 

2641
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,270
uh and that is quite difficult
if if we are limited with strings or

2642
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:57,280
if if we are limited with strings or
 

2643
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,870
if if we are limited with strings or
trees

2644
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:58,880
trees
 

2645
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,910
trees
and then we are pretty much limited what

2646
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:01,920
and then we are pretty much limited what
 

2647
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,589
and then we are pretty much limited what
can be constructed

2648
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
can be constructed
 

2649
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,510
can be constructed
and one thing that we are still missing

2650
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
and one thing that we are still missing
 

2651
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,510
and one thing that we are still missing
in evolution computation in particular

2652
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:07,520
in evolution computation in particular
 

2653
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:08,309
in evolution computation in particular
is

2654
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:08,319
is
 

2655
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,349
is
what we saw in biology major transitions

2656
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
what we saw in biology major transitions
 

2657
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:14,150
what we saw in biology major transitions
so that you go from for instance single

2658
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:14,160
so that you go from for instance single
 

2659
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,829
so that you go from for instance single
cell to multi-cell organisms

2660
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
cell to multi-cell organisms
 

2661
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,270
cell to multi-cell organisms
and eventually societies there are

2662
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
and eventually societies there are
 

2663
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,870
and eventually societies there are
transitions of level of

2664
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:18,880
transitions of level of
 

2665
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,990
transitions of level of
selection and level of what a unit is

2666
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:22,000
selection and level of what a unit is
 

2667
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,069
selection and level of what a unit is
and that's something we haven't captured

2668
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
and that's something we haven't captured
 

2669
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,910
and that's something we haven't captured
in evolution computation yet

2670
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:25,920
in evolution computation yet
 

2671
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,550
in evolution computation yet
does that require a dramatic expansion

2672
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
does that require a dramatic expansion
 

2673
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:29,910
does that require a dramatic expansion
of the representation

2674
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:29,920
of the representation
 

2675
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,950
of the representation
is that what that that is most likely it

2676
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:32,960
is that what that that is most likely it
 

2677
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:33,910
is that what that that is most likely it
does but it's

2678
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:33,920
does but it's
 

2679
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,430
does but it's
quite we don't even understand it in

2680
00:44:35,430 --> 00:44:35,440
quite we don't even understand it in
 

2681
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,589
quite we don't even understand it in
biology very well where it's coming from

2682
00:44:37,589 --> 00:44:37,599
biology very well where it's coming from
 

2683
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,589
biology very well where it's coming from
so it would be really good to look at

2684
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
so it would be really good to look at
 

2685
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,190
so it would be really good to look at
major transitions in biology try to

2686
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:41,200
major transitions in biology try to
 

2687
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,349
major transitions in biology try to
characterize them a little bit more in

2688
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:43,359
characterize them a little bit more in
 

2689
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:45,349
characterize them a little bit more in
detail what the processes are

2690
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:45,359
detail what the processes are
 

2691
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,550
detail what the processes are
how how does a so like a unit a cell

2692
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:48,560
how how does a so like a unit a cell
 

2693
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,870
how how does a so like a unit a cell
is no longer evaluated alone it's

2694
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
is no longer evaluated alone it's
 

2695
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,430
is no longer evaluated alone it's
evaluated as part of a community

2696
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
evaluated as part of a community
 

2697
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,430
evaluated as part of a community
organism right even though it could

2698
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
organism right even though it could
 

2699
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,710
organism right even though it could
reproduce now it can't

2700
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:56,720
reproduce now it can't
 

2701
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,470
reproduce now it can't
alone and it has has to have its

2702
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:58,480
alone and it has has to have its
 

2703
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,990
alone and it has has to have its
environment so there's a

2704
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,000
environment so there's a
 

2705
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,470
environment so there's a
there's a push to another level at least

2706
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
there's a push to another level at least
 

2707
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,270
there's a push to another level at least
the selection

2708
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:03,280
the selection
 

2709
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,710
the selection
and how do you make that jump to this

2710
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
and how do you make that jump to this
 

2711
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,309
and how do you make that jump to this
yes how do you make the jump that's part

2712
00:45:06,309 --> 00:45:06,319
yes how do you make the jump that's part
 

2713
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:07,190
yes how do you make the jump that's part
of the algorithm

2714
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:07,200
of the algorithm
 

2715
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,349
of the algorithm
yeah yeah so we haven't really seen that

2716
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:09,359
yeah yeah so we haven't really seen that
 

2717
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:11,109
yeah yeah so we haven't really seen that
in computation

2718
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,119
in computation
 

2719
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:13,829
in computation
um yet and there are certainly attempts

2720
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:13,839
um yet and there are certainly attempts
 

2721
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:14,470
um yet and there are certainly attempts
to have

2722
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:14,480
to have
 

2723
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:17,109
to have
open-ended evolution things that could

2724
00:45:17,109 --> 00:45:17,119
open-ended evolution things that could
 

2725
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,349
open-ended evolution things that could
add more complexity and start

2726
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:19,359
add more complexity and start
 

2727
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,829
add more complexity and start
selecting at a higher level but it is

2728
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:21,839
selecting at a higher level but it is
 

2729
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,030
selecting at a higher level but it is
still not

2730
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:23,040
still not
 

2731
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,589
still not
um quite the same as going from single

2732
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:25,599
um quite the same as going from single
 

2733
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:26,470
um quite the same as going from single
to multi to

2734
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:26,480
to multi to
 

2735
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,750
to multi to
society for instance in in biology so so

2736
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:29,760
society for instance in in biology so so
 

2737
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,230
society for instance in in biology so so
there essentially would be as opposed to

2738
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
there essentially would be as opposed to
 

2739
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,349
there essentially would be as opposed to
having one agent

2740
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:33,359
having one agent
 

2741
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:34,870
having one agent
those agent all of a sudden

2742
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:34,880
those agent all of a sudden
 

2743
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,470
those agent all of a sudden
spontaneously decide to

2744
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:36,480
spontaneously decide to
 

2745
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,750
spontaneously decide to
then be together and then your entire

2746
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:39,760
then be together and then your entire
 

2747
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:40,950
then be together and then your entire
system

2748
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:40,960
system
 

2749
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,510
system
would then be treating them as one agent

2750
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:43,520
would then be treating them as one agent
 

2751
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:44,630
would then be treating them as one agent
something like that

2752
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:44,640
something like that
 

2753
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,550
something like that
some kind of weird merger building but

2754
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:46,560
some kind of weird merger building but
 

2755
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,230
some kind of weird merger building but
also so you mentioned i think you

2756
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:48,240
also so you mentioned i think you
 

2757
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,750
also so you mentioned i think you
mentioned selection so basically there's

2758
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:49,760
mentioned selection so basically there's
 

2759
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:49,990
mentioned selection so basically there's
an

2760
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,000
an
 

2761
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,190
an
agent and they don't get to live on

2762
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:53,200
agent and they don't get to live on
 

2763
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,630
agent and they don't get to live on
if they don't do well so there's some

2764
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:54,640
if they don't do well so there's some
 

2765
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,230
if they don't do well so there's some
kind of measure of what doing well is

2766
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:56,240
kind of measure of what doing well is
 

2767
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,270
kind of measure of what doing well is
and isn't

2768
00:45:57,270 --> 00:45:57,280
and isn't
 

2769
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,870
and isn't
and uh does the mutation come into play

2770
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:00,880
and uh does the mutation come into play
 

2771
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,069
and uh does the mutation come into play
at all

2772
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
at all
 

2773
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:03,510
at all
in the process and what the world does

2774
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,520
in the process and what the world does
 

2775
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,190
in the process and what the world does
it serve yeah so

2776
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:05,200
it serve yeah so
 

2777
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:06,950
it serve yeah so
in again back to what the computational

2778
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960
in again back to what the computational
 

2779
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,630
in again back to what the computational
mechanisms of evolution computation are

2780
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:08,640
mechanisms of evolution computation are
 

2781
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,430
mechanisms of evolution computation are
so

2782
00:46:09,430 --> 00:46:09,440
so
 

2783
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:12,710
so
um the way to create variation uh you

2784
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:12,720
um the way to create variation uh you
 

2785
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,550
um the way to create variation uh you
can take multiple individuals too

2786
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
can take multiple individuals too
 

2787
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:15,430
can take multiple individuals too
usually but

2788
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:15,440
usually but
 

2789
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:19,349
usually but
but you could do more and you exchanged

2790
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:19,359

00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:22,470
the part of the representation you do
some kind of recombination

2794
00:46:22,470 --> 00:46:22,480
some kind of recombination
 

2795
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,750
some kind of recombination
it could be crossover for instance um

2796
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
it could be crossover for instance um
 

2797
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,790
it could be crossover for instance um
in biology you do have dna strings that

2798
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
in biology you do have dna strings that
 

2799
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,670
in biology you do have dna strings that
that are

cut and put together again we could do

2802
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:32,400
cut and put together again we could do
 

2803
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,430
cut and put together again we could do
something like that

2804
00:46:33,430 --> 00:46:33,440
something like that
 

2805
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,470
something like that
um and it seems to be that in biology

2806
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
um and it seems to be that in biology
 

2807
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,150
um and it seems to be that in biology
crossover is really the workhorse in in

00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:40,160
crossover is really the workhorse in in
 

2809
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:43,510

we tend to rely more on mutation

2812
00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:47,119
we tend to rely more on mutation
 

2813
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,230
we tend to rely more on mutation
and that is making random changes into

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:50,240
and that is making random changes into
 

2815
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,390
and that is making random changes into
parts of the chromosome you try to be

00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:52,400
parts of the chromosome you try to be
 

2817
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,109

00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,230
machine learning based on statistics we
use similar tools

use similar tools
 

2853
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,309
use similar tools
to guide evolutionary computation and in

to guide evolutionary computation and in
 

2855
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,309
to guide evolutionary computation and in
that sense it has diverged

00:47:28,309 --> 00:47:28,319
that sense it has diverged
 

2857
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:30,630
that sense it has diverged
a bit from biological evolution and

a bit from biological evolution and
 

2859
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,230
a bit from biological evolution and
that's one of the things i think

2860
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:32,240
that's one of the things i think
 

2861
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:35,510
that's one of the things i think
we could look at again

2862
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:35,520
we could look at again
 

2863
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,470
we could look at again
having a weaker selection more crossover

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,829
more time and maybe a different kind of
creativity would come out of it

2870
00:47:43,829 --> 00:47:43,839
creativity would come out of it

now right quickly

2876
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:49,520
now right quickly
 

2877
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:51,510
now right quickly
and every if no somebody doesn't perform

2878
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
and every if no somebody doesn't perform
 

2879
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,710
and every if no somebody doesn't perform
kill it yeah

2880
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:52,720
kill it yeah
 

2881
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,270
kill it yeah
uh and biological evolution doesn't work

2882
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
uh and biological evolution doesn't work
 

2883
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,069
uh and biological evolution doesn't work
quite that way

2884
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,079
quite that way
 

2885
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,390
quite that way
uh and and it's more patient yes much

2886
00:47:58,390 --> 00:47:58,400
uh and and it's more patient yes much
 

2887
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,910
uh and and it's more patient yes much
more patient

2888
00:47:59,910 --> 00:47:59,920
more patient
 

2889
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,030
more patient
so i guess we need to add some kind of

2890
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
so i guess we need to add some kind of
 

2891
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,950
so i guess we need to add some kind of
mating some kind of like dating

2892
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
mating some kind of like dating
 

2893

yeah and many ways of being successful

2904
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:18,240
yeah and many ways of being successful
 

2905
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:18,950
yeah and many ways of being successful
you know

2906
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:18,960
you know
 

2907
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,549
you know
usually in every competition we have one

2908
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:20,559
usually in every competition we have one
 

2909
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,790
usually in every competition we have one
goal you know play

2910

00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
this game really well uh and compared to
 

2913
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,309
this game really well uh and compared to
others but

2914

others but
 

2915
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,069
others but
in biology there are many ways of being

2916
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:28,079
in biology there are many ways of being
 

2917
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:30,710
in biology there are many ways of being
successful you can build niches you can

2918
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:30,720
successful you can build niches you can
 

2919
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,990
successful you can build niches you can
be stronger faster larger or smarter

2920
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:34,000
be stronger faster larger or smarter
 

2921
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,549
be stronger faster larger or smarter
or you know eat this or eat that or you

2922
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
or you know eat this or eat that or you
 

2923
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:37,349
or you know eat this or eat that or you
know so

2924
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:37,359
know so
 

2925
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,349
know so
so there are many ways to solve the same

2926
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:39,359
so there are many ways to solve the same
 

2927
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,549
so there are many ways to solve the same
problem of survival

2928
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:40,559
problem of survival
 

2929
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,750
problem of survival
and that then breeds creativity um

2930
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:43,760
and that then breeds creativity um
 

2931
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,790
and that then breeds creativity um
and um it allows more exploration and

2932
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:46,800
and um it allows more exploration and
 

2933
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,069
and um it allows more exploration and
eventually you get

2934
00:48:48,069 --> 00:48:48,079
eventually you get
 

2935
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,030
eventually you get
solutions that are perhaps more creative

2936
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:51,040
solutions that are perhaps more creative
 

2937
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,630
solutions that are perhaps more creative
rather than trying to go from

2938
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:52,640
rather than trying to go from
 

2939
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,870
rather than trying to go from
initial population directly or more or

2940
00:48:54,870 --> 00:48:54,880
initial population directly or more or
 

2941
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,309
initial population directly or more or
less directly to your

2942
00:48:56,309 --> 00:48:56,319
less directly to your
 

2943
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,190
less directly to your
maximum fitness which you measure that's

2944
00:48:59,190 --> 00:48:59,200
maximum fitness which you measure that's
 

2945
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:00,790
maximum fitness which you measure that's
just one metric

2946
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:00,800
just one metric
 

2947
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,910
just one metric
so in a broad sense

2948
00:49:03,910 --> 00:49:03,920
so in a broad sense
 

2949
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,230
so in a broad sense
before we talk about newer evolution

2950
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:08,240

 

2951
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:11,349

do you see evolutionary computation as

2952
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:11,359
do you see evolutionary computation as
 

2953
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,790
do you see evolutionary computation as
more effective than deep learning in

2954
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:12,800
more effective than deep learning in
 

2955
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:14,069

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,750
the deep learning has been really
successful in domains where we have a

lot of data
 

2987
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,750

00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:41,760
and that means not just data about
 

2989
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,589
and that means not just data about

and get stronger and then that's how you
 

3051
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:42,150

that
at a different time scale because you

3058
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
at a different time scale because you
 

3059
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,670
at a different time scale because you
have a population not an individual

3060
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
have a population not an individual
 

3061

3071
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:00,549

00:51:00,549 --> 00:51:00,559
they will you know everybody dies and
 

3073
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,390
they will you know everybody dies and
you have a next generation and it will

you have a next generation and it will
be better than the previous one

00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:04,079
be better than the previous one
 

3077
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,630
be better than the previous one
so that's that's the big difference

3078
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:06,640
so that's that's the big difference
 

3079
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:08,069
so that's that's the big difference

00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,390
to different kinds of problems um and
um in particular there's often a

a bit you can use evolution as an online
method and reinforcement learning to

3122
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
method and reinforcement learning to
 

3123
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,230
method and reinforcement learning to
create engineering solutions but that's

3124
00:51:52,230 --> 00:51:52,240
create engineering solutions but that's
 

3125
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:53,030
create engineering solutions but that's
still

3126
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
still
 

3127
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,030
still
roughly the distinction and

3128
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:57,040
roughly the distinction and
 

3129
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,030
roughly the distinction and
from the point of view what algorithm

3130
00:51:59,030 --> 00:51:59,040
from the point of view what algorithm
 

3131
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,230
from the point of view what algorithm
you want to use

3132
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:00,240
you want to use
 

3133
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,750
you want to use
if you have something where there is a

3134
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:01,760
if you have something where there is a
 

3135
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,829
if you have something where there is a
cost for every trial reinforcement

3136
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:03,839
cost for every trial reinforcement
 

3137
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,990
cost for every trial reinforcement
learning might be your choice

3138
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:06,000
learning might be your choice
 

3139
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,150
learning might be your choice
now if you have a domain where you can

3140
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
now if you have a domain where you can
 

3141
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,150
now if you have a domain where you can
use a surrogate perhaps

3142
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
use a surrogate perhaps
 

3143
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,470
use a surrogate perhaps
so you don't have much of a cost for

3144
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
so you don't have much of a cost for
 

3145
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,510
so you don't have much of a cost for
trial

3146
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
trial
 

3147
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,710
trial
and you want to have surprises you want

3148
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:16,720
and you want to have surprises you want
 

3149
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,549
and you want to have surprises you want
to explore more broadly

3150
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:18,559
to explore more broadly
 

3151
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,150
to explore more broadly
then this population-based method is

3152
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
then this population-based method is
 

3153
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,150
then this population-based method is
perhaps a better choice because you you

3154
00:52:24,150 --> 00:52:24,160
perhaps a better choice because you you
 

3155
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:26,309
perhaps a better choice because you you
can try things out that you wouldn't

3156
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
can try things out that you wouldn't
 

3157
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,549
can try things out that you wouldn't
afford when you're doing reinforcement

3158
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:28,559
afford when you're doing reinforcement
 

3159
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,589
afford when you're doing reinforcement
there's very few things as entertaining

3160
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:31,599
there's very few things as entertaining
 

3161
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:33,750
there's very few things as entertaining
as watching either evolution competition

3162
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
as watching either evolution competition
 

3163
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,589
as watching either evolution competition
or reinforcement learning teaching a

i maybe there's a

3168
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:41,440
i maybe there's a
 

3169
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,710
i maybe there's a
higher level question that could be

3170
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
higher level question that could be
 

3171
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,710
higher level question that could be
asked here but

3172
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:44,720
asked here but
 

3173
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,870
asked here but
do you find this whole space in of

3174
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:46,880
do you find this whole space in of
 

3175
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:49,190
do you find this whole space in of
applications in the robotics

3176
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:49,200
applications in the robotics
 

3177
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:51,750
applications in the robotics
interesting for evolution computation

3178
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:51,760
interesting for evolution computation
 

3179
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,950
interesting for evolution computation
yeah yeah very much

3180
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
yeah yeah very much
 

3181
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,349
yeah yeah very much
um and indeed that's the fascinating

3182
00:52:55,349 --> 00:52:55,359
um and indeed that's the fascinating
 

3183
00:52:55,359 --> 00:52:56,390
um and indeed that's the fascinating
videos of that

3184
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
videos of that
 

3185
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,309
videos of that
and that's actually one of the examples

3186
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
and that's actually one of the examples
 

3187
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,549
and that's actually one of the examples
where you can contrast the difference

3188
00:53:00,549 --> 00:53:00,559
where you can contrast the difference
 

3189
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,630
where you can contrast the difference
so between reinforcement learning

3190
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:02,640
so between reinforcement learning
 

3191
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,069
so between reinforcement learning
evolution yes so

3192
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
evolution yes so
 

3193
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,510
evolution yes so
if you have a reinforcement learning

3194
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520
if you have a reinforcement learning
 

3195
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,109
if you have a reinforcement learning
agent it tries to be

3196
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:07,119
agent it tries to be
 

3197
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,589
agent it tries to be
conservative because it wants to walk as

3198
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:09,599
conservative because it wants to walk as
 

3199
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,750
conservative because it wants to walk as
long as possible and be stable

3200
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:11,760
long as possible and be stable
 

3201
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,670
long as possible and be stable
but if you have evolutionary computation

3202
00:53:13,670 --> 00:53:13,680
but if you have evolutionary computation
 

3203
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,950
but if you have evolutionary computation
it can afford

3204
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:14,960
it can afford
 

3205
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,990
it can afford
these agents that go haywire they

3206
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:18,000
these agents that go haywire they
 

3207
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,230
these agents that go haywire they
fall flat on their face and they could

3208
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
fall flat on their face and they could
 

3209
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:21,910
fall flat on their face and they could
take a step and then they jump and then

3210
00:53:21,910 --> 00:53:21,920
take a step and then they jump and then
 

3211
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,230
take a step and then they jump and then
again fall flat yeah and eventually what

3212
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
again fall flat yeah and eventually what
 

3213
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,270
again fall flat yeah and eventually what
comes out of that

3214
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:25,280
comes out of that
 

3215
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,430
comes out of that
is something like a falling that's

3216
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:27,440
is something like a falling that's
 

3217
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,950
is something like a falling that's
controlled yeah

3218
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
controlled yeah
 

3219
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,470
controlled yeah
and you take another step another step

3220
00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:30,480
and you take another step another step
 

3221
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,309
and you take another step another step
and you no longer fall

3222
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:32,319
and you no longer fall
 

3223
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,710
and you no longer fall
instead you run you go fast so that's a

3224
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:34,720
instead you run you go fast so that's a
 

3225
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,150
instead you run you go fast so that's a
way of discovering

3226
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:36,160
way of discovering
 

3227
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,829
way of discovering
something that's hard to discover step

3228
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:37,839
something that's hard to discover step
 

3229
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,510
something that's hard to discover step
by step incrementally

3230
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:39,520
by step incrementally
 

3231
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,990
by step incrementally
because you can afford these

3232
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:42,000
because you can afford these
 

3233
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:42,870
because you can afford these
evolutionists

3234
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:42,880

3235
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,109

3237
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,309

dead ends in the sense that they can
 

3239
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:47,670
dead ends in the sense that they can
serve as stepping stones

3240
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:47,680
serve as stepping stones
 

3241
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,270
serve as stepping stones
when you take two of those put them

3242
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:49,280
when you take two of those put them
 

3243
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,790
when you take two of those put them
together you get something that works

3244
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:50,800
together you get something that works
 

3245
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,390
together you get something that works
even better

3246
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:52,400
even better

and that is a great example of of this
 

3249
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,790

who who just roboticists who love
 

3261
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,270
who who just roboticists who love
the elegance and beauty of uh movement

00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:09,280
the elegance and beauty of uh movement
 

3263
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:13,109
the elegance and beauty of uh movement
right and uh walking bipedal

right and uh walking bipedal
 

3265
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,470
right and uh walking bipedal
robotics is um

3266
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:16,480
robotics is um
 

3267
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,790
robotics is um
beautiful but also exceptionally

3268
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:18,800
beautiful but also exceptionally
 

3269
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,790
beautiful but also exceptionally
dangerous in the sense that like

you're constantly falling essentially if

3272
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:22,800
you're constantly falling essentially if
 

3273
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,349
you're constantly falling essentially if
you want to do elegant movement

3274
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:25,359
you want to do elegant movement
 

3275
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:31,030
you want to do elegant movement
and uh the discovery of that is uh

3276
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:31,040

 

3277
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,430

i mean it it's such a good example of um

3278
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:35,440
i mean it it's such a good example of um
 

3279
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,349
i mean it it's such a good example of um
that the discovery of a good solution

3280
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:37,359
that the discovery of a good solution
 

3281
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:39,190
that the discovery of a good solution
sometimes requires a leap of faith and

3282
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:39,200
sometimes requires a leap of faith and
 

3283
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,349
sometimes requires a leap of faith and
patience and all those kinds of things

3284
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:41,359
patience and all those kinds of things
 

3285
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:43,349
patience and all those kinds of things
i wonder what other spaces where you

3286
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:43,359
i wonder what other spaces where you
 

3287
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:44,870
i wonder what other spaces where you
have to discover those kinds of things

3288
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:44,880
have to discover those kinds of things
 

3289
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:46,230
have to discover those kinds of things
in

3290
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,240
in
 

3291
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,309
in
yeah yeah yeah and another interesting

3292
00:54:48,309 --> 00:54:48,319
yeah yeah yeah and another interesting
 

3293
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,630
yeah yeah yeah and another interesting
direction is um

3294
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:50,640
direction is um
 

3295
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,470
direction is um
learning um for for uh virtual creatures

3296
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:54,480
learning um for for uh virtual creatures
 

3297
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,829
learning um for for uh virtual creatures
learning to walk

3298
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:55,839
learning to walk
 

3299
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:59,349
learning to walk
uh we did a study in in simulation

3300
00:54:59,349 --> 00:54:59,359
uh we did a study in in simulation
 

3301
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,470
uh we did a study in in simulation
obviously that

3302
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480
obviously that
 

3303
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,430
obviously that
um you create those creatures not just

3304
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:03,440
um you create those creatures not just
 

3305
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,349
um you create those creatures not just
their controller but also their body so

3306
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:05,359
their controller but also their body so
 

3307
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:06,230
their controller but also their body so
you have

3308
00:55:06,230 --> 00:55:06,240
you have
 

3309
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:08,230
you have
cylinders you have muscles you have

3310
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
cylinders you have muscles you have
 

3311
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:09,510
cylinders you have muscles you have
joints

3312
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:09,520
joints
 

3313
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:12,549
joints
and sensors and you're creating

3314
00:55:12,549 --> 00:55:12,559
and sensors and you're creating
 

3315
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,069
and sensors and you're creating
creatures that look quite different some

3316
00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:14,079
creatures that look quite different some
 

3317
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,750
creatures that look quite different some
of them have multiple legs some of them

3318
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
of them have multiple legs some of them
 

3319
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,589
of them have multiple legs some of them
have no legs at all

3320
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:17,599
have no legs at all
 

3321
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,510
have no legs at all
and then the goal was to get them to

3322
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:19,520
and then the goal was to get them to
 

3323
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,510
and then the goal was to get them to
move the walk to run

3324
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,520
move the walk to run
 

3325
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,150
move the walk to run
uh and what was interesting is is that

3326
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:24,160
uh and what was interesting is is that
 

3327
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,349
uh and what was interesting is is that
when you evolve

3328
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:25,359
when you evolve
 

3329
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:28,309
when you evolve
the controller together with the body

3330
00:55:28,309 --> 00:55:28,319
the controller together with the body
 

3331
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:29,829
the controller together with the body
you get movements that look

3332
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
you get movements that look
 

3333
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:31,670
you get movements that look
natural because they're optimized for

3334
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:31,680
natural because they're optimized for
 

3335
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,510
natural because they're optimized for
that physical setup

3336
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
that physical setup
 

3337
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,270
that physical setup
and and these creatures you start

3338
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
and and these creatures you start
 

3339
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,789
and and these creatures you start
believing them that they're alive

3340
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:36,799
believing them that they're alive
 

3341
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,309
believing them that they're alive
because they walk in a way that you

3342
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:38,319
because they walk in a way that you
 

3343
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,430
because they walk in a way that you
would expect somebody

3344
00:55:39,430 --> 00:55:39,440
would expect somebody
 

3345
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:41,990
would expect somebody
with that kind of a setup to walk yeah

3346
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:42,000
with that kind of a setup to walk yeah
 

3347
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,190
with that kind of a setup to walk yeah
there's a

3348
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:43,200
there's a
 

3349
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,870
there's a
there's something subjective also about

3350
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:44,880
there's something subjective also about
 

3351
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,630
there's something subjective also about
that right i've been thinking a lot

3352
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:46,640
that right i've been thinking a lot
 

3353
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:48,950
that right i've been thinking a lot
about that especially in

3354
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:48,960
about that especially in
 

3355
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:53,030
about that especially in
the human robot interaction context

3356
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:53,040
the human robot interaction context
 

3357
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,069
the human robot interaction context
you know i mentioned spot the boston

3358
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:56,079
you know i mentioned spot the boston
 

3359
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:58,309
you know i mentioned spot the boston
dynamics robot

3360
00:55:58,309 --> 00:55:58,319
dynamics robot
 

3361
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,150
dynamics robot
there is something about human robot

3362
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:00,160
there is something about human robot
 

3363
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,349
there is something about human robot
communication

3364
00:56:01,349 --> 00:56:01,359
communication
 

3365
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,349
communication
let's say let's put in another context

3366
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:03,359
let's say let's put in another context
 

3367
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,470
let's say let's put in another context
something about

3368
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:04,480
something about
 

3369
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,910
something about
human and uh dog context

3370
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:07,920
human and uh dog context
 

3371
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,349
human and uh dog context
like like a living dog where there's uh

3372
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:11,359
like like a living dog where there's uh
 

3373
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:12,710
like like a living dog where there's uh
there's a there's a dance of

3374
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:12,720
there's a there's a dance of
 

3375
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,230
there's a there's a dance of
communication first of all the eyes you

3376
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:14,240
communication first of all the eyes you
 

3377
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,990
communication first of all the eyes you
both look at the same thing and you

3378
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:16,000
both look at the same thing and you
 

3379
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,910
both look at the same thing and you
dogs communicate with their eyes as well

3380
00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:17,920
dogs communicate with their eyes as well
 

3381
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,430
dogs communicate with their eyes as well
like if if the

3382
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:19,440
like if if the
 

3383
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,870
like if if the
if you and a dog want to uh

3384
00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:22,880
if you and a dog want to uh
 

3385
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,630
if you and a dog want to uh
like deal with a particular object you

3386
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:24,640
like deal with a particular object you
 

3387
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:26,069
like deal with a particular object you
will look at the person

3388
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:26,079
will look at the person
 

3389
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:27,430
will look at the person
the dog will look at you and then look

3390
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:27,440
the dog will look at you and then look
 

3391
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,950
the dog will look at you and then look
at the object and look back at you all

3392
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:28,960
at the object and look back at you all
 

3393
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,150
at the object and look back at you all
those kinds of things

3394
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:30,160
those kinds of things
 

3395
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,710
those kinds of things
but there's also just a elegance of

3396
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:32,720
but there's also just a elegance of
 

3397
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:33,190
but there's also just a elegance of
movement

3398
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:33,200
movement
 

3399
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,670
movement
i mean there's the of course the tail

3400
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:35,680
i mean there's the of course the tail
 

3401
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,190
i mean there's the of course the tail
and all those kinds of mechanisms of

3402
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:37,200
and all those kinds of mechanisms of
 

3403
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,670
and all those kinds of mechanisms of
communication it all seems natural

3404
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:39,680
communication it all seems natural
 

3405
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,270
communication it all seems natural
and often joyful and for robots to

3406
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:43,280
and often joyful and for robots to
 

3407
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,109
and often joyful and for robots to
communicate that

3408
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:45,119
communicate that
 

3409
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,710
communicate that
is it's really difficult how to figure

3410
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
is it's really difficult how to figure
 

3411
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,549
is it's really difficult how to figure
that out because it's it's almost

3412
00:56:48,549 --> 00:56:48,559
that out because it's it's almost
 

3413
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,030
that out because it's it's almost
seems impossible to hard code in you can

3414
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:51,040
seems impossible to hard code in you can
 

3415
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,430
seems impossible to hard code in you can
hard code it for a demo purpose with so

3416
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:53,440
hard code it for a demo purpose with so
 

3417
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,349
hard code it for a demo purpose with so
you know something like that but it's

3418
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:55,359
you know something like that but it's
 

3419
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:57,990
you know something like that but it's
essentially choreographed

3420
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:58,000
essentially choreographed
 

3421
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,349
essentially choreographed
like if you watch some of the boston

3422
00:56:59,349 --> 00:56:59,359
like if you watch some of the boston
 

3423
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:01,750
like if you watch some of the boston
dynamics videos where they're dancing

3424
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:01,760
dynamics videos where they're dancing
 

3425
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,230
dynamics videos where they're dancing
all of that is choreographed by human

3426
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:04,240
all of that is choreographed by human
 

3427
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,589
all of that is choreographed by human
beings

3428
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
beings
 

3429
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,430
beings
but to learn how to with your movement

3430
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:09,440
but to learn how to with your movement
 

3431
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,950
but to learn how to with your movement
demonstrate a naturalness and elegance

3432
00:57:12,950 --> 00:57:12,960
demonstrate a naturalness and elegance
 

3433
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,950
demonstrate a naturalness and elegance
that's fascinating of course in the

3434
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:14,960
that's fascinating of course in the
 

3435
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:16,470
that's fascinating of course in the
physical space that's very difficult to

3436
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:16,480
physical space that's very difficult to
 

3437
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:16,789
physical space that's very difficult to
do

3438
00:57:16,789 --> 00:57:16,799
do
 

3439
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,030
do
to learn the kind of at scale that

3440
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
to learn the kind of at scale that
 

3441
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,789
to learn the kind of at scale that
you're referring to but

3442
00:57:20,789 --> 00:57:20,799
you're referring to but
 

3443
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,390
you're referring to but
the hope is that you could do that in

3444
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400
the hope is that you could do that in
 

3445
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,150
the hope is that you could do that in
stimulation and then transfer into the

3446
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:24,160
stimulation and then transfer into the
 

3447
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:25,349
stimulation and then transfer into the
physical space

3448
00:57:25,349 --> 00:57:25,359
physical space
 

3449
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,870
physical space
if you're able to model the robots

3450
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:26,880
if you're able to model the robots
 

3451
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,630
if you're able to model the robots
efficiently naturally

3452
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,640
efficiently naturally
 

3453
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,870
efficiently naturally
yeah and and sometimes i think that that

3454
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
yeah and and sometimes i think that that
 

3455
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,630
yeah and and sometimes i think that that
requires a theory of mind

3456
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
requires a theory of mind
 

3457
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,470
requires a theory of mind
on the yes on the on the side of the

3458
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:34,480
on the yes on the on the side of the
 

3459
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:36,150
on the yes on the on the side of the
robot that

3460
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:36,160
robot that
 

3461
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:38,390
robot that
that they as they understand what you're

3462
00:57:38,390 --> 00:57:38,400
that they as they understand what you're
 

3463
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,510
that they as they understand what you're
doing because they

3464
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:39,520
doing because they
 

3465
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,430
doing because they
themselves are doing something similar

3466
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:41,440
themselves are doing something similar
 

3467
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,910
themselves are doing something similar
and uh that's a big question too

3468
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
and uh that's a big question too
 

3469
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,870
and uh that's a big question too
uh we talked about how intelligence in

3470
00:57:46,870 --> 00:57:46,880
uh we talked about how intelligence in
 

3471
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,349
uh we talked about how intelligence in
general

3472
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:47,359
general
 

3473
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:49,349
general
and and the social aspect of of

3474
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:49,359
and and the social aspect of of
 

3475
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:50,390
and and the social aspect of of
intelligence and

3476
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
intelligence and
 

3477
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,230
intelligence and
i think that's what is required that we

3478
00:57:52,230 --> 00:57:52,240
i think that's what is required that we
 

3479
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:53,990
i think that's what is required that we
humans understand other humans because

3480
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:54,000
humans understand other humans because
 

3481
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,430
humans understand other humans because
we assume that they are similar

3482
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:55,440
we assume that they are similar
 

3483
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,470
we assume that they are similar
to us um we have one simulation we did a

3484
00:57:58,470 --> 00:57:58,480
to us um we have one simulation we did a
 

3485
00:57:58,480 --> 00:57:59,829
to us um we have one simulation we did a
while ago ken stanley

3486
00:57:59,829 --> 00:57:59,839
while ago ken stanley
 

3487
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,950
while ago ken stanley
um did that um two robots that were

3488
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:02,960
um did that um two robots that were
 

3489
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,470
um did that um two robots that were
uh competing um simulation like you said

3490
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:06,480
uh competing um simulation like you said
 

3491
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:08,470
uh competing um simulation like you said
they were foraging for food to gain

3492
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
they were foraging for food to gain
 

3493
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,230
they were foraging for food to gain
energy and then when they were really

3494
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:10,240
energy and then when they were really
 

3495
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,030
energy and then when they were really
strong they would

3496
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:11,040
strong they would
 

3497
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,190
strong they would
bounce into the other robot and win if

3498
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
bounce into the other robot and win if
 

3499
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,789
bounce into the other robot and win if
they were stronger

3500
00:58:14,789 --> 00:58:14,799
they were stronger
 

3501
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:17,430
they were stronger
and we watched evolution discover more

3502
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:17,440
and we watched evolution discover more
 

3503
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,430
and we watched evolution discover more
and more complex behaviors they

3504
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:19,440
and more complex behaviors they
 

3505
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:21,190
and more complex behaviors they
first went to the nearest food and then

3506
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:21,200
first went to the nearest food and then
 

3507
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,190
first went to the nearest food and then
they started to

3508
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:23,200
they started to
 

3509
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,270
they started to
plot a trajectory so they get more get

3510
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:25,280
plot a trajectory so they get more get
 

3511
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,430
plot a trajectory so they get more get
more but then they started to take

3512
00:58:27,430 --> 00:58:27,440
more but then they started to take
 

3513
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,589
more but then they started to take
pay attention what the other robot was

3514
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:29,599
pay attention what the other robot was
 

3515
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:31,510
pay attention what the other robot was
doing and in the end there was a

3516
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:31,520
doing and in the end there was a
 

3517
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,630
doing and in the end there was a
behavior

3518
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
behavior
 

3519
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,390
behavior
where one of the robots the most

3520
00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:34,400
where one of the robots the most
 

3521
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,870
where one of the robots the most
sophisticated one

3522
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:36,880
sophisticated one
 

3523
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,430
sophisticated one
you know sensed where the food pieces

3524
00:58:39,430 --> 00:58:39,440
you know sensed where the food pieces
 

3525
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,150
you know sensed where the food pieces
were

3526
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:40,160
were
 

3527
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:42,230
were
and identified that the other robot was

3528
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
and identified that the other robot was
 

3529
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,430
and identified that the other robot was
close to uh

3530
00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:43,440
close to uh
 

3531
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,150
close to uh
two of a very far distance uh and there

3532
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
two of a very far distance uh and there
 

3533
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,270
two of a very far distance uh and there
was one more food

3534
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
was one more food
 

3535
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,870
was one more food
near by so it faked

3536
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
near by so it faked
 

3537
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,950
near by so it faked
that's now i'm using anthropomorphized

3538
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:52,960
that's now i'm using anthropomorphized
 

3539
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,030
that's now i'm using anthropomorphized
terms but it made a move towards those

3540
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:55,040
terms but it made a move towards those
 

3541
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:55,829
terms but it made a move towards those
other pieces

3542
00:58:55,829 --> 00:58:55,839
other pieces
 

3543
00:58:55,839 --> 00:58:57,510
other pieces
in order for the other robot to actually

3544
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:57,520
in order for the other robot to actually
 

3545
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,030
in order for the other robot to actually
go and get them

3546
00:58:59,030 --> 00:58:59,040
go and get them
 

3547
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,270
go and get them
because it knew that the other the last

3548
00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:01,280
because it knew that the other the last
 

3549
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,430
because it knew that the other the last
remaining piece of food was close

3550
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:03,440
remaining piece of food was close
 

3551
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,870
remaining piece of food was close
and the other robot would have to travel

3552
00:59:04,870 --> 00:59:04,880
and the other robot would have to travel
 

3553
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,870
and the other robot would have to travel
a long way lose its energy

3554
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:06,880
a long way lose its energy
 

3555
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,309
a long way lose its energy
and then lose the whole competition

3556
00:59:10,309 --> 00:59:10,319
and then lose the whole competition
 

3557
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:12,549
and then lose the whole competition
so there was like emergence of something

3558
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:12,559
so there was like emergence of something
 

3559
00:59:12,559 --> 00:59:13,670
so there was like emergence of something
like a theory of mind

3560
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:13,680
like a theory of mind
 

3561
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,630
like a theory of mind
knowing what the other robot would do

3562
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:16,640
knowing what the other robot would do
 

3563
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,789
knowing what the other robot would do
guided towards bad behavior in order to

3564
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:18,799
guided towards bad behavior in order to
 

3565
00:59:18,799 --> 00:59:19,349
guided towards bad behavior in order to
win

3566
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
win
 

3567
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,589
win
so we can get things like that happen uh

3568
00:59:21,589 --> 00:59:21,599
so we can get things like that happen uh
 

3569
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,349
so we can get things like that happen uh
in in simulation as well but that's a

3570
00:59:23,349 --> 00:59:23,359
in in simulation as well but that's a
 

3571
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:24,230
in in simulation as well but that's a
complete

3572
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,240
complete
 

3573
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,990
complete
natural emergence of a theory of mind

3574
00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:26,000
natural emergence of a theory of mind
 

3575
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,670
natural emergence of a theory of mind
but i feel like if you

3576
00:59:27,670 --> 00:59:27,680
but i feel like if you
 

3577
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,710
but i feel like if you
add a little bit of a place for a theory

3578
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:30,720
add a little bit of a place for a theory
 

3579
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,950
add a little bit of a place for a theory
of mind to emerge

3580
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:32,960
of mind to emerge
 

3581
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,950
of mind to emerge
like easier then you can go really far

3582
00:59:36,950 --> 00:59:36,960
like easier then you can go really far
 

3583
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,710
like easier then you can go really far
i mean some of these things with

3584
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:38,720
i mean some of these things with
 

3585
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,390
i mean some of these things with
evolution

3586
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:40,400
evolution
 

3587
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:43,030
evolution
you know you add a little bit of design

3588
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
you know you add a little bit of design
 

3589
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,829
you know you add a little bit of design
in there

3590
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:43,839
in there
 

3591
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:46,789
in there
it'll really help and i think i tend to

3592
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:46,799
it'll really help and i think i tend to
 

3593
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:47,510
it'll really help and i think i tend to
think that

3594
00:59:47,510 --> 00:59:47,520
think that
 

3595
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,710
think that
a very simple theory of mind

3596
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:50,720
a very simple theory of mind
 

3597
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,710
a very simple theory of mind
will go a really long way for

3598
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:52,720
will go a really long way for
 

3599
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,789
will go a really long way for
cooperation between agents

3600
00:59:54,789 --> 00:59:54,799
cooperation between agents
 

3601
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,470
cooperation between agents
and certainly for human robot

3602
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:56,480
and certainly for human robot
 

3603
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,230
and certainly for human robot
interaction like it doesn't have to be

3604
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
interaction like it doesn't have to be
 

3605
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,030
interaction like it doesn't have to be
super complicated um

3606
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,040
super complicated um
 

3607
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,309
super complicated um
i've gotten a chance to in the

3608
01:00:02,309 --> 01:00:02,319
i've gotten a chance to in the
 

3609
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:05,190
i've gotten a chance to in the
autonomous vehicle space to watch

3610
01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:05,200

general
i mean you would think that there's a

3618
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:11,680
i mean you would think that there's a
 

3619
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:12,950
i mean you would think that there's a
very complicated

3620
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:12,960
very complicated
 

3621
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:15,190
very complicated
theory of mind thing going on but i have

3622
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:15,200
theory of mind thing going on but i have
 

3623
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,030
theory of mind thing going on but i have
a sense it's not well understood yet but

3624
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:17,040
a sense it's not well understood yet but
 

3625
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,349
a sense it's not well understood yet but
i have a sense it's pretty dumb

3626
01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:19,359
i have a sense it's pretty dumb
 

3627
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,870
i have a sense it's pretty dumb
like it's pretty simple there's a social

3628
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:22,880
like it's pretty simple there's a social
 

3629
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,829
like it's pretty simple there's a social
contract

3630
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:23,839
contract
 

3631
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:25,829
contract
there where between humans a human

3632
01:00:25,829 --> 01:00:25,839
there where between humans a human
 

3633
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:28,150
there where between humans a human
driver and a human crossing the road

3634

driver and a human crossing the road
 

3635
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,589
driver and a human crossing the road
where um the the human crossing the road

3636
01:00:31,589 --> 01:00:31,599
where um the the human crossing the road
 

3637
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:33,030
where um the the human crossing the road
trusts that the human in the car is not

trusts that the human in the car is not

going to murder them

going to murder them
 

3641
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:36,390
going to murder them
and there's something about again back

3642
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
and there's something about again back
 

3643
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,150
and there's something about again back
to that mortality thing

3644
01:00:38,150 --> 01:00:38,160
to that mortality thing
 

3645
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,510
to that mortality thing
there's some dance

3646
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
there's some dance
 

3647
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:45,510
there's some dance
of ethics and morality that's built in

3648
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
of ethics and morality that's built in
 

3649
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,510
of ethics and morality that's built in
that you're mapping your own morality

3650
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
that you're mapping your own morality
 

3651
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,549
that you're mapping your own morality
onto the

3652
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:48,559
onto the
 

3653
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:50,630
onto the
the person in the car and even if

3654
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:50,640
the person in the car and even if
 

3655
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:51,750
the person in the car and even if
they're driving

3656
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:51,760
they're driving
 

3657
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,470
they're driving
at a speed where you think if they don't

3658
01:00:54,470 --> 01:00:54,480
at a speed where you think if they don't
 

3659
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,150
at a speed where you think if they don't
stop they're going to kill you

3660
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:56,160
stop they're going to kill you
 

3661
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,829
stop they're going to kill you
you trust that if you step in front of

3662
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
you trust that if you step in front of
 

3663
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,430
you trust that if you step in front of
them they're going to hit the brakes

3664
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
them they're going to hit the brakes
 

3665
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,150
them they're going to hit the brakes
and there's that weird dance that we do

3666
01:01:02,150 --> 01:01:02,160
and there's that weird dance that we do
 

3667
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:02,630
and there's that weird dance that we do
that

3668
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,640
that
 

3669
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,190
that
i think is a pretty simple model but of

01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
i think is a pretty simple model but of
 

3671
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,710
i think is a pretty simple model but of
course it's very difficult

3672
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
course it's very difficult
 

3673
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:09,510
course it's very difficult
to introspect what it is and autonomous

01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:09,520
to introspect what it is and autonomous

to introspect what it is and autonomous
robots in the human robot interaction

robots in the human robot interaction
 

3677
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:12,950

have to build that current robots are

have to build that current robots are
 

3681
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,270
have to build that current robots are
much less than what you're describing

make sure you do not collide with that's

make sure you do not collide with that's
 

3713
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:42,789
make sure you do not collide with that's
how like you mentioned elon

3714
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:42,799
how like you mentioned elon
 

3715
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:45,430
how like you mentioned elon
musk thinks about autonomous vehicles i

3716
01:01:45,430 --> 01:01:45,440
musk thinks about autonomous vehicles i
 

3717
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,630
musk thinks about autonomous vehicles i
tend to think

3718
01:01:46,630 --> 01:01:46,640
tend to think
 

3719
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:48,150
tend to think
autonomous vehicles need to have a

3720
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:48,160
autonomous vehicles need to have a
 

3721
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,750
autonomous vehicles need to have a
beautiful dance between human and

3722
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:49,760
beautiful dance between human and
 

3723
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:50,549
beautiful dance between human and
machine

3724
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:50,559
machine
 

3725
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,230
machine
where it's not just a collision

3726
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,240
where it's not just a collision
 

3727
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,190
where it's not just a collision
avoidance problem but a weird

3728
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:55,200
avoidance problem but a weird
 

3729
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,270
avoidance problem but a weird
dance yeah i think that you these

3730
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:57,280
dance yeah i think that you these
 

3731
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:58,630
dance yeah i think that you these
systems need to be

3732
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:58,640
systems need to be
 

3733
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,630
systems need to be
able to predict what will happen what

3734
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:00,640
able to predict what will happen what

the other agent is going to do
and then have a structure of

3738
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:05,440
and then have a structure of
 

3739
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,870
and then have a structure of
what the goals are and whether those

3740
01:02:06,870 --> 01:02:06,880
what the goals are and whether those
 

3741
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,549
what the goals are and whether those
predictions actually meet the goals and

3742
01:02:08,549 --> 01:02:08,559
predictions actually meet the goals and
 

3743
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,029
predictions actually meet the goals and
and you

3744
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:09,039
and you
 

3745
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:11,589
and you
can go probably pretty far with that

3746
01:02:11,589 --> 01:02:11,599
can go probably pretty far with that
 

3747
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,430
can go probably pretty far with that
relatively simple setup already

3748
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:13,440
relatively simple setup already
 

3749
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,430
relatively simple setup already
but to call it a theory of mind i don't

3750
01:02:15,430 --> 01:02:15,440
but to call it a theory of mind i don't
 

3751
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,710
but to call it a theory of mind i don't
think you need to i mean it

3752
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:16,720
think you need to i mean it
 

3753
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,230
think you need to i mean it
it doesn't matter whether a pedestrian

3754
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
it doesn't matter whether a pedestrian
 

3755
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,990
it doesn't matter whether a pedestrian
has a mind it's an object

3756
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:20,000
has a mind it's an object
 

3757
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,829
has a mind it's an object
and we can predict what we'll do and

3758
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
and we can predict what we'll do and
 

3759
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,430
and we can predict what we'll do and
then we can predict what the states will

3760
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:23,440
then we can predict what the states will
 

3761
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,870
then we can predict what the states will
be in the future and whether they are

3762
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
be in the future and whether they are

01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,069
be in the future and whether they are
desirable states

desirable states
 

3765
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,270
desirable states
stay away from those that are

01:02:27,270 --> 01:02:27,280
stay away from those that are
 

3767
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,029
stay away from those that are
undesirable and go towards those that

undesirable and go towards those that
 

3769
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,069
undesirable and go towards those that
are desirable so

3770
01:02:30,069 --> 01:02:30,079
are desirable so
 

3771
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,630
are desirable so
it's a relatively simple functional

3772
01:02:32,630 --> 01:02:32,640
it's a relatively simple functional
 

3773
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,470
it's a relatively simple functional
approach to that

3774
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
approach to that
 

3775
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,390
approach to that
where do we really need the theory of

3776
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,400
where do we really need the theory of
 

3777
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,150
where do we really need the theory of
mind

3778
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,160
mind
 

3779
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,870
mind
maybe maybe when you start interacting

3780
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:40,880
maybe maybe when you start interacting
 

3781
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,430
maybe maybe when you start interacting
and

3782
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:41,440
and
 

3783
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:43,109
and
you're trying to get the other agent to

3784
01:02:43,109 --> 01:02:43,119
you're trying to get the other agent to
 

3785
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,510
you're trying to get the other agent to
do something and jointly so that you can

3786
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:45,520
do something and jointly so that you can
 

3787
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,390
do something and jointly so that you can
jointly

3788
01:02:46,390 --> 01:02:46,400
jointly
 

3789
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,549
jointly
collaboratively achieve something then

3790
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:48,559
collaboratively achieve something then
 

3791
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:50,390
collaboratively achieve something then
then you then it becomes more complex

3792
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:50,400
then you then it becomes more complex
 

3793
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,829
then you then it becomes more complex
well i mean even with the pedestrians

3794
01:02:51,829 --> 01:02:51,839
well i mean even with the pedestrians
 

3795
01:02:51,839 --> 01:02:53,430
well i mean even with the pedestrians
you have to have a sense of where their

3796
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:53,440
you have to have a sense of where their
 

3797
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,789
you have to have a sense of where their
attention

3798
01:02:54,789 --> 01:02:54,799
attention
 

3799
01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:57,349
attention
actual attention in terms of their gaze

3800
01:02:57,349 --> 01:02:57,359
actual attention in terms of their gaze
 

3801
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:58,549
actual attention in terms of their gaze
is but also like

3802
01:02:58,549 --> 01:02:58,559
is but also like
 

3803
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,069
is but also like
a tent i mean there's this vision

3804
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:00,079
a tent i mean there's this vision
 

3805
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,510
a tent i mean there's this vision
science people talk about this all time

3806
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:01,520
science people talk about this all time
 

3807
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:01,990
science people talk about this all time
just because

3808
01:03:01,990 --> 01:03:02,000
just because
 

3809
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,190
just because
i'm looking at it doesn't mean i'm

3810
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,200
i'm looking at it doesn't mean i'm
 

3811
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:05,029
i'm looking at it doesn't mean i'm
paying attention to it so

3812
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:05,039
paying attention to it so
 

3813
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,109
paying attention to it so
figuring out what is the person looking

3814
01:03:07,109 --> 01:03:07,119
figuring out what is the person looking
 

3815
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,470
figuring out what is the person looking
at what is the sensory information

3816
01:03:08,470 --> 01:03:08,480
at what is the sensory information
 

3817
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,750
at what is the sensory information
they've taken in

3818
01:03:09,750 --> 01:03:09,760
they've taken in
 

3819
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,470
they've taken in
and the theory of mind piece comes in is

3820
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:12,480
and the theory of mind piece comes in is
 

3821
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,190
and the theory of mind piece comes in is
what are they

3822
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
what are they
 

3823
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:16,390
what are they
actually attending to cognitively

actually attending to cognitively
 

3825
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,870
actually attending to cognitively
and also what are they thinking about

3826
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:18,880
and also what are they thinking about
 

3827
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,390
and also what are they thinking about
like what is the computation they're

3828
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
like what is the computation they're
 

3829
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,029
like what is the computation they're
performing

3830
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:21,039
performing
 

3831
01:03:21,039 --> 01:03:23,190
performing
and you have you have probably maybe a

3832
01:03:23,190 --> 01:03:23,200
and you have you have probably maybe a
 

3833
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,430
and you have you have probably maybe a
few options

3834
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
few options
 

3835
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,230

you know for the pedestrian crossing it

3836
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:28,240
you know for the pedestrian crossing it
 

3837
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,109

doesn't have to be
 

3839
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:31,029

it's like a variable with a few discrete

3840
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
it's like a variable with a few discrete
 

3841
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,630
it's like a variable with a few discrete
states but you have to have a good

3842
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
states but you have to have a good
 

3843
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,230
states but you have to have a good
estimation which of the states that

3844
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:34,240
estimation which of the states that
 

3845
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,349

if you're collaborating to pick up an

3852
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
if you're collaborating to pick up an
 

3853
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,109
if you're collaborating to pick up an
object you have to figure out

3854
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
object you have to figure out
 

3855
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,470
object you have to figure out
is the human like uh like there's a few

3856
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
is the human like uh like there's a few
 

3857
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:48,309
is the human like uh like there's a few
discrete states that the human could be

3858
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
discrete states that the human could be
 

3859
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,829
discrete states that the human could be
and you have to

3860
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:49,839
and you have to
 

3861
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:51,349
and you have to
you have to predict that by observing

3862
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:51,359
you have to predict that by observing
 

3863
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:53,190
you have to predict that by observing
the human and that seems like a machine

3864
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,200
the human and that seems like a machine
 

3865
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,190
the human and that seems like a machine
learning problem to figure out

3866
01:03:55,190 --> 01:03:55,200
learning problem to figure out
 

3867
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,069
learning problem to figure out
uh what's how the human is uh what's the

3868
01:03:58,069 --> 01:03:58,079
uh what's how the human is uh what's the
 

3869
01:03:58,079 --> 01:03:59,190
uh what's how the human is uh what's the

it's not as simple as sort of planning
 

3873
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:03,349
it's not as simple as sort of planning
just because they move their

01:04:03,349 --> 01:04:03,359
just because they move their
 

3875
01:04:03,359 --> 01:04:05,510
just because they move their
arm means the arm will continue moving

3876
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
arm means the arm will continue moving
 

3877
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,710
arm means the arm will continue moving
in this direction

in this direction
 

3879
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,069
in this direction
you have to you have to really have a

3880
01:04:08,069 --> 01:04:08,079
you have to you have to really have a
 

3881
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,910
you have to you have to really have a
model of what they're thinking about and

3882
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:09,920
model of what they're thinking about and
 

3883
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:10,549
model of what they're thinking about and
what's the

3884
01:04:10,549 --> 01:04:10,559
what's the
 

3885
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:12,789
what's the
motivation behind the moment and here we

3886
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:12,799
motivation behind the moment and here we
 

3887
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:13,589
motivation behind the moment and here we
are talking about

3888
01:04:13,589 --> 01:04:13,599
are talking about
 

3889
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,230
are talking about
uh relatively simple physical actions

3890
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:16,240
uh relatively simple physical actions
 

3891
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,510
uh relatively simple physical actions
yeah but you can take that

3892
01:04:17,510 --> 01:04:17,520
yeah but you can take that
 

3893
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,230
yeah but you can take that
the higher levels also like to predict

3894
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:20,240
the higher levels also like to predict
 

3895
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,990
the higher levels also like to predict
what the people are going to do you need

3896
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,000
what the people are going to do you need
 

3897
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,029
what the people are going to do you need
to know

3898
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
to know
 

3899
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,230
to know
what uh what their goals are uh what are

01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:26,240
what uh what their goals are uh what are
 

3901
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:27,990
what uh what their goals are uh what are
they trying to are they exercising are

3902

starting to get somewhere but even even
 

3907
01:04:30,079 --> 01:04:31,910
starting to get somewhere but even even
higher level i mean you are

3908
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:31,920
higher level i mean you are
 

3909
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:33,430
higher level i mean you are
predicting what people will do in their

3910
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
predicting what people will do in their
 

3911
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,190
predicting what people will do in their
career what their life themes are do

3912
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:35,200
career what their life themes are do
 

3913
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:36,230
career what their life themes are do
they want to be famous

3914
01:04:36,230 --> 01:04:36,240
they want to be famous
 

3915
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,349
they want to be famous
rich or do good and that takes a lot

3916
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:39,359
rich or do good and that takes a lot
 

3917
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:40,470
rich or do good and that takes a lot
more information

3918
01:04:40,470 --> 01:04:40,480
more information
 

3919
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,309
more information
but it allows you to then predict their

3920
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:42,319
but it allows you to then predict their
 

3921
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,309
but it allows you to then predict their
their actions what choices they might

3922
01:04:44,309 --> 01:04:44,319
their actions what choices they might
 

3923
01:04:44,319 --> 01:04:45,670

apply

3928

apply
 

3929
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,870
apply
to the world of neural networks because

3930
01:04:50,870 --> 01:04:50,880
to the world of neural networks because
 

3931
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:52,390

i've seen quite a bit of work
 

3933
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:54,549

3936
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
of neural evolution so maybe first
 

3937
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,710
of neural evolution so maybe first
can you say what is this field yeah a

3938
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
can you say what is this field yeah a
 

3939
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,910
can you say what is this field yeah a
new evolution

3940
01:04:59,910 --> 01:04:59,920
new evolution
 

3941
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:02,309
new evolution
is a combination of of uh neural

3942
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
is a combination of of uh neural
 

3943
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:04,309
is a combination of of uh neural
networks and evolution computation

3944
01:05:04,309 --> 01:05:04,319
networks and evolution computation
 

3945
01:05:04,319 --> 01:05:07,349
networks and evolution computation
in many different forms but the early

3946
01:05:07,349 --> 01:05:07,359
in many different forms but the early
 

3947
01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,390
in many different forms but the early
versions were simply using evolution

3948
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
versions were simply using evolution
 

3949
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,870
versions were simply using evolution
the way um as a way to construct the

3950
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:12,880
the way um as a way to construct the
 

3951
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:13,910
the way um as a way to construct the
neural network

3952
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:13,920
neural network
 

3953
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,710
neural network
instead of say stochastic gradient

3954
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
instead of say stochastic gradient
 

3955
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,190
instead of say stochastic gradient
descent or back propagation

3956
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:19,200
descent or back propagation
 

3957
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,750
descent or back propagation
because evolution can evolve these

3958
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
because evolution can evolve these
 

3959
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,510
because evolution can evolve these
parameters weight values in a neural

3960
01:05:23,510 --> 01:05:23,520

3961
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,109

01:05:27,270 --> 01:05:27,280
numbers you can you can do that
 

3965
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,750
numbers you can you can do that
and that's useful because some cases you

3966
01:05:29,750 --> 01:05:29,760
and that's useful because some cases you
 

3967
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:30,710
and that's useful because some cases you
don't have

3968
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:30,720
don't have
 

3969
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,510
don't have
those targets that you need to um back

3970
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:33,520
those targets that you need to um back
 

3971
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,630
those targets that you need to um back
propagate from

3972
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,640

answer says you don't have backup
 

3983
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:44,870
answer says you don't have backup
but this way you can still evolve in

3984
01:05:44,870 --> 01:05:44,880
but this way you can still evolve in
 

3985
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,390
but this way you can still evolve in
your own hand and

3986
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:46,400
your own hand and
 

3987
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,910

neural networks are really good at this
 

3989
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,150

so that's an inter interaction between

4058
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
so that's an inter interaction between
 

4059
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:56,870
so that's an inter interaction between
two mechanisms

4060
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:56,880
two mechanisms
 

4061
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:59,990
two mechanisms
but there's also when we get more into

4062
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:00,000
but there's also when we get more into
 

4063
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,349
but there's also when we get more into
cognitive science and the topics that

we've been talking about
you could have learning mechanisms at

you could have learning mechanisms at
 

4069
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:06,069
you could have learning mechanisms at
two level time scales

4070

two level time scales
 

4071
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,630
two level time scales
so you do have an evolution that gives

4072
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:08,640
so you do have an evolution that gives
 

4073
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:09,190
so you do have an evolution that gives
you

4074

during their lifetime
 

4079
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:15,029
during their lifetime
and you have this interaction of two

4080
01:07:15,029 --> 01:07:15,039
and you have this interaction of two
 

4081
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:16,549
and you have this interaction of two
time scales and i think that can

4082
01:07:16,549 --> 01:07:16,559
time scales and i think that can
 

4083
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:19,349
time scales and i think that can
potentially be really powerful

4084
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:19,359
potentially be really powerful
 

4085
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,990
potentially be really powerful
now in biology we are not born with all

4097
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,510

probably the reason is that
evolution and dna is not detailed enough

4100
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:34,720
evolution and dna is not detailed enough
 

4101
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,789
evolution and dna is not detailed enough
or plentiful enough to describe them we

4102
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
or plentiful enough to describe them we
 

4103
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,470
or plentiful enough to describe them we
can't describe how to set the brain

4104
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,480
can't describe how to set the brain
 

4105
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,510
can't describe how to set the brain
up but we can

4106
01:07:41,510 --> 01:07:41,520
up but we can
 

4107
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:45,270
up but we can
evolution can decide on a starting point

4108
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
evolution can decide on a starting point
 

4109
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,190
evolution can decide on a starting point
and then have a learning algorithm that

4110
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
and then have a learning algorithm that
 

4111
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:48,470
and then have a learning algorithm that
will construct

4112
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
will construct
 

4113
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,270
will construct
the final product and this interaction

4114
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:51,280
the final product and this interaction
 

4115
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:51,910
the final product and this interaction
of

4116
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
of
 

4117
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:55,029
of
you know intelligent um well

4118
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:55,039
you know intelligent um well
 

4119
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,950
you know intelligent um well
evolution that has produced a good

01:07:56,950 --> 01:07:56,960
evolution that has produced a good
 

4121
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:58,390
evolution that has produced a good
starting point for the

with the interaction of

4126
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:01,839
with the interaction of
 

4127
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:03,589
with the interaction of
uh with the environment that can be a

01:08:03,589 --> 01:08:03,599
uh with the environment that can be a
 

4129
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:04,710

4135
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,270

01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:09,280
i like how you walk back from
 

4137
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,109
i like how you walk back from
intelligence so optimize

4138
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,119

starting point maybe uh yeah

4140
01:08:14,230 --> 01:08:14,240
starting point maybe uh yeah
 

4141
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:17,590

uh okay there's a lot of fascinating

4142
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:17,600
uh okay there's a lot of fascinating
 

4143
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,110
uh okay there's a lot of fascinating
things to ask here and this is

4144
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,120
things to ask here and this is
 

4145
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,590
things to ask here and this is
basically this dance between neural

4146
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
basically this dance between neural
 

4147
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,749
basically this dance between neural
networks and evolutionary computations

4148
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:23,759
networks and evolutionary computations
 

4149
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:25,430
networks and evolutionary computations
could go into the category of automated

4150
01:08:25,430 --> 01:08:25,440
could go into the category of automated
 

4151
01:08:25,440 --> 01:08:28,149
could go into the category of automated
machine learning so where you're

4152
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:28,159
machine learning so where you're
 

4153
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:29,990
machine learning so where you're
optimizing whether it's hyper parameters

4154
01:08:29,990 --> 01:08:30,000
optimizing whether it's hyper parameters

01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:34,640
hyper parameters taken broadly but the
 

4159
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,390
hyper parameters taken broadly but the
topology thing is really interesting i

4160
01:08:36,390 --> 01:08:36,400
topology thing is really interesting i
 

4161
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,789

small scale set of experiments or do you

4202
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
small scale set of experiments or do you
 

4203
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,550
small scale set of experiments or do you
have hope

4204
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,560
have hope

01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,030
have hope
that we can be able to grow powerful

4211
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,309
i i think we can uh and most of the work
up to now is taking architectures that

4212
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
up to now is taking architectures that
 

4213
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,630
up to now is taking architectures that
already exist that humans have designed

already exist that humans have designed
 

4215
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,030
already exist that humans have designed

01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
and tried to optimize them further and
 

4217
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,110
and tried to optimize them further and
and you can totally do that a few years

4218
01:09:33,110 --> 01:09:33,120
and you can totally do that a few years
 

4219
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:34,550
and you can totally do that a few years
ago we did an experiment we took a

and um the architecture and just broke

4226
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:41,679
and um the architecture and just broke
 

4227
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:42,789

4229
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:44,390

01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,550
put them together
and the space is just really really big

4264
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
and the space is just really really big
 

4265
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,950
and the space is just really really big
uh so you have to somehow constrain it

4266
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:20,960
uh so you have to somehow constrain it
 

4267
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,790
uh so you have to somehow constrain it
and have some hunch of what will work

4268
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:22,800
and have some hunch of what will work
 

4269
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,310
and have some hunch of what will work
uh because otherwise everything is

4270
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
uh because otherwise everything is
 

4271
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:27,350
uh because otherwise everything is
possible and another challenge is that

4272
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
possible and another challenge is that
 

4273
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,950
possible and another challenge is that
in order to evaluate how good your

4274
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:28,960
in order to evaluate how good your
 

4275
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:30,870
in order to evaluate how good your
design is

4276
01:10:30,870 --> 01:10:30,880
design is
 

4277
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,510
design is
you have to train it i mean you have to

4278
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:33,520
you have to train it i mean you have to
 

4279
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,870
you have to train it i mean you have to
actually try it out

4280
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:34,880
actually try it out
 

4281
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,870
actually try it out
and that's currently very expensive

4282
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:36,880
and that's currently very expensive
 

4283
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:38,470
and that's currently very expensive
right i mean deep learning networks may

4284
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:38,480
right i mean deep learning networks may
 

4285
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:38,870
right i mean deep learning networks may
they

4286
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:38,880
they
 

4287
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:41,189
they
take days to train well imagine having a

4288
01:10:41,189 --> 01:10:41,199
take days to train well imagine having a
 

4289
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:42,790
take days to train well imagine having a
population of 100 and have to

4290
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:42,800
population of 100 and have to
 

4291
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,510
population of 100 and have to
run it for 100 generations it's not yet

4292
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:45,520
run it for 100 generations it's not yet
 

4293
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:47,510
run it for 100 generations it's not yet
quite feasible computationally

4294
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:47,520
quite feasible computationally
 

4295
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,470
quite feasible computationally
um it will be but but also there's a

4296
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:50,480
um it will be but but also there's a
 

4297
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,070
um it will be but but also there's a
large carbon footprint and all that i

4298
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,080
large carbon footprint and all that i
 

4299
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,430
large carbon footprint and all that i
mean we're using a lot of computation

4300
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:53,440
mean we're using a lot of computation
 

4301
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,229
mean we're using a lot of computation
for doing it

4302
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:54,239
for doing it
 

4303
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,430
for doing it
so intelligent methods and intelligence

4304
01:10:57,430 --> 01:10:57,440
so intelligent methods and intelligence
 

4305
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,189
so intelligent methods and intelligence
i mean

4306
01:10:59,189 --> 01:10:59,199
i mean
 

4307
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:00,790
i mean
we have to do some science in order to

4308
01:11:00,790 --> 01:11:00,800
we have to do some science in order to
 

4309
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,070
we have to do some science in order to
figure out what the right

4310
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:02,080
figure out what the right
 

4311
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:03,510
figure out what the right
representations are

4312
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:03,520
representations are
 

4313
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,990
representations are
and right operators are and how do we

4314
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
and right operators are and how do we
 

4315
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,189
and right operators are and how do we
evaluate them

4316
01:11:07,189 --> 01:11:07,199
evaluate them
 

4317
01:11:07,199 --> 01:11:09,910
evaluate them
without having to fully train them and

4318
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:09,920
without having to fully train them and
 

4319
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,270
without having to fully train them and
that is where the current research is

4320
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:11,280
that is where the current research is
 

4321
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:12,630
that is where the current research is
and we're making progress on all those

4322
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
and we're making progress on all those
 

4323
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:13,590
and we're making progress on all those
fronts

4324
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:13,600
fronts
 

4325
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:17,270
fronts
um so so yes there are certain

4326
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:17,280
um so so yes there are certain
 

4327
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,790
um so so yes there are certain
architectures that are more amenable to

4328
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:18,800
architectures that are more amenable to
 

4329
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:19,430
architectures that are more amenable to
that

4330
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
that
 

4331
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,750
that
uh approach but also i think we can

4332
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
uh approach but also i think we can
 

4333
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:22,950
uh approach but also i think we can
create our own

4334
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:22,960
create our own
 

4335
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,950
create our own
architecture and whole representations

4336
01:11:24,950 --> 01:11:24,960
architecture and whole representations
 

4337
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:26,310
architecture and whole representations
that are even better

4338
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:26,320
that are even better
 

4339
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,470
that are even better
do you think it's possible to do like uh

4340
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,480
do you think it's possible to do like uh
 

4341
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,189
do you think it's possible to do like uh
like a tiny baby network that grows into

4342
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:31,199
like a tiny baby network that grows into
 

4343
01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:32,630
like a tiny baby network that grows into
something that can do state of the art

4344
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
something that can do state of the art
 

4345
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,229
something that can do state of the art
and like even the simple data set like

4346
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:34,239
and like even the simple data set like
 

4347
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:35,270
and like even the simple data set like
mnist

4348
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:35,280
mnist
 

4349
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:38,470
mnist
and just like it uh just grows into a

4350
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:38,480
and just like it uh just grows into a
 

4351
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:40,149
and just like it uh just grows into a
you know gigantic monster that's the

4352
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
you know gigantic monster that's the
 

4353
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,990
you know gigantic monster that's the
world's greatest handwriting recognition

4354
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:42,000
world's greatest handwriting recognition
 

4355
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:42,470
world's greatest handwriting recognition
system

4356
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:42,480
system
 

4357
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,229
system
yeah there are approaches like that

4358
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:44,239
yeah there are approaches like that
 

4359
01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:45,990
yeah there are approaches like that
esteban rail and cochlear for instance

4360
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
esteban rail and cochlear for instance
 

4361
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,110
esteban rail and cochlear for instance
have worked on

4362
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:47,120
have worked on
 

4363
01:11:47,120 --> 01:11:48,709
have worked on
evolving a smaller network and then

4364
01:11:48,709 --> 01:11:48,719
evolving a smaller network and then
 

4365
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,870
evolving a smaller network and then
systematically expanding it to a larger

4366
01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
systematically expanding it to a larger
 

4367
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:51,590
systematically expanding it to a larger
one

4368
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:51,600
one
 

4369
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,149
one
uh your elements are already there and

4370
01:11:54,149 --> 01:11:54,159
uh your elements are already there and
 

4371
01:11:54,159 --> 01:11:55,669
uh your elements are already there and
scaling it up will just give you more

4372
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:55,679
scaling it up will just give you more
 

4373
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:56,470
scaling it up will just give you more
power

4374
01:11:56,470 --> 01:11:56,480
power
 

4375
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,149
power
so again evolution gives you that

4376
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
so again evolution gives you that
 

4377
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,830
so again evolution gives you that
starting point yes and then there's a

4378
01:11:59,830 --> 01:11:59,840
starting point yes and then there's a
 

4379
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:00,950
starting point yes and then there's a
mechanism

4380
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
mechanism
 

4381
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,189
mechanism
that gives you the final result and a

4382
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:03,199
that gives you the final result and a
 

4383
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:04,790
that gives you the final result and a
very powerful approach

4384
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:04,800
very powerful approach
 

4385
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,790
very powerful approach
um but you know you could you could also

4386
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:08,800
um but you know you could you could also
 

4387
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,550
um but you know you could you could also
um simulate the actual growth process

4388
01:12:12,550 --> 01:12:12,560
um simulate the actual growth process
 

4389
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,630
um simulate the actual growth process
and like i said before evolving a

4390
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:14,640
and like i said before evolving a
 

4391
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:16,229
and like i said before evolving a
starting point and then evolving it

4392
01:12:16,229 --> 01:12:16,239
starting point and then evolving it
 

4393
01:12:16,239 --> 01:12:18,790
starting point and then evolving it
uh or training the network there's not

4394
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
uh or training the network there's not
 

4395
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,390
uh or training the network there's not
that much work that's been done

4396
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:20,400
that much work that's been done
 

4397
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,790
that much work that's been done
on that yet uh we need some kind of a

4398
01:12:22,790 --> 01:12:22,800
on that yet uh we need some kind of a
 

4399
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:23,590
on that yet uh we need some kind of a
simulated

4400
01:12:23,590 --> 01:12:23,600
simulated
 

4401
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:24,950
simulated
simulation environment so there are

4402
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
simulation environment so there are
 

4403
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,030
simulation environment so there are
interactions uh at will

4404
01:12:27,030 --> 01:12:27,040
interactions uh at will
 

4405
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,709
interactions uh at will
uh the supervised environment doesn't

4406
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:28,719
uh the supervised environment doesn't
 

4407
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,630
uh the supervised environment doesn't
really it's not as easily

4408
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:30,640
really it's not as easily
 

4409
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:34,149
really it's not as easily
uh usable here sorry the interaction

4410
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:34,159
uh usable here sorry the interaction
 

4411
01:12:34,159 --> 01:12:36,070
uh usable here sorry the interaction
between neural networks yeah the neural

4412
01:12:36,070 --> 01:12:36,080
between neural networks yeah the neural
 

4413
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,270
between neural networks yeah the neural
networks that you are creating

4414
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:37,280
networks that you are creating
 

4415
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:39,750
networks that you are creating
interacting the world uh and learning

4416
01:12:39,750 --> 01:12:39,760
interacting the world uh and learning
 

4417
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,430
interacting the world uh and learning

from these uh
 

4419
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:43,270
from these uh
sequences of interactions perhaps

4420
01:12:43,270 --> 01:12:43,280
sequences of interactions perhaps
 

4421
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,510

4425
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,630
[Laughter]
that's awesome we would like to get

4426
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:48,640
that's awesome we would like to get
 

4427
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:51,189
that's awesome we would like to get
there but just the task of simulating

4428
01:12:51,189 --> 01:12:51,199
there but just the task of simulating
 

4429
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,830
there but just the task of simulating
something is

4430
01:12:51,830 --> 01:12:51,840
something is
 

4431
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,430
something is
at that level is very hard it's very

4432
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:53,440
at that level is very hard it's very
 

4433
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,270
at that level is very hard it's very
difficult i love the idea

4434
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,280
difficult i love the idea
 

4435
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:57,669
difficult i love the idea
i mean one of the powerful things about

4436
01:12:57,669 --> 01:12:57,679
i mean one of the powerful things about
 

4437
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,830
i mean one of the powerful things about
evolution on earth is the predators and

4438
01:12:59,830 --> 01:12:59,840
evolution on earth is the predators and
 

4439
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:01,189
evolution on earth is the predators and
prey emerged

4440
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
prey emerged
 

4441
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:03,669
prey emerged
and like there's just like there's

4442
01:13:03,669 --> 01:13:03,679
and like there's just like there's
 

4443
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,830
and like there's just like there's
bigger fish and smaller fish and

4444
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:05,840
bigger fish and smaller fish and
 

4445
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,430
bigger fish and smaller fish and
it's fascinating to think that you could

4446
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
it's fascinating to think that you could
 

4447
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,030
it's fascinating to think that you could
have neural networks competing against

4448
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
have neural networks competing against
 

4449
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,630
have neural networks competing against
each other one yellow network being able

4450
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:10,640
each other one yellow network being able
 

4451
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,149
each other one yellow network being able
to destroy another one

4452
01:13:12,149 --> 01:13:12,159
to destroy another one
 

4453
01:13:12,159 --> 01:13:14,229
to destroy another one
there's like wars of neural networks

4454
01:13:14,229 --> 01:13:14,239
there's like wars of neural networks
 

4455
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,510
there's like wars of neural networks
competing to solve

4456
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:15,520
competing to solve
 

4457
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,830
competing to solve
the mnist problem i don't know yeah yeah

4458
01:13:17,830 --> 01:13:17,840
the mnist problem i don't know yeah yeah
 

4459
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,189
the mnist problem i don't know yeah yeah
oh totally yeah yeah yeah

4460
01:13:19,189 --> 01:13:19,199
oh totally yeah yeah yeah
 

4461
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,110
oh totally yeah yeah yeah
and and we actually simulated also that

4462
01:13:21,110 --> 01:13:21,120
and and we actually simulated also that
 

4463
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,630
and and we actually simulated also that
uh prayer the prey

4464
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:22,640
uh prayer the prey
 

4465
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:24,229
uh prayer the prey
and it was interesting what happened

4466
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:24,239
and it was interesting what happened
 

4467
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,390
and it was interesting what happened
there but budget but minnie roger poland

4468
01:13:26,390 --> 01:13:26,400
there but budget but minnie roger poland
 

4469
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:26,870
there but budget but minnie roger poland
did this

4470
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:26,880
did this
 

4471
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,750
did this
and um kay holcomb was a zoologist so we

4472
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:29,760
and um kay holcomb was a zoologist so we
 

4473
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:30,310
and um kay holcomb was a zoologist so we
had

4474
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:30,320
had
 

4475
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,590
had
again um

4476
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:33,600
again um
 

4477
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,350
again um
we had simulated hyenas simulated zebras

4478
01:13:37,350 --> 01:13:37,360
we had simulated hyenas simulated zebras
 

4479
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:40,390
we had simulated hyenas simulated zebras
nice uh and initially you know

4480
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:40,400
nice uh and initially you know
 

4481
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,870
nice uh and initially you know
the hyenas just tried to hunt them and

4482
01:13:42,870 --> 01:13:42,880
the hyenas just tried to hunt them and
 

4483
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:43,750
the hyenas just tried to hunt them and
when they actually

4484
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:43,760
when they actually
 

4485
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:46,229
when they actually
stumbled upon the zebra they ate it and

4486
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
stumbled upon the zebra they ate it and
 

4487
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,110
stumbled upon the zebra they ate it and
we're happy

4488
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:47,120
we're happy
 

4489
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:50,390
we're happy
um and and then the zebras learned to

4490
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:50,400
um and and then the zebras learned to
 

4491
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:53,590
um and and then the zebras learned to
escape uh and the hyenas learned to team

4492
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:53,600
escape uh and the hyenas learned to team
 

4493
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,229
escape uh and the hyenas learned to team
up

4494
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
up
 

4495
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,750
up
and actually two of them approached in

4496
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:55,760
and actually two of them approached in
 

4497
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,910
and actually two of them approached in
different directions and now the zebras

4498
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
different directions and now the zebras
 

4499
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:58,950
different directions and now the zebras
their next step

4500
01:13:58,950 --> 01:13:58,960
their next step
 

4501
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,229
their next step
they generated a behavior where they

4502
01:14:02,229 --> 01:14:02,239
they generated a behavior where they
 

4503
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:02,709
they generated a behavior where they
split

4504
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
split
 

4505
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:04,550
split
in different directions just like

4506
01:14:04,550 --> 01:14:04,560
in different directions just like
 

4507
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,229
in different directions just like
actually gazelles do

4508
01:14:06,229 --> 01:14:06,239
actually gazelles do
 

4509
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:08,470
actually gazelles do
in in when they are being hunted they

4510
01:14:08,470 --> 01:14:08,480
in in when they are being hunted they
 

4511
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:09,990
in in when they are being hunted they
confuse the predator by going in

4512
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:10,000
confuse the predator by going in
 

4513
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:10,950
confuse the predator by going in
different directions

4514
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:10,960
different directions
 

4515
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,229
different directions
that emerged and then more hyenas joined

4516
01:14:14,229 --> 01:14:14,239
that emerged and then more hyenas joined
 

4517
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:17,270
that emerged and then more hyenas joined
and and kind of circled them uh and

4518
01:14:17,270 --> 01:14:17,280
and and kind of circled them uh and
 

4519
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,870
and and kind of circled them uh and
and then when they circled them they

4520
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:18,880
and then when they circled them they
 

4521
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:20,950
and then when they circled them they
could actually hurt the zebras together

4522
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:20,960
could actually hurt the zebras together
 

4523
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:21,669
could actually hurt the zebras together
and and eat

4524
01:14:21,669 --> 01:14:21,679
and and eat
 

4525
01:14:21,679 --> 01:14:24,709
and and eat
multiple uh zebras so there was a like

4526
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:24,719
multiple uh zebras so there was a like
 

4527
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:24,950
multiple uh zebras so there was a like
an

4528
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:24,960
an
 

4529
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:28,310
an
arms race of predators and prey

4530
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:28,320
arms race of predators and prey
 

4531
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:30,310
arms race of predators and prey
and they gradually develop more complex

4532
01:14:30,310 --> 01:14:30,320
and they gradually develop more complex
 

4533
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,149
and they gradually develop more complex
behaviors some of which we actually do

4534
01:14:32,149 --> 01:14:32,159
behaviors some of which we actually do
 

4535
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:33,430
behaviors some of which we actually do
see in nature

4536
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:33,440
see in nature
 

4537
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,630
see in nature
uh and and this kind of co-evolution uh

4538
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:36,640
uh and and this kind of co-evolution uh
 

4539
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,229
uh and and this kind of co-evolution uh
that's competitive evolution it's a

4540
01:14:38,229 --> 01:14:38,239
that's competitive evolution it's a
 

4541
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:40,390
that's competitive evolution it's a
fascinating topic because there's a

4542
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:40,400
fascinating topic because there's a
 

4543
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,350
fascinating topic because there's a
a promise or possibility that you will

4544
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
a promise or possibility that you will
 

4545
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,709
a promise or possibility that you will
discover something

4546
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:44,719
discover something
 

4547
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,470
discover something
uh new that you don't already know you

4548
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:46,480
uh new that you don't already know you
 

4549
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:47,990
uh new that you don't already know you
didn't build it in

4550
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:48,000
didn't build it in
 

4551
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,110
didn't build it in
it came from this arms race it's hard to

4552
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:51,120
it came from this arms race it's hard to
 

4553
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:52,950
it came from this arms race it's hard to
keep the arms race going it's hard to

4554
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:52,960
keep the arms race going it's hard to
 

4555
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:53,510
keep the arms race going it's hard to
have

4556
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
have
 

4557
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,910
have
reits enough simulation that that

4558
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:55,920
reits enough simulation that that
 

4559
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:58,149
reits enough simulation that that
supports all of these complex behaviors

4560
01:14:58,149 --> 01:14:58,159
supports all of these complex behaviors
 

4561
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:00,229
supports all of these complex behaviors
but at least for several steps we've

4562
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:00,239
but at least for several steps we've
 

4563
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,830
but at least for several steps we've
already seen it in the spread of the

4564
01:15:01,830 --> 01:15:01,840
already seen it in the spread of the
 

4565
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,510
already seen it in the spread of the
prey scenario yeah

4566
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:03,520
prey scenario yeah
 

4567
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:04,790
prey scenario yeah
first of all it's fascinating to think

4568
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:04,800
first of all it's fascinating to think
 

4569
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,830
first of all it's fascinating to think
about this context in terms of uh

4570
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:07,840
about this context in terms of uh
 

4571
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,870
about this context in terms of uh
evolving architectures so i've studied

4572
01:15:10,870 --> 01:15:10,880
evolving architectures so i've studied
 

4573
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:12,630
evolving architectures so i've studied
tesla autopilot for a long time

4574
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,640
tesla autopilot for a long time
 

4575
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:16,470
tesla autopilot for a long time
it's one particular implementation

4576
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
it's one particular implementation
 

4577
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,229
it's one particular implementation
of an ai system that's operating in the

4578
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:18,239
of an ai system that's operating in the
 

4579
01:15:18,239 --> 01:15:20,070
of an ai system that's operating in the
real world i find it fascinating because

4580
01:15:20,070 --> 01:15:20,080
real world i find it fascinating because
 

4581
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:21,990
real world i find it fascinating because
of the scale at which it's used out in

4582
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:22,000
of the scale at which it's used out in
 

4583
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,270
of the scale at which it's used out in
the real world

4584
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:23,280
the real world
 

4585
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:25,189
the real world
and uh i'm not sure if you're familiar

4586
01:15:25,189 --> 01:15:25,199
and uh i'm not sure if you're familiar
 

4587
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:26,470
and uh i'm not sure if you're familiar
with that system much but

4588
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:26,480
with that system much but
 

4589
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,470
with that system much but
you know andre kapathi leads that team

4590
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:28,480
you know andre kapathi leads that team
 

4591
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,070
you know andre kapathi leads that team
on the machine learning side

4592
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:30,080
on the machine learning side
 

4593
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:33,110
on the machine learning side
and there's a multitask

4594
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:33,120
and there's a multitask
 

4595
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,510
and there's a multitask
network multi-headed network where

4596
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:35,520
network multi-headed network where
 

4597
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,790
network multi-headed network where
there's a core

4598
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:36,800
there's a core
 

4599
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,870
there's a core
but it's trained on particular tasks and

4600
01:15:38,870 --> 01:15:38,880
but it's trained on particular tasks and
 

4601
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:40,310
but it's trained on particular tasks and
there's a bunch of different heads that

4602
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:40,320
there's a bunch of different heads that
 

4603
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:41,669
there's a bunch of different heads that
are trained on that

4604
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:41,679
are trained on that
 

4605
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,870
are trained on that
is there some lessons from

4606
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:44,880
is there some lessons from
 

4607
01:15:44,880 --> 01:15:46,709
is there some lessons from
evolutionary computation or neural

4608
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:46,719
evolutionary computation or neural
 

4609
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:48,630
evolutionary computation or neural
evolution that could be applied to this

4610
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:48,640
evolution that could be applied to this
 

4611
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:49,830
evolution that could be applied to this
kind of

4612
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:49,840
kind of
 

4613
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:51,590
kind of
multi-headed beast that's operating in

01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:51,600
multi-headed beast that's operating in
 

4615
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:53,270
multi-headed beast that's operating in
the real world yes

4616
01:15:53,270 --> 01:15:53,280
the real world yes
 

4617
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,790
the real world yes
it's a very good problem for new

4618
01:15:54,790 --> 01:15:54,800
it's a very good problem for new
 

4619
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:56,470
it's a very good problem for new
revolution

01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
revolution
 

4621
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:57,990
revolution
and the reason is that when you have

4622
01:15:57,990 --> 01:15:58,000
and the reason is that when you have
 

4623
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,550
and the reason is that when you have
multiple tasks

4624
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:00,560
multiple tasks
 

4625
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:03,669
multiple tasks
they support each other so let's say

4626
01:16:03,669 --> 01:16:03,679
they support each other so let's say
 

4627
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:04,229
they support each other so let's say
you're

4628
01:16:04,229 --> 01:16:04,239
you're
 

4629
01:16:04,239 --> 01:16:07,990
you're
learning to classify x-ray images uh

4630
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
learning to classify x-ray images uh
 

4631
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,070
learning to classify x-ray images uh
different pathologies so you have one

4632
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:10,080
different pathologies so you have one
 

4633
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,030
different pathologies so you have one
task is to classify

4634
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
task is to classify
 

4635
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,470
task is to classify
this disease and another one this

4636
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:14,480
this disease and another one this
 

4637
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:16,229
this disease and another one this
disease another on this one and when

4638
01:16:16,229 --> 01:16:16,239
disease another on this one and when
 

4639
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,110
disease another on this one and when
you're learning

4640
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:17,120
you're learning
 

4641
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:20,310
you're learning
from one disease that forces certain

4642
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:20,320
from one disease that forces certain
 

4643
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,669
from one disease that forces certain
kinds of internal representations and

4644
01:16:21,669 --> 01:16:21,679
kinds of internal representations and
 

4645
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:23,270
kinds of internal representations and
embeddings

4646
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
embeddings
 

4647
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,750
embeddings
and they can serve as a helpful starting

4648
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:25,760
and they can serve as a helpful starting
 

4649
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:27,510
and they can serve as a helpful starting
point for the other tasks

4650
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:27,520
point for the other tasks
 

4651
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,910
point for the other tasks
so you are combining the wisdom of

4652
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:29,920
so you are combining the wisdom of
 

4653
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,270
so you are combining the wisdom of
multiple tasks into these

4654
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
multiple tasks into these
 

4655
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,310
multiple tasks into these
representations

4656
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
representations
 

4657
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,229
representations
and it turns out that you can do better

4658
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:34,239
and it turns out that you can do better
 

4659
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:35,750
and it turns out that you can do better
in each of these tasks

4660
01:16:35,750 --> 01:16:35,760
in each of these tasks
 

4661
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:37,110
in each of these tasks
when you're learning simultaneously

4662
01:16:37,110 --> 01:16:37,120
when you're learning simultaneously
 

4663
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,350
when you're learning simultaneously
other tasks than you would by one task

4664
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
other tasks than you would by one task
 

4665
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,030
other tasks than you would by one task
alone which is a fascinating idea in

4666
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:41,040
alone which is a fascinating idea in
 

4667
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:41,669
alone which is a fascinating idea in
itself yeah

4668
01:16:41,669 --> 01:16:41,679
itself yeah
 

4669
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:43,669
itself yeah
yes and and people do that all the time

4670
01:16:43,669 --> 01:16:43,679
yes and and people do that all the time
 

4671
01:16:43,679 --> 01:16:45,350
yes and and people do that all the time
i mean you use knowledge of domains that

4672
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
i mean you use knowledge of domains that
 

4673
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:45,910
i mean you use knowledge of domains that
you know

4674
01:16:45,910 --> 01:16:45,920
you know
 

4675
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,229
you know
in new domains uh and and certainly

4676
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:48,239
in new domains uh and and certainly
 

4677
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:49,510
in new domains uh and and certainly
neural networks can do that

4678
01:16:49,510 --> 01:16:49,520
neural networks can do that
 

4679
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,149
neural networks can do that
when your evolution comes in is that um

4680
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:52,159
when your evolution comes in is that um
 

4681
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:53,990
when your evolution comes in is that um
what's the best way to combine

4682
01:16:53,990 --> 01:16:54,000
what's the best way to combine
 

4683
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,550
what's the best way to combine
these tasks now there's architectural

4684
01:16:56,550 --> 01:16:56,560
these tasks now there's architectural
 

4685
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,950
these tasks now there's architectural
design that allow you to decide where

4686
01:16:58,950 --> 01:16:58,960
design that allow you to decide where
 

4687
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,669
design that allow you to decide where
and how the the embeddings the internal

4688
01:17:01,669 --> 01:17:01,679
and how the the embeddings the internal
 

4689
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:03,270
and how the the embeddings the internal
representations are combined

4690
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:03,280
representations are combined
 

4691
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:06,229
representations are combined
and how much you combine uh them uh and

4692
01:17:06,229 --> 01:17:06,239
and how much you combine uh them uh and
 

4693
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:06,550
and how much you combine uh them uh and
uh

4694
01:17:06,550 --> 01:17:06,560
uh
 

4695
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:07,910
uh
there's quite a bit of research on that

4696
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:07,920
there's quite a bit of research on that
 

4697
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:10,149
there's quite a bit of research on that
and and my team eliot madison has worked

4698
01:17:10,149 --> 01:17:10,159
and and my team eliot madison has worked
 

4699
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:10,790
and and my team eliot madison has worked
on that

4700
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:10,800
on that
 

4701
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,110
on that
um in particular like what is a good

4702
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
um in particular like what is a good
 

4703
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:14,709
um in particular like what is a good
internal representation

4704
01:17:14,709 --> 01:17:14,719
internal representation
 

4705
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:17,430
internal representation
that supports multiple tasks uh and

4706
01:17:17,430 --> 01:17:17,440
that supports multiple tasks uh and
 

4707
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:17,830
that supports multiple tasks uh and
we're

4708
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:17,840
we're
 

4709
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,750
we're
getting to understand how that's

4710
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
getting to understand how that's
 

4711
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,750
getting to understand how that's
constructed and what's in it

4712
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:21,760
constructed and what's in it
 

4713
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:24,229
constructed and what's in it
uh so that it is in a space that

4714
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
uh so that it is in a space that
 

4715
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:25,430
uh so that it is in a space that
supports multiple

4716
01:17:25,430 --> 01:17:25,440
supports multiple
 

4717
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,630
supports multiple
different heads like you said um and

4718
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
different heads like you said um and
 

4719
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,830
different heads like you said um and
and that i think is fundamentally how

4720
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
and that i think is fundamentally how
 

4721
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,070
and that i think is fundamentally how
biological intelligence works as well

4722
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
biological intelligence works as well
 

4723
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:37,110
biological intelligence works as well
uh you don't build a representation just

4724
01:17:37,110 --> 01:17:37,120
uh you don't build a representation just
 

4725
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:39,030
uh you don't build a representation just
for one task you try to build something

4726
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:39,040
for one task you try to build something
 

4727
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:39,990
for one task you try to build something
that's general

4728
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,000
that's general
 

4729
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,669
that's general
not only so that you can do better in

4730
01:17:41,669 --> 01:17:41,679
not only so that you can do better in
 

4731
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:44,229
not only so that you can do better in
one task or multiple tasks but also

4732
01:17:44,229 --> 01:17:44,239
one task or multiple tasks but also
 

4733
01:17:44,239 --> 01:17:46,229
one task or multiple tasks but also
future tasks and future challenges

4734
01:17:46,229 --> 01:17:46,239
future tasks and future challenges
 

4735
01:17:46,239 --> 01:17:48,550
future tasks and future challenges
so you learn to learn the structure of

4736
01:17:48,550 --> 01:17:48,560
so you learn to learn the structure of
 

4737
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,510
so you learn to learn the structure of
of the world

4738
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:49,520
of the world
 

4739
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:52,470
of the world
um and and that helps you uh in all

4740
01:17:52,470 --> 01:17:52,480
um and and that helps you uh in all
 

4741
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,229
um and and that helps you uh in all
kinds of future future challenges and so

4742
01:17:54,229 --> 01:17:54,239
kinds of future future challenges and so
 

4743
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,990
kinds of future future challenges and so
you're trying to design a representation

4744
01:17:55,990 --> 01:17:56,000
you're trying to design a representation
 

4745
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,950
you're trying to design a representation
that will support

4746
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:56,960
that will support
 

4747
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,550
that will support
an arbitrary set of tasks in a

4748
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:58,560
an arbitrary set of tasks in a
 

4749
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,950
an arbitrary set of tasks in a
particular sort of class of problem

4750
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
particular sort of class of problem
 

4751
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:03,110
particular sort of class of problem
yeah and and also it turns out and

4752
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,120
yeah and and also it turns out and
 

4753
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,270
yeah and and also it turns out and
that's again a surprise that elliot

4754
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
that's again a surprise that elliot
 

4755
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:05,910
that's again a surprise that elliot
found

4756
01:18:05,910 --> 01:18:05,920
found
 

4757
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,790
found
was that those tasks don't have to be

4758
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
was that those tasks don't have to be
 

4759
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,310
was that those tasks don't have to be
very related

4760
01:18:10,310 --> 01:18:10,320
very related
 

4761
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:11,910
very related
you know you can learn to do better

4762
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:11,920
you know you can learn to do better
 

4763
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,070
you know you can learn to do better
vision by learning language

4764
01:18:14,070 --> 01:18:14,080
vision by learning language
 

4765
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,390
vision by learning language
or better language by learning about dna

4766
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,400
or better language by learning about dna
 

4767
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,830
or better language by learning about dna
structure

4768
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:17,840
structure
 

4769
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:21,110
structure
no somehow the world

4770
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
no somehow the world
 

4771
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,790
no somehow the world
yeah it rhymes the world rhymes even

4772
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:24,800
yeah it rhymes the world rhymes even
 

4773
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:26,630
yeah it rhymes the world rhymes even
it's very uh

4774
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:26,640
it's very uh
 

4775
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,750
it's very uh
very desperate fields um i mean

4776
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760
very desperate fields um i mean
 

4777
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,350
very desperate fields um i mean
on that small topic let me ask you

4778
01:18:31,350 --> 01:18:31,360
on that small topic let me ask you
 

4779
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:32,870
on that small topic let me ask you
because you've also on the competition

4780
01:18:32,870 --> 01:18:32,880
because you've also on the competition
 

4781
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:36,149
because you've also on the competition
your science side

4782
01:18:36,149 --> 01:18:36,159

 

4783
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:41,350

you worked on both language and vision

4784
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:41,360
you worked on both language and vision
 

4785
01:18:41,360 --> 01:18:43,430
you worked on both language and vision
what's what's the connection between the

4786
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,440
what's what's the connection between the
 

4787
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,470
what's what's the connection between the
two uh

4788
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:44,480
two uh
 

4789
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:45,990
two uh
what's more maybe there's a bunch of

4790
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:46,000
what's more maybe there's a bunch of
 

4791
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:47,350
what's more maybe there's a bunch of
ways to ask this but what's more

4792
01:18:47,350 --> 01:18:47,360
ways to ask this but what's more
 

4793
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:47,990
ways to ask this but what's more
difficult

4794
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
difficult
 

4795
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,470
difficult
to build from an engineering perspective

4796
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
to build from an engineering perspective
 

4797
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,229
to build from an engineering perspective
an evolutionary perspective

4798
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
an evolutionary perspective
 

4799
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,270
an evolutionary perspective
the human language system or the human

4800
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
the human language system or the human
 

4801
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,470
the human language system or the human
vision system or

4802
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,480
vision system or
 

4803
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,189
vision system or
the equivalent of in the ai space

4804
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
the equivalent of in the ai space
 

4805
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:00,550
the equivalent of in the ai space
language and vision

4806
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:00,560
language and vision
 

4807
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,270
language and vision
or is it the the best is the multi-task

4808
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
or is it the the best is the multi-task
 

4809
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,070
or is it the the best is the multi-task
idea that you're

4810
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:04,080
idea that you're
 

4811
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:05,990
idea that you're
speaking to that they they need to be

4812
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:06,000
speaking to that they they need to be
 

4813
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,350
speaking to that they they need to be
deeply integrated

4814
01:19:07,350 --> 01:19:07,360
deeply integrated
 

4815
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,870
deeply integrated
yeah absolutely learning both at the

4816
01:19:10,870 --> 01:19:10,880
yeah absolutely learning both at the
 

4817
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:11,510
yeah absolutely learning both at the
same time

4818
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:11,520
same time
 

4819
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:14,229
same time
i i think is a fascinating direction in

4820
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:14,239
i i think is a fascinating direction in
 

4821
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,070
i i think is a fascinating direction in
that in the future so you have data sets

4822
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:16,080
that in the future so you have data sets
 

4823
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,750
that in the future so you have data sets
where there's visual component as well

4824
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:17,760
where there's visual component as well
 

4825
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,390
where there's visual component as well
as

4826
01:19:18,390 --> 01:19:18,400
as
 

4827
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,310
as
verbal descriptions for instance and and

4828
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:20,320
verbal descriptions for instance and and
 

4829
01:19:20,320 --> 01:19:21,510
verbal descriptions for instance and and
that way you can learn

4830
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
that way you can learn
 

4831
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,350
that way you can learn
a deeper representation a more useful

4832
01:19:23,350 --> 01:19:23,360
a deeper representation a more useful
 

4833
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:24,950
a deeper representation a more useful
representation for both

4834
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
representation for both
 

4835
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,149
representation for both
uh but it's still an interesting

4836
01:19:26,149 --> 01:19:26,159
uh but it's still an interesting
 

4837
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:28,310
uh but it's still an interesting
question of um

4838
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:28,320
question of um
 

4839
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:29,910
question of um
which one is easier eventually i mean

4840
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:29,920
which one is easier eventually i mean
 

4841
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:31,430
which one is easier eventually i mean
recognizing objects or

4842
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:31,440
recognizing objects or
 

4843
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:33,910
recognizing objects or
even understanding sentences that's

4844
01:19:33,910 --> 01:19:33,920
even understanding sentences that's
 

4845
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:35,750
even understanding sentences that's
relatively possible

4846
01:19:35,750 --> 01:19:35,760
relatively possible
 

4847
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,030
relatively possible
but where it becomes where the

4848
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:37,040
but where it becomes where the
 

4849
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,950
but where it becomes where the
challenges are is to understand the

4850
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:38,960
challenges are is to understand the
 

4851
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:39,750
challenges are is to understand the
world

4852
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
world
 

4853
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:42,709
world
like the visual world the 3d uh what are

4854
01:19:42,709 --> 01:19:42,719
like the visual world the 3d uh what are
 

4855
01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:44,310
like the visual world the 3d uh what are
the objects doing and predicting what

4856
01:19:44,310 --> 01:19:44,320
the objects doing and predicting what
 

4857
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:45,189
the objects doing and predicting what
will happen

4858
01:19:45,189 --> 01:19:45,199
will happen
 

4859
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:47,270
will happen
uh the relationships that's what makes

4860
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:47,280
uh the relationships that's what makes
 

4861
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,189
uh the relationships that's what makes
vision difficult and language obviously

4862
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:49,199
vision difficult and language obviously
 

4863
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:50,950
vision difficult and language obviously
it's it's what's the mean what what is

4864
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:50,960
it's it's what's the mean what what is
 

4865
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,630
it's it's what's the mean what what is
being said what the meaning is

4866
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:52,640
being said what the meaning is
 

4867
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:55,830
being said what the meaning is
and the meaning doesn't stop at who did

4868
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,840
and the meaning doesn't stop at who did
 

4869
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,790
and the meaning doesn't stop at who did
what to whom

4870
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:56,800
what to whom
 

4871
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,669
what to whom
um there are goals and plans and themes

4872
01:19:59,669 --> 01:19:59,679
um there are goals and plans and themes
 

4873
01:19:59,679 --> 01:19:59,990
um there are goals and plans and themes
and

4874
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,000
and
 

4875
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,750
and
you eventually have to understand the

4876
01:20:01,750 --> 01:20:01,760
you eventually have to understand the
 

4877
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:04,550
you eventually have to understand the
entire uh human society and history

4878
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:04,560
entire uh human society and history
 

4879
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:06,550
entire uh human society and history
in order to understand the sentence very

4880
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:06,560
in order to understand the sentence very
 

4881
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,990
in order to understand the sentence very
much fully that

4882
01:20:07,990 --> 01:20:08,000
much fully that
 

4883
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,669
much fully that
there are plenty of examples of those

4884
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:09,679
there are plenty of examples of those
 

4885
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,270
there are plenty of examples of those
kind of short sentences when you bring

4886
01:20:11,270 --> 01:20:11,280
kind of short sentences when you bring
 

4887
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,790
kind of short sentences when you bring
in all the world knowledge

4888
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:12,800
in all the world knowledge
 

4889
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,870
in all the world knowledge
uh to understand it uh and that's the

4890
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
uh to understand it uh and that's the
 

4891
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:15,830
uh to understand it uh and that's the
big challenge

4892
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
big challenge
 

4893
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:18,390
big challenge
now we are far from that but even just

4894
01:20:18,390 --> 01:20:18,400
now we are far from that but even just
 

4895
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,229
now we are far from that but even just
bringing in the visual world

4896
01:20:20,229 --> 01:20:20,239
bringing in the visual world
 

4897
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:22,550
bringing in the visual world
uh together with the sentence will give

4898
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
uh together with the sentence will give
 

4899
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:23,590
uh together with the sentence will give
you

4900
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:23,600
you
 

4901
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,830
you
already a lot deeper understanding of

4902
01:20:25,830 --> 01:20:25,840
already a lot deeper understanding of
 

4903
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:26,709
already a lot deeper understanding of
what's happening

4904
01:20:26,709 --> 01:20:26,719
what's happening
 

4905
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:28,229
what's happening
and i think that that's where we're

4906
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:28,239
and i think that that's where we're
 

4907
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:30,070
and i think that that's where we're
going very soon i mean

4908
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:30,080
going very soon i mean
 

4909
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:32,870
going very soon i mean
we've we've had imagenet for a long time

4910
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:32,880
we've we've had imagenet for a long time
 

4911
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:33,990
we've we've had imagenet for a long time
and now we have

4912
01:20:33,990 --> 01:20:34,000
and now we have
 

4913
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:36,390
and now we have
all these uh text collections but having

4914
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:36,400
all these uh text collections but having
 

4915
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:37,669
all these uh text collections but having
both together

4916
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
both together
 

4917
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:40,950
both together
uh and then learning a semantic

4918
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:40,960
uh and then learning a semantic
 

4919
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,629
uh and then learning a semantic
understanding of what is happening

4920
01:20:42,629 --> 01:20:42,639
understanding of what is happening
 

4921
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,470
understanding of what is happening
i think that that will be the next step

4922
01:20:44,470 --> 01:20:44,480
i think that that will be the next step
 

4923
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,510
i think that that will be the next step
in the next few years yeah you're

4924
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:45,520
in the next few years yeah you're
 

4925
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,470
in the next few years yeah you're
starting to see that with

4926
01:20:46,470 --> 01:20:46,480
starting to see that with
 

4927
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,950
starting to see that with
all the work with transformers was the

4928
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:48,960
all the work with transformers was the
 

4929
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:49,910
all the work with transformers was the
the community

4930
01:20:49,910 --> 01:20:49,920
the community
 

4931
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,510
the community
the ai community started to dip their

4932
01:20:51,510 --> 01:20:51,520
the ai community started to dip their
 

4933
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:54,550
the ai community started to dip their
toe into this idea idea of

4934
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:54,560
toe into this idea idea of
 

4935
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,629
toe into this idea idea of
having uh language models that are now

4936
01:20:58,629 --> 01:20:58,639
having uh language models that are now
 

4937
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:01,350
having uh language models that are now
doing stuff with images with vision and

4938
01:21:01,350 --> 01:21:01,360
doing stuff with images with vision and
 

4939
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:02,709
doing stuff with images with vision and
then

4940
01:21:02,709 --> 01:21:02,719
then
 

4941
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:04,470
then
connecting the two i mean right now it's

4942
01:21:04,470 --> 01:21:04,480
connecting the two i mean right now it's
 

4943
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:05,910
connecting the two i mean right now it's
like these little explorations we're

4944
01:21:05,910 --> 01:21:05,920
like these little explorations we're
 

4945
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,669
like these little explorations we're
literally dipping the toe in

4946
01:21:07,669 --> 01:21:07,679
literally dipping the toe in
 

4947
01:21:07,679 --> 01:21:09,990
literally dipping the toe in
but like maybe at some point we'll just

4948
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:10,000
but like maybe at some point we'll just
 

4949
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,590
but like maybe at some point we'll just
like dive into the pool

4950
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
like dive into the pool
 

4951
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,189
like dive into the pool
and it'll just be all seen as the same

4952
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:13,199
and it'll just be all seen as the same
 

4953
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,510
and it'll just be all seen as the same
thing i i do still wonder what's more

4954
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:15,520
thing i i do still wonder what's more
 

4955
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,709
thing i i do still wonder what's more
fundamental

4956
01:21:16,709 --> 01:21:16,719
fundamental
 

4957
01:21:16,719 --> 01:21:20,790
fundamental
well their vision is um whether we

4958
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
well their vision is um whether we
 

4959
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:23,430
well their vision is um whether we
don't think about vision correctly maybe

4960
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:23,440
don't think about vision correctly maybe
 

4961
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:24,950
don't think about vision correctly maybe
the fact because we're humans and we see

4962
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:24,960
the fact because we're humans and we see
 

4963
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:27,510
the fact because we're humans and we see
things as beautiful and so on

4964
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:27,520
things as beautiful and so on
 

4965
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:29,990
things as beautiful and so on
that and because we have cameras that

4966
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,000
that and because we have cameras that
 

4967
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,310
that and because we have cameras that
taking pixels is a 2d

4968
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:32,320
taking pixels is a 2d
 

4969
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,669
taking pixels is a 2d
image that we don't sufficiently think

4970
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:35,679
image that we don't sufficiently think
 

4971
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:36,149
image that we don't sufficiently think
about

4972
01:21:36,149 --> 01:21:36,159
about
 

4973
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:39,350
about
vision as language you know maybe

4974
01:21:39,350 --> 01:21:39,360
vision as language you know maybe
 

4975
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:41,830
vision as language you know maybe
maybe chomsky is right all along that

4976
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:41,840
maybe chomsky is right all along that
 

4977
01:21:41,840 --> 01:21:43,510
maybe chomsky is right all along that
vision is fundamental to

4978
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:43,520
vision is fundamental to
 

4979
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,590
vision is fundamental to
uh sorry that language is fundamental to

4980
01:21:45,590 --> 01:21:45,600
uh sorry that language is fundamental to
 

4981
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,629
uh sorry that language is fundamental to
everything

4982
01:21:46,629 --> 01:21:46,639
everything
 

4983
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:48,709
everything
to even cognition to even consciousness

4984
01:21:48,709 --> 01:21:48,719
to even cognition to even consciousness
 

4985
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,550
to even cognition to even consciousness
like the base layer is all

4986
01:21:50,550 --> 01:21:50,560
like the base layer is all
 

4987
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,950
like the base layer is all
language not necessarily like english

4988
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:52,960
language not necessarily like english
 

4989
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:53,830
language not necessarily like english
but some

4990
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
but some
 

4991
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,270
but some
weird abstract representation uh the

4992
01:21:57,270 --> 01:21:57,280
weird abstract representation uh the
 

4993
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,270
weird abstract representation uh the
linguistic representation

4994
01:21:59,270 --> 01:21:59,280
linguistic representation
 

4995
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,590
linguistic representation
yeah well earlier we talked about the

4996
01:22:01,590 --> 01:22:01,600
yeah well earlier we talked about the
 

4997
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,430
yeah well earlier we talked about the
social structures and that may be what's

4998
01:22:03,430 --> 01:22:03,440
social structures and that may be what's
 

4999
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:04,470
social structures and that may be what's
underlying

5000
01:22:04,470 --> 01:22:04,480
underlying
 

5001
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,830
underlying
the language and that's the more

5002
01:22:05,830 --> 01:22:05,840
the language and that's the more
 

5003
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,510
the language and that's the more
fundamental part and then language has

5004
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:07,520
fundamental part and then language has
 

5005
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,030
fundamental part and then language has
been added on top of that language

5006
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:09,040
been added on top of that language
 

5007
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:09,990
been added on top of that language
emerges from the social

5008
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:10,000
emerges from the social
 

5009
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,830
emerges from the social
interaction probably yeah that's a very

5010
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:11,840
interaction probably yeah that's a very
 

5011
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,910
interaction probably yeah that's a very
good guess um

5012
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
good guess um
 

5013
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,750
good guess um
via visual animals though a lot of the

5014
01:22:15,750 --> 01:22:15,760
via visual animals though a lot of the
 

5015
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,750
via visual animals though a lot of the
brain is dedicated to vision and

5016
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:17,760
brain is dedicated to vision and
 

5017
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:20,550
brain is dedicated to vision and
and also when we think about various

5018
01:22:20,550 --> 01:22:20,560
and also when we think about various
 

5019
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:21,189
and also when we think about various
abstract

5020
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
abstract
 

5021
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:24,310
abstract
concepts uh we usually reduce that to

5022
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:24,320
concepts uh we usually reduce that to
 

5023
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:25,030
concepts uh we usually reduce that to
vision

5024
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,040
vision
 

5025
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:28,550
vision
uh and and images and that's

5026
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:28,560
uh and and images and that's
 

5027
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,390
uh and and images and that's
you know go to a whiteboard you draw

5028
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:30,400
you know go to a whiteboard you draw
 

5029
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,030
you know go to a whiteboard you draw
pictures of very abstract concepts

5030
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:33,040
pictures of very abstract concepts
 

5031
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,270
pictures of very abstract concepts
so we tend to tend to resort to that

5032
01:22:35,270 --> 01:22:35,280
so we tend to tend to resort to that
 

5033
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,870
so we tend to tend to resort to that
quite a bit and that's a fundamental

5034
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
quite a bit and that's a fundamental
 

5035
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,709
quite a bit and that's a fundamental
representation it's probably

5036
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
representation it's probably
 

5037
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,950
representation it's probably
possible that it predated um you know

5038
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:40,960
possible that it predated um you know
 

5039
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:41,990
possible that it predated um you know
language even i mean

5040
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
language even i mean
 

5041
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,990
language even i mean
animals a lot of they don't talk but

5042
01:22:43,990 --> 01:22:44,000
animals a lot of they don't talk but
 

5043
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,149
animals a lot of they don't talk but
they certainly do have vision

5044
01:22:46,149 --> 01:22:46,159
they certainly do have vision
 

5045
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:49,590
they certainly do have vision
uh and and language is interesting

5046
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:49,600
uh and and language is interesting
 

5047
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:52,790
uh and and language is interesting
development in um from for mastication

5048
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:52,800
development in um from for mastication
 

5049
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,669
development in um from for mastication
from eating

5050
01:22:53,669 --> 01:22:53,679
from eating
 

5051
01:22:53,679 --> 01:22:55,910
from eating
you develop an organ that actually can

5052
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:55,920
you develop an organ that actually can
 

5053
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,709
you develop an organ that actually can
produce sound to manipulate them

5054
01:22:58,709 --> 01:22:58,719
produce sound to manipulate them
 

5055
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:00,070
produce sound to manipulate them
maybe that was an accident maybe that

5056
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:00,080
maybe that was an accident maybe that
 

5057
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:02,149
maybe that was an accident maybe that
was something that was available and

5058
01:23:02,149 --> 01:23:02,159
was something that was available and
 

5059
01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:05,030
was something that was available and
and then allowed us to to do that

5060
01:23:05,030 --> 01:23:05,040
and then allowed us to to do that
 

5061
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:06,310
and then allowed us to to do that
communication or maybe it was

5062
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:06,320
communication or maybe it was
 

5063
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,470
communication or maybe it was
gestures sign language could have been

5064
01:23:08,470 --> 01:23:08,480
gestures sign language could have been
 

5065
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,470
gestures sign language could have been
the original proto-language

5066
01:23:10,470 --> 01:23:10,480
the original proto-language
 

5067
01:23:10,480 --> 01:23:12,470
the original proto-language
we don't quite know but they're the

5068
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:12,480
we don't quite know but they're the
 

5069
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,070
we don't quite know but they're the
language is more fundamental than the

5070
01:23:14,070 --> 01:23:14,080
language is more fundamental than the
 

5071
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:14,870
language is more fundamental than the

5072
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:14,880
medium
 

5073
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:17,590
medium
in which it's uh communicated and i

5074
01:23:17,590 --> 01:23:17,600
in which it's uh communicated and i
 

5075
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:18,830
in which it's uh communicated and i
think that it comes from those

5076
01:23:18,830 --> 01:23:18,840
think that it comes from those
 

5077
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,510
think that it comes from those

5087
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:30,709
fundamental
you look at the brain structures and

5088
01:23:30,709 --> 01:23:30,719
you look at the brain structures and
 

5089
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:32,629
you look at the brain structures and
even visual cortex

5090
01:23:32,629 --> 01:23:32,639
even visual cortex
 

5091
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,390
even visual cortex
which supposed to be very much just

vision well if you are
thinking of semantic concepts you're

5096
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:38,080
thinking of semantic concepts you're
 

5097
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:40,149
thinking of semantic concepts you're
thinking of language visual cortex

it's still useful even for language

5102
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
it's still useful even for language
 

5103
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:44,470
it's still useful even for language
computations

5104
01:23:44,470 --> 01:23:44,480
computations
 

5105
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:46,229
computations
so there are common structures

5106
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:46,239
so there are common structures
 

5107
01:23:46,239 --> 01:23:48,709
so there are common structures
underlying them so utilize what you need

5108
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:48,719
underlying them so utilize what you need
 

5109
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:50,629
underlying them so utilize what you need
yeah and and when you are understanding

5110
01:23:50,629 --> 01:23:50,639
yeah and and when you are understanding
 

5111
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:51,990
yeah and and when you are understanding
a scene you're understanding

5112
01:23:51,990 --> 01:23:52,000
a scene you're understanding
 

5113
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,030
a scene you're understanding
relationships

5114
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:53,040
relationships
 

5115
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:54,790
relationships
well it's not so far from understanding

5116
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:54,800
well it's not so far from understanding
 

5117
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,709
well it's not so far from understanding
relationships between words and concepts

5118
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:56,719
relationships between words and concepts
 

5119
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,149
relationships between words and concepts
so i think that that's how they are

5120
01:23:58,149 --> 01:23:58,159
so i think that that's how they are
 

5121
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,189
so i think that that's how they are
integrated yeah and there's dreams and

5122
01:24:01,189 --> 01:24:01,199
integrated yeah and there's dreams and
 

5123
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:02,790
integrated yeah and there's dreams and
wants to close our eyes there's still a

01:24:02,790 --> 01:24:02,800
wants to close our eyes there's still a
 

5125
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:04,470
wants to close our eyes there's still a
world in there somehow operating and

5126
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:04,480

scientist and and
 

5243
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,270
scientist and and
trying to build intelligent agents

5244
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:11,280
trying to build intelligent agents
 

5245
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,590
trying to build intelligent agents
what i would like to do is have a

5246
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,600
what i would like to do is have a
 

5247
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:14,470
what i would like to do is have a
simulation

5248
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:14,480
simulation
 

5249
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:17,669
simulation
where the agents actually evolve

5250
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:17,679
where the agents actually evolve
 

5251
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,189
where the agents actually evolve
communication not just communication

5252
01:26:19,189 --> 01:26:19,199
communication not just communication
 

5253
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:19,830
communication not just communication
we've done that

5254
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:19,840
we've done that
 

5255
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,430
we've done that
people have done that many times they

5256
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
people have done that many times they
 

5257
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,950
people have done that many times they
communicate they signal

5258
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:22,960
communicate they signal
 

5259
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,110
communicate they signal
and so on but actually develop a

5260
01:26:25,110 --> 01:26:25,120
and so on but actually develop a
 

5261
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,270
and so on but actually develop a
language and language means grammar it

5262
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:27,280
language and language means grammar it
 

5263
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:27,910
language and language means grammar it
means all these

5264
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
means all these
 

5265
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,669
means all these
social structures and on top of that

5266
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
social structures and on top of that
 

5267
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,830
social structures and on top of that
grammatical structures

5268
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:31,840
grammatical structures
 

5269
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:35,830
grammatical structures
and we do it in under various conditions

5270
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:35,840
and we do it in under various conditions
 

5271
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:37,189
and we do it in under various conditions
and actually try to identify what

5272
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:37,199
and actually try to identify what
 

5273
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,350
and actually try to identify what
conditions are necessary for it to

5274
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:39,360
conditions are necessary for it to
 

5275
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:42,470
conditions are necessary for it to
come out and then we can start asking

5276
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:42,480
come out and then we can start asking
 

5277
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:44,149
come out and then we can start asking
that kind of questions

5278
01:26:44,149 --> 01:26:44,159
that kind of questions
 

5279
01:26:44,159 --> 01:26:46,629
that kind of questions
are those languages that emerge in that

5280
01:26:46,629 --> 01:26:46,639
are those languages that emerge in that
 

5281
01:26:46,639 --> 01:26:48,790
are those languages that emerge in that
those different simulated environments

5282
01:26:48,790 --> 01:26:48,800
those different simulated environments
 

5283
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:51,270
those different simulated environments
are they understandable to us can we

5284
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:51,280
are they understandable to us can we
 

5285
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,350
are they understandable to us can we
somehow make a translation

5286
01:26:53,350 --> 01:26:53,360
somehow make a translation
 

5287
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,390
somehow make a translation
we can make it a concrete question so

5288
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:56,400
we can make it a concrete question so
 

5289
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,870
we can make it a concrete question so
machine translation of evolved languages

5290
01:26:58,870 --> 01:26:58,880
machine translation of evolved languages
 

5291
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,750
machine translation of evolved languages
and so like

5292
01:26:59,750 --> 01:26:59,760
and so like
 

5293
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:02,070
and so like
languages that evolve come up with can

5294
01:27:02,070 --> 01:27:02,080
languages that evolve come up with can
 

5295
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:03,270
languages that evolve come up with can
we translate

5296
01:27:03,270 --> 01:27:03,280
we translate
 

5297
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:05,350
we translate
like i have a google translate for the

5298
01:27:05,350 --> 01:27:05,360
like i have a google translate for the
 

5299
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:07,110
like i have a google translate for the
evolved languages

5300
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:07,120
evolved languages
 

5301
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:10,390
evolved languages
yes and if we do that enough we have

5302
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:10,400
yes and if we do that enough we have
 

5303
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:13,590
yes and if we do that enough we have
perhaps an idea what an alien

5304
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:13,600
perhaps an idea what an alien
 

5305
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,430
perhaps an idea what an alien
language might be like the space or

5306
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:15,440
language might be like the space or
 

5307
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,030
language might be like the space or
where those languages can be

5308
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
where those languages can be
 

5309
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,709
where those languages can be
because we can set up their environment

5310
01:27:18,709 --> 01:27:18,719
because we can set up their environment
 

5311
01:27:18,719 --> 01:27:20,550
because we can set up their environment
differently there doesn't need to be

5312
01:27:20,550 --> 01:27:20,560
differently there doesn't need to be
 

5313
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:21,270
differently there doesn't need to be
gravity

5314
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:21,280
gravity
 

5315
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:23,110
gravity
you know you can you can have all kinds

5316
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,120
you know you can you can have all kinds
 

5317
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,270
you know you can you can have all kinds
of societies can be different they may

5318
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:25,280
of societies can be different they may
 

5319
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,430
of societies can be different they may
have no predators they may have all

5320
01:27:27,430 --> 01:27:27,440
have no predators they may have all
 

5321
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:28,470
have no predators they may have all
everybody is a predator

5322
01:27:28,470 --> 01:27:28,480
everybody is a predator
 

5323
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:31,189
everybody is a predator
all kinds of situations and and then see

5324
01:27:31,189 --> 01:27:31,199
all kinds of situations and and then see
 

5325
01:27:31,199 --> 01:27:31,750
all kinds of situations and and then see
what the

5326
01:27:31,750 --> 01:27:31,760
what the
 

5327
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,669
what the
space possibly is where those languages

5328
01:27:33,669 --> 01:27:33,679
space possibly is where those languages
 

5329
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:35,750
space possibly is where those languages
are and what the difficulties are

5330
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:35,760
are and what the difficulties are
 

5331
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,430
are and what the difficulties are
they'll be really good actually to do

5332
01:27:37,430 --> 01:27:37,440
they'll be really good actually to do
 

5333
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:39,430
they'll be really good actually to do
that before the aliens come here

5334
01:27:39,430 --> 01:27:39,440
that before the aliens come here
 

5335
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,229
that before the aliens come here
yes it's good practice yeah uh on the

5336
01:27:42,229 --> 01:27:42,239
yes it's good practice yeah uh on the
 

5337
01:27:42,239 --> 01:27:43,110
yes it's good practice yeah uh on the
similar

5338
01:27:43,110 --> 01:27:43,120
similar
 

5339
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:46,229
similar
connection you know you can think of ai

5340
01:27:46,229 --> 01:27:46,239
connection you know you can think of ai
 

5341
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:46,950
connection you know you can think of ai
systems as

5342
01:27:46,950 --> 01:27:46,960
systems as
 

5343
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:50,310
systems as
aliens is there uh ways to evolve a

5344
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:50,320
aliens is there uh ways to evolve a
 

5345
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,510
aliens is there uh ways to evolve a
communication scheme

5346
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:51,520
communication scheme
 

5347
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:53,350
communication scheme
for there's a field you can call like

5348
01:27:53,350 --> 01:27:53,360
for there's a field you can call like
 

5349
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:55,030
for there's a field you can call like
explainable ai

5350
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:55,040
explainable ai
 

5351
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,870
explainable ai
for ai systems to be able to communicate

5352
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
for ai systems to be able to communicate
 

5353
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,550
for ai systems to be able to communicate
so you have a but you evolve a bunch of

5354
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
so you have a but you evolve a bunch of
 

5355
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:01,910
so you have a but you evolve a bunch of
agents but

5356
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
agents but
 

5357
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,510
agents but
for some of them to be able to talk to

5358
01:28:03,510 --> 01:28:03,520
for some of them to be able to talk to
 

5359
01:28:03,520 --> 01:28:05,350
for some of them to be able to talk to
you yeah also

5360
01:28:05,350 --> 01:28:05,360
you yeah also
 

5361
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,510
you yeah also
so to evolve a way for agents to be able

5362
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:07,520
so to evolve a way for agents to be able
 

5363
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,470
so to evolve a way for agents to be able
to communicate

5364
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:08,480
to communicate
 

5365
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,270
to communicate
about their world to us humans do you

5366
01:28:11,270 --> 01:28:11,280
about their world to us humans do you
 

5367
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:12,310
about their world to us humans do you
think that there's

5368
01:28:12,310 --> 01:28:12,320
think that there's
 

5369
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:14,870
think that there's
possible mechanisms for doing that we

5370
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:14,880
possible mechanisms for doing that we
 

5371
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,229
possible mechanisms for doing that we
can certainly try

5372
01:28:16,229 --> 01:28:16,239
can certainly try
 

5373
01:28:16,239 --> 01:28:19,830
can certainly try
and if we um if it's an evidence

5374
01:28:19,830 --> 01:28:19,840
and if we um if it's an evidence
 

5375
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,030
and if we um if it's an evidence
competition system for instance you

5376
01:28:21,030 --> 01:28:21,040
competition system for instance you
 

5377
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:21,750
competition system for instance you
reward

5378
01:28:21,750 --> 01:28:21,760
reward
 

5379
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,189
reward
those solutions that are actually

5380
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:23,199
those solutions that are actually
 

5381
01:28:23,199 --> 01:28:25,189
those solutions that are actually
functional that that communication makes

5382
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:25,199
functional that that communication makes
 

5383
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,709
functional that that communication makes
sense it allows us to

5384
01:28:26,709 --> 01:28:26,719
sense it allows us to
 

5385
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:29,430
sense it allows us to
together again achieve common goals i

5386
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:29,440
together again achieve common goals i
 

5387
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,790
together again achieve common goals i
think it's possible

5388
01:28:30,790 --> 01:28:30,800
think it's possible
 

5389
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,629
think it's possible
but even from that um paper that you

5390
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:34,639
but even from that um paper that you
 

5391
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:37,030
but even from that um paper that you
mentioned the the anecdotes it's quite

5392
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:37,040
mentioned the the anecdotes it's quite
 

5393
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:38,390
mentioned the the anecdotes it's quite
likely also that the

5394
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:38,400
likely also that the
 

5395
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,790
likely also that the
uh the agents learn to you know lie

5396
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:42,800
uh the agents learn to you know lie
 

5397
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,629
uh the agents learn to you know lie
and fake and do all kinds of things like

5398
01:28:44,629 --> 01:28:44,639
and fake and do all kinds of things like
 

5399
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:46,470
and fake and do all kinds of things like
that yes i mean we see that in in

5400
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
that yes i mean we see that in in
 

5401
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,310
that yes i mean we see that in in
even very low level like bacterial

5402
01:28:48,310 --> 01:28:48,320
even very low level like bacterial
 

5403
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:51,110
even very low level like bacterial
evolution there are there are cheaters

5404
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,120
evolution there are there are cheaters
 

5405
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,830
evolution there are there are cheaters
um and who's to say that what they say

5406
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:53,840
um and who's to say that what they say
 

5407
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:55,430
um and who's to say that what they say
is actually what they think

5408
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:55,440
is actually what they think
 

5409
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:57,590
is actually what they think
it um but but that's what i'm saying

5410
01:28:57,590 --> 01:28:57,600
it um but but that's what i'm saying
 

5411
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,070
it um but but that's what i'm saying
that there would have to be some common

5412
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,080
that there would have to be some common
 

5413
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:00,790
that there would have to be some common
goal

5414
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:00,800
goal
 

5415
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,149
goal
so that we can evaluate whether that

5416
01:29:02,149 --> 01:29:02,159
so that we can evaluate whether that
 

5417
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,229
so that we can evaluate whether that
communication is at least useful

5418
01:29:04,229 --> 01:29:04,239
communication is at least useful
 

5419
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,950
communication is at least useful
um you know they may be saying things

5420
01:29:06,950 --> 01:29:06,960
um you know they may be saying things
 

5421
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:08,950
um you know they may be saying things
just to make us feel good

5422
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:08,960
just to make us feel good
 

5423
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,870
just to make us feel good
or or get us to do what we want whatever

5424
01:29:10,870 --> 01:29:10,880
or or get us to do what we want whatever
 

5425
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,310
or or get us to do what we want whatever
not turn them off or something

5426
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:12,320
not turn them off or something
 

5427
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:14,629
not turn them off or something
but but uh so we would have to

5428
01:29:14,629 --> 01:29:14,639
but but uh so we would have to
 

5429
01:29:14,639 --> 01:29:16,149
but but uh so we would have to
understand their internal representation

5430
01:29:16,149 --> 01:29:16,159
understand their internal representation
 

5431
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,430
understand their internal representation
is much better to really make sure that

5432
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:17,440
is much better to really make sure that
 

5433
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,550
is much better to really make sure that
that translation is

5434
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:18,560
that translation is
 

5435
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:21,510
that translation is
political um but it can be useful and i

5436
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:21,520
political um but it can be useful and i
 

5437
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:23,910
political um but it can be useful and i
think that it's possible to do that

5438
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:23,920
think that it's possible to do that
 

5439
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,030
think that it's possible to do that
there are examples where visualizations

5440
01:29:27,030 --> 01:29:27,040
there are examples where visualizations
 

5441
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:30,470
there are examples where visualizations
um are automatically created so that we

5442
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:30,480
um are automatically created so that we
 

5443
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:32,070
um are automatically created so that we
can look into the what

5444
01:29:32,070 --> 01:29:32,080
can look into the what
 

5445
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,030
can look into the what
the system uh and the language is not

5446
01:29:35,030 --> 01:29:35,040
the system uh and the language is not
 

5447
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:36,709
the system uh and the language is not
that far from it i mean it is a way of

5448
01:29:36,709 --> 01:29:36,719
that far from it i mean it is a way of
 

5449
01:29:36,719 --> 01:29:38,550
that far from it i mean it is a way of
communicating and logging

5450
01:29:38,550 --> 01:29:38,560
communicating and logging
 

5451
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,149

interpretable way
 

5455
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,709
interpretable way
um i think a fascinating topic yeah to

5456
01:29:44,709 --> 01:29:44,719
um i think a fascinating topic yeah to
 

5457
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:46,390
um i think a fascinating topic yeah to
do that

5458
01:29:46,390 --> 01:29:46,400
do that
 

5459
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,110
do that
yeah you're making me realize that it's

5460
01:29:49,110 --> 01:29:49,120
yeah you're making me realize that it's
 

5461
01:29:49,120 --> 01:29:51,030
yeah you're making me realize that it's
a good scientific question

5462
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,040
a good scientific question
 

5463
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:54,310
a good scientific question
whether lying is an effective mechanism

5464
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:54,320
whether lying is an effective mechanism
 

5465
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,510
whether lying is an effective mechanism

01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
agents but it's also very possible that

01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:48,400
highly constrained on resources it's
 

5513
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:50,390
highly constrained on resources it's
like people start getting weird and evil

5514
01:30:50,390 --> 01:30:50,400
like people start getting weird and evil

survival shelter uh food all those kinds

5526
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
survival shelter uh food all those kinds
 

5527
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:05,030
survival shelter uh food all those kinds
of things but um

5528
01:31:05,030 --> 01:31:05,040
of things but um
 

5529
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,430
of things but um
i i tend to believe that uh once you

5530
01:31:07,430 --> 01:31:07,440
i i tend to believe that uh once you
 

5531
01:31:07,440 --> 01:31:10,229
i i tend to believe that uh once you
have those things established then

5532
01:31:10,229 --> 01:31:10,239
have those things established then
 

5533
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,550
have those things established then
well not to believe i i guess i hope

5534
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:12,560
well not to believe i i guess i hope
 

5535
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,790
well not to believe i i guess i hope
that ai systems would be honest

5536
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:14,800
that ai systems would be honest
 

5537
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:17,910
that ai systems would be honest
but it's fun it's scary to think about

5538
01:31:17,910 --> 01:31:17,920
but it's fun it's scary to think about
 

5539
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:20,629
but it's fun it's scary to think about
the touring test you know ai systems

5540
01:31:20,629 --> 01:31:20,639
the touring test you know ai systems
 

5541
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:21,669
the touring test you know ai systems
that will

5542
01:31:21,669 --> 01:31:21,679
that will
 

5543
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:24,229
that will
eventually pass the touring test will be

5544
01:31:24,229 --> 01:31:24,239
eventually pass the touring test will be
 

5545
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:25,669
eventually pass the touring test will be

5567
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,629
there will be human level or superhuman
level intelligences in the future

5568
01:31:48,629 --> 01:31:48,639
level intelligences in the future
 

5569
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:52,149
level intelligences in the future
that we eventually build

5570
01:31:52,149 --> 01:31:52,159
that we eventually build
 

5571
01:31:52,159 --> 01:31:54,550
that we eventually build
well definitely hope that we can we can

5572
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:54,560
well definitely hope that we can we can
 

5573
01:31:54,560 --> 01:31:56,070
well definitely hope that we can we can
get there

5574
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:56,080
get there
 

5575
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,270
get there
one i think um important perspective is

5576
01:31:59,270 --> 01:31:59,280
one i think um important perspective is
 

5577
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,910
one i think um important perspective is
that we are building ai to help us

5578
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
that we are building ai to help us
 

5579
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,950
that we are building ai to help us
uh that it is a it is tool like cars or

5580
01:32:04,950 --> 01:32:04,960
uh that it is a it is tool like cars or
 

5581
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,149
uh that it is a it is tool like cars or
or or language or

5582
01:32:08,149 --> 01:32:08,159
or or language or
 

5583
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:11,750
or or language or
communication uh ai will help us be more

5584
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:11,760
communication uh ai will help us be more
 

5585
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:13,110
communication uh ai will help us be more
productive

5586
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,120
productive
 

5587
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:17,430
productive
uh and that is always a condition

5588
01:32:17,430 --> 01:32:17,440
uh and that is always a condition
 

5589
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:19,830
uh and that is always a condition
it's not something that we build and let

5590
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:19,840
it's not something that we build and let
 

5591
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,189
it's not something that we build and let
run and it

5592
01:32:21,189 --> 01:32:21,199
run and it
 

5593
01:32:21,199 --> 01:32:22,470
run and it
becomes an entity of its own that

5594
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:22,480
becomes an entity of its own that
 

5595
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,030
becomes an entity of its own that
doesn't care about us

5596
01:32:25,030 --> 01:32:25,040
doesn't care about us
 

5597
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,270
doesn't care about us
now of course really far in the future

5598
01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:27,280
now of course really far in the future
 

5599
01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:29,030
now of course really far in the future
maybe that might be possible but not in

5600
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:29,040
maybe that might be possible but not in
 

5601
01:32:29,040 --> 01:32:30,310
maybe that might be possible but not in
the foreseeable future when we are

5602
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:30,320
the foreseeable future when we are
 

5603
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,510
the foreseeable future when we are
building it

5604
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520
building it
 

5605
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,669
building it
uh and therefore we are always in a

5606
01:32:33,669 --> 01:32:33,679
uh and therefore we are always in a
 

5607
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:35,270
uh and therefore we are always in a
position of

5608
01:32:35,270 --> 01:32:35,280
position of
 

5609
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:38,830
position of
limiting what it can or cannot do uh

5610
01:32:38,830 --> 01:32:38,840
limiting what it can or cannot do uh
 

5611
01:32:38,840 --> 01:32:41,990
limiting what it can or cannot do uh
and the um

5612
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:42,000
and the um
 

5613
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:43,830
and the um
your point about lying is very

5614
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:43,840
your point about lying is very
 

5615
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,110
your point about lying is very
interesting

5616
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:45,120
interesting
 

5617
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:48,229
interesting
um even even in these highness societies

5618
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:48,239
um even even in these highness societies
 

5619
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:49,189
um even even in these highness societies
for instance

5620
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:49,199
for instance
 

5621
01:32:49,199 --> 01:32:52,149
for instance
uh when a number of these hyenas band

5622
01:32:52,149 --> 01:32:52,159
uh when a number of these hyenas band
 

5623
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:53,030
uh when a number of these hyenas band
together and they

5624
01:32:53,030 --> 01:32:53,040
together and they
 

5625
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,189
together and they
they still they take a risk and steal

5626
01:32:55,189 --> 01:32:55,199
they still they take a risk and steal
 

5627
01:32:55,199 --> 01:32:56,070
they still they take a risk and steal
the kill

5628
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:56,080
the kill
 

5629
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,709
the kill
they're always hyenas that hang back and

5630
01:32:58,709 --> 01:32:58,719
they're always hyenas that hang back and
 

5631
01:32:58,719 --> 01:33:00,310
they're always hyenas that hang back and
don't participate in that

5632
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:00,320
don't participate in that
 

5633
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:03,350
don't participate in that
uh risky behavior but they walk in later

5634
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:03,360
uh risky behavior but they walk in later
 

5635
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:03,590
uh risky behavior but they walk in later
and

5636
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:03,600
and
 

5637
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,990
and
and join the party after the after the

5638
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:06,000
and join the party after the after the
 

5639
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:06,790
and join the party after the after the
kill

5640
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:06,800
kill
 

5641
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:09,110
kill
and there are even some that may be

5642
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:09,120
and there are even some that may be
 

5643
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:10,229
and there are even some that may be
ineffective and

5644
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:10,239
ineffective and
 

5645
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:13,350
ineffective and
cause others to have harm so and

5646
01:33:13,350 --> 01:33:13,360
cause others to have harm so and
 

5647
01:33:13,360 --> 01:33:15,669
cause others to have harm so and
like i said even bacteria cheat and we

5648
01:33:15,669 --> 01:33:15,679
like i said even bacteria cheat and we
 

5649
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:17,189
like i said even bacteria cheat and we
see it in biology

5650
01:33:17,189 --> 01:33:17,199
see it in biology
 

5651
01:33:17,199 --> 01:33:19,750
see it in biology
there's always some element an

5652
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:19,760
there's always some element an
 

5653
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,270
there's always some element an
opportunity if you have a

5654
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,280
opportunity if you have a
 

5655
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,870
opportunity if you have a
i think that is this because if you have

5656
01:33:22,870 --> 01:33:22,880
i think that is this because if you have
 

5657
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:25,350
i think that is this because if you have
a society in order for society to be

5658
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:25,360
a society in order for society to be
 

5659
01:33:25,360 --> 01:33:26,709
a society in order for society to be
effective you have to have this

5660
01:33:26,709 --> 01:33:26,719
effective you have to have this
 

5661
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:28,229
effective you have to have this
cooperation and you have to have

5662
01:33:28,229 --> 01:33:28,239
cooperation and you have to have
 

5663
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:31,189
cooperation and you have to have
trust uh and and if you have enough of

5664
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:31,199
trust uh and and if you have enough of
 

5665
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:31,910
trust uh and and if you have enough of
agents

5666
01:33:31,910 --> 01:33:31,920
agents
 

5667
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,229
agents
who are able to trust each other you can

5668
01:33:34,229 --> 01:33:34,239
who are able to trust each other you can
 

5669
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:36,390
who are able to trust each other you can
achieve a lot more

5670
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
achieve a lot more
 

5671
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,070
achieve a lot more
but if you have trust you also have

5672
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:38,080
but if you have trust you also have
 

5673
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:40,470
but if you have trust you also have
opportunity for cheaters and liars

5674
01:33:40,470 --> 01:33:40,480
opportunity for cheaters and liars
 

5675
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,830
opportunity for cheaters and liars
and i don't think that's ever going to

5676
01:33:41,830 --> 01:33:41,840
and i don't think that's ever going to
 

5677
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:43,510
and i don't think that's ever going to
go away

5678
01:33:43,510 --> 01:33:43,520
go away
 

5679
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:45,270
go away
there will be hopefully a minority so

5680
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:45,280
there will be hopefully a minority so
 

5681
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,790
there will be hopefully a minority so
that they don't get in the way and we

5682
01:33:46,790 --> 01:33:46,800
that they don't get in the way and we
 

5683
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,550
that they don't get in the way and we
studied in these high-end simulations

5684
01:33:48,550 --> 01:33:48,560
studied in these high-end simulations
 

5685
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:50,390
studied in these high-end simulations
like what the proportion needs to be

5686
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:50,400
like what the proportion needs to be
 

5687
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,470
like what the proportion needs to be
before it is no longer functional

5688
01:33:52,470 --> 01:33:52,480
before it is no longer functional
 

5689
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:53,910
before it is no longer functional
and you can point out that you can

5690
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:53,920
and you can point out that you can
 

5691
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:56,310
and you can point out that you can
tolerate a few cheaters and a few

5692
01:33:56,310 --> 01:33:56,320
tolerate a few cheaters and a few
 

5693
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,510
tolerate a few cheaters and a few
liars and the society can still function

5694
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
liars and the society can still function
 

5695
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,229
liars and the society can still function
and that's probably going to happen um

5696
01:34:02,229 --> 01:34:02,239
and that's probably going to happen um
 

5697
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:04,070
and that's probably going to happen um
when we build these systems that

5698
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:04,080
when we build these systems that
 

5699
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,590
when we build these systems that
autonomously learn

5700
01:34:05,590 --> 01:34:05,600
autonomously learn
 

5701
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,709
autonomously learn
um the really successful ones are

5702
01:34:08,709 --> 01:34:08,719
um the really successful ones are
 

5703
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:10,629
um the really successful ones are
honest because that's the best way of

5704
01:34:10,629 --> 01:34:10,639
honest because that's the best way of
 

5705
01:34:10,639 --> 01:34:12,310
honest because that's the best way of
getting things done

5706
01:34:12,310 --> 01:34:12,320
getting things done
 

5707
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,390
getting things done
um but there probably are also

5708
01:34:14,390 --> 01:34:14,400
um but there probably are also
 

5709
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:15,350
um but there probably are also
intelligent

5710
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:15,360
intelligent
 

5711
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,270
intelligent
agents that find that they can achieve

5712
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:17,280
agents that find that they can achieve
 

5713
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:18,709
agents that find that they can achieve
their goals by

5714
01:34:18,709 --> 01:34:18,719
their goals by
 

5715
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:20,870
their goals by
by bending the rules of cheating so

5716
01:34:20,870 --> 01:34:20,880
by bending the rules of cheating so
 

5717
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:22,550
by bending the rules of cheating so
there could be a huge benefit to

5718
01:34:22,550 --> 01:34:22,560
there could be a huge benefit to
 

5719
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:25,510
there could be a huge benefit to
uh as opposed to having fixed ai systems

5720
01:34:25,510 --> 01:34:25,520
uh as opposed to having fixed ai systems
 

5721
01:34:25,520 --> 01:34:26,310
uh as opposed to having fixed ai systems
say we build an

5722
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:26,320
say we build an
 

5723
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:29,270
say we build an
agi system and deploying millions of

5724
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:29,280
agi system and deploying millions of
 

5725
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:29,830
agi system and deploying millions of
them

5726
01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:29,840
them
 

5727
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,950
them
it'd be that are exactly the same

5728
01:34:32,950 --> 01:34:32,960
it'd be that are exactly the same
 

5729
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:36,310
it'd be that are exactly the same
uh there might be a huge benefit to um

5730
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320
uh there might be a huge benefit to um
 

5731
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:37,990
uh there might be a huge benefit to um
introducing sort of from like an

5732
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:38,000
introducing sort of from like an
 

5733
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,830
introducing sort of from like an
evolution computation perspective a lot

5734
01:34:39,830 --> 01:34:39,840
evolution computation perspective a lot
 

5735
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:40,629
evolution computation perspective a lot
of variation

5736
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:40,639
of variation
 

5737
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:44,790
of variation
yeah sort of uh like diversity in all

5738
01:34:44,790 --> 01:34:44,800
yeah sort of uh like diversity in all
 

5739
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,470
yeah sort of uh like diversity in all
its forms is beneficial

5740
01:34:46,470 --> 01:34:46,480
its forms is beneficial
 

5741
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,709
its forms is beneficial
even if some people are or some

5742
01:34:48,709 --> 01:34:48,719
even if some people are or some
 

5743
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:49,830
even if some people are or some
robots are

5744
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:49,840
robots are
 

5745
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:51,669
robots are
so like it's it's beneficial to have

5746
01:34:51,669 --> 01:34:51,679
so like it's it's beneficial to have
 

5747
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:52,870
so like it's it's beneficial to have
that because

5748
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:52,880
that because
 

5749
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:55,270
that because
i uh because you can't always at

5750
01:34:55,270 --> 01:34:55,280
i uh because you can't always at
 

5751
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:56,070
i uh because you can't always at
pre-order i

5752
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,080
pre-order i
 

5753
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,270
pre-order i
know what's good what's bad but

5754
01:34:59,270 --> 01:34:59,280
know what's good what's bad but
 

5755
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:01,270
know what's good what's bad but
uh there's that that's a fascinating

5756
01:35:01,270 --> 01:35:01,280
uh there's that that's a fascinating
 

5757
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:03,189
uh there's that that's a fascinating
absolutely diversity

5758
01:35:03,189 --> 01:35:03,199
absolutely diversity
 

5759
01:35:03,199 --> 01:35:04,709
absolutely diversity
is the bread and butter i mean if you're

5760
01:35:04,709 --> 01:35:04,719
is the bread and butter i mean if you're
 

5761
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,030
is the bread and butter i mean if you're
running away you see diversity is the

5762
01:35:07,030 --> 01:35:07,040
running away you see diversity is the
 

5763
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:09,030
running away you see diversity is the
one fundamental thing you have to have

5764
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
one fundamental thing you have to have
 

5765
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:11,350
one fundamental thing you have to have
and absolutely it also it's not always

5766
01:35:11,350 --> 01:35:11,360
and absolutely it also it's not always
 

5767
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,310
and absolutely it also it's not always
good diversity

5768
01:35:12,310 --> 01:35:12,320
good diversity
 

5769
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:13,910
good diversity
right it may be something that can be

5770
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
right it may be something that can be
 

5771
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,830
right it may be something that can be
destructive we had in these heinous

5772
01:35:15,830 --> 01:35:15,840
destructive we had in these heinous
 

5773
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:17,669
destructive we had in these heinous
simulations we have hyenas that just

5774
01:35:17,669 --> 01:35:17,679
simulations we have hyenas that just
 

5775
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:19,990
simulations we have hyenas that just
are suicidal they just run and get

5776
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:20,000
are suicidal they just run and get
 

5777
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:21,270
are suicidal they just run and get
killed but they

5778
01:35:21,270 --> 01:35:21,280
killed but they
 

5779
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:23,350
killed but they
form the basis of those who actually are

5780
01:35:23,350 --> 01:35:23,360
form the basis of those who actually are
 

5781
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:24,310
form the basis of those who actually are
really fast

5782
01:35:24,310 --> 01:35:24,320
really fast
 

5783
01:35:24,320 --> 01:35:26,149
really fast
but stop before they get killed and

5784
01:35:26,149 --> 01:35:26,159
but stop before they get killed and
 

5785
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,310
but stop before they get killed and
eventually turn into this mob uh

5786
01:35:28,310 --> 01:35:28,320
eventually turn into this mob uh
 

5787
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:29,910
eventually turn into this mob uh
so there might be something useful there

5788
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:29,920
so there might be something useful there
 

5789
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,750
so there might be something useful there
if it's recombined with something else

5790
01:35:31,750 --> 01:35:31,760
if it's recombined with something else
 

5791
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,070
if it's recombined with something else
right

5792
01:35:32,070 --> 01:35:32,080
right
 

5793
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:33,830
right
so i think that as long as we can

5794
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:33,840
so i think that as long as we can
 

5795
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:35,830
so i think that as long as we can
tolerate some of that it may turn into

5796
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:35,840
tolerate some of that it may turn into
 

5797
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:36,790
tolerate some of that it may turn into
something better

5798
01:35:36,790 --> 01:35:36,800
something better
 

5799
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:39,030
something better
you may change the rules because it's so

5800
01:35:39,030 --> 01:35:39,040
you may change the rules because it's so
 

5801
01:35:39,040 --> 01:35:40,709
you may change the rules because it's so
much more efficient to do something that

5802
01:35:40,709 --> 01:35:40,719
much more efficient to do something that
 

5803
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:42,310
much more efficient to do something that
was actually against the rules before

5804
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:42,320
was actually against the rules before
 

5805
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:42,790
was actually against the rules before
yes

5806
01:35:42,790 --> 01:35:42,800
yes
 

5807
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,149
yes
uh and we've seen society change uh over

5808
01:35:46,149 --> 01:35:46,159
uh and we've seen society change uh over
 

5809
01:35:46,159 --> 01:35:47,830
uh and we've seen society change uh over
time quite a bit along those lines that

5810
01:35:47,830 --> 01:35:47,840
time quite a bit along those lines that
 

5811
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:48,950
time quite a bit along those lines that
there were

5812
01:35:48,950 --> 01:35:48,960
there were
 

5813
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,709
there were
rules in society that we don't believe

5814
01:35:50,709 --> 01:35:50,719
rules in society that we don't believe
 

5815
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:52,149
rules in society that we don't believe
are fair anymore

5816
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:52,159
are fair anymore
 

5817
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:54,229
are fair anymore
even though they were you know

5818
01:35:54,229 --> 01:35:54,239
even though they were you know
 

5819
01:35:54,239 --> 01:35:55,189
even though they were you know
considered

5820
01:35:55,189 --> 01:35:55,199
considered
 

5821
01:35:55,199 --> 01:35:58,229
considered
proper behavior before yes um so things

5822
01:35:58,229 --> 01:35:58,239
proper behavior before yes um so things
 

5823
01:35:58,239 --> 01:35:58,950
proper behavior before yes um so things
are changing and

5824
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
are changing and
 

5825
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,109
are changing and
i think that in that sense i think it's

5826
01:36:01,109 --> 01:36:01,119
i think that in that sense i think it's
 

5827
01:36:01,119 --> 01:36:02,870
i think that in that sense i think it's
um it's a good idea to be able to

5828
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:02,880
um it's a good idea to be able to
 

5829
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:03,910
um it's a good idea to be able to
tolerate some of that

5830
01:36:03,910 --> 01:36:03,920
tolerate some of that
 

5831
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,750
tolerate some of that
some of that cheating because eventually

5832
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:05,760
some of that cheating because eventually
 

5833
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,109
some of that cheating because eventually
we might turn into something

5834
01:36:07,109 --> 01:36:07,119
we might turn into something
 

5835
01:36:07,119 --> 01:36:09,109
we might turn into something
better so yeah i think this is a message

5836
01:36:09,109 --> 01:36:09,119
better so yeah i think this is a message
 

5837
01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:10,870
better so yeah i think this is a message
to the trolls and the of the

5838
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:10,880
to the trolls and the of the
 

5839
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:12,229
to the trolls and the of the
internet that you two

5840
01:36:12,229 --> 01:36:12,239
internet that you two
 

5841
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,550
internet that you two
have a beautiful purpose in this uh

5842
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:14,560
have a beautiful purpose in this uh
 

5843
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:16,149
have a beautiful purpose in this uh
human ecosystem so we

5844
01:36:16,149 --> 01:36:16,159
human ecosystem so we
 

5845
01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:17,430
human ecosystem so we
i appreciate you guys watering

5846
01:36:17,430 --> 01:36:17,440
i appreciate you guys watering
 

5847
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,990
i appreciate you guys watering
quantities yeah moderate quantities

5848
01:36:19,990 --> 01:36:20,000
quantities yeah moderate quantities
 

5849
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,350
quantities yeah moderate quantities
uh so there's a whole field of

5850
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:21,360
uh so there's a whole field of
 

5851
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,030
uh so there's a whole field of
artificial life

5852
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:23,040
artificial life
 

5853
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,470
artificial life
i don't know if you're connected to this

5854
01:36:24,470 --> 01:36:24,480
i don't know if you're connected to this
 

5855
01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:26,229
i don't know if you're connected to this
field if you uh pay attention

5856
01:36:26,229 --> 01:36:26,239
field if you uh pay attention
 

5857
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:29,030
field if you uh pay attention
is do you think about this kind of thing

5858
01:36:29,030 --> 01:36:29,040
is do you think about this kind of thing
 

5859
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:29,510
is do you think about this kind of thing
uh

5860
01:36:29,510 --> 01:36:29,520
uh
 

5861
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,750
uh
is there a impressive demonstration to

5862
01:36:31,750 --> 01:36:31,760
is there a impressive demonstration to
 

5863
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,990
is there a impressive demonstration to
you of artificial life do you think of

5864
01:36:33,990 --> 01:36:34,000
you of artificial life do you think of
 

5865
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:35,590
you of artificial life do you think of
the agents that you work with in the

5866
01:36:35,590 --> 01:36:35,600
the agents that you work with in the
 

5867
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,510
the agents that you work with in the
evolutionary competition

5868
01:36:37,510 --> 01:36:37,520
evolutionary competition
 

5869
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,109
evolutionary competition
at perspective as life

5870
01:36:41,109 --> 01:36:41,119
at perspective as life
 

5871
01:36:41,119 --> 01:36:43,510
at perspective as life
and where do you think this is headed

5872
01:36:43,510 --> 01:36:43,520
and where do you think this is headed
 

5873
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:45,109
and where do you think this is headed
like is there interesting systems that

5874
01:36:45,109 --> 01:36:45,119
like is there interesting systems that
 

5875
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,030
like is there interesting systems that
we'll be creating more and more

5876
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:47,040
we'll be creating more and more
 

5877
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:50,709
we'll be creating more and more
that uh make us redefine maybe rethink

5878
01:36:50,709 --> 01:36:50,719
that uh make us redefine maybe rethink
 

5879
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:53,990
that uh make us redefine maybe rethink
about the nature of life different

5880
01:36:53,990 --> 01:36:54,000
about the nature of life different
 

5881
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:54,950
about the nature of life different
levels of

5882
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
levels of
 

5883
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,350
levels of
definition and goals there then i mean

5884
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:57,360
definition and goals there then i mean
 

5885
01:36:57,360 --> 01:36:59,669
definition and goals there then i mean
at some level artificial life

5886
01:36:59,669 --> 01:36:59,679
at some level artificial life
 

5887
01:36:59,679 --> 01:37:02,229
at some level artificial life
can be considered multi-agent systems

5888
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:02,239
can be considered multi-agent systems
 

5889
01:37:02,239 --> 01:37:04,149
can be considered multi-agent systems
that build a society that again achieves

5890
01:37:04,149 --> 01:37:04,159
that build a society that again achieves
 

5891
01:37:04,159 --> 01:37:04,870
that build a society that again achieves
a goal

5892
01:37:04,870 --> 01:37:04,880
a goal
 

5893
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:06,550
a goal
and it might be robots that go into a

5894
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:06,560
and it might be robots that go into a
 

5895
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,310
and it might be robots that go into a
building and clean it up or or

5896
01:37:08,310 --> 01:37:08,320
building and clean it up or or
 

5897
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:10,550
building and clean it up or or
after an earthquake or something you can

5898
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560
after an earthquake or something you can
 

5899
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:11,990
after an earthquake or something you can
think of that as an artificial life

5900
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
think of that as an artificial life
 

5901
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,950
think of that as an artificial life
problem

5902
01:37:12,950 --> 01:37:12,960
problem
 

5903
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,590
problem
in some sense um or you can really think

5904
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:15,600
in some sense um or you can really think
 

5905
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:15,990
in some sense um or you can really think
of it

5906
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:16,000
of it
 

5907
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,030
of it
artificial life as a simulation of life

5908
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
artificial life as a simulation of life
 

5909
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:22,390
artificial life as a simulation of life
and a tool to understand what life is

5910
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:22,400
and a tool to understand what life is
 

5911
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:23,669
and a tool to understand what life is
and how life evolved

5912
01:37:23,669 --> 01:37:23,679
and how life evolved
 

5913
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:25,270
and how life evolved
in on earth and like i said in

5914
01:37:25,270 --> 01:37:25,280
in on earth and like i said in
 

5915
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,709
in on earth and like i said in
artificial life conference

5916
01:37:26,709 --> 01:37:26,719
artificial life conference
 

5917
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:28,950
artificial life conference
there are branches of that conference

5918
01:37:28,950 --> 01:37:28,960
there are branches of that conference
 

5919
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:30,709
there are branches of that conference
sessions of people who really worry

5920
01:37:30,709 --> 01:37:30,719
sessions of people who really worry
 

5921
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:31,510
sessions of people who really worry
about

5922
01:37:31,510 --> 01:37:31,520
about
 

5923
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,550
about
molecular designs and and the start of

5924
01:37:34,550 --> 01:37:34,560
molecular designs and and the start of
 

5925
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:35,430
molecular designs and and the start of
life like the

5926
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
life like the
 

5927
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,270
life like the
like i said primordial soup where

5928
01:37:37,270 --> 01:37:37,280
like i said primordial soup where
 

5929
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,390
like i said primordial soup where
eventually you get something

5930
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:38,400
eventually you get something
 

5931
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:39,590
eventually you get something
self-replicating

5932
01:37:39,590 --> 01:37:39,600
self-replicating
 

5933
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,430
self-replicating
and they're really trying to build that

5934
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:41,440
and they're really trying to build that
 

5935
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:43,109
and they're really trying to build that
um so it's a whole range of

5936
01:37:43,109 --> 01:37:43,119
um so it's a whole range of
 

5937
01:37:43,119 --> 01:37:46,390
um so it's a whole range of
of uh of topics um

5938
01:37:46,390 --> 01:37:46,400
of uh of topics um
 

5939
01:37:46,400 --> 01:37:49,189
of uh of topics um
and i think that artificial life is a

5940
01:37:49,189 --> 01:37:49,199
and i think that artificial life is a
 

5941
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:50,390
and i think that artificial life is a
great tool

5942
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:50,400
great tool
 

5943
01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:53,350
great tool
uh to understand life and there are

5944
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
uh to understand life and there are
 

5945
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,510
uh to understand life and there are
questions like sustainability

5946
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:55,520
questions like sustainability
 

5947
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,870
questions like sustainability
um species we're losing species

5948
01:37:58,870 --> 01:37:58,880
um species we're losing species
 

5949
01:37:58,880 --> 01:38:02,070
um species we're losing species
uh how bad is it is it natural

5950
01:38:02,070 --> 01:38:02,080
uh how bad is it is it natural
 

5951
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,189
uh how bad is it is it natural
uh is there a tipping point um

5952
01:38:05,189 --> 01:38:05,199
uh is there a tipping point um
 

5953
01:38:05,199 --> 01:38:07,109
uh is there a tipping point um
and where are we going i mean like the

5954
01:38:07,109 --> 01:38:07,119
and where are we going i mean like the
 

5955
01:38:07,119 --> 01:38:09,109
and where are we going i mean like the
hyena evolution we may have

5956
01:38:09,109 --> 01:38:09,119
hyena evolution we may have
 

5957
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:11,270
hyena evolution we may have
understood that there's a pivotal point

5958
01:38:11,270 --> 01:38:11,280
understood that there's a pivotal point
 

5959
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:12,950
understood that there's a pivotal point
in their evolution they discovered

5960
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
in their evolution they discovered
 

5961
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,910
in their evolution they discovered
cooperation and coordination

5962
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:15,920
cooperation and coordination
 

5963
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,590
cooperation and coordination
you know artificialized simulations can

5964
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:17,600
you know artificialized simulations can
 

5965
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:19,590
you know artificialized simulations can
identify that and

5966
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:19,600
identify that and
 

5967
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,790
identify that and
maybe encourage things like that um so

5968
01:38:22,790 --> 01:38:22,800
maybe encourage things like that um so
 

5969
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:26,870
maybe encourage things like that um so
and and also societies can be seen as a

5970
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:26,880
and and also societies can be seen as a
 

5971
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:28,629
and and also societies can be seen as a
form of life itself i mean we're not

5972
01:38:28,629 --> 01:38:28,639
form of life itself i mean we're not
 

5973
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:29,990
form of life itself i mean we're not
talking about biological evolution we

5974
01:38:29,990 --> 01:38:30,000
talking about biological evolution we
 

5975
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,149
talking about biological evolution we
have all evolution of societies maybe

5976
01:38:32,149 --> 01:38:32,159
have all evolution of societies maybe
 

5977
01:38:32,159 --> 01:38:33,430
have all evolution of societies maybe
some of the same

5978
01:38:33,430 --> 01:38:33,440
some of the same
 

5979
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:36,629
some of the same
phenomena emerging in that uh domain and

5980
01:38:36,629 --> 01:38:36,639
phenomena emerging in that uh domain and
 

5981
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:38,790
phenomena emerging in that uh domain and
unders and having artificial life

5982
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:38,800
unders and having artificial life
 

5983
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,470
unders and having artificial life
simulations and understanding could help

5984
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:40,480
simulations and understanding could help
 

5985
01:38:40,480 --> 01:38:40,790
simulations and understanding could help
us

5986
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:40,800
us
 

5987
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:43,750
us
build better societies yeah and thinking

5988
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
build better societies yeah and thinking
 

5989
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:44,550
build better societies yeah and thinking
from a

5990
01:38:44,550 --> 01:38:44,560
from a
 

5991
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:48,229
from a
meme perspective of of uh from

5992
01:38:48,229 --> 01:38:48,239
meme perspective of of uh from
 

5993
01:38:48,239 --> 01:38:51,270
meme perspective of of uh from
richard dawkins that

5994
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:51,280
richard dawkins that
 

5995
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,350
richard dawkins that
maybe the organisms ideas of the

5996
01:38:53,350 --> 01:38:53,360
maybe the organisms ideas of the
 

5997
01:38:53,360 --> 01:38:55,270
maybe the organisms ideas of the
organisms not the humans

5998
01:38:55,270 --> 01:38:55,280
organisms not the humans
 

5999
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:58,390
organisms not the humans
in these societies that from

6000
01:38:58,390 --> 01:38:58,400
in these societies that from
 

6001
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:00,390
in these societies that from
it's almost like reframing what is

6002
01:39:00,390 --> 01:39:00,400
it's almost like reframing what is
 

6003
01:39:00,400 --> 01:39:01,830
it's almost like reframing what is
exactly evolving

6004
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:01,840
exactly evolving
 

6005
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:03,590
exactly evolving
maybe the interesting the humans aren't

6006
01:39:03,590 --> 01:39:03,600
maybe the interesting the humans aren't
 

6007
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:05,590
maybe the interesting the humans aren't
the interesting thing is the contents of

6008
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
the interesting thing is the contents of
 

6009
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,350
the interesting thing is the contents of
our minds is the interesting thing and

6010
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:07,360
our minds is the interesting thing and
 

6011
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,109
our minds is the interesting thing and
that's what's multiplying

6012
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:09,119
that's what's multiplying
 

6013
01:39:09,119 --> 01:39:10,390
that's what's multiplying
and that's actually multiplying and

6014
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400
and that's actually multiplying and
 

6015
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,950
and that's actually multiplying and
evolving in a much faster time scale

6016
01:39:12,950 --> 01:39:12,960
evolving in a much faster time scale
 

6017
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,350
evolving in a much faster time scale
and that maybe has more power on the

6018
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:15,360
and that maybe has more power on the
 

6019
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,910
and that maybe has more power on the
trajectory of life on earth than

6020
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:17,920
trajectory of life on earth than
 

6021
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:19,750
trajectory of life on earth than
this biological evolution yes the

6022
01:39:19,750 --> 01:39:19,760
this biological evolution yes the
 

6023
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:21,430
this biological evolution yes the
evolution of these ideas yes

6024
01:39:21,430 --> 01:39:21,440
evolution of these ideas yes
 

6025
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,750
evolution of these ideas yes
and it's fascinating like i said before

6026
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:23,760
and it's fascinating like i said before
 

6027
01:39:23,760 --> 01:39:24,629
and it's fascinating like i said before
that

6028
01:39:24,629 --> 01:39:24,639
that
 

6029
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,350
that
we can keep up somehow biologically yeah

6030
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,360
we can keep up somehow biologically yeah
 

6031
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,669
we can keep up somehow biologically yeah
we

6032
01:39:27,669 --> 01:39:27,679
we
 

6033
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:29,510
we
have we belong to a point where we can

6034
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520
have we belong to a point where we can
 

6035
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:30,709
have we belong to a point where we can
keep up with this

6036
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:30,719
keep up with this
 

6037
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,669
keep up with this
meme evolution literature you know

6038
01:39:33,669 --> 01:39:33,679
meme evolution literature you know
 

6039
01:39:33,679 --> 01:39:34,310
meme evolution literature you know
internet

6040
01:39:34,310 --> 01:39:34,320
internet
 

6041
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,430
internet
um we understand dna and we understand

6042
01:39:37,430 --> 01:39:37,440
um we understand dna and we understand
 

6043
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:38,790
um we understand dna and we understand
fundamental particles

6044
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:38,800
fundamental particles
 

6045
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:40,629
fundamental particles
we didn't start that way i mean thousand

6046
01:39:40,629 --> 01:39:40,639
we didn't start that way i mean thousand
 

6047
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:42,149
we didn't start that way i mean thousand
years ago and we haven't evolved

6048
01:39:42,149 --> 01:39:42,159
years ago and we haven't evolved
 

6049
01:39:42,159 --> 01:39:43,590
years ago and we haven't evolved
biologically very much but

6050
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:43,600
biologically very much but
 

6051
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:46,390
biologically very much but
somehow our minds are able to uh extend

6052
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,400
somehow our minds are able to uh extend
 

6053
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:46,870
somehow our minds are able to uh extend
um

6054
01:39:46,870 --> 01:39:46,880
um
 

6055
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,430
um
and and therefore ai can be seen also as

6056
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
and and therefore ai can be seen also as
 

6057
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,390
and and therefore ai can be seen also as
one such

6058
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:50,400
one such
 

6059
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,030
one such
step that we created and it's our tool

6060
01:39:53,030 --> 01:39:53,040
step that we created and it's our tool
 

6061
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,870
step that we created and it's our tool
uh and it's part of that meme evolution

6062
01:39:54,870 --> 01:39:54,880
uh and it's part of that meme evolution
 

6063
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:56,310
uh and it's part of that meme evolution
that that we create

6064
01:39:56,310 --> 01:39:56,320
that that we create
 

6065
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,070
that that we create
even if our biological evolution does

6066
01:39:58,070 --> 01:39:58,080
even if our biological evolution does
 

6067
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,590
even if our biological evolution does
not progress as fast

6068
01:39:59,590 --> 01:39:59,600
not progress as fast
 

6069
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:02,470
not progress as fast
and us humans might only be able to

6070
01:40:02,470 --> 01:40:02,480
and us humans might only be able to
 

6071
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,629
and us humans might only be able to
understand so much we're keeping up

6072
01:40:04,629 --> 01:40:04,639
understand so much we're keeping up
 

6073
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:07,030
understand so much we're keeping up
so far or we think we're keeping up so

6074
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:07,040
so far or we think we're keeping up so
 

6075
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,709
so far or we think we're keeping up so
far but we might need ai systems to

6076
01:40:08,709 --> 01:40:08,719
far but we might need ai systems to
 

6077
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:09,430
far but we might need ai systems to
understand

6078
01:40:09,430 --> 01:40:09,440
understand
 

6079
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:12,470

maybe like the physics of the universe

6080
01:40:12,470 --> 01:40:12,480
maybe like the physics of the universe
 

6081
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:13,669
maybe like the physics of the universe
is operating

6082
01:40:13,669 --> 01:40:13,679
is operating
 

6083
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:15,030
is operating
like a string theory maybe it's

6084
01:40:15,030 --> 01:40:15,040
like a string theory maybe it's
 

6085
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:16,790
like a string theory maybe it's
operating in much higher

6086
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
operating in much higher
 

6087
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:19,189
operating in much higher
dimensions maybe we're totally because

6088
01:40:19,189 --> 01:40:19,199
dimensions maybe we're totally because
 

6089
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:20,390
dimensions maybe we're totally because
of our cognitive

6090
01:40:20,390 --> 01:40:20,400
of our cognitive
 

6091
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,950

limitations are not able to truly

internalize
 

6095
01:40:24,239 --> 01:40:26,470
internalize
the way this world works and so our

01:40:26,470 --> 01:40:26,480
the way this world works and so our
 

6097
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:28,229
the way this world works and so our
limit we're running up against the

01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:28,239
limit we're running up against the
 

6099
01:40:28,239 --> 01:40:29,350

01:40:29,350 --> 01:40:29,360
limitation of
 

6101
01:40:29,360 --> 01:40:30,870
limitation of
our own minds and we have to create

6102
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:30,880
our own minds and we have to create
 

6103
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:33,510
our own minds and we have to create
these next level organisms like ai

6104
01:40:33,510 --> 01:40:33,520
these next level organisms like ai
 

6105

6107
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:35,910
systems
that would be able to understand much

01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:35,920
that would be able to understand much
 

6109
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,750
that would be able to understand much
deeper like really understand what it

6110
01:40:37,750 --> 01:40:37,760
deeper like really understand what it
 

6111
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:39,270
deeper like really understand what it
means to live in a

6112
01:40:39,270 --> 01:40:39,280
means to live in a
 

6113
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,350
means to live in a
uh multi-dimensional world that's

6114
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:41,360
uh multi-dimensional world that's
 

6115
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:42,950
uh multi-dimensional world that's
outside of the four dimensions the three

6116
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
outside of the four dimensions the three
 

6117
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:44,470
outside of the four dimensions the three
of space and

6118
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:44,480
of space and
 

6119
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:46,550
of space and
one of them yeah translation and and

6120
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:46,560
one of them yeah translation and and
 

6121
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:48,070
one of them yeah translation and and
generally we can deal with the world

6122
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:48,080
generally we can deal with the world
 

6123
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:49,189
generally we can deal with the world
even if you don't understand all the

6124
01:40:49,189 --> 01:40:49,199
even if you don't understand all the
 

6125
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,790
even if you don't understand all the
details we can use computers

6126
01:40:50,790 --> 01:40:50,800
details we can use computers
 

6127
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:52,470
details we can use computers
yes even though we don't most of us

6128
01:40:52,470 --> 01:40:52,480
yes even though we don't most of us
 

6129
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:53,910
yes even though we don't most of us
don't know all the

6130
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:53,920
don't know all the
 

6131
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:55,750
don't know all the
structures underneath or drive a car i

6132
01:40:55,750 --> 01:40:55,760
structures underneath or drive a car i
 

6133
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,030
structures underneath or drive a car i
mean there are many components

6134
01:40:57,030 --> 01:40:57,040
mean there are many components
 

6135
01:40:57,040 --> 01:40:58,709
mean there are many components
especially new cars that you don't quite

6136
01:40:58,709 --> 01:40:58,719
especially new cars that you don't quite
 

6137
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:01,030
especially new cars that you don't quite
fully know but you have the interface

6138
01:41:01,030 --> 01:41:01,040
fully know but you have the interface
 

6139
01:41:01,040 --> 01:41:02,550
fully know but you have the interface
you have an abstraction of it

6140
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:02,560
you have an abstraction of it
 

6141
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:03,910
you have an abstraction of it
that allows you to operate it and

6142
01:41:03,910 --> 01:41:03,920
that allows you to operate it and
 

6143
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,550
that allows you to operate it and
utilize it and i think that that's

6144
01:41:06,550 --> 01:41:06,560
utilize it and i think that that's
 

6145
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,470
utilize it and i think that that's
that's perfectly adequate and we can

6146
01:41:08,470 --> 01:41:08,480
that's perfectly adequate and we can
 

6147
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:10,870
that's perfectly adequate and we can
build on it and ai can be

6148
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:10,880
build on it and ai can be
 

6149
01:41:10,880 --> 01:41:14,390
build on it and ai can be
play a similar role i have to ask

6150
01:41:14,390 --> 01:41:14,400
play a similar role i have to ask
 

6151
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:17,270
play a similar role i have to ask
uh about beautiful artificial life

6152
01:41:17,270 --> 01:41:17,280
uh about beautiful artificial life

6157
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:22,470

cellular automata to me

6158
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:22,480
cellular automata to me
 

6159
01:41:22,480 --> 01:41:25,270
cellular automata to me
like i remember it was as a game changer

6160
01:41:25,270 --> 01:41:25,280
like i remember it was as a game changer
 

6161
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,669
like i remember it was as a game changer
for me early on in life when i saw

somehow that simplicity is
such a powerful illustration and also

such a powerful illustration and also

01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,470
of what it means to create something
complex and interesting and surprising

6222
01:42:34,470 --> 01:42:34,480
complex and interesting and surprising
 

6223
01:42:34,480 --> 01:42:36,310
complex and interesting and surprising
all those words that you said

6224
01:42:36,310 --> 01:42:36,320
all those words that you said
 

6225
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:39,350
all those words that you said
um is there some some of those systems

6226
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,360
um is there some some of those systems
 

6227
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,950
um is there some some of those systems
you find uh beautiful

6228
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:40,960
you find uh beautiful
 

6229
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:43,189
you find uh beautiful
yeah yeah and uh similarly evolution

6230
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
yeah yeah and uh similarly evolution
 

6231
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,629
yeah yeah and uh similarly evolution
does not have a goal

6232
01:42:44,629 --> 01:42:44,639
does not have a goal
 

6233
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:47,669
does not have a goal
uh it is responding to uh

6234
01:42:47,669 --> 01:42:47,679
uh it is responding to uh
 

6235
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,470
uh it is responding to uh
current situation uh and so survival

6236
01:42:50,470 --> 01:42:50,480
current situation uh and so survival
 

6237
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:50,870
current situation uh and so survival
then

6238
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880
then
 

6239
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,709
then
if it creates more complexity and

6240
01:42:52,709 --> 01:42:52,719
if it creates more complexity and
 

6241
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:54,629
if it creates more complexity and
therefore we have something that we

6242
01:42:54,629 --> 01:42:54,639
therefore we have something that we
 

6243
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,790
therefore we have something that we
perceive as progress but that's not what

6244
01:42:56,790 --> 01:42:56,800
perceive as progress but that's not what
 

6245
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:59,430
perceive as progress but that's not what
evolution is inherently

6246
01:42:59,430 --> 01:42:59,440
evolution is inherently
 

6247
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,310
evolution is inherently
said to do uh and yeah that's that's

6248
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,320
said to do uh and yeah that's that's
 

6249
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:03,350
said to do uh and yeah that's that's
really fascinating

6250
01:43:03,350 --> 01:43:03,360
really fascinating
 

6251
01:43:03,360 --> 01:43:06,550
really fascinating
how how a simple set of rules or simple

6252
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:06,560
how how a simple set of rules or simple
 

6253
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,229
how how a simple set of rules or simple
uh mappings can um from from

6254
01:43:10,229 --> 01:43:10,239
uh mappings can um from from
 

6255
01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:13,350
uh mappings can um from from
how from such simple mapping complexity

6256
01:43:13,350 --> 01:43:13,360
how from such simple mapping complexity
 

6257
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:14,310
how from such simple mapping complexity
can emerge

6258
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:14,320
can emerge
 

6259
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,830
can emerge
so it's a question of emergence and

6260
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:15,840
so it's a question of emergence and
 

6261
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,990
so it's a question of emergence and
self-organization uh and

6262
01:43:17,990 --> 01:43:18,000
self-organization uh and
 

6263
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,070
self-organization uh and
um the game of life is one of the

6264
01:43:20,070 --> 01:43:20,080
um the game of life is one of the
 

6265
01:43:20,080 --> 01:43:21,350
um the game of life is one of the
simplest ones

6266
01:43:21,350 --> 01:43:21,360
simplest ones
 

6267
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,870
simplest ones
and very visual and therefore it drives

6268
01:43:24,870 --> 01:43:24,880
and very visual and therefore it drives
 

6269
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,790
and very visual and therefore it drives
home the point that it's possible that

6270
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:26,800
home the point that it's possible that
 

6271
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,109
home the point that it's possible that
non-linear interactions uh and

6272
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:31,119
non-linear interactions uh and
 

6273
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:33,750
non-linear interactions uh and
and this kind of complexity can emerge

6274
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:33,760
and this kind of complexity can emerge
 

6275
01:43:33,760 --> 01:43:34,629
and this kind of complexity can emerge
emerge from them

6276
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:34,639
emerge from them
 

6277
01:43:34,639 --> 01:43:37,270
emerge from them
and biology and evolution is along the

6278
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:37,280
and biology and evolution is along the
 

6279
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:37,990
and biology and evolution is along the
same lines we

6280
01:43:37,990 --> 01:43:38,000
same lines we
 

6281
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:40,870
same lines we
have simple representations dna if you

6282
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:40,880
have simple representations dna if you
 

6283
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:41,669
have simple representations dna if you
really think of it

6284
01:43:41,669 --> 01:43:41,679
really think of it
 

6285
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,629
really think of it
it's not that complex um it's a long

6286
01:43:44,629 --> 01:43:44,639
it's not that complex um it's a long
 

6287
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:46,070
it's not that complex um it's a long
sequence of them there's lots of them

6288
01:43:46,070 --> 01:43:46,080
sequence of them there's lots of them
 

6289
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,070
sequence of them there's lots of them
but it's a very simple representation

6290
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:48,080
but it's a very simple representation
 

6291
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:49,750
but it's a very simple representation
and similar evolutionary computation

6292
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,760
and similar evolutionary computation
 

6293
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:51,910
and similar evolutionary computation
whatever string or tree representation

6294
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
whatever string or tree representation
 

6295
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,470
whatever string or tree representation
we have

6296
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:52,480
we have
 

6297
01:43:52,480 --> 01:43:55,030
we have
any operations you know the amount of

6298
01:43:55,030 --> 01:43:55,040
any operations you know the amount of
 

6299
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:55,910
any operations you know the amount of
code

6300
01:43:55,910 --> 01:43:55,920
code
 

6301
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,189
code
that's required to manipulate those is

6302
01:43:59,189 --> 01:43:59,199
that's required to manipulate those is
 

6303
01:43:59,199 --> 01:44:01,270
that's required to manipulate those is
really really little and of course came

6304
01:44:01,270 --> 01:44:01,280
really really little and of course came
 

6305
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,390
really really little and of course came
alive even less

6306
01:44:02,390 --> 01:44:02,400
alive even less
 

6307
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,270
alive even less
so how complexity emerges from such

6308
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:05,280
so how complexity emerges from such
 

6309
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:06,950
so how complexity emerges from such
simple principles that's that's

6310
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:06,960
simple principles that's that's
 

6311
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,590
simple principles that's that's
absolutely fascinating um the challenge

6312
01:44:09,590 --> 01:44:09,600
absolutely fascinating um the challenge
 

6313
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:11,430
absolutely fascinating um the challenge
is to be able to control it

6314
01:44:11,430 --> 01:44:11,440
is to be able to control it
 

6315
01:44:11,440 --> 01:44:14,149
is to be able to control it
and guide it and direct it so that it

6316
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:14,159
and guide it and direct it so that it
 

6317
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:15,430
and guide it and direct it so that it
becomes useful

6318
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:15,440
becomes useful
 

6319
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,430
becomes useful
and like game of life is fascinating to

6320
01:44:17,430 --> 01:44:17,440
and like game of life is fascinating to
 

6321
01:44:17,440 --> 01:44:19,669
and like game of life is fascinating to
look at and and evolution all the forms

6322
01:44:19,669 --> 01:44:19,679
look at and and evolution all the forms
 

6323
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:19,990
look at and and evolution all the forms
that come

6324
01:44:19,990 --> 01:44:20,000
that come
 

6325
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,910
that come
out is fascinating but can we actually

6326
01:44:21,910 --> 01:44:21,920
out is fascinating but can we actually
 

6327
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,350
out is fascinating but can we actually
make it useful

6328
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:23,360
make it useful
 

6329
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,750
make it useful
for us and efficient because if you

6330
01:44:25,750 --> 01:44:25,760
for us and efficient because if you
 

6331
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:26,950
for us and efficient because if you
actually think about

6332
01:44:26,950 --> 01:44:26,960
actually think about
 

6333
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:28,790
actually think about
each of the cells in the game of life as

6334
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:28,800
each of the cells in the game of life as
 

6335
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,229
each of the cells in the game of life as
a living organism

6336
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:30,239
a living organism
 

6337
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,149
a living organism
there's a lot of death that has to

6338
01:44:32,149 --> 01:44:32,159
there's a lot of death that has to
 

6339
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:33,830
there's a lot of death that has to
happen to create anything interesting

6340
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:33,840
happen to create anything interesting
 

6341
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:34,229
happen to create anything interesting
yeah

6342
01:44:34,229 --> 01:44:34,239
yeah
 

6343
01:44:34,239 --> 01:44:35,990
yeah
and so i guess the questions for us

6344
01:44:35,990 --> 01:44:36,000
and so i guess the questions for us
 

6345
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,669
and so i guess the questions for us
humans that are mortal and then life

6346
01:44:37,669 --> 01:44:37,679
humans that are mortal and then life
 

6347
01:44:37,679 --> 01:44:40,470
humans that are mortal and then life
ends quickly we want to kind of hurry up

6348
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:40,480
ends quickly we want to kind of hurry up
 

6349
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,910
ends quickly we want to kind of hurry up
and make sure

6350
01:44:41,910 --> 01:44:41,920
and make sure
 

6351
01:44:41,920 --> 01:44:45,030
and make sure
we make sure we take evolution uh uh

6352
01:44:45,030 --> 01:44:45,040
we make sure we take evolution uh uh
 

6353
01:44:45,040 --> 01:44:46,870
we make sure we take evolution uh uh
the trajectory that is a little bit more

6354
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:46,880
the trajectory that is a little bit more
 

6355
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,229
the trajectory that is a little bit more
efficient than uh

6356
01:44:48,229 --> 01:44:48,239
efficient than uh
 

6357
01:44:48,239 --> 01:44:50,070
efficient than uh
the alternatives and that that's one

6358
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:50,080
the alternatives and that that's one
 

6359
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,430
the alternatives and that that's one
something we talked about earlier that

6360
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,440
something we talked about earlier that
 

6361
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,870
something we talked about earlier that
evolution computation is very

6362
01:44:52,870 --> 01:44:52,880
evolution computation is very
 

6363
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,189
evolution computation is very
uh impatient yeah we had we have a goal

6364
01:44:55,189 --> 01:44:55,199
uh impatient yeah we had we have a goal
 

6365
01:44:55,199 --> 01:44:56,229
uh impatient yeah we had we have a goal
we want it

6366
01:44:56,229 --> 01:44:56,239
we want it
 

6367
01:44:56,239 --> 01:44:58,310
we want it
right away whereas this biology has a

6368
01:44:58,310 --> 01:44:58,320
right away whereas this biology has a
 

6369
01:44:58,320 --> 01:44:59,510
right away whereas this biology has a
lot of time and

6370
01:44:59,510 --> 01:44:59,520
lot of time and
 

6371
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,030
lot of time and
and deep deep time and weak pressure and

6372
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:03,040
and deep deep time and weak pressure and
 

6373
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:04,310
and deep deep time and weak pressure and
large populations

6374
01:45:04,310 --> 01:45:04,320
large populations
 

6375
01:45:04,320 --> 01:45:07,189
large populations
uh one great example of of this is the

6376
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:07,199
uh one great example of of this is the
 

6377
01:45:07,199 --> 01:45:08,470
uh one great example of of this is the
novelty search

6378
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:08,480
novelty search
 

6379
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,430
novelty search
uh so evolutionary computation where you

6380
01:45:11,430 --> 01:45:11,440
uh so evolutionary computation where you
 

6381
01:45:11,440 --> 01:45:11,910
uh so evolutionary computation where you
don't

6382
01:45:11,910 --> 01:45:11,920
don't
 

6383
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,790
don't
actually specify a fitness goal

6384
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:14,800
actually specify a fitness goal
 

6385
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,470
actually specify a fitness goal
something that is your actual thing that

6386
01:45:16,470 --> 01:45:16,480
something that is your actual thing that
 

6387
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,189
something that is your actual thing that
you want

6388
01:45:17,189 --> 01:45:17,199
you want
 

6389
01:45:17,199 --> 01:45:19,830
you want
but you just reward solutions that are

6390
01:45:19,830 --> 01:45:19,840
but you just reward solutions that are
 

6391
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:20,790
but you just reward solutions that are
different

6392
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:20,800
different
 

6393
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:22,390
different
from what you've seen before yeah

6394
01:45:22,390 --> 01:45:22,400
from what you've seen before yeah
 

6395
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:24,070
from what you've seen before yeah
nothing else yeah and

6396
01:45:24,070 --> 01:45:24,080
nothing else yeah and
 

6397
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,229
nothing else yeah and
you know what you actually discover

6398
01:45:26,229 --> 01:45:26,239
you know what you actually discover
 

6399
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:27,830
you know what you actually discover
things that are interesting and useful

6400
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:27,840
things that are interesting and useful
 

6401
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:28,629
things that are interesting and useful
that way

6402
01:45:28,629 --> 01:45:28,639
that way
 

6403
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,470
that way
um guess danny and joe lemon did this

6404
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:30,480
um guess danny and joe lemon did this
 

6405
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,550
um guess danny and joe lemon did this
one study where they actually

6406
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:32,560
one study where they actually
 

6407
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,390
one study where they actually
tried to evolve walking behavior on

6408
01:45:34,390 --> 01:45:34,400
tried to evolve walking behavior on
 

6409
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:35,990
tried to evolve walking behavior on
robots and that's actually we talked

6410
01:45:35,990 --> 01:45:36,000
robots and that's actually we talked
 

6411
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:36,950
robots and that's actually we talked
about earlier where

6412
01:45:36,950 --> 01:45:36,960
about earlier where
 

6413
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:39,030
about earlier where
your robot actually failed in all kinds

6414
01:45:39,030 --> 01:45:39,040
your robot actually failed in all kinds
 

6415
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,550
your robot actually failed in all kinds
of ways and eventually discovered

6416
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:40,560
of ways and eventually discovered
 

6417
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:41,669
of ways and eventually discovered
something that was

6418
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:41,679
something that was
 

6419
01:45:41,679 --> 01:45:44,629
something that was
a very efficient walk uh and and it was

6420
01:45:44,629 --> 01:45:44,639
a very efficient walk uh and and it was
 

6421
01:45:44,639 --> 01:45:45,750
a very efficient walk uh and and it was
because they if

6422
01:45:45,750 --> 01:45:45,760
because they if
 

6423
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,629
because they if
they rewarded things that were different

6424
01:45:48,629 --> 01:45:48,639
they rewarded things that were different
 

6425
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:50,550
they rewarded things that were different
that you were able to discover something

6426
01:45:50,550 --> 01:45:50,560
that you were able to discover something
 

6427
01:45:50,560 --> 01:45:52,790
that you were able to discover something
uh and i think that this is crucial um

6428
01:45:52,790 --> 01:45:52,800
uh and i think that this is crucial um
 

6429
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,870
uh and i think that this is crucial um
because in order to be really different

6430
01:45:54,870 --> 01:45:54,880
because in order to be really different
 

6431
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:56,390
because in order to be really different
from what you already have

6432
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:56,400
from what you already have
 

6433
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,550
from what you already have
you have to utilize what is there in a

6434
01:45:58,550 --> 01:45:58,560
you have to utilize what is there in a
 

6435
01:45:58,560 --> 01:45:59,830
you have to utilize what is there in a
domain to create something really

6436
01:45:59,830 --> 01:45:59,840
domain to create something really
 

6437
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:00,629
domain to create something really
different

6438
01:46:00,629 --> 01:46:00,639
different
 

6439
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:04,310
different
so you have encoded the uh fundamentals

6440
01:46:04,310 --> 01:46:04,320
so you have encoded the uh fundamentals
 

6441
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,590
so you have encoded the uh fundamentals
of your world

6442
01:46:05,590 --> 01:46:05,600
of your world
 

6443
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:07,270
of your world
and then you make changes to those

6444
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:07,280
and then you make changes to those
 

6445
01:46:07,280 --> 01:46:09,669
and then you make changes to those
fundamentals you get further away

6446
01:46:09,669 --> 01:46:09,679
fundamentals you get further away
 

6447
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:11,590
fundamentals you get further away
so that's probably what's happening in

6448
01:46:11,590 --> 01:46:11,600
so that's probably what's happening in
 

6449
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:13,750
so that's probably what's happening in
these systems of emergence

6450
01:46:13,750 --> 01:46:13,760
these systems of emergence
 

6451
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:17,189
these systems of emergence
uh that the fundamentals are there

6452
01:46:17,189 --> 01:46:17,199
uh that the fundamentals are there
 

6453
01:46:17,199 --> 01:46:18,870
uh that the fundamentals are there
and when you follow those fundamentals

6454
01:46:18,870 --> 01:46:18,880
and when you follow those fundamentals
 

6455
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,030
and when you follow those fundamentals
you get into points and some of those

6456
01:46:21,030 --> 01:46:21,040
you get into points and some of those
 

6457
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:23,030
you get into points and some of those
are actually interesting and useful now

6458
01:46:23,030 --> 01:46:23,040
are actually interesting and useful now
 

6459
01:46:23,040 --> 01:46:25,030
are actually interesting and useful now
even in that robotic walker simulation

6460
01:46:25,030 --> 01:46:25,040
even in that robotic walker simulation
 

6461
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:26,149
even in that robotic walker simulation
there was a large

6462
01:46:26,149 --> 01:46:26,159
there was a large
 

6463
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:29,270
there was a large
set of garbage but among them there were

6464
01:46:29,270 --> 01:46:29,280
set of garbage but among them there were
 

6465
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:30,149
set of garbage but among them there were
some of these

6466
01:46:30,149 --> 01:46:30,159
some of these
 

6467
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:32,390
some of these
you know gems and then those are the

6468
01:46:32,390 --> 01:46:32,400
you know gems and then those are the
 

6469
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:34,229
you know gems and then those are the
ones that somehow you have to outside

6470
01:46:34,229 --> 01:46:34,239
ones that somehow you have to outside
 

6471
01:46:34,239 --> 01:46:37,030
ones that somehow you have to outside
recognize and make useful but these kind

6472
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:37,040
recognize and make useful but these kind
 

6473
01:46:37,040 --> 01:46:38,550
recognize and make useful but these kind
of productive systems

6474
01:46:38,550 --> 01:46:38,560
of productive systems
 

6475
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,990
of productive systems
if you code them the right kind of

6476
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:40,000
if you code them the right kind of
 

6477
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,709
if you code them the right kind of
principles i think that they

6478
01:46:42,709 --> 01:46:42,719
principles i think that they
 

6479
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,709
principles i think that they
that encode the structure of the of the

6480
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:44,719
that encode the structure of the of the
 

6481
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:46,550
that encode the structure of the of the
domain then you will get to these

6482
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:46,560
domain then you will get to these
 

6483
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:49,910
domain then you will get to these
solutions and the discoveries

6484
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:49,920
solutions and the discoveries
 

6485
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:51,590
solutions and the discoveries
it feels like that might also be a good

6486
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:51,600
it feels like that might also be a good
 

6487
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:54,629
it feels like that might also be a good
way to live life so let me ask

6488
01:46:54,629 --> 01:46:54,639
way to live life so let me ask
 

6489
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:57,430
way to live life so let me ask
do you have advice for young people

6490
01:46:57,430 --> 01:46:57,440
do you have advice for young people
 

6491
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:57,990
do you have advice for young people
today

6492
01:46:57,990 --> 01:46:58,000
today
 

6493
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,149
today
about how to live life or how to succeed

6494
01:47:00,149 --> 01:47:00,159
about how to live life or how to succeed
 

6495
01:47:00,159 --> 01:47:01,430
about how to live life or how to succeed
in their career

6496
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
in their career
 

6497
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:05,990
in their career
or forget career just succeed in life

6498
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
or forget career just succeed in life
 

6499
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,149
or forget career just succeed in life
form an evolutionary computation

6500

yes definitely explore
 

6505
01:47:13,440 --> 01:47:16,470
yes definitely explore
diversity exploration yeah and i mean

6506
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:16,480
diversity exploration yeah and i mean
 

6507
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,750
diversity exploration yeah and i mean
individuals take classes in music

6508
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:19,760
individuals take classes in music
 

6509
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:21,270

history philosophy

6510
01:47:21,270 --> 01:47:21,280
history philosophy
 

6511
01:47:21,280 --> 01:47:24,950
history philosophy
yeah you know math engineering uh

6512
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:24,960
yeah you know math engineering uh
 

6513
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,149
yeah you know math engineering uh
see connections between them travel

6514
01:47:28,149 --> 01:47:28,159
see connections between them travel
 

6515
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,550
see connections between them travel
you know learn a language i mean all

6516
01:47:30,550 --> 01:47:30,560
you know learn a language i mean all
 

6517
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,310
you know learn a language i mean all
this diversity is fascinating and we

6518
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:32,320
this diversity is fascinating and we
 

6519
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,910
this diversity is fascinating and we
have it at our fingerprint

6520
01:47:33,910 --> 01:47:33,920
have it at our fingerprint
 

6521
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:36,629
have it at our fingerprint
fingertips today it's possible you have

6522
01:47:36,629 --> 01:47:36,639
fingertips today it's possible you have
 

6523
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:38,070
fingertips today it's possible you have
to make a bit of an effort because it's

6524
01:47:38,070 --> 01:47:38,080
to make a bit of an effort because it's
 

6525
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:39,590
to make a bit of an effort because it's
not easy

6526
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:39,600
not easy
 

6527
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:42,709
not easy
but the rewards are wonderful um

6528
01:47:42,709 --> 01:47:42,719
but the rewards are wonderful um
 

6529
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:43,910
but the rewards are wonderful um
yeah there's something interesting about

6530
01:47:43,910 --> 01:47:43,920
yeah there's something interesting about
 

6531
01:47:43,920 --> 01:47:47,189
yeah there's something interesting about
an objective function of new experiences

6532
01:47:47,189 --> 01:47:47,199
an objective function of new experiences
 

6533
01:47:47,199 --> 01:47:51,109
an objective function of new experiences
so try to figure out i mean uh

6534
01:47:51,109 --> 01:47:51,119
so try to figure out i mean uh
 

6535
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:53,030
so try to figure out i mean uh
what what is the maximally new

6536
01:47:53,030 --> 01:47:53,040
what what is the maximally new
 

6537
01:47:53,040 --> 01:47:54,790
what what is the maximally new
experience that could have

6538
01:47:54,790 --> 01:47:54,800
experience that could have
 

6539
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:58,149
experience that could have
today and that so like that novelty

6540
01:47:58,149 --> 01:47:58,159
today and that so like that novelty
 

6541
01:47:58,159 --> 01:47:59,990
today and that so like that novelty
optimizing for novelty for some period

6542
01:47:59,990 --> 01:48:00,000
optimizing for novelty for some period
 

6543
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:01,750
optimizing for novelty for some period
of time might be a very interesting way

6544
01:48:01,750 --> 01:48:01,760
of time might be a very interesting way
 

6545
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,830
of time might be a very interesting way
to sort of uh

6546
01:48:03,830 --> 01:48:03,840
to sort of uh
 

6547
01:48:03,840 --> 01:48:06,470
to sort of uh
expand the the sets of experiences you

6548
01:48:06,470 --> 01:48:06,480
expand the the sets of experiences you
 

6549
01:48:06,480 --> 01:48:06,950
expand the the sets of experiences you
had

6550
01:48:06,950 --> 01:48:06,960
had
 

6551
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:10,149
had
and uh then ground from that perspective

6552
01:48:10,149 --> 01:48:10,159
and uh then ground from that perspective
 

6553
01:48:10,159 --> 01:48:13,270
and uh then ground from that perspective
um like what you what would be the most

6554
01:48:13,270 --> 01:48:13,280
um like what you what would be the most
 

6555
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:15,109
um like what you what would be the most
fulfilling trajectory through life of

6556
01:48:15,109 --> 01:48:15,119
fulfilling trajectory through life of
 

6557
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:15,750
fulfilling trajectory through life of
course

6558
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:15,760
course
 

6559
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:18,550
course
the flip side of that this is where i

6560
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
the flip side of that this is where i
 

6561
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,310
the flip side of that this is where i
come from again maybe russian i don't

6562
01:48:20,310 --> 01:48:20,320
come from again maybe russian i don't
 

6563
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:20,870
come from again maybe russian i don't
know

6564
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:20,880
know
 

6565
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:25,030
know
but the the choice has a

6566
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:25,040

 

6567
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:28,070

choice is a has a detrimental effect i

6568
01:48:28,070 --> 01:48:28,080
choice is a has a detrimental effect i
 

6569
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:28,629
choice is a has a detrimental effect i
think

6570
01:48:28,629 --> 01:48:28,639
think
 

6571
01:48:28,639 --> 01:48:31,669
think
from at least from my mind where

6572
01:48:31,669 --> 01:48:31,679
from at least from my mind where
 

6573
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:35,270
from at least from my mind where
scarcity is has a empowering effect

6574
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:35,280
scarcity is has a empowering effect
 

6575
01:48:35,280 --> 01:48:39,590
scarcity is has a empowering effect
so if i sort of

6576
01:48:39,590 --> 01:48:39,600
so if i sort of
 

6577
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:41,350
so if i sort of
if i have very little of something and

6578
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:41,360
if i have very little of something and
 

6579
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,950
if i have very little of something and
only one of that something

6580
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:42,960
only one of that something
 

6581
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:45,750
only one of that something
i will appreciate it deeply until i came

6582
01:48:45,750 --> 01:48:45,760
i will appreciate it deeply until i came
 

6583
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:46,790
i will appreciate it deeply until i came
to

6584
01:48:46,790 --> 01:48:46,800
to
 

6585
01:48:46,800 --> 01:48:49,669

delicious incredible meat i've been
fasting a lot so i need to do that again

6592
01:48:53,750 --> 01:48:53,760
fasting a lot so i need to do that again
 

6593
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,070
fasting a lot so i need to do that again
but

6594
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
but
 

6595
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,790
but
when you fast for a few days that the

6596
01:48:56,790 --> 01:48:56,800
when you fast for a few days that the
 

6597
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:57,990
when you fast for a few days that the
first taste of

6598
01:48:57,990 --> 01:48:58,000
first taste of
 

6599
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,910
first taste of
of a food is is incredible so

01:49:01,910 --> 01:49:01,920
of a food is is incredible so
 

6601
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,790
of a food is is incredible so
the downside of exploration is that

6602
01:49:06,790 --> 01:49:06,800
the downside of exploration is that
 

6603
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:10,790
the downside of exploration is that
uh somehow maybe maybe you can correct

6604
01:49:10,790 --> 01:49:10,800
uh somehow maybe maybe you can correct
 

6605
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:11,350
uh somehow maybe maybe you can correct
me but

6606
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:11,360
me but
 

6607
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:13,430
me but
somehow you don't get to experience

6608
01:49:13,430 --> 01:49:13,440
somehow you don't get to experience
 

6609
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:15,109
somehow you don't get to experience
deeply

6610
01:49:15,109 --> 01:49:15,119
deeply
 

6611
01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:17,510
deeply
any one of the particular moments but

6612
01:49:17,510 --> 01:49:17,520
any one of the particular moments but
 

6613
01:49:17,520 --> 01:49:19,589
any one of the particular moments but
that could be a psychology thing

6614
01:49:19,589 --> 01:49:19,599
that could be a psychology thing
 

6615
01:49:19,599 --> 01:49:23,109
that could be a psychology thing
that could be just a very human peculiar

6616
01:49:23,109 --> 01:49:23,119
that could be just a very human peculiar
 

6617
01:49:23,119 --> 01:49:24,950
that could be just a very human peculiar
flaw yeah i didn't mean that you

6618
01:49:24,950 --> 01:49:24,960
flaw yeah i didn't mean that you
 

6619
01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:26,149
flaw yeah i didn't mean that you
superficially

6620
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:26,159
superficially
 

6621
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:28,390
superficially
explore i mean you can explore deeply

6622
01:49:28,390 --> 01:49:28,400
explore i mean you can explore deeply
 

6623
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,830
explore i mean you can explore deeply
yeah so you don't have to

6624
01:49:29,830 --> 01:49:29,840
yeah so you don't have to
 

6625
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:32,550
yeah so you don't have to
explore 100 things but maybe a few

6626
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:32,560
explore 100 things but maybe a few
 

6627
01:49:32,560 --> 01:49:34,709
explore 100 things but maybe a few
topics where you can take a deep enough

6628
01:49:34,709 --> 01:49:34,719
topics where you can take a deep enough
 

6629
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:35,350
topics where you can take a deep enough
time

6630
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
time
 

6631
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:39,510
time
a dive that you gain an understanding

6632
01:49:39,510 --> 01:49:39,520
a dive that you gain an understanding
 

6633
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:42,310
a dive that you gain an understanding
um you yourself have to decide at some

6634
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:42,320
um you yourself have to decide at some
 

6635
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,229
um you yourself have to decide at some
point that this is deep enough

6636
01:49:44,229 --> 01:49:44,239
point that this is deep enough
 

6637
01:49:44,239 --> 01:49:47,030
point that this is deep enough
and i i unders i i've obtained what i

6638
01:49:47,030 --> 01:49:47,040
and i i unders i i've obtained what i
 

6639
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:47,830
and i i unders i i've obtained what i
can

6640
01:49:47,830 --> 01:49:47,840
can
 

6641
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:50,149
can
from this topic uh and now it's time to

6642
01:49:50,149 --> 01:49:50,159
from this topic uh and now it's time to
 

6643
01:49:50,159 --> 01:49:51,270
from this topic uh and now it's time to
move on

6644
01:49:51,270 --> 01:49:51,280
move on
 

6645
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:54,390
move on
and that might take years um people

6646
01:49:54,390 --> 01:49:54,400
and that might take years um people
 

6647
01:49:54,400 --> 01:49:57,030
and that might take years um people
sometimes switch careers and they may

6648
01:49:57,030 --> 01:49:57,040
sometimes switch careers and they may
 

6649
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:58,149
sometimes switch careers and they may
stay on some

6650
01:49:58,149 --> 01:49:58,159
stay on some
 

6651
01:49:58,159 --> 01:49:59,830
stay on some
career for a decade and switch to

6652
01:49:59,830 --> 01:49:59,840
career for a decade and switch to
 

6653
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:01,669
career for a decade and switch to
another one you can do it

6654
01:50:01,669 --> 01:50:01,679
another one you can do it
 

6655
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,510
another one you can do it
you're not pretty determined to stay

6656
01:50:03,510 --> 01:50:03,520
you're not pretty determined to stay
 

6657
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:05,030
you're not pretty determined to stay
where you are but

6658
01:50:05,030 --> 01:50:05,040
where you are but
 

6659
01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:08,149
where you are but
you know in order to achieve um

6660
01:50:08,149 --> 01:50:08,159
you know in order to achieve um
 

6661
01:50:08,159 --> 01:50:10,629
you know in order to achieve um
something you know 10 000 hours makes

6662
01:50:10,629 --> 01:50:10,639
something you know 10 000 hours makes
 

6663
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:11,189
something you know 10 000 hours makes
you need 10

6664
01:50:11,189 --> 01:50:11,199
you need 10
 

6665
01:50:11,199 --> 01:50:12,470
you need 10
000 hours to become an expert on

6666
01:50:12,470 --> 01:50:12,480
000 hours to become an expert on
 

6667
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,790
000 hours to become an expert on
something uh so you don't have to become

6668
01:50:14,790 --> 01:50:14,800
something uh so you don't have to become
 

6669
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:15,910
something uh so you don't have to become
an expert but to even

6670
01:50:15,910 --> 01:50:15,920
an expert but to even
 

6671
01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:17,589
an expert but to even
develop an understanding and gain the

6672
01:50:17,589 --> 01:50:17,599
develop an understanding and gain the
 

6673
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:19,350
develop an understanding and gain the
experience that you can use later you

6674
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:19,360
experience that you can use later you
 

6675
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,470
experience that you can use later you
probably have to spend

6676
01:50:20,470 --> 01:50:20,480
probably have to spend
 

6677
01:50:20,480 --> 01:50:22,149
probably have to spend
like i said it's not easy you got to

6678
01:50:22,149 --> 01:50:22,159
like i said it's not easy you got to
 

6679
01:50:22,159 --> 01:50:24,310
like i said it's not easy you got to
spend some effort on it

6680
01:50:24,310 --> 01:50:24,320
spend some effort on it
 

6681
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:26,470
spend some effort on it
now also at some point then when you

6682
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:26,480
now also at some point then when you
 

6683
01:50:26,480 --> 01:50:28,550
now also at some point then when you
have this diversity and you have these

6684
01:50:28,550 --> 01:50:28,560
have this diversity and you have these
 

6685
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:30,229
have this diversity and you have these
experiences exploration

6686
01:50:30,229 --> 01:50:30,239
experiences exploration
 

6687
01:50:30,239 --> 01:50:33,270
experiences exploration
you may want to um you may find

6688
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:33,280
you may want to um you may find
 

6689
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,350
you may want to um you may find
something that you can't stay away from

6690
01:50:35,350 --> 01:50:35,360
something that you can't stay away from
 

6691
01:50:35,360 --> 01:50:38,070
something that you can't stay away from
uh like for as it was computers it was

6692
01:50:38,070 --> 01:50:38,080
uh like for as it was computers it was
 

6693
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,030
uh like for as it was computers it was
ai it was

6694
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:39,040
ai it was
 

6695
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:41,270
ai it was
you know that you i just have to do it

6696
01:50:41,270 --> 01:50:41,280
you know that you i just have to do it
 

6697
01:50:41,280 --> 01:50:43,109
you know that you i just have to do it
you know and i uh you know and then

6698
01:50:43,109 --> 01:50:43,119
you know and i uh you know and then
 

6699
01:50:43,119 --> 01:50:43,430
you know and i uh you know and then
we'll

6700
01:50:43,430 --> 01:50:43,440
we'll
 

6701
01:50:43,440 --> 01:50:45,589
we'll
it will take decades maybe and you are

6702
01:50:45,589 --> 01:50:45,599
it will take decades maybe and you are
 

6703
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:46,470
it will take decades maybe and you are
pursuing it

6704
01:50:46,470 --> 01:50:46,480
pursuing it
 

6705
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:48,310
pursuing it
because you figured out that this is

6706
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:48,320
because you figured out that this is
 

6707
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:50,070
because you figured out that this is
really exciting and you can bring in

6708
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:50,080
really exciting and you can bring in
 

6709
01:50:50,080 --> 01:50:51,189
really exciting and you can bring in
your experiences

6710
01:50:51,189 --> 01:50:51,199
your experiences
 

6711
01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:52,390
your experiences
and there's nothing wrong with that

6712
01:50:52,390 --> 01:50:52,400
and there's nothing wrong with that
 

6713
01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:53,990
and there's nothing wrong with that
either but you asked what's the advice

6714
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
either but you asked what's the advice
 

6715
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,750
either but you asked what's the advice
for young people

6716
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:55,760
for young people
 

6717
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:57,990
for young people
that's the expiration part and then

6718
01:50:57,990 --> 01:50:58,000
that's the expiration part and then
 

6719
01:50:58,000 --> 01:50:59,030
that's the expiration part and then
beyond that if

6720
01:50:59,030 --> 01:50:59,040
beyond that if
 

6721
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:00,950
beyond that if
after that expiration you actually can

6722
01:51:00,950 --> 01:51:00,960
after that expiration you actually can
 

6723
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:03,109
after that expiration you actually can
focus and and build a career

6724
01:51:03,109 --> 01:51:03,119
focus and and build a career
 

6725
01:51:03,119 --> 01:51:04,870
focus and and build a career
and you know even there you can switch

6726
01:51:04,870 --> 01:51:04,880
and you know even there you can switch
 

6727
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:06,470
and you know even there you can switch
multiple times but

6728
01:51:06,470 --> 01:51:06,480
multiple times but
 

6729
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:08,390
multiple times but
but i think the diversity exploration is

6730
01:51:08,390 --> 01:51:08,400
but i think the diversity exploration is
 

6731
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:09,750
but i think the diversity exploration is
fundamental to having a

6732
01:51:09,750 --> 01:51:09,760
fundamental to having a
 

6733
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:13,510
fundamental to having a
successful career as is concentration

6734
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:13,520
successful career as is concentration
 

6735
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:15,510
successful career as is concentration
and spending an effort where it matters

6736
01:51:15,510 --> 01:51:15,520
and spending an effort where it matters
 

6737
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:16,550
and spending an effort where it matters
and and

6738
01:51:16,550 --> 01:51:16,560
and and
 

6739
01:51:16,560 --> 01:51:18,390
and and
but you're in better position to make

6740
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:18,400
but you're in better position to make
 

6741
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:19,910

that choice when you have done your
 

6743

that choice when you have done your
homework

6744

homework
 

6745
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,750

so exploration precedes commitment but

6746
01:51:23,750 --> 01:51:23,760
so exploration precedes commitment but
 

6747
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,669
so exploration precedes commitment but
both are beautiful

what do you think from that individual

01:51:39,189 --> 01:51:39,199
what do you think from that individual
 

6763
01:51:39,199 --> 01:51:41,109
what do you think from that individual
agent's perspective is the meaning of it

6764
01:51:41,109 --> 01:51:41,119
agent's perspective is the meaning of it

all

6766
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:41,760
all
 

6767
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,750
all
so far as humans you're just one agent

6768
01:51:43,750 --> 01:51:43,760
so far as humans you're just one agent
 

6769
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:44,870
so far as humans you're just one agent
who's going to be dead

01:51:44,870 --> 01:51:44,880
who's going to be dead
 

6771
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,709
who's going to be dead
unfortunately one day too soon

6772
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
unfortunately one day too soon

what do you think is the why

6774
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:51,760
what do you think is the why
 

6775
01:51:51,760 --> 01:51:55,109
what do you think is the why
of why that agent came to be

6776
01:51:55,109 --> 01:51:55,119
of why that agent came to be
 

6777
01:51:55,119 --> 01:51:58,470
of why that agent came to be
and uh eventually will be no more

6778
01:51:58,470 --> 01:51:58,480
and uh eventually will be no more
 

6779
01:51:58,480 --> 01:52:01,030
and uh eventually will be no more
is there meaning to it all yeah in

6780
01:52:01,030 --> 01:52:01,040
is there meaning to it all yeah in
 

6781
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:02,470
is there meaning to it all yeah in
evolution there is meaning

6782
01:52:02,470 --> 01:52:02,480
evolution there is meaning
 

6783
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:05,589
evolution there is meaning
everything is a potential direction

6784
01:52:05,589 --> 01:52:05,599
everything is a potential direction
 

6785

it doesn't mean that that there was an

well is that just a silly human notion

6866
01:53:28,070 --> 01:53:28,080
well is that just a silly human notion
 

6867
01:53:28,080 --> 01:53:30,070
well is that just a silly human notion
in uh individualistic society and though

6868
01:53:30,070 --> 01:53:30,080
in uh individualistic society and though
 

6869
01:53:30,080 --> 01:53:32,709
in uh individualistic society and though
she'll let go of that

01:53:32,709 --> 01:53:32,719
she'll let go of that

01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:34,709
she'll let go of that
do you find beauty in being part of the

paragliding and
 

6901
01:54:03,599 --> 01:54:06,830
paragliding and
you know all these things you've become

6902
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:06,840
you know all these things you've become
 

6903
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:08,229
you know all these things you've become
wiser

6904
01:54:08,229 --> 01:54:08,239
wiser
 

6905
01:54:08,239 --> 01:54:11,350
wiser
um there is a reason

6906
01:54:11,350 --> 01:54:11,360
um there is a reason
 

6907
01:54:11,360 --> 01:54:14,550
um there is a reason
for this uh life arc that

6908
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:14,560
for this uh life arc that
 

6909
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,709
for this uh life arc that
younger folks are more fearless in many

6910
01:54:16,709 --> 01:54:16,719
younger folks are more fearless in many
 

6911
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:19,189
younger folks are more fearless in many
ways it's part of the exploration

6912
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:19,199
ways it's part of the exploration
 

6913
01:54:19,199 --> 01:54:20,950
ways it's part of the exploration
you know they are the they are the

6914
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:20,960
you know they are the they are the
 

6915
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:22,550
you know they are the they are the
individuals who think hmm

6916
01:54:22,550 --> 01:54:22,560
individuals who think hmm
 

6917
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,270
individuals who think hmm
i wonder what's over those mountains or

6918
01:54:25,270 --> 01:54:25,280
i wonder what's over those mountains or
 

6919
01:54:25,280 --> 01:54:27,030
i wonder what's over those mountains or
what if i go really far in that ocean

6920
01:54:27,030 --> 01:54:27,040
what if i go really far in that ocean
 

6921
01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:27,990
what if i go really far in that ocean
what would i find

6922
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:28,000
what would i find
 

6923
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,950
what would i find
i mean older folks i don't necessarily

6924
01:54:30,950 --> 01:54:30,960
i mean older folks i don't necessarily
 

6925
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:32,070
i mean older folks i don't necessarily
think that way

6926
01:54:32,070 --> 01:54:32,080
think that way
 

6927
01:54:32,080 --> 01:54:34,149
think that way
but younger do and it's kind of

6928
01:54:34,149 --> 01:54:34,159
but younger do and it's kind of
 

6929
01:54:34,159 --> 01:54:37,109
but younger do and it's kind of
counterintuitive so yeah this is uh

6930
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:37,119
counterintuitive so yeah this is uh
 

6931
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:39,189
counterintuitive so yeah this is uh
and biologically it's like you know you

6932
01:54:39,189 --> 01:54:39,199
and biologically it's like you know you
 

6933
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:40,470
and biologically it's like you know you
have limited amount of time what can you

6934
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:40,480
have limited amount of time what can you
 

6935
01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:42,310
have limited amount of time what can you
do with it that matters

6936
01:54:42,310 --> 01:54:42,320
do with it that matters
 

6937
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:44,709
do with it that matters
so you try to you have done your

6938
01:54:44,709 --> 01:54:44,719
so you try to you have done your
 

6939
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:45,750
so you try to you have done your
exploration you

6940
01:54:45,750 --> 01:54:45,760
exploration you
 

6941
01:54:45,760 --> 01:54:48,470
exploration you
committed to a certain direction and you

6942
01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:48,480
committed to a certain direction and you
 

6943
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:50,390
committed to a certain direction and you
become an expert perhaps in it

6944
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:50,400
become an expert perhaps in it
 

6945
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:53,030
become an expert perhaps in it
what can i do that matters uh with with

6946
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:53,040
what can i do that matters uh with with
 

6947
01:54:53,040 --> 01:54:53,430
what can i do that matters uh with with
the

6948
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:53,440
the
 

6949
01:54:53,440 --> 01:54:55,750
the
limited resources that i have that's

6950
01:54:55,750 --> 01:54:55,760
limited resources that i have that's
 

6951

a lot of people myself included start
 

6955
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:02,470
a lot of people myself included start
thinking later on in their career

6956
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:02,480
thinking later on in their career
 

6957

trace and a bit of an impact even though
 

6961
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:09,669
trace and a bit of an impact even though
after the agent is gone yeah that's the

6962
