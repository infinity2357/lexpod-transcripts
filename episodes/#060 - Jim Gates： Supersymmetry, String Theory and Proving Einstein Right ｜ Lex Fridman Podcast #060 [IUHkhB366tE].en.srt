the stars in the sky are actually places
that we could travel to one day do you

172
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:22,670
that we could travel to one day do you
 

173

00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:27,709
outside our solar system Wow the
 

177
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:29,110
outside our solar system Wow the
question of whether humanity gets

outside of the solar system it's going
 

181
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:33,220
outside of the solar system it's going
to be a challenge and as long as the

so I love to dream of starships and
 

193
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:49,090
so I love to dream of starships and

barriers are just formidable if we just
 

197
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,580
barriers are just formidable if we just
kind of venture a little bit into

kind of venture a little bit into
 

199
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,930
kind of venture a little bit into
science fiction do you think the

science fiction do you think the
 

201
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,390
science fiction do you think the
spaceships if we are successful that

spaceships if we are successful that
 

203
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,160
spaceships if we are successful that
take us outside the solar system

204
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,170
take us outside the solar system
 

205
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,620
take us outside the solar system
we'll look like the ones we have today

that probably means cancer so that's one

00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:11,590
that probably means cancer so that's one

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:13,590
that probably means cancer so that's one

of the most formal challenge even if we
could get over the technology if you

could get over the technology if you

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:19,830
could get over the technology if you

00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,310
colonize Mars first do you think we'll
put a human on Mars and then do you

00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:38,320
put a human on Mars and then do you
 

281
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,890
put a human on Mars and then do you
think we'll put many humans on Mars so

debate what's the challenge there well
 

293
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,810

you think so

294
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:54,820
you think so
 

295
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,980
you think so
there are a couple of ways that I could

00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:55,990
there are a couple of ways that I could
 

297
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,480
there are a couple of ways that I could
slice this but the one that I think is

298
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:57,490
slice this but the one that I think is
 

299
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,740
slice this but the one that I think is
simplest for people and understand

simplest for people and understand
 

301
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,630
simplest for people and understand

to the moon in the 1960s it was about

304
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:05,710
to the moon in the 1960s it was about
 

305
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,190
to the moon in the 1960s it was about
10-year duration between the challenge

successfully landing a moon I was

310
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:12,970
successfully landing a moon I was
 

311
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,940
successfully landing a moon I was
actually here at MIT when that first

312
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:14,950
actually here at MIT when that first
 

313
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,980
actually here at MIT when that first
moon landing occurred so I remember

moon landing occurred so I remember
 

315
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,870
moon landing occurred so I remember
watching it on TV but how do we get

watching it on TV but how do we get
 

317
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,320
watching it on TV but how do we get
there well we had this extraordinary

00:08:52,249 --> 00:08:52,259
cost down I mean this is so do you have
 

425
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:54,620
cost down I mean this is so do you have
hope is this actually a sort of a

science and make it cheaper and get it
 

433
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,929
science and make it cheaper and get it
out there faster so bending the cost

434
00:09:05,929 --> 00:09:05,939
out there faster so bending the cost
 

435
00:09:05,939 --> 00:09:08,120
out there faster so bending the cost
curve is you'll notice that has been an

436
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,130
curve is you'll notice that has been an
 

437
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,590
curve is you'll notice that has been an
anchor there's the simplest way for me

438
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
anchor there's the simplest way for me

to discuss this with people about what
 

441
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:13,040
to discuss this with people about what
the challenge is so yes bending the cost

442
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,050
the challenge is so yes bending the cost
 

443
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:16,579
the challenge is so yes bending the cost
curve is certainly critical if we're

going to be successful now you asked
 

447
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:22,009
going to be successful now you asked
about the endeavors that are out there

448
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:22,019
about the endeavors that are out there

in terms of the routes that are being
 

459
00:09:33,689 --> 00:09:36,110
in terms of the routes that are being
pursued so let me give you one example

460
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,120
pursued so let me give you one example
 

461
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,030
pursued so let me give you one example
there and this one is going to be a

there and this one is going to be a
 

463
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,069
there and this one is going to be a
little bit more technical so if you look

464
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:40,079
little bit more technical so if you look
 

465
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,679
little bit more technical so if you look
at the kinds of rockets that both these

00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,809
technology that we're doing now is not
really that different than what was used

482
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:02,819
really that different than what was used
 

483
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:04,879
really that different than what was used
to go to the moon and there are

484
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:04,889
to go to the moon and there are
 

485
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,100
to go to the moon and there are
alternatives it turns out there's an

486
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,110
alternatives it turns out there's an
 

487
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:09,949
alternatives it turns out there's an
engine called a flare engine which so a

488
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:09,959
engine called a flare engine which so a
 

489
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:11,540
engine called a flare engine which so a
traditional rocket if you look at the

490
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:11,550
traditional rocket if you look at the
 

491
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,460
traditional rocket if you look at the
engine looks like a bell right and then

492
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:13,470
engine looks like a bell right and then
 

493
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,230
engine looks like a bell right and then
the flame comes out the bottom but there

494
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:15,240
the flame comes out the bottom but there
 

495
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,910
the flame comes out the bottom but there
is a kind of engine called a flare

496
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:16,920
is a kind of engine called a flare
 

497
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,519
is a kind of engine called a flare
engine which is essentially when you

498
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:19,529
engine which is essentially when you
 

499
00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,269
engine which is essentially when you
look at it it looks like an exhaust pipe

500
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:23,279
look at it it looks like an exhaust pipe
 

501
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,179
look at it it looks like an exhaust pipe
on like a fancy car that's you know long

502
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:26,189
on like a fancy car that's you know long
 

503
00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:28,400
on like a fancy car that's you know long
and elongate it and it's a type of

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:28,410
and elongate it and it's a type of
 

505
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,129
and elongate it and it's a type of
rocket engine that we know we know it's

506
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:31,139
rocket engine that we know we know it's
 

507
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:33,050
rocket engine that we know we know it's
there been preliminary testing we know

508
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:33,060
there been preliminary testing we know
 

509
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,389
there been preliminary testing we know
it works and it also is actually much

510
00:10:35,389 --> 00:10:35,399
it works and it also is actually much
 

511
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,150
it works and it also is actually much
more economical because what it does is

512
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,160
more economical because what it does is
 

513
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
more economical because what it does is
allow you to vary the amount of thrust

514
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:40,170
allow you to vary the amount of thrust
 

515
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,199
allow you to vary the amount of thrust
as you go up in a way that you cannot do

516
00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:42,209
as you go up in a way that you cannot do
 

517
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:42,710
as you go up in a way that you cannot do
with one of the

518
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
with one of the
 

519
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,889
with one of the
bell shaped engines so you would think

520
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:45,899
bell shaped engines so you would think
 

521
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,840
bell shaped engines so you would think
that an entrepreneur might try to have

522
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:50,850
that an entrepreneur might try to have
 

523
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,389
that an entrepreneur might try to have
the breakthrough to use flared nozzles

524
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:53,399
the breakthrough to use flared nozzles
 

525
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,059
the breakthrough to use flared nozzles
as they're called as a way to bend the

526
00:10:56,059 --> 00:10:56,069
as they're called as a way to bend the
 

527
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:57,379
as they're called as a way to bend the
cost curve because we keep coming back

528
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:57,389
cost curve because we keep coming back
 

529
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:59,480
cost curve because we keep coming back
that's going to be a big factor but

530
00:10:59,480 --> 00:10:59,490
that's going to be a big factor but
 

531
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,939
that's going to be a big factor but
that's not happening in fact what we see

532
00:11:01,939 --> 00:11:01,949
that's not happening in fact what we see
 

533
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,340
that's not happening in fact what we see
is what I think of as incremental change

534
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:04,350
is what I think of as incremental change
 

535
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,949
is what I think of as incremental change
in terms of our technology so I'm not

536
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:06,959
in terms of our technology so I'm not
 

537
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,809
in terms of our technology so I'm not
really very encouraged by what I

538
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:08,819
really very encouraged by what I
 

539
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,119
really very encouraged by what I
personally see so incremental change

540
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:11,129
personally see so incremental change
 

541
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:12,860
personally see so incremental change
won't bend the cost curve and I don't

542
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:12,870
won't bend the cost curve and I don't
 

543
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,420
won't bend the cost curve and I don't
see it

544
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:13,430
see it
 

545
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:17,030
see it
just linger on the sci-fi for one more

546
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
just linger on the sci-fi for one more
 

547
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,759
just linger on the sci-fi for one more
question sure do you think we're alone

548
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:19,769
question sure do you think we're alone
 

549
00:11:19,769 --> 00:11:21,730
question sure do you think we're alone
in the universe are we the only

550
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:21,740
in the universe are we the only
 

551
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,129
in the universe are we the only
intelligent form of life so there is a

552
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:25,139
intelligent form of life so there is a
 

553
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:28,249
intelligent form of life so there is a

when I hear this question and I'm I
 

557
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,230
when I hear this question and I'm I
recall the quote and it goes something

558
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,240
recall the quote and it goes something
 

559
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,369
recall the quote and it goes something
like if we're the only conscious life in

560
00:11:37,369 --> 00:11:37,379
like if we're the only conscious life in
 

561
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,800
like if we're the only conscious life in
the universe it's a terrible waste of

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:39,810
the universe it's a terrible waste of
 

563
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,829
the universe it's a terrible waste of
space because the universe is an

if you look at carbon-based life why we
 

639
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,960
if you look at carbon-based life why we
carbon base well it turns out it's

640
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:16,970
carbon base well it turns out it's
 

641
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,570
carbon base well it turns out it's
because of the way that carbon interacts

642
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:19,580
because of the way that carbon interacts
 

643
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,730
because of the way that carbon interacts
with elements which in fact is also a

644
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:21,740
with elements which in fact is also a

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,340
with elements which in fact is also a
reflection on the electronic Select

646
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:24,350
reflection on the electronic Select
 

647
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:26,950
reflection on the electronic Select
structure of the carbon nucleus so you

648
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:26,960
structure of the carbon nucleus so you
 

649
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,180
structure of the carbon nucleus so you
can look down the table developments and

650
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,190
can look down the table developments and
 

651
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:30,460
can look down the table developments and
say but gee do we see similar elements

652
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:30,470
say but gee do we see similar elements
 

653
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,530
say but gee do we see similar elements
the answer is yes and one that when it

654
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:32,540
the answer is yes and one that when it
 

655
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,230
the answer is yes and one that when it
often hears about in science fiction is

656
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,240
often hears about in science fiction is
 

657
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,510
often hears about in science fiction is
silicon so maybe there's a silicon-based

658
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:37,520
silicon so maybe there's a silicon-based
 

659
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,340
silicon so maybe there's a silicon-based
life-form out there if the conditions

660
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:39,350
life-form out there if the conditions
 

661
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,230
life-form out there if the conditions
are right but I think it's presumptuous

662
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:41,240
are right but I think it's presumptuous
 

663
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,170
are right but I think it's presumptuous
of us to think that we are the template

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:44,180
of us to think that we are the template
 

665
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:50,770
of us to think that we are the template
by which all life has to appear before

describing the universe it may have
little to do with the universe but in

little to do with the universe but in

well I don't even know if this one looks

00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:35,779
well I don't even know if this one looks
 

747
00:15:35,779 --> 00:15:37,769
well I don't even know if this one looks
like I think it does but the beautiful

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:37,779
like I think it does but the beautiful
 

749
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:43,389
like I think it does but the beautiful
surprising thing is that physics there

00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:43,399
surprising thing is that physics there
 

751
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:45,910
surprising thing is that physics there
are laws of physics very few laws of

down the functioning of the universe yes
that's extraordinarily surprising you

758
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:52,670
that's extraordinarily surprising you
 

759
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,309
that's extraordinarily surprising you
know I like to use the analogy with

00:15:54,309 --> 00:15:54,319
know I like to use the analogy with

00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:57,129
know I like to use the analogy with
computers and information technology if

00:15:57,129 --> 00:15:57,139
computers and information technology if
 

763
00:15:57,139 --> 00:15:59,679
computers and information technology if
you worry about transmitting large

you worry about transmitting large
 

765
00:15:59,689 --> 00:16:01,929
you worry about transmitting large
bundles of data one of the things that

766
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:01,939
bundles of data one of the things that
 

767
00:16:01,939 --> 00:16:03,489
bundles of data one of the things that
computer scientists do for us is they

768
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:03,499
computer scientists do for us is they
 

769
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:05,559
computer scientists do for us is they
allow for processes that are called

770
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:05,569
allow for processes that are called
 

771
00:16:05,569 --> 00:16:07,660
allow for processes that are called
compression where you take big packets

772
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:07,670
compression where you take big packets
 

773
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:09,280
compression where you take big packets
of data and you press them down into

774
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:09,290
of data and you press them down into
 

775
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,749
of data and you press them down into
much smaller packets and then you

776
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:10,759
much smaller packets and then you
 

777
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,489
much smaller packets and then you
transmit those and then unpack them at

778
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:12,499
transmit those and then unpack them at
 

779
00:16:12,499 --> 00:16:15,519
transmit those and then unpack them at
the other end and so it looks a little

780
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:15,529
the other end and so it looks a little
 

781
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:17,259
the other end and so it looks a little
bit to me like the universe is kind of

782
00:16:17,259 --> 00:16:17,269
bit to me like the universe is kind of
 

783
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:19,360
bit to me like the universe is kind of
done us a favor it's constructed our

done us a favor it's constructed our
 

785
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,939
done us a favor it's constructed our
minds in such a way that we have this

786
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:21,949
minds in such a way that we have this
 

787
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:23,740
minds in such a way that we have this
thing called mathematics which then as

788
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:23,750
thing called mathematics which then as
 

789
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,449
thing called mathematics which then as
we look at the universe teaches us how

790
00:16:25,449 --> 00:16:25,459
we look at the universe teaches us how
 

791
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:29,040
we look at the universe teaches us how
to carry out the compression process a

792
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:29,050
to carry out the compression process a
 

793
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,900
to carry out the compression process a
quick question about compression do you

794
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:31,910
quick question about compression do you
 

795
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:34,319
quick question about compression do you
think the human mind can be compressed

796
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:34,329
think the human mind can be compressed
 

797
00:16:34,329 --> 00:16:38,350
think the human mind can be compressed
the the biology could be compressed we

798
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:38,360

so many strange coincidences that you

so many strange coincidences that you

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,060
so many strange coincidences that you
just get a sense that something is going

916
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:13,070
just get a sense that something is going
 

917
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,440
just get a sense that something is going
on

consented at the speed of light yes so

00:19:22,499 --> 00:19:22,509
consented at the speed of light yes so
 

925
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:25,509
consented at the speed of light yes so
so the first thing is I would argue that

926
00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:25,519
so the first thing is I would argue that
 

927
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:28,389
so the first thing is I would argue that
it's probably very likely that

it's probably very likely that

it's probably very likely that

artificial intelligence ultimately will

artificial intelligence ultimately will

develop something like consciousness

develop something like consciousness
something that for us will probably be

something that for us will probably be
 

935
00:19:34,369 --> 00:19:36,669
something that for us will probably be
indistinguishable from consciousness so

936
00:19:36,669 --> 00:19:36,679
indistinguishable from consciousness so
 

937
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,139
indistinguishable from consciousness so
that's what I meant by our biological

00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:40,149
that's what I meant by our biological
 

939
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:42,129
that's what I meant by our biological
processing equipment that we carry up

processing equipment that we carry up
 

941
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,019
processing equipment that we carry up
here probably had does not hold a patent

942
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:44,029
here probably had does not hold a patent
 

943
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:46,180
here probably had does not hold a patent
on consciousness because it's really

on consciousness because it's really

on consciousness because it's really
about the data streams I mean that's as

00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:48,200
about the data streams I mean that's as
 

947
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,690
about the data streams I mean that's as
far as I can tell that's what we are we

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:49,700
far as I can tell that's what we are we

way I can tell you what I have seen in

00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:57,139
way I can tell you what I have seen in
 

955
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:00,070
way I can tell you what I have seen in
my lifetime about what humans are at the

my lifetime about what humans are at the

my lifetime about what humans are at the

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,669
level of consciousness so if that's the
case then you just need to have an

960
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:03,679
case then you just need to have an
 

961
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,869
case then you just need to have an
architecture that supports that

962
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:04,879
architecture that supports that
 

963
00:20:04,879 --> 00:20:07,299
architecture that supports that
information processing so let's assume

964
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:07,309
information processing so let's assume
 

965
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,739
information processing so let's assume
that that's true

966
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:08,749
that that's true
 

967
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,919
that that's true
that that in fact what we call

968
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:11,929
that that in fact what we call
 

969
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:14,499
that that in fact what we call
consciousness is really about a very

consciousness is really about a very

consciousness is really about a very
peculiar kind of data stream if that's

00:20:17,619 --> 00:20:17,629
peculiar kind of data stream if that's
 

973
00:20:17,629 --> 00:20:21,310
peculiar kind of data stream if that's
the case then if you can export that to

974
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:21,320
the case then if you can export that to
 

975
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,239
the case then if you can export that to
a piece of hardware something metal

Chinese water torture mythos drop drop

1118
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,010
Chinese water torture mythos drop drop
 

1119
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,770
Chinese water torture mythos drop drop
drop you get more and more information

1120
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:20,780
drop you get more and more information
 

1121
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:23,410
drop you get more and more information
and suddenly it all congeals and you get

1122
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:23,420
and suddenly it all congeals and you get
 

1123
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,360
and suddenly it all congeals and you get
a clearer picture and so that's the kind

1124
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,370
a clearer picture and so that's the kind
 

1125
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,310
a clearer picture and so that's the kind
of a standard way of working and I think

1126
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:27,320
of a standard way of working and I think
 

1127
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:30,100
of a standard way of working and I think
that's how most people think about the

1128
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,110
that's how most people think about the
 

1129
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,260
that's how most people think about the
way technical people solve problems that

1130
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:32,270
way technical people solve problems that
 

1131
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:35,530
way technical people solve problems that
it's kind of you accumulate this body of

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,600
it's kind of you accumulate this body of

information at a certain point you
 

1135
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,460
information at a certain point you
synthesize it and then boom there's

1136
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:39,470
synthesize it and then boom there's
 

1137
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,620
synthesize it and then boom there's
something new but I've also observed in

and calculus comes in two different
 

1159
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,890
and calculus comes in two different

calculus is the calculus that Newton
 

1167
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:15,190
calculus is the calculus that Newton
invented to describe motion since our

integral calculus was probably invented

1170
00:24:16,779 --> 00:24:16,789
integral calculus was probably invented
 

1171
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,549
integral calculus was probably invented
about seventeen hundred years earlier by

1172
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
about seventeen hundred years earlier by
 

1173
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,260
about seventeen hundred years earlier by
Archimedes but we didn't know that when

Archimedes but we didn't know that when
I was a freshman but so that's what you

1176
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:23,539
I was a freshman but so that's what you
 

1177
00:24:23,539 --> 00:24:26,200
I was a freshman but so that's what you
study as a student and the differential

1178
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:26,210
study as a student and the differential
 

1179
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:29,039
study as a student and the differential
calculus part of the course was to me I

1180
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:29,049
calculus part of the course was to me I
 

1181
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:31,510
calculus part of the course was to me I
wouldn't how do I say this it was

1182
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:31,520
wouldn't how do I say this it was
 

1183
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,310
wouldn't how do I say this it was
something that that by the driptip

1184
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,320
something that that by the driptip
 

1185
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,519
something that that by the driptip
method you could sort of figure it out

1186
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:35,529
method you could sort of figure it out
 

1187
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:38,649
method you could sort of figure it out
now the integral part of calculus I

1188
00:24:38,649 --> 00:24:38,659
now the integral part of calculus I
 

1189
00:24:38,659 --> 00:24:40,510
now the integral part of calculus I
could memorize the formula that was not

1190
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:40,520
could memorize the formula that was not
 

1191
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,330
could memorize the formula that was not
the formula that was not the problem the

1192
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:43,340
the formula that was not the problem the
 

1193
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,060
the formula that was not the problem the
problem was why in my own mind why do

1194
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,070
problem was why in my own mind why do
 

1195
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,570
problem was why in my own mind why do
these formulae work and because of that

1196
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:51,580
these formulae work and because of that
 

1197
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:54,460
these formulae work and because of that
when I was in the part of the calculus

1198
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:54,470
when I was in the part of the calculus
 

1199
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,899
when I was in the part of the calculus
course where we had to do multiple

1200
00:24:55,899 --> 00:24:55,909
course where we had to do multiple
 

1201
00:24:55,909 --> 00:24:58,330
course where we had to do multiple
substitutions to solve integrals I had a

1202
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:58,340
substitutions to solve integrals I had a
 

1203
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:01,539
substitutions to solve integrals I had a
lot of difficulty I was emotionally

1204
00:25:01,539 --> 00:25:01,549
lot of difficulty I was emotionally
 

1205
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:03,820
lot of difficulty I was emotionally
involved in my education because this is

1206
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:03,830
involved in my education because this is
 

1207
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,730
involved in my education because this is
where I think the passion emotion comes

1208
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:06,740
where I think the passion emotion comes
 

1209
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,070
where I think the passion emotion comes
to and it caused an emotional crisis

1210
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,080
to and it caused an emotional crisis
 

1211
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,600
to and it caused an emotional crisis
that I was having these difficulties

1212
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:10,610
that I was having these difficulties
 

1213
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:11,830
that I was having these difficulties
understanding the integral part of

1214
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:11,840
understanding the integral part of
 

1215
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,930
understanding the integral part of
calculus so why other why that's right

1216
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:13,940
calculus so why other why that's right
 

1217
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,789
calculus so why other why that's right
the why of it not the remember rote

1218
00:25:15,789 --> 00:25:15,799
the why of it not the remember rote
 

1219
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:17,440
the why of it not the remember rote
memorization of fact but the why of it

1220
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:17,450
memorization of fact but the why of it
 

1221
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:20,560
memorization of fact but the why of it
why does this work and so one night I

1222
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:20,570
why does this work and so one night I
 

1223
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,139
why does this work and so one night I
was over in my dormitory room in Baker

1224
00:25:23,139 --> 00:25:23,149
was over in my dormitory room in Baker
 

1225
00:25:23,149 --> 00:25:25,899
was over in my dormitory room in Baker
house I was trying to do a calculus

1226
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:25,909
house I was trying to do a calculus
 

1227
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:30,130
house I was trying to do a calculus
problem set I was getting nowhere I got

1228
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:30,140
problem set I was getting nowhere I got
 

1229
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,830
problem set I was getting nowhere I got
a terrific headache I went to sleep and

1230
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:32,840
a terrific headache I went to sleep and
 

1231
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:35,169
a terrific headache I went to sleep and
had this very strange dream and when I

1232
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:35,179
had this very strange dream and when I
 

1233
00:25:35,179 --> 00:25:38,950
had this very strange dream and when I
woke walk awakened I could do 3 & 4

1234
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:38,960
woke walk awakened I could do 3 & 4
 

1235
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,570
woke walk awakened I could do 3 & 4
substitutions and integrals with

1236
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:40,580
substitutions and integrals with
 

1237
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:43,600
substitutions and integrals with
relative ease now this to me wasn't an

1238
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:43,610
relative ease now this to me wasn't an
 

1239
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:46,060
relative ease now this to me wasn't an
astounding experience because I had

1240
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,070
astounding experience because I had
 

1241
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,049
astounding experience because I had
never before my life understood that one

1242
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:50,059
never before my life understood that one
 

1243
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:52,090
never before my life understood that one
subconscious is actually capable of

1244
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:52,100
subconscious is actually capable of
 

1245
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,130
subconscious is actually capable of
being harnessed to do mathematics

1246
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:54,140
being harnessed to do mathematics
 

1247
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,320
being harnessed to do mathematics
I experienced it this and I've

1248
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:56,330
I experienced it this and I've
 

1249
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,090
I experienced it this and I've
experienced this more than once so this

1250
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:58,100
experienced this more than once so this
 

1251
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,860
experienced this more than once so this
was just the first time why I remember

1252
00:25:59,860 --> 00:25:59,870
was just the first time why I remember
 

1253
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,710
was just the first time why I remember
it so so that's why when it comes to

1254
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:02,720
it so so that's why when it comes to
 

1255
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,900
it so so that's why when it comes to
like really wickedly tough problems I

1256
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:04,910
like really wickedly tough problems I
 

1257
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,820
like really wickedly tough problems I
think that the kind of creativity that

1258
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:06,830
think that the kind of creativity that
 

1259
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,480
think that the kind of creativity that
you need to solve them is probably this

1260
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:10,490
you need to solve them is probably this
 

1261
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,780
you need to solve them is probably this
second variety which comes somehow from

1262
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:13,790
second variety which comes somehow from
 

1263
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:18,760
second variety which comes somehow from
dreaming if you think again I told you

1264
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:18,770
dreaming if you think again I told you
 

1265
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:19,390
dreaming if you think again I told you
I'm Russian

1266
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm Russian
 

1267
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,580
I'm Russian
so we romanticize suffering but do you

1268
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:21,590
so we romanticize suffering but do you
 

1269
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:23,260
so we romanticize suffering but do you
think part of that equation is the

1270
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,270
think part of that equation is the
 

1271
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:26,860
think part of that equation is the
suffering leading up to that dreaming so

1272
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:26,870
suffering leading up to that dreaming so
 

1273
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,360
suffering leading up to that dreaming so
the suffering is I am convinced that

1274
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,370
the suffering is I am convinced that
 

1275
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,220
the suffering is I am convinced that
this kind of creative sick the second

1276
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,230
this kind of creative sick the second
 

1277
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,870
this kind of creative sick the second
mode of creativity as I like to call it

1278
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:34,880
mode of creativity as I like to call it
 

1279
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,030
mode of creativity as I like to call it
I'm convinced that this second mode of

1280
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:37,040
I'm convinced that this second mode of
 

1281
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:42,340
I'm convinced that this second mode of
creativity is in fact that suffering is

1282
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:42,350
creativity is in fact that suffering is
 

1283
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,890
creativity is in fact that suffering is
a kind of crucible that triggers it

1284
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:44,900
a kind of crucible that triggers it
 

1285
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,230
a kind of crucible that triggers it
because the mine I think is struggling

1286
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:47,240
because the mine I think is struggling
 

1287
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,390
because the mine I think is struggling
to get out of this and the only the only

1288
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:49,400
to get out of this and the only the only
 

1289
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,130
to get out of this and the only the only
way the heaters actually solved the

1290
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:51,140
way the heaters actually solved the
 

1291
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,930
way the heaters actually solved the
problem and even though you're not

1292
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:52,940
problem and even though you're not
 

1293
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,090
problem and even though you're not
consciously solving problems something

1294
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:55,100
consciously solving problems something
 

1295
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,340
consciously solving problems something
is going on and I've talked about to a

1296
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,350
is going on and I've talked about to a
 

1297
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,960
is going on and I've talked about to a
few other people in there are there

1298
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:58,970
few other people in there are there
 

1299
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:02,860
few other people in there are there
similar stories and so I the way I guess

1300
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:02,870
similar stories and so I the way I guess
 

1301
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,450
similar stories and so I the way I guess
so I think about it is it's a little bit

1302
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:04,460
so I think about it is it's a little bit
 

1303
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:07,120
so I think about it is it's a little bit
by like the way that thermonuclear

1304
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,130
by like the way that thermonuclear
 

1305
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,100
by like the way that thermonuclear
weapons work and if you know how they

1306
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:09,110
weapons work and if you know how they
 

1307
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,020
weapons work and if you know how they
work but a thermonuclear weapon is

1308
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,030
work but a thermonuclear weapon is
 

1309
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,640
work but a thermonuclear weapon is
actually two bombs there's an atomic

1310
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:12,650
actually two bombs there's an atomic
 

1311
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:14,470
actually two bombs there's an atomic
bomb which sort of Delta compression and

1312
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:14,480
bomb which sort of Delta compression and
 

1313
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,909
bomb which sort of Delta compression and
then you have a fusion bomb that goes

1314
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
then you have a fusion bomb that goes
 

1315
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,730
then you have a fusion bomb that goes
off and somehow that emotional pressure

1316
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:18,740
off and somehow that emotional pressure
 

1317
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:20,980
off and somehow that emotional pressure
I think acts like the first stage of a

1318
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:20,990
I think acts like the first stage of a
 

1319
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,990
I think acts like the first stage of a
thermonuclear weapon that's when we get

1320
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,000
thermonuclear weapon that's when we get
 

1321
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,380
thermonuclear weapon that's when we get
really big thoughts the analogy between

1322
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:26,390
really big thoughts the analogy between
 

1323
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:28,060
really big thoughts the analogy between
thermonuclear weapons and the

1324
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,070
thermonuclear weapons and the
 

1325
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,669
thermonuclear weapons and the
subconscious the the connection there is

1326
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:30,679
subconscious the the connection there is
 

1327
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,960
subconscious the the connection there is
uh at least visually that's kind of

1328
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:34,970
uh at least visually that's kind of
 

1329
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,520
uh at least visually that's kind of
interesting well I there may be fried it

1330
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:39,530
interesting well I there may be fried it
 

1331
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,799
interesting well I there may be fried it
would have a few things to say well part

1332
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:41,809
would have a few things to say well part
 

1333
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,240
would have a few things to say well part
of it is probably based on my own

1334
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,250
of it is probably based on my own
 

1335
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:45,070
of it is probably based on my own
trajectory through life my father was in

1336
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,080
trajectory through life my father was in

1339
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:50,070

years and so I started my life out on

1340
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
years and so I started my life out on
 

1341
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,650
years and so I started my life out on
military bases and so a lot of probably

1342
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:53,660
military bases and so a lot of probably
 

1343
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,180
military bases and so a lot of probably
the things that wander around in my

1344
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,190
the things that wander around in my
 

1345
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,560
the things that wander around in my
subconscious are connected to the

1346
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:56,570
subconscious are connected to the
 

1347
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,539
subconscious are connected to the
experience I apologize for all the

gonna be a little I think it's gonna

gonna be a little I think it's gonna
 

1401
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:16,950
gonna be a little I think it's gonna
work a little bit like the Cold War you

1402
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:16,960
work a little bit like the Cold War you
 

1403
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,090
work a little bit like the Cold War you
know we survived 50 60 years as a

know we survived 50 60 years as a
 

1405
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,240
know we survived 50 60 years as a
species with these weapons that are so

1406
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,250
species with these weapons that are so
 

1407
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:25,649
species with these weapons that are so
terrible that they could have actually

1408
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:25,659
terrible that they could have actually
 

1409
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,990
terrible that they could have actually
ended our form of life on this planet

1410
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:28,000
ended our form of life on this planet
 

1411
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,509
ended our form of life on this planet
but it didn't why didn't it well it's a

1412
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:30,519
but it didn't why didn't it well it's a
 

1413
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,220
but it didn't why didn't it well it's a
very bizarre and interesting thing but

1414
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:32,230
very bizarre and interesting thing but
 

1415
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,149
very bizarre and interesting thing but
it was called mutually assured

1416
00:29:33,149 --> 00:29:33,159
it was called mutually assured
 

1417
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:35,999
it was called mutually assured
destruction and so the cost was so great

1418
00:29:35,999 --> 00:29:36,009
destruction and so the cost was so great
 

1419
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,220
destruction and so the cost was so great
that people eventually figured out that

1420
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:38,230
that people eventually figured out that
 

1421
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:40,680
that people eventually figured out that
you can't really use these things which

1422
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:40,690
you can't really use these things which
 

1423
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,879
you can't really use these things which
is kind of interesting because if you

1424
00:29:41,879 --> 00:29:41,889
is kind of interesting because if you
 

1425
00:29:41,889 --> 00:29:43,320
is kind of interesting because if you
read the history about the development

1426
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:43,330
read the history about the development
 

1427
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,240
read the history about the development
of nuclear weapons businesses actually

1428

these things are not really weapons

these things are not really weapons

if you take that example and spread it

if you take that example and spread it
 

1441
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,169

out to the kind of technological

nuclear physics but I picked the example

1446
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:05,590
nuclear physics but I picked the example
 

1447
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:08,330
nuclear physics but I picked the example
of biology I could well imagine that

take that experience from nuclear

that it would be so there would be

that it would be so there would be
 

1461
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:22,230
that it would be so there would be
possible to develop technologies that

possible to develop technologies that
 

1463
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,360
possible to develop technologies that
are so terrible that you couldn't use

are so terrible that you couldn't use
 

1465
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:27,690
are so terrible that you couldn't use
them because the costs are too high and

00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:27,700
them because the costs are too high and

00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,970
them because the costs are too high and
that might cure us and many people have

without things on these two buckets so
you got to have things that's the matter

1744
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:20,760
you got to have things that's the matter
 

1745
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,460
you got to have things that's the matter
and then you have to either have other

1746
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,470
and then you have to either have other
 

1747
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:24,650
and then you have to either have other
objects that act on them to cause those

1748
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:24,660
objects that act on them to cause those
 

1749
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:27,800
objects that act on them to cause those
things to cohere to fixed finite

1750
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:27,810
things to cohere to fixed finite
 

1751
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,300
things to cohere to fixed finite
patterns because you need those fixed

1752
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:29,310
patterns because you need those fixed
 

1753
00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:31,190
patterns because you need those fixed
finite patterns as building blocks so

1754
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:31,200
finite patterns as building blocks so
 

1755
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,420
finite patterns as building blocks so
that's the way our universe looks to

1756
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:32,430
that's the way our universe looks to
 

1757
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:35,510
that's the way our universe looks to
people like me now the building blocks

1758
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:35,520
people like me now the building blocks
 

1759
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,000
people like me now the building blocks
do different things so let's go back to

1760
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,010
do different things so let's go back to
 

1761
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:40,310
do different things so let's go back to
these two buckets again let me start

1762
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:40,320
these two buckets again let me start
 

1763
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,870
these two buckets again let me start
with a bucket containing the particle of

1764
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:41,880
with a bucket containing the particle of
 

1765
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,600
with a bucket containing the particle of
light let me imagine I'm in a dusty room

1766
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:44,610
light let me imagine I'm in a dusty room
 

1767
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,940
light let me imagine I'm in a dusty room
with two flashlights and I have one

1768
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:46,950
with two flashlights and I have one
 

1769
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,370
with two flashlights and I have one
flashlight which I direct directly in

1770
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:49,380
flashlight which I direct directly in
 

1771
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,020
flashlight which I direct directly in
front of me and then I have you stand

1772
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,030
front of me and then I have you stand
 

1773
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,330
front of me and then I have you stand
over to say my left and then we both

1774
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:53,340
over to say my left and then we both
 

1775
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,830
over to say my left and then we both
take our flashlights and turn them on

1776
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:54,840
take our flashlights and turn them on
 

1777
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,850
take our flashlights and turn them on
make sure the beams go right through

1778
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:55,860
make sure the beams go right through
 

1779
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,740
make sure the beams go right through
each other and the beams do just that

1780
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:57,750
each other and the beams do just that
 

1781
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,790
each other and the beams do just that
they go right through each other they

1782
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:58,800
they go right through each other they
 

1783
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,140
they go right through each other they
don't bounce off of each other

1784
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:00,150
don't bounce off of each other
 

1785
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,550
don't bounce off of each other
the reason the room has to be dusty is

1786
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:01,560
the reason the room has to be dusty is
 

1787
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,990
the reason the room has to be dusty is
because we want to see the light because

1788
00:37:02,990 --> 00:37:03,000
because we want to see the light because
 

1789
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,550
because we want to see the light because
I'll let the rule dust wasn't there we

1790
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:04,560
I'll let the rule dust wasn't there we
 

1791
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,720
I'll let the rule dust wasn't there we
wouldn't actually see the light until it

1792
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:05,730
wouldn't actually see the light until it
 

1793
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,340
wouldn't actually see the light until it
got to the other wall right so you see

1794
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:07,350
got to the other wall right so you see
 

1795
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,040
got to the other wall right so you see
the beam because it's dust in the air

1796
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,050
the beam because it's dust in the air
 

1797
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,390
the beam because it's dust in the air
but the do things actually pass right

1798
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:11,400
but the do things actually pass right
 

1799
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
but the do things actually pass right
through each other they literally pass

1800
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:13,410
through each other they literally pass
 

1801
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,110
through each other they literally pass
right through they don't affect each

1802
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:15,120
right through they don't affect each
 

1803
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,180
right through they don't affect each
other at all when acts like that one's

1804
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:17,190
other at all when acts like that one's
 

1805
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:20,720
other at all when acts like that one's
not there things there are the particle

1806
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:20,730
not there things there are the particle
 

1807
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,180
not there things there are the particle
flight is the simplest example that

1808
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,190
flight is the simplest example that
 

1809
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,270
flight is the simplest example that
shows that behavior that's a boson now

1810
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,280
shows that behavior that's a boson now
 

1811
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,970
shows that behavior that's a boson now
let's imagine that I have to wear in the

1812
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:28,980
let's imagine that I have to wear in the
 

1813
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,710
let's imagine that I have to wear in the
same dusty room and this time you have a

1814
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:30,720
same dusty room and this time you have a
 

1815
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,510
same dusty room and this time you have a
bucket of balls and I have a bucket of

1816
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:32,520
bucket of balls and I have a bucket of
 

1817
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,730
bucket of balls and I have a bucket of
balls and we try to throw them so that

1818
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:34,740
balls and we try to throw them so that
 

1819
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,290
balls and we try to throw them so that
they pass so that we get something like

1820
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:36,300
they pass so that we get something like
 

1821
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,560
they pass so that we get something like
a beam throwing them fast right if they

1822
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:39,570
a beam throwing them fast right if they
 

1823
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:41,060
a beam throwing them fast right if they
collide they don't just pass through

1824
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:41,070
collide they don't just pass through
 

1825
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,470
collide they don't just pass through
each other they bounce off of each other

1826
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:42,480
each other they bounce off of each other
 

1827
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,990
each other they bounce off of each other
now that's mostly because they have

1828
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:45,000
now that's mostly because they have
 

1829
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,760
now that's mostly because they have
electric charge an electric charge is

1830
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:46,770
electric charge an electric charge is
 

1831
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,370
electric charge an electric charge is
like charges repel but mathematically I

1832
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:49,380
like charges repel but mathematically I
 

1833
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,930
like charges repel but mathematically I
know how to turn off the electric charge

1834
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:50,940
know how to turn off the electric charge
 

1835
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,850
know how to turn off the electric charge
if you do that you'll finally still

1836
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:52,860
if you do that you'll finally still
 

1837
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,250
if you do that you'll finally still
repel and it's because they are these

1838
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:55,260
repel and it's because they are these
 

1839
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:57,620
repel and it's because they are these
things we call fermions so this is how

1840
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:57,630
things we call fermions so this is how
 

1841
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:59,330
things we call fermions so this is how
you distinguish the things that are in

1842
00:37:59,330 --> 00:37:59,340
you distinguish the things that are in
 

1843
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,130
you distinguish the things that are in
the two buckets they are either bosons

1844
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,140
the two buckets they are either bosons
 

1845
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:05,870
the two buckets they are either bosons
or fermions which of them and maybe you

1846
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:05,880
or fermions which of them and maybe you
 

1847
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,930
or fermions which of them and maybe you
can mention the most popular of the

1848
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:08,940
can mention the most popular of the
 

1849
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,360
can mention the most popular of the
boson the most recently discovered she's

1850
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:11,370
boson the most recently discovered she's
 

1851
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:14,630
boson the most recently discovered she's
it's like yeah it's like when I was in

1852
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:14,640
it's like yeah it's like when I was in
 

1853
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,340
it's like yeah it's like when I was in
high school and there was a really

1854
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,350
high school and there was a really
 

1855
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,310
high school and there was a really
popular major rift her name is her name

1856
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:19,320
popular major rift her name is her name
 

1857
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,080
popular major rift her name is her name
is the Higgs particle these days

1858
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,090
is the Higgs particle these days
 

1859
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:26,000
is the Higgs particle these days
can you describe which which which of

1860
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,010
can you describe which which which of
 

1861
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,590
can you describe which which which of
the bosons and fermions have been

1862
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:27,600
the bosons and fermions have been
 

1863
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,870
the bosons and fermions have been
discovered hypothesized which have been

1864
00:38:29,870 --> 00:38:29,880
discovered hypothesized which have been
 

1865
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,580
discovered hypothesized which have been
experimentally value she was still out

1866
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:31,590
experimentally value she was still out
 

1867
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:35,750
experimentally value she was still out
there right so the two buckets that I've

1868
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
there right so the two buckets that I've
 

1869
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,480
there right so the two buckets that I've
actually described to you have all been

1870
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,490
actually described to you have all been
 

1871
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,930
actually described to you have all been
first hypothesized and then verified by

1872
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:41,940
first hypothesized and then verified by
 

1873
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,210
first hypothesized and then verified by
observation with the Higgs boson being

1874
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,220
observation with the Higgs boson being
 

1875
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:47,300
observation with the Higgs boson being
the most recent one of these things we

1876
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:47,310
the most recent one of these things we
 

1877
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:49,670
the most recent one of these things we
haven't actually verified the graviton

1878
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
haven't actually verified the graviton
 

1879
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,430
haven't actually verified the graviton
interestingly enough we mathematically

1880
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,440
interestingly enough we mathematically
 

1881
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,560
interestingly enough we mathematically
we have an expectation that gravitas

1882
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:54,570
we have an expectation that gravitas
 

1883
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,330
we have an expectation that gravitas
like this but we've not performed an

1884
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:56,340
like this but we've not performed an
 

1885
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:58,190
like this but we've not performed an
experiment to show that this is an

1886
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:58,200
experiment to show that this is an
 

1887
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,020
experiment to show that this is an
accurate idea that nature uses so

1888
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,030
accurate idea that nature uses so
 

1889
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,360
accurate idea that nature uses so
something has to be a carrier for the

1890
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,370
something has to be a carrier for the
 

1891
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,940
something has to be a carrier for the
force of gravity exactly because maybe

1892
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:04,950
force of gravity exactly because maybe
 

1893
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,090
force of gravity exactly because maybe
something way more mysterious than we so

1894
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:08,100
something way more mysterious than we so
 

1895
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:08,740
something way more mysterious than we so
when you say

1896
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:08,750
when you say
 

1897
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:13,150
when you say

yes but in other ways no it turned out
that the graviton is also if you look at

00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:29,360
you know if you try to imagine it you
 

1911
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,910
you know if you try to imagine it you
can sort of think of it as kind of a

rubber surface that's one popular

1914
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:33,290

1917
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,730
depiction of space-time it's not an
accurate depiction because the only

1918
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:36,740
accurate depiction because the only
 

1919
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,530
accurate depiction because the only
accuracy is actually in the calculus

1920
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:38,540
accuracy is actually in the calculus
 

1921
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,600
accuracy is actually in the calculus
that he uses but that's close enough

1922
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:40,610
that he uses but that's close enough

so if you have a sheet of rubber you can

1924
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:42,620
so if you have a sheet of rubber you can
 

1925
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:44,740
so if you have a sheet of rubber you can
wave it you can actually form a wave on

1926
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:44,750
wave it you can actually form a wave on
 

1927
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,920
wave it you can actually form a wave on
it space-time is enough like that so

1928
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:47,930
it space-time is enough like that so
 

1929
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:50,020
it space-time is enough like that so
that when space-time oscillates you

1930
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,030
that when space-time oscillates you
 

1931
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,540
that when space-time oscillates you
create these waves these ways carry

1932
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:52,550
create these waves these ways carry
 

1933
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:54,280
create these waves these ways carry
energy we expect them to carry energy in

1934
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,290

1935
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:56,380

quanta that's what a graviton is it's a

1936
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:56,390

1937
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,810
quanta that's what a graviton is it's a
wave in space-time and so the fact that

1938
00:39:58,810 --> 00:39:58,820
wave in space-time and so the fact that
 

1939
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,960
wave in space-time and so the fact that
we have seen the waves with LIGO over

00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:01,970
we have seen the waves with LIGO over
 

1941
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:03,760
we have seen the waves with LIGO over
the course of the last three years and

1942
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:03,770
the course of the last three years and
 

1943
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,430

00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,390
there would be a bunch of stuff in one
 

2053
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,510
there would be a bunch of stuff in one
upper quadrant and stuff in others and

2054
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:13,520
upper quadrant and stuff in others and
 

2055
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:16,030
upper quadrant and stuff in others and
then I would ask you a question does

2056
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:16,040
then I would ask you a question does
 

2057
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:20,310
then I would ask you a question does
that look symmetrical to you no no and

2058
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:20,320
that look symmetrical to you no no and
 

2059
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,810
that look symmetrical to you no no and
that's exactly right because we humans

2060
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:22,820
that's exactly right because we humans
 

2061
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:26,500
that's exactly right because we humans
actually have a very deeply programmed

2062
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:26,510
actually have a very deeply programmed
 

2063
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,440
actually have a very deeply programmed
sense of symmetry it's something that is

2064
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:29,450
sense of symmetry it's something that is
 

2065
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:33,040
sense of symmetry it's something that is
part of that mystery of the universe so

2066
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,050
part of that mystery of the universe so
 

2067
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,599
part of that mystery of the universe so
how would you make it symmetrical one

2068
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:34,609
how would you make it symmetrical one
 

2069
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:36,099
how would you make it symmetrical one
way you could is by saying those two

2070
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:36,109
way you could is by saying those two
 

2071
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:37,900
way you could is by saying those two
empty quadrants had things in them not

2072
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:37,910
empty quadrants had things in them not
 

2073
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,050
empty quadrants had things in them not
so and if you do that that's

2074
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,060
so and if you do that that's
 

2075
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,940
so and if you do that that's
supersymmetry so that's what I

2076
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:42,950
supersymmetry so that's what I
 

2077
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,770
supersymmetry so that's what I
understood when I was a graduate student

2078
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:44,780
understood when I was a graduate student
 

2079
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:48,760
understood when I was a graduate student
here in at MIT in 1975 weeding the idea

2080
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:48,770
here in at MIT in 1975 weeding the idea
 

2081
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,380
here in at MIT in 1975 weeding the idea
when the mathematics of this was first

2082
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:50,390
when the mathematics of this was first
 

2083
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,410
when the mathematics of this was first
being born supersymmetry was actually

2084
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:53,420
being born supersymmetry was actually
 

2085
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,960
being born supersymmetry was actually
born in the Ukraine in the late 60s but

2086
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:55,970
born in the Ukraine in the late 60s but
 

2087
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,190
born in the Ukraine in the late 60s but
we have this thing called the iron

2088
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:57,200
we have this thing called the iron
 

2089
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,140
we have this thing called the iron
curtain so we Westerners didn't know

2090
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,150
curtain so we Westerners didn't know
 

2091
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,680
curtain so we Westerners didn't know
about it but by the early 70s

2092
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:01,690
about it but by the early 70s
 

2093
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,820
about it but by the early 70s
independently there were scientists in

2094
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:03,830
independently there were scientists in
 

2095
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,020

the West who had rediscovered

2096
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,030
the West who had rediscovered
 

2097
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:08,200

supersymmetry symmetry bruno Cimino and

2098
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:08,210
supersymmetry symmetry bruno Cimino and
 

2099
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,380
supersymmetry symmetry bruno Cimino and
julius vests were their names so this

2100
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:11,390
julius vests were their names so this
 

2101
00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:13,750
julius vests were their names so this
was around 71 or 72 when this happened I

2102
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:13,760
was around 71 or 72 when this happened I
 

2103
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,849
was around 71 or 72 when this happened I
started graduate school in 73

2104
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:15,859
started graduate school in 73
 

2105
00:43:15,859 --> 00:43:19,090
started graduate school in 73
so around 74 75 I was trying to figure

2106
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:19,100
so around 74 75 I was trying to figure
 

2107
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,440
so around 74 75 I was trying to figure
out how to write a thesis so that I

2108
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:20,450
out how to write a thesis so that I
 

2109
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:21,760
out how to write a thesis so that I
could have become a physicist the rest

2110
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:21,770
could have become a physicist the rest
 

2111
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,450
could have become a physicist the rest
of my life

2112
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:22,460
of my life
 

2113
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:26,920
of my life
I did a lot of great advisor professor

2114
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:26,930
I did a lot of great advisor professor
 

2115
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:28,840
I did a lot of great advisor professor
James Young who had taught me a number

2116
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:28,850
James Young who had taught me a number
 

2117
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:31,450
James Young who had taught me a number
of things about electrons and weak

2118
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:31,460
of things about electrons and weak
 

2119
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,620
of things about electrons and weak
forces and those sorts of things

2120
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:33,630
forces and those sorts of things
 

2121
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,690
forces and those sorts of things
but I decided that if I was going to

2122
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:37,700
but I decided that if I was going to
 

2123
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:42,500
but I decided that if I was going to
have a really opportunity to maximize my

2124
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:42,510
have a really opportunity to maximize my
 

2125
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:45,470
have a really opportunity to maximize my
chances of being successful

2126
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:45,480
chances of being successful
 

2127
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,910
chances of being successful
I should strike it out in a direction

2128
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:46,920
I should strike it out in a direction
 

2129
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:48,860
I should strike it out in a direction
that other people were not studying and

2130
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:48,870
that other people were not studying and
 

2131
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:52,100
that other people were not studying and
so as a consequence I surveyed ideas

2132
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,110
so as a consequence I surveyed ideas
 

2133
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,450
so as a consequence I surveyed ideas
that were going that were being

2134
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:53,460
that were going that were being
 

2135
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,400
that were going that were being
developed and I came across the idea of

2136
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:55,410
developed and I came across the idea of
 

2137
00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:58,340
developed and I came across the idea of
supersymmetry and it was so the

2138
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:58,350
supersymmetry and it was so the
 

2139
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:00,860
supersymmetry and it was so the
mathematics was so remarkable that I

2140
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:00,870
mathematics was so remarkable that I
 

2141
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,740
mathematics was so remarkable that I
just it bowled me over I actually have

2142
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:03,750
just it bowled me over I actually have
 

2143
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,840
just it bowled me over I actually have
two undergraduate degrees my first

2144
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:05,850
two undergraduate degrees my first
 

2145
00:44:05,850 --> 00:44:06,800
two undergraduate degrees my first
undergraduate degree is actually

00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:17,850
good grades was mathematics I was a

00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,610
good grades was mathematics I was a

mathematics major thinking about
graduate school but my heart was in

you've encountered in this interplay
between math and physics it's the idea

00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:34,050
between math and physics it's the idea
 

2169
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:38,690
between math and physics it's the idea
of symmetry the fact that our innate

is the most beautiful thing it's very
 

2177
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,230
is the most beautiful thing it's very
strange but true that if symmetries were

2178
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:51,240
strange but true that if symmetries were
 

2179
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,660
strange but true that if symmetries were
perfect we would not exist and so even

2180
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:53,670
perfect we would not exist and so even
 

2181
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,250
perfect we would not exist and so even
though we have these very powerful ideas

sense it's only when you break those

2186
00:44:58,670 --> 00:44:58,680
sense it's only when you break those
 

2187
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:00,440
sense it's only when you break those
balances that you get creatures like

00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:00,450
balances that you get creatures like
 

2189
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,600
balances that you get creatures like
humans and objects like planets and

2190
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:02,610
humans and objects like planets and
 

2191
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,750
humans and objects like planets and
stars so although they are a scaffold

2192
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:05,760
stars so although they are a scaffold
 

2193
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,300
stars so although they are a scaffold
for reality they cannot be the entirety

for reality they cannot be the entirety
 

2195
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:14,470
for reality they cannot be the entirety
of reality so I I'm kind of naturally

2209
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:31,010
magic happens when you break the
symmetry okay so diving right back in

2210
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:31,020
symmetry okay so diving right back in
 

2211
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,400
symmetry okay so diving right back in
you mentioned four quadrants yes - - or

2212
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,410
you mentioned four quadrants yes - - or
 

2213
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:36,740
you mentioned four quadrants yes - - or
filled with stuff what can we do buckets

2214
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:36,750
filled with stuff what can we do buckets
 

2215
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:38,870
filled with stuff what can we do buckets
yeah and then there's crazy mathematical

2216
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:38,880
yeah and then there's crazy mathematical
 

2217
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,500
yeah and then there's crazy mathematical
thing ideas for filling the other two

2218
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:41,510
thing ideas for filling the other two
 

2219
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:44,810
thing ideas for filling the other two
what are those things so earlier the way

2220
00:45:44,810 --> 00:45:44,820
what are those things so earlier the way
 

2221
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,370
what are those things so earlier the way
I described these two buckets

2222
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:46,380
I described these two buckets
 

2223
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,890
I described these two buckets
as I gave you a story that started out

2224
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:48,900
as I gave you a story that started out
 

2225
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:51,620
as I gave you a story that started out
by putting us in a dusty room with two

2226
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:51,630
by putting us in a dusty room with two
 

2227
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:53,900
by putting us in a dusty room with two
flashlights and I said turn on your

2228
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:53,910
flashlights and I said turn on your
 

2229
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,670
flashlights and I said turn on your
flashlight I'll turn on mine the beans

2230
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:55,680
flashlight I'll turn on mine the beans
 

2231
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,830
flashlight I'll turn on mine the beans
will go through each other and the beams

2232
00:45:57,830 --> 00:45:57,840
will go through each other and the beams
 

2233
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,350
will go through each other and the beams
are composed of force carriers called

2234
00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:00,360
are composed of force carriers called
 

2235
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:00,950
are composed of force carriers called
photons

2236
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:00,960
photons
 

2237
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,500
photons
they carry the electromagnetic force and

2238
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:02,510
they carry the electromagnetic force and
 

2239
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:04,550
they carry the electromagnetic force and
they pass right through each other so

2240
00:46:04,550 --> 00:46:04,560
they pass right through each other so
 

2241
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,950
they pass right through each other so
imagine looking at the mathematics of

2242
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:06,960
imagine looking at the mathematics of
 

2243
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:09,050
imagine looking at the mathematics of
such an object which you don't imagine

2244
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:09,060
such an object which you don't imagine
 

2245
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,930
such an object which you don't imagine
people like me do that so you take that

2246
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:11,940
people like me do that so you take that
 

2247
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,360
people like me do that so you take that
mathematics and then you ask yourself a

2248
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:14,370
mathematics and then you ask yourself a
 

2249
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:14,900
mathematics and then you ask yourself a
question

2250
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:14,910
question
 

2251
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:16,820
question
you see mathematics is a palette it's

2252
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:16,830
you see mathematics is a palette it's
 

2253
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:21,020
you see mathematics is a palette it's
just like a a musical composer is able

2254
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:21,030
just like a a musical composer is able
 

2255
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:23,570
just like a a musical composer is able
to construct to construct variations on

2256
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:23,580
to construct to construct variations on
 

2257
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,850
to construct to construct variations on
a theme well a piece of mathematics in

2258
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:25,860
a theme well a piece of mathematics in
 

2259
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,290
a theme well a piece of mathematics in
the hand of a physicist something that

2260
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:27,300
the hand of a physicist something that
 

2261
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,570
the hand of a physicist something that
we can construct variations on so even

2262
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:29,580
we can construct variations on so even
 

2263
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,600
we can construct variations on so even
though the mathematics that Maxwell gave

2264
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:32,610
though the mathematics that Maxwell gave
 

2265
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,650
though the mathematics that Maxwell gave
us about light we know how to construct

2266
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:36,660
us about light we know how to construct
 

2267
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:38,810
us about light we know how to construct
very issues on that and one of the very

2268
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:38,820
very issues on that and one of the very
 

2269
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:40,760
very issues on that and one of the very
issues you can construct is to say

2270
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:40,770
issues you can construct is to say
 

2271
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:43,360
issues you can construct is to say
suppose you have a force carrier for

2272
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:43,370
suppose you have a force carrier for
 

2273
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:46,640
suppose you have a force carrier for
electromagnetism that behaves like an

2274
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:46,650
electromagnetism that behaves like an
 

2275
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:47,930
electromagnetism that behaves like an
electron that in that it would bounce

2276
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:47,940
electron that in that it would bounce
 

2277
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,730
electron that in that it would bounce
off of another one it's so that's

2278
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:49,740
off of another one it's so that's
 

2279
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,800
off of another one it's so that's
changing a mathematical term in an

2280
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:51,810
changing a mathematical term in an
 

2281
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,980
changing a mathematical term in an
equation so if you did that you would

2282
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:54,990
equation so if you did that you would
 

2283
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:57,620
equation so if you did that you would
have a force carrier so you would say

2284
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:57,630
have a force carrier so you would say
 

2285
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:58,940
have a force carrier so you would say
first it belongs in this force carrying

2286
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:58,950
first it belongs in this force carrying
 

2287
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,620
first it belongs in this force carrying
bucket but it's got this property of

2288
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:00,630
bucket but it's got this property of
 

2289
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:01,910
bucket but it's got this property of
bouncing off like electrons and so you

2290
00:47:01,910 --> 00:47:01,920
bouncing off like electrons and so you
 

2291
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,800
bouncing off like electrons and so you
say well gee wait no that's not the

2292
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:03,810
say well gee wait no that's not the
 

2293
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,210
say well gee wait no that's not the
right bucket so you're forced to

2294
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:05,220
right bucket so you're forced to
 

2295
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:06,140
right bucket so you're forced to
actually put it in one of these empty

2296
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:06,150
actually put it in one of these empty
 

2297
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:09,590
actually put it in one of these empty
quadrants so those sorts of things we

2298
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:09,600
quadrants so those sorts of things we
 

2299
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,330
quadrants so those sorts of things we
basically we give them so the photon

2300
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:13,340
basically we give them so the photon
 

2301
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,140
basically we give them so the photon
mathematically can be accompanied by a

2302
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:15,150
mathematically can be accompanied by a
 

2303
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:17,660
mathematically can be accompanied by a
photino it's the thing that carries a

2304
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:17,670
photino it's the thing that carries a
 

2305
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,660
photino it's the thing that carries a
force but has the rule of bouncing off

2306
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:19,670
force but has the rule of bouncing off
 

2307
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,670
force but has the rule of bouncing off
in a similar manner you could start with

2308
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:22,680
in a similar manner you could start with
 

2309
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,490
in a similar manner you could start with
an electron and you say okay so write

2310
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:25,500
an electron and you say okay so write
 

2311
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,110
an electron and you say okay so write
down the mathematical is electron I know

2312
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:27,120
down the mathematical is electron I know
 

2313
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,970
down the mathematical is electron I know
I want to do that physicists name Dirac

2314
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:28,980
I want to do that physicists name Dirac
 

2315
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,470
I want to do that physicists name Dirac
first told us how to do that back in the

2316
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
first told us how to do that back in the
 

2317
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,890
first told us how to do that back in the
nineteen late 20s early 30s so take that

2318
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:33,900
nineteen late 20s early 30s so take that
 

2319
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,720
nineteen late 20s early 30s so take that
mathematics and then you say let's let

2320
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:35,730
mathematics and then you say let's let
 

2321
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:38,150
mathematics and then you say let's let
me look at that mathematics and find out

2322
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:38,160
me look at that mathematics and find out
 

2323
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,190
me look at that mathematics and find out
what in the mathematics caused us two

2324
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:40,200
what in the mathematics caused us two
 

2325
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,660
what in the mathematics caused us two
electrons to bounce off of each other

2326
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:41,670
electrons to bounce off of each other
 

2327
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,670
electrons to bounce off of each other
even if I turn off the electrical charge

2328
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:43,680
even if I turn off the electrical charge
 

2329
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,370
even if I turn off the electrical charge
so I could do that and now let me change

2330
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:46,380
so I could do that and now let me change
 

2331
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,560
so I could do that and now let me change
that mathematical term so now I have

2332
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:48,570
that mathematical term so now I have
 

2333
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:49,850
that mathematical term so now I have
something that carries electrical charge

2334
00:47:49,850 --> 00:47:49,860
something that carries electrical charge
 

2335
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:52,760
something that carries electrical charge
but if you take two of them I'm sorry if

2336
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:52,770
but if you take two of them I'm sorry if
 

2337
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,960
but if you take two of them I'm sorry if
you turn their charges off they'll pass

2338
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:53,970
you turn their charges off they'll pass
 

2339
00:47:53,970 --> 00:47:56,270
you turn their charges off they'll pass
through each other so that puts things

2340
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:56,280
through each other so that puts things
 

2341
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,100
through each other so that puts things
in the other quadrant and those things

2342
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:58,110
in the other quadrant and those things
 

2343
00:47:58,110 --> 00:48:00,160
in the other quadrant and those things
we till we tend to call

2344
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,170
we till we tend to call
 

2345
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,960
we till we tend to call
we put the Essen in front of their name

2346
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:01,970
we put the Essen in front of their name
 

2347
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,150
we put the Essen in front of their name
so in the lower quadrant here we have

2348
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
so in the lower quadrant here we have
 

2349
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,490
so in the lower quadrant here we have
electrons and this now newly filled

2350
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:06,500
electrons and this now newly filled
 

2351
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:08,350
electrons and this now newly filled
quadrant we have select rods and the

2352
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:08,360
quadrant we have select rods and the
 

2353
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:12,460
quadrant we have select rods and the
quadrant over here we had corks over

2354
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:12,470
quadrant over here we had corks over
 

2355
00:48:12,470 --> 00:48:14,500
quadrant over here we had corks over
here we have squirts so now we've got

2356
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:14,510
here we have squirts so now we've got
 

2357
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:16,330
here we have squirts so now we've got
this balance pie and that's basically

2358
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:16,340
this balance pie and that's basically
 

2359
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,210
this balance pie and that's basically
what I understood as a graduate student

2360
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:18,220
what I understood as a graduate student
 

2361
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,760
what I understood as a graduate student
in 1975 about this idea of supersymmetry

2362
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:21,770
in 1975 about this idea of supersymmetry
 

2363
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,770
in 1975 about this idea of supersymmetry
that it was going to fill up these two

2364
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:23,780
that it was going to fill up these two
 

2365
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,360
that it was going to fill up these two
quadrants of the pie in a way that no

2366
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:25,370
quadrants of the pie in a way that no
 

2367
00:48:25,370 --> 00:48:27,910
quadrants of the pie in a way that no
one had ever thought about before so I

2368
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:27,920
one had ever thought about before so I
 

2369
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,340
one had ever thought about before so I
was amazed that no one else at MIT found

2370
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:30,350
was amazed that no one else at MIT found
 

2371
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:31,500
was amazed that no one else at MIT found
this an interesting idea

2372
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:31,510
this an interesting idea
 

2373
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:34,840
this an interesting idea
so that's it led to my becoming the

2374
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:34,850
so that's it led to my becoming the
 

2375
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:38,080
so that's it led to my becoming the
first person in MIT to really study

2376
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:38,090
first person in MIT to really study
 

2377
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:39,130
first person in MIT to really study
supersymmetry

00:48:43,870 --> 00:48:43,880
this is 1975 76 77 and in 77 I wrote the
 

2381
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,340
this is 1975 76 77 and in 77 I wrote the
first PhD thesis in the physics

where do you put some supersymmetry and
 

2413
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,390
where do you put some supersymmetry and
that's it's closer than string theory it

00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:28,400
that's it's closer than string theory it

00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:38,450
Einstein right we actually do talk about
 

2423
00:49:38,450 --> 00:49:40,750
Einstein right we actually do talk about
the fact that Albert Einstein in 1915

the fact that Albert Einstein in 1915
 

2425
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,630
the fact that Albert Einstein in 1915
wrote a set of equations which were very

2426
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:43,640
wrote a set of equations which were very
 

2427
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,340
wrote a set of equations which were very
different from Newton's equations and

2428
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:45,350
different from Newton's equations and
 

2429
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,980
different from Newton's equations and
describing gravity these equations made

2430
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:47,990
describing gravity these equations made
 

2431
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:49,510
describing gravity these equations made
some predictions that were different

00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
some predictions that were different
 

2433
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,550
some predictions that were different
from Newton's predictions and it

2434
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:51,560
from Newton's predictions and it
 

2435
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,240
from Newton's predictions and it
actually made three different

2436
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:52,250
actually made three different
 

2437
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:54,490
actually made three different
predictions one of them was not actually

2438
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:54,500
predictions one of them was not actually
 

2439
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,590
predictions one of them was not actually
a prediction but a post diction because

2440
00:49:56,590 --> 00:49:56,600
a prediction but a post diction because
 

2441
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,210
a prediction but a post diction because
it was known that mercury was not

00:49:58,210 --> 00:49:58,220
it was known that mercury was not
 

2443
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,430
it was known that mercury was not
orbiting the Sun in the way that Newton

00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:00,440
orbiting the Sun in the way that Newton
 

2445
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,180
orbiting the Sun in the way that Newton
would have told you

the second prediction that came out of

the second prediction that came out of
the theory of general relativity which

the theory of general relativity which
 

2461
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:20,779
the theory of general relativity which
Einstein wrote in 1915 was that if you

if so let me describe an experiment and

2464
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:23,890
if so let me describe an experiment and
 

2465
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:25,440
if so let me describe an experiment and
come back to it suppose like a glass of

2466
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:25,450
come back to it suppose like a glass of
 

2467
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,190
come back to it suppose like a glass of
water and I filled it up fill the glass

2468
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:29,200
water and I filled it up fill the glass
 

2469
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,500
water and I filled it up fill the glass
up and then I moved the glass slowly

2470
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:31,510
up and then I moved the glass slowly
 

2471
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:35,220
up and then I moved the glass slowly
back and forth between our two faces it

2472
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:35,230
back and forth between our two faces it
 

2473
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:37,230
back and forth between our two faces it
would appear to me like your face was

2474
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:37,240
would appear to me like your face was
 

2475
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:39,059
would appear to me like your face was
moving even though you weren't moving I

2476
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:39,069
moving even though you weren't moving I
 

2477
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,250
moving even though you weren't moving I
mean it's actually and what's causing it

2478
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:41,260
mean it's actually and what's causing it
 

2479
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,079
mean it's actually and what's causing it
is because the light gets bent through

2480
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:43,089
is because the light gets bent through
 

2481
00:50:43,089 --> 00:50:44,789
is because the light gets bent through
the glass has it passes from your face

2482
00:50:44,789 --> 00:50:44,799
the glass has it passes from your face
 

2483
00:50:44,799 --> 00:50:50,339
the glass has it passes from your face
to my eye so Einstein in his 1915 theory

2484
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:50,349
to my eye so Einstein in his 1915 theory
 

2485
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:53,220
to my eye so Einstein in his 1915 theory
of general relativity found out that

2486
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:53,230
of general relativity found out that
 

2487
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:55,529
of general relativity found out that
gravity has the same effect on light as

2488
00:50:55,529 --> 00:50:55,539
gravity has the same effect on light as
 

2489
00:50:55,539 --> 00:50:57,539
gravity has the same effect on light as
that glass of water it would cause beams

2490
00:50:57,539 --> 00:50:57,549
that glass of water it would cause beams
 

2491
00:50:57,549 --> 00:51:01,170
that glass of water it would cause beams
of light tube in now Newton also knew

2492
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:01,180
of light tube in now Newton also knew
 

2493
00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:03,510
of light tube in now Newton also knew
this but Einstein's prediction was that

2494
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
this but Einstein's prediction was that
 

2495
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,089
this but Einstein's prediction was that
light would Bend twice as much and so

2496
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:06,099
light would Bend twice as much and so
 

2497
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:08,940
light would Bend twice as much and so
here's a mathematical idea now how do

2498
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:08,950
here's a mathematical idea now how do
 

2499
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:11,789
here's a mathematical idea now how do
you actually prove it well you've got to

2500
00:51:11,789 --> 00:51:11,799
you actually prove it well you've got to
 

2501
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:13,890
you actually prove it well you've got to
watch yes just a quick pause on that

2502
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:13,900
watch yes just a quick pause on that
 

2503
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,440
watch yes just a quick pause on that
just the language you're using he found

out I can say he did a calculation it's
 

2507

out I can say he did a calculation it's
a really interesting notion that the one

a really interesting notion that the one

00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:26,430
of the most and one of the beautiful
things about this universe is you can do

00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:29,430
things about this universe is you can do
a calculation and and combined with some

00:51:29,430 --> 00:51:29,440
a calculation and and combined with some
 

2515
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,990

of that magical intuition that

00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:33,849
physicists have actually predict what
 

2519
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,839
physicists have actually predict what
would be was possible to experiment to

2520
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:36,849
would be was possible to experiment to
 

2521
00:51:36,849 --> 00:51:39,029
would be was possible to experiment to
validate that's correct so he found out

2522
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:39,039
validate that's correct so he found out
 

2523
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,329
validate that's correct so he found out
in the sense that there seems to be

2524
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:42,339
in the sense that there seems to be
 

2525
00:51:42,339 --> 00:51:44,849
in the sense that there seems to be
something here and mathematically should

2526
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:44,859
something here and mathematically should
 

2527
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:47,069
something here and mathematically should
bend gravity should bend like this

2528
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:47,079
bend gravity should bend like this
 

2529
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:50,160
bend gravity should bend like this
amount and so therefore that's something

2530
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:50,170
amount and so therefore that's something
 

2531
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,750
amount and so therefore that's something
that could be potentially and then come

2532
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:51,760
that could be potentially and then come
 

2533
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,829
that could be potentially and then come
up with an experiment that can be

2534
00:51:52,829 --> 00:51:52,839
up with an experiment that can be
 

2535
00:51:52,839 --> 00:51:55,500
up with an experiment that can be
validated right and that's the way that

2536
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:55,510
validated right and that's the way that
 

2537
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:58,130
validated right and that's the way that

works you earlier we spoke about the
 

2543
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:06,230
works you earlier we spoke about the
Higgs boson so why did we go looking for

2544
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:06,240
Higgs boson so why did we go looking for
 

2545
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,410
Higgs boson so why did we go looking for
the answer is they had back in the late

this so then we went looking for it so

2552
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:19,660
this so then we went looking for it so
 

2553
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:21,960
this so then we went looking for it so

was so let's not go there so we but we

2630
00:53:48,150 --> 00:53:48,160
was so let's not go there so we but we
 

2631
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,040
was so let's not go there so we but we
figured out that the data that was in

funny pictures that we could draw and so

2636
00:53:54,089 --> 00:53:54,099
funny pictures that we could draw and so
 

2637
00:53:54,099 --> 00:53:58,829
funny pictures that we could draw and so
that was stunning but it also was

2638
00:53:58,829 --> 00:53:58,839
that was stunning but it also was
 

2639
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:00,270
that was stunning but it also was
encouraging because there aren't

2645
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:08,460
first learned about in 1979 when I was
down at Harvard and I went out to

2646
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:08,470
down at Harvard and I went out to
 

2647
00:54:08,470 --> 00:54:10,319
down at Harvard and I went out to
Caltech for the first time and working

2648
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:10,329
Caltech for the first time and working
 

2649
00:54:10,329 --> 00:54:12,089
Caltech for the first time and working
with a great scientist by the name of

equations we don't notice all and so one
 

2655
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,120
equations we don't notice all and so one
of the things about solving problems

2656
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,130
of the things about solving problems
 

2657
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:20,579
of the things about solving problems
that you don't know how to solve is that

2658
00:54:20,579 --> 00:54:20,589
that you don't know how to solve is that
 

2659
00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:22,740
that you don't know how to solve is that
beating your head against the brick wall

2660
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:22,750
beating your head against the brick wall
 

2661
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:24,359
beating your head against the brick wall
is probably not a good philosophy about

2662
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:24,369
is probably not a good philosophy about
 

2663
00:54:24,369 --> 00:54:26,670
is probably not a good philosophy about
how to solve it so what do you need to

2664
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:26,680
how to solve it so what do you need to
 

2665
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,470
how to solve it so what do you need to
do you need to change your sense of of

2666
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:28,480
do you need to change your sense of of
 

2667
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,210
do you need to change your sense of of
reference your frame of reference your

2668
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:30,220
reference your frame of reference your
 

2669
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:33,690
reference your frame of reference your
perspective so when I saw these funny

2670
00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:33,700
perspective so when I saw these funny
 

2671
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:37,410
perspective so when I saw these funny
pictures I thought gee that might be a

2672
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:37,420
pictures I thought gee that might be a
 

2673
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,579
pictures I thought gee that might be a
way to solve these problems with

2674
00:54:38,579 --> 00:54:38,589
way to solve these problems with
 

2675
00:54:38,589 --> 00:54:40,999
way to solve these problems with
equations that we don't know how to do

2676
00:54:40,999 --> 00:54:41,009
equations that we don't know how to do
 

2677
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:43,620
equations that we don't know how to do
so that was for me when the first

2678
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:43,630
so that was for me when the first
 

2679
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:45,749
so that was for me when the first
attractions is that I now had an

2680
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:45,759
attractions is that I now had an
 

2681
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,150
attractions is that I now had an
alternative language to try to attack a

2682
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:48,160
alternative language to try to attack a
 

2683
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,809
alternative language to try to attack a
set of mathematical problems but I

2684
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:51,819
set of mathematical problems but I
 

2685
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:54,809
set of mathematical problems but I
quickly realized that a this

2686
00:54:54,809 --> 00:54:54,819
quickly realized that a this
 

2687
00:54:54,819 --> 00:54:56,370
quickly realized that a this
mathematical language was not known by

2688
00:54:56,370 --> 00:54:56,380
mathematical language was not known by
 

2689
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,130
mathematical language was not known by
mathematicians which makes it pretty

2690
00:54:59,130 --> 00:54:59,140
mathematicians which makes it pretty
 

2691
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,779
mathematicians which makes it pretty
interesting because now you have to

2692
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:00,789
interesting because now you have to
 

2693
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:02,940
interesting because now you have to
actually teach mathematicians about a

2694
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:02,950
actually teach mathematicians about a
 

2695
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,890
actually teach mathematicians about a
piece of mathematics because that's how

2696
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:04,900
piece of mathematics because that's how
 

2697
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,719
piece of mathematics because that's how
they make their living and the great

2698
00:55:06,719 --> 00:55:06,729
they make their living and the great
 

2699
00:55:06,729 --> 00:55:08,130
they make their living and the great
thing about working mathematicians of

2700
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:08,140
thing about working mathematicians of
 

2701
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,749
thing about working mathematicians of
course is the rigor with which they

2702
00:55:09,749 --> 00:55:09,759
course is the rigor with which they
 

2703
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:12,089
course is the rigor with which they
examine ideas so they make your ideas

2704
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:12,099
examine ideas so they make your ideas
 

2705
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:14,880
examine ideas so they make your ideas
better then they start out so I start

2706
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:14,890
better then they start out so I start
 

2707
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:15,690
better then they start out so I start
working with a group of mathematicians

2708
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:15,700
working with a group of mathematicians
 

2709
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,969
working with a group of mathematicians
and there's in that collaboration that

2710
00:55:17,969 --> 00:55:17,979
and there's in that collaboration that
 

2711
00:55:17,979 --> 00:55:19,170
and there's in that collaboration that
we figured out that these funny pictures

2712
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:19,180
we figured out that these funny pictures
 

2713
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,180
we figured out that these funny pictures
had error correcting codes buried in

2714
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:21,190
had error correcting codes buried in
 

2715
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:24,660
had error correcting codes buried in
them so can you can talk about what our

2716
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:24,670
them so can you can talk about what our
 

2717
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:27,709
them so can you can talk about what our
error correcting codes are sure so the

2718
00:55:27,709 --> 00:55:27,719
error correcting codes are sure so the
 

2719
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:29,670
error correcting codes are sure so the
simplest way to talk about error

2720
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:29,680
simplest way to talk about error
 

2721
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:34,019
simplest way to talk about error
correcting codes is first of all to talk

2722
00:55:34,019 --> 00:55:34,029
correcting codes is first of all to talk
 

2723
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:37,200
correcting codes is first of all to talk
about digital information digital

2724
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:37,210
about digital information digital
 

2725
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,089
about digital information digital
information is basically strings of ones

2726
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:39,099
information is basically strings of ones
 

2727
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:41,609
information is basically strings of ones
and zeros they're called bits so now

2728
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:41,619
and zeros they're called bits so now
 

2729
00:55:41,619 --> 00:55:44,880
and zeros they're called bits so now
let's imagine that I want to send you

2730
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:44,890
let's imagine that I want to send you
 

2731
00:55:44,890 --> 00:55:48,749
let's imagine that I want to send you
some bits well maybe I can show you

2732
00:55:48,749 --> 00:55:48,759
some bits well maybe I can show you
 

2733
00:55:48,759 --> 00:55:52,200
some bits well maybe I can show you
pictures but maybe it's a rainy day or

2734
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:52,210
pictures but maybe it's a rainy day or
 

2735
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:54,870
pictures but maybe it's a rainy day or
maybe the windows in your house are

2736
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:54,880
maybe the windows in your house are
 

2737
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,959
maybe the windows in your house are
foggy so sometimes when I show you a

2738
00:55:57,959 --> 00:55:57,969
foggy so sometimes when I show you a
 

2739
00:55:57,969 --> 00:56:01,229
foggy so sometimes when I show you a
zero you might interpret it as a one or

2740
00:56:01,229 --> 00:56:01,239
zero you might interpret it as a one or
 

2741
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:03,509
zero you might interpret it as a one or
other times when I show you one you

2742
00:56:03,509 --> 00:56:03,519
other times when I show you one you
 

2743
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:06,120
other times when I show you one you
might interpret it as a zero so if

2744
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:06,130
might interpret it as a zero so if
 

2745
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:07,410
might interpret it as a zero so if
that's the case that means when I try to

2746
00:56:07,410 --> 00:56:07,420
that's the case that means when I try to
 

2747
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:09,509
that's the case that means when I try to
send you this data it comes to you in

2748
00:56:09,509 --> 00:56:09,519
send you this data it comes to you in
 

2749
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:12,180
send you this data it comes to you in
corrupted form and so the challenge is

2750
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:12,190
corrupted form and so the challenge is
 

2751
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:15,299
corrupted form and so the challenge is
how do you get it to be uncorrupted in

2752
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:15,309
how do you get it to be uncorrupted in
 

2753
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:19,950
how do you get it to be uncorrupted in
the 1940s a computer scientist named

2754
00:56:19,950 --> 00:56:19,960
the 1940s a computer scientist named
 

2755
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,200
the 1940s a computer scientist named
hemming address the problem how do you

2756
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:22,210
hemming address the problem how do you
 

2757
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:25,380
hemming address the problem how do you
reliably transmit digital information

2758
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:25,390
reliably transmit digital information
 

2759
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:28,319
reliably transmit digital information
and what he came up with with was a

2760
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:28,329
and what he came up with with was a
 

2761
00:56:28,329 --> 00:56:29,099
and what he came up with with was a
brilliant idea

2762
00:56:29,099 --> 00:56:29,109
brilliant idea
 

2763
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:31,950
brilliant idea
the way to solve it is that you take the

2764
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:31,960
the way to solve it is that you take the
 

2765
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,599
the way to solve it is that you take the
data that you want to send and then once

2766
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:33,609
data that you want to send and then once
 

2767
00:56:33,609 --> 00:56:35,339
data that you want to send and then once
in your strings of 1 0 is your favorite

2768
00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:35,349
in your strings of 1 0 is your favorite
 

2769
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:37,229
in your strings of 1 0 is your favorite
string and then you've dumped more ones

2770
00:56:37,229 --> 00:56:37,239
string and then you've dumped more ones
 

2771
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:39,029
string and then you've dumped more ones
and zeros then but you dump them in in a

2772
00:56:39,029 --> 00:56:39,039
and zeros then but you dump them in in a
 

2773
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:41,999
and zeros then but you dump them in in a
particular pattern and this particular

2774
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:42,009
particular pattern and this particular
 

2775
00:56:42,009 --> 00:56:44,249
particular pattern and this particular
pattern is what a Hamming code is all

2776
00:56:44,249 --> 00:56:44,259
pattern is what a Hamming code is all
 

2777
00:56:44,259 --> 00:56:46,529
pattern is what a Hamming code is all
about so it's an error correcting code

2778
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:46,539
about so it's an error correcting code
 

2779
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:48,120
about so it's an error correcting code
because if you the person at the other

2780
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:48,130
because if you the person at the other
 

2781
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,589
because if you the person at the other
end knows what the pattern is supposed

2782
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
end knows what the pattern is supposed
 

2783
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,450
end knows what the pattern is supposed
to be they can figure out when once got

2784
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:51,460
to be they can figure out when once got
 

2785
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:53,180
to be they can figure out when once got
changed the zeros

2786
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:53,190
changed the zeros
 

2787
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:56,410
changed the zeros
so it turned out that our strange little

2788
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:56,420
so it turned out that our strange little
 

2789
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,790
so it turned out that our strange little
objects that came from looking at the

2790
00:56:58,790 --> 00:56:58,800
objects that came from looking at the
 

2791
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:00,530
objects that came from looking at the
equations that we couldn't solve it

2792
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:00,540
equations that we couldn't solve it
 

2793
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:01,970
equations that we couldn't solve it
turns out that when you look at them

2794
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:01,980
turns out that when you look at them
 

2795
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:03,710
turns out that when you look at them
deeply enough you find out they're

2796
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:03,720
deeply enough you find out they're
 

2797
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,170
deeply enough you find out they're
strictly that they have ones and zeros

2798
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:06,180
strictly that they have ones and zeros
 

2799
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:08,090
strictly that they have ones and zeros
back buried in them but even more

2800
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:08,100
back buried in them but even more
 

2801
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,800
back buried in them but even more
astoundingly that ones and zeroes are

2802
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:09,810
astoundingly that ones and zeroes are
 

2803
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,750
astoundingly that ones and zeroes are
not there randomly they are in the

2804
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:11,760
not there randomly they are in the
 

2805
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,330
not there randomly they are in the
pattern of error correcting codes so

2806
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:14,340
pattern of error correcting codes so
 

2807
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,000
pattern of error correcting codes so
this was an astounding thing that when

2808
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:17,010
this was an astounding thing that when
 

2809
00:57:17,010 --> 00:57:19,490
this was an astounding thing that when
we first got this result and tried to

2810
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:19,500
we first got this result and tried to
 

2811
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,960
we first got this result and tried to
publish it it took us three years to

2812
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:20,970
publish it it took us three years to
 

2813
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:22,220
publish it it took us three years to
convince other physicists that we

2814
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:22,230
convince other physicists that we
 

2815
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,410
convince other physicists that we
weren't crazy mm-hmm eventually we were

2816
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:24,420
weren't crazy mm-hmm eventually we were
 

2817
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:25,790
weren't crazy mm-hmm eventually we were
able to publish it I in this

2818
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:25,800
able to publish it I in this
 

2819
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,500
able to publish it I in this
collaboration of mathematicians and

2820
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:27,510
collaboration of mathematicians and
 

2821
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:31,370
collaboration of mathematicians and
other physicists and so every since then

2822
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:31,380
other physicists and so every since then
 

2823
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:33,710
other physicists and so every since then
I have actually been looking at the

2824
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:33,720
I have actually been looking at the
 

2825
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:36,380
I have actually been looking at the
mathematics of these objects trying to

2826
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:36,390
mathematics of these objects trying to
 

2827
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,120
mathematics of these objects trying to
still understand properties of the

2828
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:38,130
still understand properties of the
 

2829
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:40,040
still understand properties of the
equations and I want to understand the

2830
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:40,050

00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,510
the craziest thing about these to me is
that when you look at physics and try to

unless there's an error correcting code
 

2919
00:59:25,710 --> 00:59:28,940
unless there's an error correcting code
present so as as if the universe says

00:59:32,579 --> 00:59:33,740
unless there's something about an error
correcting code this to me is the

2926
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:33,750
correcting code this to me is the
 

2927
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,349
correcting code this to me is the
craziest thing that I've ever personally

2928
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:36,359
craziest thing that I've ever personally
 

2929
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:38,540
craziest thing that I've ever personally
encountered in my research and it

2930
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:38,550
encountered in my research and it
 

2931
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:41,540
encountered in my research and it
actually got me to wondering how this

2932
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:41,550
actually got me to wondering how this
 

2933
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:43,309
actually got me to wondering how this
could come about because the only place

2934
00:59:43,309 --> 00:59:43,319
could come about because the only place
 

2935
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:45,380
could come about because the only place
in nature that we know about error

2936
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:45,390
in nature that we know about error
 

2937
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,809
in nature that we know about error
correcting codes is genetics and in

2938
00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:47,819
correcting codes is genetics and in
 

2939
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:50,359
correcting codes is genetics and in
genetics we think it was evolution that

2940
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:50,369
genetics we think it was evolution that
 

2941
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:52,040
genetics we think it was evolution that
causes air correcting codes to be in

2942
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:52,050
causes air correcting codes to be in
 

2943
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:54,079
causes air correcting codes to be in
genomes and so does that mean that there

2944
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:54,089
genomes and so does that mean that there
 

2945
00:59:54,089 --> 00:59:55,309
genomes and so does that mean that there
was some kind of form of evolution

2946
00:59:55,309 --> 00:59:55,319
was some kind of form of evolution
 

2947
00:59:55,319 --> 00:59:57,260
was some kind of form of evolution

I've wondered about from time to time
since making these discoveries do you

since making these discoveries do you
 

2957
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:08,000
since making these discoveries do you
think such an idea could be fundamental

2958
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:08,010
think such an idea could be fundamental
 

2959
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,069
think such an idea could be fundamental
or is it emergent throughout all the

right one can you maybe describe what is
string theory and two what are the open

3146
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:53,859
string theory and two what are the open
 

3147
01:03:53,859 --> 01:03:57,980
string theory and two what are the open
challenges so what is string theory well

3148
01:03:57,980 --> 01:03:57,990
challenges so what is string theory well
 

3149
01:03:57,990 --> 01:04:00,750
challenges so what is string theory well
let the simplest explanation I can

3150
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:00,760
let the simplest explanation I can
 

3151
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:05,400
let the simplest explanation I can
provide is to go back and ask water

3152
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:05,410
provide is to go back and ask water
 

3153
01:04:05,410 --> 01:04:07,590
provide is to go back and ask water
particles which is the question you

3154
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:07,600
particles which is the question you
 

3155
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,430
particles which is the question you
first ask me what's the smallest thing

3156
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:11,440
first ask me what's the smallest thing
 

3157
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,680
first ask me what's the smallest thing
yeah what's the smallest thing so

3158
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:15,690
yeah what's the smallest thing so
 

3159
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:20,040
yeah what's the smallest thing so
particles one way I try to describe

3160
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:20,050
particles one way I try to describe
 

3161
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,290
particles one way I try to describe
particles to people a star I want you to

3162
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:22,300
particles to people a star I want you to
 

3163
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:25,560
particles to people a star I want you to
imagine a little ball and I want you to

3164
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:25,570
imagine a little ball and I want you to
 

3165
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:26,970
imagine a little ball and I want you to
let this size of that ball shrink into

3166
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:26,980
let this size of that ball shrink into
 

3167
01:04:26,980 --> 01:04:30,270
let this size of that ball shrink into
it has no extent whatsoever but it still

3168
01:04:30,270 --> 01:04:30,280
it has no extent whatsoever but it still
 

3169
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:34,020
it has no extent whatsoever but it still
has the mass of the ball that's actually

3170
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:34,030
has the mass of the ball that's actually
 

3171
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:36,030
has the mass of the ball that's actually
what Newton was working with when he

3172
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:36,040
what Newton was working with when he
 

3173
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,220
what Newton was working with when he
first invented physics he's the real

3174
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:38,230
first invented physics he's the real
 

3175
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:40,290
first invented physics he's the real
inventor of the massive particle which

3176
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:40,300
inventor of the massive particle which
 

3177
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,359
inventor of the massive particle which
is this idea that underlies all of

3178
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:42,369
is this idea that underlies all of
 

3179
01:04:42,369 --> 01:04:45,690
is this idea that underlies all of
physics so that's where we start it's a

3180
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:45,700
physics so that's where we start it's a
 

3181
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,180
physics so that's where we start it's a
mathematical construct that you get by

3182
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:48,190
mathematical construct that you get by
 

3183
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:51,109
mathematical construct that you get by
taking a limit of things that you know

3184
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
taking a limit of things that you know
 

3185
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,490
taking a limit of things that you know
so what's a string well in the same

3186
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:53,500
so what's a string well in the same
 

3187
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:55,980
so what's a string well in the same

01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:00,510
start with a piece of spaghetti so we
all know what that looks like and now I

all know what that looks like and now I
 

3193
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:03,210
all know what that looks like and now I
want you to let the thickness of the

want you to let the thickness of the
 

3195
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:05,460
want you to let the thickness of the
spaghetti shrink until it has no

3197
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,340

thickness mathematically I mean words

3198
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:08,350

I just nodded I do and that's one reason
why I was happy to focus on on the story

why I was happy to focus on on the story
 

3323
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,739
why I was happy to focus on on the story
of how Einstein became a global

01:07:50,019 --> 01:07:50,029
went over the the his history where in
 

3329
01:07:50,029 --> 01:07:51,999
went over the the his history where in
1915 he he came up this piece of

3330
01:07:51,999 --> 01:07:52,009
1915 he he came up this piece of
 

3331
01:07:52,009 --> 01:07:53,390
1915 he he came up this piece of
mathematics

3332
01:07:53,390 --> 01:07:53,400
mathematics
 

3333
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:55,920
mathematics
used it to do some calculations and then

3334
01:07:55,920 --> 01:07:55,930
used it to do some calculations and then
 

3335
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,450
used it to do some calculations and then
made a prediction yes

3336
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:57,460
made a prediction yes
 

3337
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,569
made a prediction yes
but making a prediction is not enough

3338
01:07:59,569 --> 01:07:59,579
but making a prediction is not enough
 

3339
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:02,299
but making a prediction is not enough
someone's got to go out and measure and

01:08:02,299 --> 01:08:02,309
someone's got to go out and measure and
 

3341
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:05,819
someone's got to go out and measure and
so string theory is in that in-between

3342
01:08:05,819 --> 01:08:05,829
so string theory is in that in-between
 

3343
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:08,940
so string theory is in that in-between

about how science kind of feels if

01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:21,450
people who do science even though that
may not be obvious to everyone so for me

3390
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:21,460
may not be obvious to everyone so for me

I wanted to write this book for a couple
of reasons I wanted young people to

of reasons I wanted young people to
 

3395
01:09:25,109 --> 01:09:30,050
of reasons I wanted young people to
understand that the seeming alien Giants

understand that the seeming alien Giants
 

3397
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:32,760
understand that the seeming alien Giants
that lived before them were just as

3398

that lived before them were just as
 

3399
01:09:32,770 --> 01:09:34,829
that lived before them were just as
human as they are you get married you

3400
01:09:34,829 --> 01:09:34,839
human as they are you get married you
 

3401
01:09:34,839 --> 01:09:36,720
human as they are you get married you
get divorced again married they get

3402
01:09:36,720 --> 01:09:36,730
get divorced again married they get
 

3403
01:09:36,730 --> 01:09:38,640
get divorced again married they get
worse they do terrible things they do

3404
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:38,650
worse they do terrible things they do
 

3405
01:09:38,650 --> 01:09:40,680
worse they do terrible things they do
great things they're people they're just

3406
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:40,690
great things they're people they're just
 

3407
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:43,140
great things they're people they're just
people like you and so that part of

3408
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:43,150
people like you and so that part of
 

3409
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,820
people like you and so that part of
telling the story allowed me to get that

3410
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:44,830
telling the story allowed me to get that
 

3411
01:09:44,830 --> 01:09:46,919
telling the story allowed me to get that
out there for both young people interest

3412
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:46,929
out there for both young people interest
 

3413
01:09:46,929 --> 01:09:48,769
out there for both young people interest
in the sciences as well as the public

3414
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:48,779
in the sciences as well as the public
 

3415
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:52,979
in the sciences as well as the public
but the other part of the story is I

3416
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:52,989
but the other part of the story is I
 

3417
01:09:52,989 --> 01:09:56,970
but the other part of the story is I
wanted to open up sort of what what it

3418
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:56,980
wanted to open up sort of what what it
 

3419
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,750
wanted to open up sort of what what it
was like now I'm a scientist and so I

3420
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:00,760
was like now I'm a scientist and so I
 

3421
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,490
was like now I'm a scientist and so I
will not pretend to be a great writer I

3422
01:10:02,490 --> 01:10:02,500
will not pretend to be a great writer I
 

3423
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,740
will not pretend to be a great writer I
understand a lot about mathematics and

01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:04,750
understand a lot about mathematics and
 

3425
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,860
understand a lot about mathematics and
I've even created my own mathematic

3426
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:06,870
I've even created my own mathematic
 

3427
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:09,980
I've even created my own mathematic
that you know it's kind of a weird thing

3428
01:10:09,980 --> 01:10:09,990
that you know it's kind of a weird thing
 

3429
01:10:09,990 --> 01:10:13,490
that you know it's kind of a weird thing
to be able to do but in order to tell

to be able to do but in order to tell
 

3431
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,530
to be able to do but in order to tell
the story you really have to have an

3432
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:15,540
the story you really have to have an
 

3433
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:19,550
the story you really have to have an
incredible master of the narrative and

3434
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:19,560
incredible master of the narrative and
 

3435
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:22,070
incredible master of the narrative and
my that was my co-author Kathy Pelletier

we so we formed this conjoined brain I

01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:26,310
we so we formed this conjoined brain I
 

3441
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,280
we so we formed this conjoined brain I
used to call us she's the call us

professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle my
 

3445
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:31,580
professor Higgins and Eliza Doolittle my
expression for us was that we were a

3446
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:31,590
expression for us was that we were a
 

3447
01:10:31,590 --> 01:10:34,430
expression for us was that we were a
conjoined brain to tell this story and

01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:34,440
conjoined brain to tell this story and
 

3449
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,150
conjoined brain to tell this story and
it allowed so what are some magical

3450
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:38,160
it allowed so what are some magical
 

3451
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:41,960
it allowed so what are some magical
moments to me the first magical moment

3452
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:41,970
moments to me the first magical moment
 

3453
01:10:41,970 --> 01:10:46,040
moments to me the first magical moment
in telling the story was looking at

3454
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:46,050
in telling the story was looking at
 

3455
01:10:46,050 --> 01:10:48,830
in telling the story was looking at
Albert Einstein in his struggle because

3456
01:10:48,830 --> 01:10:48,840
Albert Einstein in his struggle because
 

3457
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,260
Albert Einstein in his struggle because
although we regard him as a genius

3458
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:51,270
although we regard him as a genius
 

3459
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:53,660
although we regard him as a genius
as I said in 1911 he actually made an

3460
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:53,670
as I said in 1911 he actually made an
 

3461
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:54,920
as I said in 1911 he actually made an
incorrect prediction about spending

3462
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:54,930
incorrect prediction about spending
 

3463
01:10:54,930 --> 01:10:56,810
incorrect prediction about spending
starlight and that's actually what set

3464
01:10:56,810 --> 01:10:56,820
starlight and that's actually what set
 

3465
01:10:56,820 --> 01:11:01,460
starlight and that's actually what set
the astronomers off in 1914 there was an

3466
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:01,470
the astronomers off in 1914 there was an
 

3467
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:06,470
the astronomers off in 1914 there was an
eclipse and by various accidents of war

3468
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:06,480
eclipse and by various accidents of war
 

3469
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:08,750
eclipse and by various accidents of war
and weather and all sorts of things that

3470
01:11:08,750 --> 01:11:08,760
and weather and all sorts of things that
 

3471
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,910
and weather and all sorts of things that
we talked about in the book no one was

3472
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:10,920
we talked about in the book no one was
 

3473
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:13,730
we talked about in the book no one was
able to make the measurement if they had

3474
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:13,740
able to make the measurement if they had
 

3475
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:16,640
able to make the measurement if they had
made the measurement it would have

3476
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:16,650
made the measurement it would have
 

3477
01:11:16,650 --> 01:11:20,320
made the measurement it would have
disagreed with his 1911 prediction

3478
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:20,330
disagreed with his 1911 prediction
 

3479
01:11:20,330 --> 01:11:23,450
disagreed with his 1911 prediction
because nature only has one answer and

3480
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:23,460
because nature only has one answer and
 

3481
01:11:23,460 --> 01:11:26,980
because nature only has one answer and
so you then you see how fortunate he was

3482
01:11:26,980 --> 01:11:26,990
so you then you see how fortunate he was
 

3483
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:32,150
so you then you see how fortunate he was
that Wars and bad weather and accidents

3484
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:32,160
that Wars and bad weather and accidents
 

3485
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:34,130
that Wars and bad weather and accidents
and transporting equipment stopped any

3486
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:34,140
and transporting equipment stopped any
 

3487
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:36,170
and transporting equipment stopped any
measurements from being made so he

3488
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:36,180
measurements from being made so he
 

3489
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:39,200
measurements from being made so he
corrects himself in 1915 and but the

3490
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:39,210
corrects himself in 1915 and but the
 

3491
01:11:39,210 --> 01:11:40,580
corrects himself in 1915 and but the
astronomers are already out there trying

3492
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:40,590
astronomers are already out there trying
 

3493
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:42,380
astronomers are already out there trying
to make the measurement so now he gives

3494
01:11:42,380 --> 01:11:42,390
to make the measurement so now he gives
 

3495
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,150
to make the measurement so now he gives
them a different number and it turns out

3496
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:44,160
them a different number and it turns out
 

3497
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,560
them a different number and it turns out
that's the number that nature agrees

3498
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:45,570
that's the number that nature agrees
 

3499
01:11:45,570 --> 01:11:49,520
that's the number that nature agrees
with so it gives you a sense of this is

3500
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:49,530
with so it gives you a sense of this is
 

3501
01:11:49,530 --> 01:11:51,050
with so it gives you a sense of this is
a person struggling with something

3502
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:51,060
a person struggling with something
 

3503
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:55,130
a person struggling with something
deeply and it although his deep insight

3504
01:11:55,130 --> 01:11:55,140
deeply and it although his deep insight
 

3505
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:57,830
deeply and it although his deep insight
led him to this it is the circumstance

3506
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:57,840
led him to this it is the circumstance
 

3507
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,940
led him to this it is the circumstance
of time place an accident but through

3508
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:01,950
of time place an accident but through
 

3509
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:04,880
of time place an accident but through
which we view him and it could the story

3510
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:04,890
which we view him and it could the story
 

3511
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:06,340
which we view him and it could the story
could have turned out very differently

3512
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:06,350
could have turned out very differently
 

3513
01:12:06,350 --> 01:12:09,890
could have turned out very differently
where first he makes the prediction the

3514
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:09,900
where first he makes the prediction the
 

3515
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:12,200
where first he makes the prediction the
measurements are made in 1914 they

3516
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:12,210
measurements are made in 1914 they
 

3517
01:12:12,210 --> 01:12:14,150
measurements are made in 1914 they
disagree with his prediction and so what

3518
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:14,160
disagree with his prediction and so what
 

3519
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,070
disagree with his prediction and so what
would the world view him as well he's

3520
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:16,080
would the world view him as well he's
 

3521
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,600
would the world view him as well he's
this professor who made this prediction

3522
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:17,610
this professor who made this prediction
 

3523
01:12:17,610 --> 01:12:19,149
this professor who made this prediction
that didn't get it right

3524
01:12:19,149 --> 01:12:19,159
that didn't get it right
 

3525
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:26,470
that didn't get it right
yes so the fragility of human history is

3526
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480
yes so the fragility of human history is
 

3527
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,060
yes so the fragility of human history is
illustrated by that story and this is

3528
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:28,070
illustrated by that story and this is
 

3529
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:30,189
illustrated by that story and this is
one of my favorite things you also learn

3530
01:12:30,189 --> 01:12:30,199
one of my favorite things you also learn
 

3531
01:12:30,199 --> 01:12:33,729
one of my favorite things you also learn
things like in our book how eclipses and

3532
01:12:33,729 --> 01:12:33,739
things like in our book how eclipses and
 

3533
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:36,610
things like in our book how eclipses and
watching eclipses was a driver of the

3534
01:12:36,610 --> 01:12:36,620
watching eclipses was a driver of the
 

3535
01:12:36,620 --> 01:12:38,020
watching eclipses was a driver of the
development of science in our nation

3536
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:38,030
development of science in our nation
 

3537
01:12:38,030 --> 01:12:39,430
development of science in our nation
when it was very young in fact even

3538
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:39,440
when it was very young in fact even
 

3539
01:12:39,440 --> 01:12:42,100
when it was very young in fact even
before we were a nation turns out they

3540
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:42,110
before we were a nation turns out they
 

3541
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:46,750
before we were a nation turns out they
were citizens or citizens of this would

3542
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:46,760
were citizens or citizens of this would
 

3543
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,340
were citizens or citizens of this would
be country they were going out trying to

3544
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:48,350
be country they were going out trying to
 

3545
01:12:48,350 --> 01:12:52,629
be country they were going out trying to
measure eclipses so some fortunes some

3546
01:12:52,629 --> 01:12:52,639
measure eclipses so some fortunes some
 

3547
01:12:52,639 --> 01:12:56,320
measure eclipses so some fortunes some
misfortune affects the progress of

misfortune affects the progress of
 

3549
01:12:56,330 --> 01:13:01,450
misfortune affects the progress of
science especially with ideas as to me

science especially with ideas as to me
 

3551
01:13:01,460 --> 01:13:03,100
science especially with ideas as to me
at least if I put myself back in those

3552
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:03,110
at least if I put myself back in those
 

3553
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:07,860
at least if I put myself back in those
days as radicals general relativity is

first can you describe if it's okay

3556
01:13:11,649 --> 01:13:11,659
first can you describe if it's okay
 

3557
01:13:11,659 --> 01:13:14,250
first can you describe if it's okay
briefly what general relativity is and

briefly what general relativity is and
yeah if you could you just take a moment

3565
01:13:22,820 --> 01:13:25,060
eka and academic researchers scientists
of that time and what is this theory

01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:25,070
of that time and what is this theory

01:13:25,070 --> 01:13:26,770
of that time and what is this theory
what is it trying to describe about our

that left Isaac Newton puzzled Isaac

3572
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:38,030
that left Isaac Newton puzzled Isaac

that left Isaac Newton puzzled Isaac
Newton says gravity magically goes from

Newton says gravity magically goes from
one place to another he doesn't believe

one place to another he doesn't believe
 

3577
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:44,490
one place to another he doesn't believe
it by the way he knows that's not right

3578
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:44,500
it by the way he knows that's not right
 

3579
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:47,560
it by the way he knows that's not right
but the mathematics is so good that you

3580
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:47,570
but the mathematics is so good that you
 

3581
01:13:47,570 --> 01:13:49,720
but the mathematics is so good that you
have to say well I'll throw my qualms

3582
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:49,730
have to say well I'll throw my qualms
 

3583
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:52,540
have to say well I'll throw my qualms
away because I'll use it that's all we

3584
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:52,550
away because I'll use it that's all we
 

3585
01:13:52,550 --> 01:13:54,760
away because I'll use it that's all we
use to get for a man from the earth to

3586
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:54,770
use to get for a man from the earth to
 

3587
01:13:54,770 --> 01:14:01,570
use to get for a man from the earth to
the moon was that mathematics so I'm one

3588
01:14:01,570 --> 01:14:01,580
the moon was that mathematics so I'm one
 

3589
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:02,919
the moon was that mathematics so I'm one
of those scientists and I've seen this

3590
01:14:02,919 --> 01:14:02,929
of those scientists and I've seen this
 

3591
01:14:02,929 --> 01:14:05,200
of those scientists and I've seen this
and if I thought deeply about it maybe I

3592
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:05,210
and if I thought deeply about it maybe I
 

3593
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:06,939
and if I thought deeply about it maybe I
know that Newton himself wasn't

3594
01:14:06,939 --> 01:14:06,949
know that Newton himself wasn't
 

3595
01:14:06,949 --> 01:14:09,580
know that Newton himself wasn't
comfortable and so the first thing I

3596
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:09,590
comfortable and so the first thing I
 

3597
01:14:09,590 --> 01:14:11,919
comfortable and so the first thing I
would hope that I would feel is gee this

3598
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:11,929
would hope that I would feel is gee this
 

3599
01:14:11,929 --> 01:14:13,870
would hope that I would feel is gee this
is young kid out there who has an idea

3600
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:13,880
is young kid out there who has an idea
 

3601
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:17,169
is young kid out there who has an idea
to fill in this hole that was lay left

3602
01:14:17,169 --> 01:14:17,179
to fill in this hole that was lay left
 

3603
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:20,410
to fill in this hole that was lay left
with us by Sir Isaac Newton that would I

3604
01:14:20,410 --> 01:14:20,420
with us by Sir Isaac Newton that would I
 

3605
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,320
with us by Sir Isaac Newton that would I
hope would be my reaction I have a

3606
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:23,330
hope would be my reaction I have a
 

3607
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:27,010
hope would be my reaction I have a
suspicion I'm I'm kind of a mathematical

3608
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:27,020
suspicion I'm I'm kind of a mathematical
 

3609
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:30,010
suspicion I'm I'm kind of a mathematical
creature I was four years old when I

01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:30,020
creature I was four years old when I
 

3611
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,510
creature I was four years old when I
first decided that size was what I

3612
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
first decided that size was what I
 

3613
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,540
first decided that size was what I
wanted to do my

3614
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:32,550
wanted to do my
 

3615
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:36,920
wanted to do my
and so if my personality back then was

3616
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:36,930
and so if my personality back then was
 

3617
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:39,860
and so if my personality back then was
like it is now I think it's probably

3618
01:14:39,860 --> 01:14:39,870
like it is now I think it's probably
 

3619
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:41,720
like it is now I think it's probably
likely I would want to want to have

3620
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:41,730
likely I would want to want to have
 

3621
01:14:41,730 --> 01:14:44,120
likely I would want to want to have

this mathematics by a friend so this is

3638
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:01,170
this mathematics by a friend so this is
 

3639
01:15:01,170 --> 01:15:05,750
this mathematics by a friend so this is
in our book so putting myself in that

in our book so putting myself in that
 

3641
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:08,420
in our book so putting myself in that
time I would want to like I said I think

I would feel excitement I would want to
know what the mathematics is and then I

know what the mathematics is and then I
 

3647
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,470
know what the mathematics is and then I
wouldn't want to do the calculations

wouldn't want to do the calculations
 

3649

myself because one thing that physics is

all about is that you don't take

3652
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
all about is that you don't take
 

3653
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:19,700
all about is that you don't take
anybody's word for anything it's you can

string theory well I think that the

3734
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:13,710
string theory well I think that the
 

3735
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:15,400
string theory well I think that the
string theorists are probably going to

3736
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:15,410
string theorists are probably going to
 

3737
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,650
string theorists are probably going to
retrace this path but it's gonna be far

3738
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:18,660
retrace this path but it's gonna be far
 

3739
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:21,459
retrace this path but it's gonna be far
longer and more torturous in my opinion

3740
01:17:21,459 --> 01:17:21,469
longer and more torturous in my opinion
 

3741
01:17:21,469 --> 01:17:27,070
longer and more torturous in my opinion
string theory is such a broad and deep

3742
01:17:27,070 --> 01:17:27,080
string theory is such a broad and deep
 

3743
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:33,080
string theory is such a broad and deep
development that in my opinion when it

3744
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:33,090
development that in my opinion when it
 

3745
01:17:33,090 --> 01:17:34,850
development that in my opinion when it
becomes acceptable it's going to be

3746
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:34,860
becomes acceptable it's going to be
 

3747
01:17:34,860 --> 01:17:38,060
becomes acceptable it's going to be
because of a confluence of observation

3748
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:38,070
because of a confluence of observation
 

3749
01:17:38,070 --> 01:17:39,140
because of a confluence of observation
it's not gonna be a single observation

3750
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:39,150
it's not gonna be a single observation
 

3751
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:43,669
it's not gonna be a single observation
and I have to tell you that so I give a

3752
01:17:43,669 --> 01:17:43,679
and I have to tell you that so I give a
 

3753
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,760
and I have to tell you that so I give a
seminar here yesterday to my team and

3754
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:45,770
seminar here yesterday to my team and
 

3755
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:50,060
seminar here yesterday to my team and
it's it's on an idea I have about how

3756
01:17:50,060 --> 01:17:50,070
it's it's on an idea I have about how
 

3757
01:17:50,070 --> 01:17:52,550
it's it's on an idea I have about how
string theory can leave signatures in

3758
01:17:52,550 --> 01:17:52,560
string theory can leave signatures in
 

3759
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,080
string theory can leave signatures in
the Cosmic Microwave Background which is

3760
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:54,090
the Cosmic Microwave Background which is
 

3761
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:57,560
the Cosmic Microwave Background which is
a Astro physical structure and so if

3762
01:17:57,560 --> 01:17:57,570
a Astro physical structure and so if
 

3763
01:17:57,570 --> 01:17:59,990
a Astro physical structure and so if
those kinds of observations are borne

3764
01:17:59,990 --> 01:18:00,000
those kinds of observations are borne

and there's a lot of that that I think
 

3885
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:44,950
and there's a lot of that that I think
is correct that that when you truly

01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:21,690
that to me was extraordinary as I said
 

4231
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,390
that to me was extraordinary as I said
I've been around other executives and

4232
01:28:23,390 --> 01:28:23,400
I've been around other executives and
 

4233
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:26,380
I've been around other executives and
I've never seen qua one quite like him

4234
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:26,390
I've never seen qua one quite like him
 

4235
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:29,180
I've never seen qua one quite like him
he's an extraordinary learner that's

4236
01:28:29,180 --> 01:28:29,190
he's an extraordinary learner that's
 

4237
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,520
he's an extraordinary learner that's
what I observed and not just about

4238
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:31,530
what I observed and not just about
 

4239
01:28:31,530 --> 01:28:33,709
what I observed and not just about
science but he has a way of

4240
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:33,719
science but he has a way of
 

4241
01:28:33,719 --> 01:28:36,290
science but he has a way of
internalizing information in real time

4242
01:28:36,290 --> 01:28:36,300
internalizing information in real time
 

4243
01:28:36,300 --> 01:28:38,750
internalizing information in real time
that I've never seen in a politician

4244
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:38,760
that I've never seen in a politician
 

4245
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,370
that I've never seen in a politician
before even in extraordinarily

4246
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:40,380
before even in extraordinarily
 

4247
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:43,459
before even in extraordinarily
complicated situations even scientific

4248
01:28:43,459 --> 01:28:43,469
complicated situations even scientific
 

4249
01:28:43,469 --> 01:28:44,890
complicated situations even scientific
ideas scientific or non-scientific

4250
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:44,900
ideas scientific or non-scientific
 

4251
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:46,729
ideas scientific or non-scientific
complicated ideas don't have to be

4252
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:46,739
complicated ideas don't have to be
 

4253
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,860
complicated ideas don't have to be
scientific ideas but I have like I said

4254
01:28:48,860 --> 01:28:48,870
scientific ideas but I have like I said
 

4255
01:28:48,870 --> 01:28:50,930
scientific ideas but I have like I said
I've seen him in real time process

4256
01:28:50,930 --> 01:28:50,940
I've seen him in real time process
 

4257
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,700
I've seen him in real time process
complicated ideas with a speed that was

4258
01:28:52,700 --> 01:28:52,710
complicated ideas with a speed that was
 

4259
01:28:52,710 --> 01:28:53,140
complicated ideas with a speed that was
stunning

4260
01:28:53,140 --> 01:28:53,150
stunning
 

4261
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:56,180
stunning
in fact he's shocked the entire council

4262
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:56,190
in fact he's shocked the entire council
 

4263
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:59,780
in fact he's shocked the entire council
I mean we were all stunned at his

4264
01:28:59,780 --> 01:28:59,790
I mean we were all stunned at his
 

4265
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:03,610
I mean we were all stunned at his
capacity to be presented with

4266
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:03,620
capacity to be presented with
 

4267
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:07,250
capacity to be presented with
complicated ideas and then to wrestle

4268
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:07,260
complicated ideas and then to wrestle
 

4269
01:29:07,260 --> 01:29:09,140
complicated ideas and then to wrestle
with him and internalize them and then

4270
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:09,150
with him and internalize them and then
 

4271
01:29:09,150 --> 01:29:11,840
with him and internalize them and then
come back more interestingly enough come

4272
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:11,850
come back more interestingly enough come
 

4273
01:29:11,850 --> 01:29:13,700
come back more interestingly enough come
back with really good questions to ask

4274
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:13,710
back with really good questions to ask
 

4275
01:29:13,710 --> 01:29:16,430
back with really good questions to ask
I've noticed this is in an area that I

4276
01:29:16,430 --> 01:29:16,440
I've noticed this is in an area that I
 

4277
01:29:16,440 --> 01:29:18,080
I've noticed this is in an area that I
understand more of artificial

4278
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:18,090
understand more of artificial
 

4279
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:18,770
understand more of artificial

intelligence
 

4281
01:29:18,780 --> 01:29:21,500
intelligence
I've seen him integrate information

4282
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:21,510
I've seen him integrate information
 

4283
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:23,900
I've seen him integrate information
about artificial intelligence and then

4284
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:23,910
about artificial intelligence and then
 

4285
01:29:23,910 --> 01:29:25,520
about artificial intelligence and then
come out with these kind of richard

4286
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:25,530
come out with these kind of richard
 

4287
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:28,189
come out with these kind of richard
fineman like insights that's exactly

4288
01:29:28,189 --> 01:29:28,199
fineman like insights that's exactly
 

4289
01:29:28,199 --> 01:29:31,189
fineman like insights that's exactly
right and that's that as I said those of

4290
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:31,199
right and that's that as I said those of
 

4291
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,540
right and that's that as I said those of
us who have been in that position

4292
01:29:32,540 --> 01:29:32,550
us who have been in that position
 

4293
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:34,520
us who have been in that position
it is stunning to see it happen because

4294
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:34,530
it is stunning to see it happen because
 

4295
01:29:34,530 --> 01:29:38,030
it is stunning to see it happen because
you don't expect it yeah it takes what

4296
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:38,040
you don't expect it yeah it takes what
 

4297
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:40,400
you don't expect it yeah it takes what
for a lot of sort of graduate students

4298
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:40,410
for a lot of sort of graduate students
 

4299
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:42,020
for a lot of sort of graduate students
takes like four years in a particular

4300
01:29:42,020 --> 01:29:42,030
takes like four years in a particular
 

4301
01:29:42,030 --> 01:29:44,180
takes like four years in a particular
topic he just does it in a few minutes I

01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:46,890
have like learn naturally you've
 

4305
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:48,350
have like learn naturally you've
mentioned that you would love to see

01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:01,330
smile oh well si you know people who
 

4317
01:30:01,330 --> 01:30:02,820
smile oh well si you know people who
actually misunderstand that because it's

4318
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:02,830
actually misunderstand that because it's
 

4319
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,530
actually misunderstand that because it's
not what it doesn't mean what we

4320
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:04,540
not what it doesn't mean what we
 

4321
01:30:04,540 --> 01:30:06,930
not what it doesn't mean what we
generally take it to mean colloquially

01:30:06,930 --> 01:30:06,940
generally take it to mean colloquially
 

4323
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:08,250
generally take it to mean colloquially
but it's such a beautiful expression

4324
01:30:08,250 --> 01:30:08,260
but it's such a beautiful expression
 

4325
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:11,940
but it's such a beautiful expression
yeah it is it's from the hamlet to be or

4326
01:30:11,940 --> 01:30:11,950
yeah it is it's from the hamlet to be or
 

4327
01:30:11,950 --> 01:30:14,730
yeah it is it's from the hamlet to be or
not to be a speech which I still don't

4328
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:14,740
not to be a speech which I still don't
 

4329
01:30:14,740 --> 01:30:16,610
not to be a speech which I still don't
understand what that's above

4330
01:30:16,610 --> 01:30:16,620
understand what that's above
 

4331
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:21,450
understand what that's above
interpretation anyway the what are the

4332
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:21,460
interpretation anyway the what are the
 

4333
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:22,770
interpretation anyway the what are the
most exciting problems in physics

4334
01:30:22,770 --> 01:30:22,780
most exciting problems in physics
 

4335
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:24,840
most exciting problems in physics
they're just within our reach of

4336
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:24,850
they're just within our reach of
 

4337
01:30:24,850 --> 01:30:26,520
they're just within our reach of
understanding and maybe solve the next

4338
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:26,530
understanding and maybe solve the next
 

4339
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:28,830

two decades they you may be able to see

4340
01:30:28,830 --> 01:30:28,840
two decades they you may be able to see
 

4341
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:32,700
two decades they you may be able to see
so in physics you limited it to physics

4342
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:32,710
so in physics you limited it to physics
 

4343
01:30:32,710 --> 01:30:35,760
so in physics you limited it to physics
physics mathematics this kind of space

of problems that fascinate you well the

4346
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:39,910
of problems that fascinate you well the
 

4347
01:30:39,910 --> 01:30:41,580
of problems that fascinate you well the

4353
01:30:46,990 --> 01:30:48,780

actually get there that's gonna be

4354
01:30:48,780 --> 01:30:48,790
actually get there that's gonna be
 

4355
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:51,210
actually get there that's gonna be
extraordinarily interesting do you think

4356
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:51,220
extraordinarily interesting do you think
 

4357
01:30:51,220 --> 01:30:54,240
extraordinarily interesting do you think
that's a fundamentally problem of theory

4358
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:54,250
that's a fundamentally problem of theory
 

4359
01:30:54,250 --> 01:30:56,130
that's a fundamentally problem of theory
or is it now in the space of engineering

4360
01:30:56,130 --> 01:30:56,140
or is it now in the space of engineering
 

4361
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,600
or is it now in the space of engineering
it's in the space of engineering I was

4362
01:30:57,600 --> 01:30:57,610
it's in the space of engineering I was
 

4363
01:30:57,610 --> 01:31:01,260
it's in the space of engineering I was
not a cue station as you may know

Santa Barbara I was out there a couple

4368
01:31:07,710 --> 01:31:07,720
Santa Barbara I was out there a couple
 

4369
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:10,500
Santa Barbara I was out there a couple
of months in my capacity as a vice

4370
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:10,510
of months in my capacity as a vice
 

4371
01:31:10,510 --> 01:31:11,840
of months in my capacity as a vice
president of American Physical Society

4372
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:11,850
president of American Physical Society
 

4373
01:31:11,850 --> 01:31:14,670
president of American Physical Society
and I got a you know I had some things

4374
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:14,680
and I got a you know I had some things
 

4375
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:16,200
and I got a you know I had some things
that were like lectures and they were

4376
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:16,210
that were like lectures and they were
 

4377
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:18,720
that were like lectures and they were
telling me what they were doing and it

4378
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:18,730
telling me what they were doing and it
 

4379
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:20,130
telling me what they were doing and it
sure sounded like they knew what they

4380
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:20,140
sure sounded like they knew what they
 

4381
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:21,690
sure sounded like they knew what they
were doing and the thing were close to

4382
01:31:21,690 --> 01:31:21,700
were doing and the thing were close to
 

4383
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:25,260
were doing and the thing were close to
major breakthroughs yeah that's a really

4384
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:25,270
major breakthroughs yeah that's a really
 

4385
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:28,290
major breakthroughs yeah that's a really
exciting possibility there but the back

4386
01:31:28,290 --> 01:31:28,300
