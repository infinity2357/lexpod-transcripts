so much further and i didn't even say

168
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:51,200
so much further and i didn't even say
 

169
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,949
so much further and i didn't even say
what the goal was up front

170
00:02:52,949 --> 00:02:52,959
what the goal was up front
 

171
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,630
what the goal was up front
because it was so far out there i would

172
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:54,640
because it was so far out there i would
 

173
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,390
because it was so far out there i would
have been laughed at and that's

174
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
have been laughed at and that's
 

175
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,229
have been laughed at and that's
i i think big goals should be kept

176
00:02:58,229 --> 00:02:58,239
i i think big goals should be kept
 

177
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,309
i i think big goals should be kept
pretty damn close uh to start with for

178
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:00,319
pretty damn close uh to start with for
 

179
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,830
pretty damn close uh to start with for
that reason too

180
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,840
that reason too
 

181
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,910
that reason too
um but and then the second piece was to

182
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:03,920
um but and then the second piece was to
 

183
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,990
um but and then the second piece was to
to to walk the walk to show

184
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,000
to to walk the walk to show
 

185
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,750
to to walk the walk to show
like the principles of what i believed

186
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:07,760
like the principles of what i believed
 

187
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,670
like the principles of what i believed
in around human movement

188
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
in around human movement
 

189
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,229
in around human movement
um the ability to manage and control the

190
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:12,239
um the ability to manage and control the
 

191
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,910
um the ability to manage and control the
spinal mechanics and the output that can

192
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
spinal mechanics and the output that can
 

193
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,030
spinal mechanics and the output that can
have on the body

194
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,040
have on the body
 

195
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,630
have on the body
and so i wanted to take the two most

196
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:16,640
and so i wanted to take the two most
 

197
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,070
and so i wanted to take the two most
basic movements that

198
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,080
basic movements that
 

199
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,070
basic movements that
every able-bodied person should be able

200
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
every able-bodied person should be able
 

201
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,750
every able-bodied person should be able
to do so fundamental

202
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
to do so fundamental
 

203
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,589
to do so fundamental
movement patterns the squat which is

00:03:23,589 --> 00:03:23,599
movement patterns the squat which is
 

205
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,149
movement patterns the squat which is
like in the developmental approach is

ground a deadlift

and i wanted to do those two not just

226
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:43,280
and i wanted to do those two not just

outliers
 

241
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,789

because nobody had ever done a thousand

because nobody had ever done a thousand
 

243
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,229
because nobody had ever done a thousand
pound squat so this is it

244
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:02,239
pound squat so this is it
 

245
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,670
pound squat so this is it
is and a thousand pound deadlift

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,550
is and a thousand pound deadlift
it was outside of the scope of what

it was outside of the scope of what
 

249
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,070
it was outside of the scope of what
anybody's there's like half a dozen

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:10,080
anybody's there's like half a dozen
 

251
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,429
anybody's there's like half a dozen
people that have done one

00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:11,439
people that have done one
 

253
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,070

255
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,830
or the other but nobody's ever done both
and i wanted to do something unique i

256
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:15,840
and i wanted to do something unique i
 

257
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,270
and i wanted to do something unique i
wanted to do them

258
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:17,280
wanted to do them
 

259
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,830
wanted to do them
not only do it but do them for reps to

260
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:19,840
not only do it but do them for reps to
 

261
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,550
not only do it but do them for reps to
leave literally

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,710
leave literally
no question out there and there's no

264
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:22,720
no question out there and there's no
 

265
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,710
no question out there and there's no
competition for that

266
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:24,720
competition for that
 

267
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,749
competition for that
so it was this is what i'm gonna go do

268
00:04:27,749 --> 00:04:27,759
so it was this is what i'm gonna go do
 

269
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,230
so it was this is what i'm gonna go do
and

270
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:28,240
and
 

271
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,550
and
to pull it off i had some past issues

272
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,560
to pull it off i had some past issues
 

273
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,310
to pull it off i had some past issues
with my elbows and stuff that i couldn't

274
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:32,320
with my elbows and stuff that i couldn't
 

275
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,150
with my elbows and stuff that i couldn't
work around so i had to wear

276
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:34,160
work around so i had to wear
 

277
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,749
work around so i had to wear
straps which was another reason i

278
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
straps which was another reason i
 

279
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,350
straps which was another reason i
couldn't do it in the competition

280
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,360
couldn't do it in the competition
 

281
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,870
couldn't do it in the competition
setting

282
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:38,880
setting
 

283
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,790
setting
so the first year i worked up and i did

284
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:40,800
so the first year i worked up and i did
 

285
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,070
so the first year i worked up and i did
a thousand and two

286
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:42,080
a thousand and two
 

287
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,070
a thousand and two
pound deadlift we plates were weight

288
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
pound deadlift we plates were weight
 

289
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,350
pound deadlift we plates were weight
afterwards it was a couple a little bit

290
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:45,360
afterwards it was a couple a little bit
 

291
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,909
afterwards it was a couple a little bit
over

292
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:45,919
over
 

293
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,189
over
and i did it for almost three reps

294
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:49,199
and i did it for almost three reps
 

295
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,710
and i did it for almost three reps
and that still stands as a guinness

296
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:50,720
and that still stands as a guinness
 

297
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,350
and that still stands as a guinness
world record the just the one rep does

world record the just the one rep does
 

299
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,990
world record the just the one rep does
is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted

300
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:56,000
is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted
 

301
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,710
is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted
and

302
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:56,720
and
 

303
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,070
and
one other person has deadlifted a

304
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:58,080
one other person has deadlifted a
 

305
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,510
one other person has deadlifted a
thousand for reps at this point and that

306
00:04:59,510 --> 00:04:59,520
thousand for reps at this point and that
 

307
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,390
thousand for reps at this point and that
was uh thor

308
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:00,400
was uh thor
 

309
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,469
was uh thor
bjornsson uh from game of thrones he's

310
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:02,479
bjornsson uh from game of thrones he's
 

311
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,029
bjornsson uh from game of thrones he's
done a thousand for a double as well so

312
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:05,039
done a thousand for a double as well so
 

313
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,870
done a thousand for a double as well so
then the next four years and i did a

314
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:06,880
then the next four years and i did a
 

315
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,230
then the next four years and i did a
bunch of feats of strength on the way

316
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:08,240
bunch of feats of strength on the way
 

317
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,870
bunch of feats of strength on the way
but it was

318
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:08,880
but it was
 

319
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,990
but it was
all about building that axial loading

320
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,000
all about building that axial loading
 

321
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,830
all about building that axial loading
capacity the strength of because now i'm

322
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:13,840
capacity the strength of because now i'm
 

323
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,430
capacity the strength of because now i'm
moving the weight from my hands up to my

324
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:15,440
moving the weight from my hands up to my
 

325
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,390
moving the weight from my hands up to my
shoulders

326
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
shoulders
 

327
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,270
shoulders
and so to do it for reps is like so much

328
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:19,280
and so to do it for reps is like so much
 

329
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,310
and so to do it for reps is like so much
harder than a single

330
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:20,320
harder than a single
 

331
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,150
harder than a single
like 5 to 10 seconds versus 30

332
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:24,160
like 5 to 10 seconds versus 30
 

333
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,070
like 5 to 10 seconds versus 30
plus seconds to be able to buffer and

334
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
plus seconds to be able to buffer and
 

335
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,510
plus seconds to be able to buffer and
manage all that

336
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:27,520
manage all that
 

337
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,870
manage all that
with that kind of load is just crazy so

338
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
with that kind of load is just crazy so
 

339
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,790
with that kind of load is just crazy so
it's literally about the duration that

340
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:32,800
it's literally about the duration that
 

341
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,790
it's literally about the duration that
your body is carrying the load

342
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:34,800
your body is carrying the load
 

343
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,870
your body is carrying the load
yeah that's a big part of it yeah

344
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:36,880
yeah that's a big part of it yeah
 

345
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,070
yeah that's a big part of it yeah
because you have to

346
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,080
because you have to
 

347
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,590
because you have to
you're using the resource of the

348
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:39,600
you're using the resource of the
 

349
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,510
you're using the resource of the
diaphragm for stabilization

350
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:41,520
diaphragm for stabilization
 

351
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,430
diaphragm for stabilization
and so it it's also responsible for

352
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:43,440
and so it it's also responsible for
 

353
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,189
and so it it's also responsible for
respiration and all this other stuff so

354
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:45,199
respiration and all this other stuff so
 

355
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,550
respiration and all this other stuff so
even when you're not squatting you've

356
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
even when you're not squatting you've
 

357
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,150
even when you're not squatting you've
got to be handling those loads

358
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
got to be handling those loads
 

359
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,390
got to be handling those loads
just holding that weight is fascinating

360
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,400
just holding that weight is fascinating
 

361
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,830
just holding that weight is fascinating
it's like it's fascinating that the

362
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:51,840
it's like it's fascinating that the
 

363
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,270
it's like it's fascinating that the
human body

364
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
human body
 

365
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,070
human body
can do that can can maintain that

366
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,080
can do that can can maintain that
 

367
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,950
can do that can can maintain that
structure

368
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:56,960
structure
 

369
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,950
structure
just everything working together that

370
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:58,960
just everything working together that
 

371
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,070
just everything working together that
the biology

372
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,080
the biology
 

373
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,150
the biology
the skeletal structure the the

374
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,160
the skeletal structure the the
 

375
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,070
the skeletal structure the the
musculature on top of that can

376
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,080
musculature on top of that can
 

377
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,670
musculature on top of that can
hold the weight it's fascinating to

378
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:05,680
hold the weight it's fascinating to
 

379
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,230
hold the weight it's fascinating to
watch everything is very intentful about

380
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:08,240
watch everything is very intentful about
 

381
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,029
watch everything is very intentful about
positioning

382
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
positioning
 

383
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,430
positioning
and how you're creating pressure and all

384
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
and how you're creating pressure and all
 

385
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,950
and how you're creating pressure and all
this sort of stuff especially for me so

386
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
this sort of stuff especially for me so
 

387
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:13,830
this sort of stuff especially for me so
when i mentioned that

388
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:13,840
when i mentioned that
 

389
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,510
when i mentioned that
half a dozen people have squatted it and

390
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:15,520
half a dozen people have squatted it and
 

391
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,189
half a dozen people have squatted it and
half a dozen people have deadlifted it

392
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
half a dozen people have deadlifted it
 

393
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,469
half a dozen people have deadlifted it
you understand those people all weigh

394
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:18,479
you understand those people all weigh
 

395
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,790
you understand those people all weigh
380 to 440 pounds

396
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
380 to 440 pounds
 

397
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,990
380 to 440 pounds
i weighed 265 to 285 depending on the

398
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
i weighed 265 to 285 depending on the
 

399
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,830
i weighed 265 to 285 depending on the
where i was between the two

400
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:25,840
where i was between the two
 

401
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,390
where i was between the two
so there's that as well right so big big

402
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
so there's that as well right so big big
 

403
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,670
so there's that as well right so big big
difference

404
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:29,680
difference
 

405
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,309
difference
and uh over the course of that i did a

406
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
and uh over the course of that i did a
 

407
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:32,790
and uh over the course of that i did a
lot of

408
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,800
lot of
 

409
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,029
lot of
other feats of strength that fit in that

410
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:35,039
other feats of strength that fit in that
 

411
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,830
other feats of strength that fit in that
capacity and we can skip over those but

412
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:37,840
capacity and we can skip over those but
 

413
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,230
capacity and we can skip over those but
that was hugely invested as far as you

414
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
that was hugely invested as far as you
 

415
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,350
that was hugely invested as far as you
know

416
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:41,360
know
 

417
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,270
know
what i put into being able to accomplish

418
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,280
what i put into being able to accomplish
 

419
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,029
what i put into being able to accomplish
that because it's it's over the top

420
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
that because it's it's over the top
 

421
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,590
that because it's it's over the top
which means

422
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:45,600
which means
 

423
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,749
which means
the other stuff had to shift and i had

424
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
the other stuff had to shift and i had
 

425
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,270
the other stuff had to shift and i had
to learn something

426
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
to learn something
 

427
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,710
to learn something
there's so many things that came into

428
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:50,720
there's so many things that came into
 

429
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,189
there's so many things that came into
place to pull that off and so yeah last

430
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
place to pull that off and so yeah last
 

431
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:53,749
place to pull that off and so yeah last
march

432
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:53,759
march
 

433
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,390
march
two days before the world shutdown i did

434
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,400
two days before the world shutdown i did
 

435
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,670
two days before the world shutdown i did
it it was supposed to be

436
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:57,680
it it was supposed to be
 

437
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,670
it it was supposed to be
at the largest equipment exhibition in

438
00:06:59,670 --> 00:06:59,680
at the largest equipment exhibition in
 

439
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,830
at the largest equipment exhibition in
the world down in san diego

440
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:01,840
the world down in san diego
 

441
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,830
the world down in san diego
as an event and that got shut down a

442
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:03,840
as an event and that got shut down a
 

443
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,990
as an event and that got shut down a
week beforehand obviously so we moved to

444
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,000
week beforehand obviously so we moved to
 

445
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,150
week beforehand obviously so we moved to
let's do it in my gym and invite people

446
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
let's do it in my gym and invite people
 

447
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,749
let's do it in my gym and invite people
and that was on a saturday and thursday

448
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:09,759
and that was on a saturday and thursday
 

449
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,189
and that was on a saturday and thursday
or friday they limited it to

450
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:11,199
or friday they limited it to
 

451
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,830
or friday they limited it to
25 people for gatherings i did it on

452
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:13,840
25 people for gatherings i did it on
 

453
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,710
25 people for gatherings i did it on
saturday

454
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:14,720
saturday
 

455
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,510
saturday
and then monday everything shut down so

456
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:17,520
and then monday everything shut down so
 

457
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:17,909
and then monday everything shut down so
wow

458
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:17,919
wow
 

459
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,390
wow
it was kind of surreal for timing-wise

460
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,400
it was kind of surreal for timing-wise
 

461
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,469
it was kind of surreal for timing-wise
right and so if i hadn't done it it

462
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:22,479
right and so if i hadn't done it it
 

463
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,950
right and so if i hadn't done it it
would have never got done like because i

464
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:24,960
would have never got done like because i
 

465
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,790
would have never got done like because i
i'd pushed to the limit i couldn't come

466
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:26,800
i'd pushed to the limit i couldn't come
 

467
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,629
i'd pushed to the limit i couldn't come
back and do it it was at the total

468
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:28,639
back and do it it was at the total
 

469
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,790
back and do it it was at the total
limitation of my capabilities so

470
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
limitation of my capabilities so
 

471
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,309
limitation of my capabilities so
i'm pretty i'm pretty proud of it and

472
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:32,319
i'm pretty i'm pretty proud of it and
 

473
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,830
i'm pretty i'm pretty proud of it and
the last piece was uh

474
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:33,840
the last piece was uh
 

475
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,270
the last piece was uh
every one of these feats along the way i

476
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:37,280
every one of these feats along the way i
 

477
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,790
every one of these feats along the way i
collaborated with a charity that i

478
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:38,800
collaborated with a charity that i
 

479
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,550
collaborated with a charity that i
believed in and there was a lot of those

480
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:40,560
believed in and there was a lot of those
 

481
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,589
believed in and there was a lot of those
tied to my life

482
00:07:41,589 --> 00:07:41,599
tied to my life
 

483
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,710
tied to my life
story uh which we probably will get into

484
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:44,720
story uh which we probably will get into
 

485
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,830
story uh which we probably will get into
um so it was threefold so that

486
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
um so it was threefold so that
 

487
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,029
um so it was threefold so that

for reps do a thousand pounds squat and
 

521
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,950

let's first talk through the actual day

524
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
let's first talk through the actual day
 

525
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,270
let's first talk through the actual day
you did it

526
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:27,280
you did it
 

527
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,350
you did it
what does it take to lift that much

528
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:31,360
what does it take to lift that much
 

529
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,870
what does it take to lift that much
for reps the day of is really easy

530
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:36,880
for reps the day of is really easy
 

531
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,310
for reps the day of is really easy
the really the lift itself other than a

532
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:40,320
the really the lift itself other than a
 

533
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,829
the really the lift itself other than a
few seconds

534
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
few seconds
 

535
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,829
few seconds
is really easy and not challenging

536
00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:43,839
is really easy and not challenging
 

537
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,949
is really easy and not challenging
people always ask me

538
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:44,959
people always ask me
 

539
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,949
people always ask me
what was it like how beat up were you

540
00:08:46,949 --> 00:08:46,959
what was it like how beat up were you
 

541
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,550
what was it like how beat up were you
after that and the deadlift and the

542
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:48,560
after that and the deadlift and the
 

543
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,110
after that and the deadlift and the
simple fact is it was easy

544
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
simple fact is it was easy
 

545
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,430
simple fact is it was easy
the work to get there was horrendous

546
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:55,440
the work to get there was horrendous
 

547
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,630
the work to get there was horrendous
so so even the psychology of the day

548
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:58,640
so so even the psychology of the day
 

549
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,150
so so even the psychology of the day
you weren't there was not a fear there

550
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,160
you weren't there was not a fear there
 

551
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,150
you weren't there was not a fear there
was not a nervousness there was not a

552
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
was not a nervousness there was not a
 

553
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:02,790
was not a nervousness there was not a
doubt

554
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
doubt
 

555
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,230
doubt
in your mind uh there were certainly

556
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:04,240
in your mind uh there were certainly
 

557
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,829
in your mind uh there were certainly
doubts on that day um

558
00:09:05,829 --> 00:09:05,839
doubts on that day um
 

559
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,389
doubts on that day um
from some training history so there was

560
00:09:08,389 --> 00:09:08,399
from some training history so there was
 

561
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,750
from some training history so there was
some major

562
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:09,760
some major
 

563
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,829
some major
breaks to my confidence in the couple

564
00:09:11,829 --> 00:09:11,839
breaks to my confidence in the couple
 

565
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:13,110
breaks to my confidence in the couple
months leading up

566
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,120
months leading up
 

567
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,389
months leading up
where i had issues with passing out

568
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
where i had issues with passing out
 

569
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,550
where i had issues with passing out
under the bar so completely losing

570
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:18,560
under the bar so completely losing
 

571
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,829
under the bar so completely losing
consciousness and this was

572
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
consciousness and this was
 

573
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,350
consciousness and this was
on weight less than a thousand pounds

574
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:21,360
on weight less than a thousand pounds
 

575
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,670
on weight less than a thousand pounds
even so

576
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:23,680
even so
 

577
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,910
even so
that was like all this build up in me

578
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:25,920
that was like all this build up in me
 

579
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,190
that was like all this build up in me
going

580
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
going
 

581
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,150
going
what if what if it i think i have this

582
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,160
what if what if it i think i have this
 

583
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,430
what if what if it i think i have this
resolved

584
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
resolved
 

585
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,269
resolved
but what if i get up there and i can't

586
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
but what if i get up there and i can't
 

587
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,630
but what if i get up there and i can't
even do a rep

588
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
even do a rep
 

589
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,470
even do a rep
how embarrassing will this be that i've

590
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:36,480
how embarrassing will this be that i've
 

591
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,230
how embarrassing will this be that i've
been talking about this and planning for

592
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
been talking about this and planning for
 

593
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,710
been talking about this and planning for
this for so long

594
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:40,720
this for so long
 

595
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,670
this for so long
but outside of that i knew i could do it

596
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
but outside of that i knew i could do it
 

597
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,590
but outside of that i knew i could do it
in fact i wanted to do even more even up

598
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
in fact i wanted to do even more even up
 

599
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,150
in fact i wanted to do even more even up
to the

600
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:46,160
to the
 

601
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,030
to the
the second rep training is about you

602
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
the second rep training is about you
 

603
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,389
the second rep training is about you
know working

604
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
know working
 

605
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,389
know working
into a fatigue state so you're building

606
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:54,399
into a fatigue state so you're building
 

607
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,910
into a fatigue state so you're building
uh an amount of fatigue in your system

608
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:57,920
uh an amount of fatigue in your system
 

609
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,590
uh an amount of fatigue in your system
and then when you let off of it that's

610
00:09:59,590 --> 00:09:59,600
and then when you let off of it that's
 

611
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,030
and then when you let off of it that's
when you get a compensation and that's

612
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
when you get a compensation and that's
 

613
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,470
when you get a compensation and that's
how you stair-step training this is

614
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
how you stair-step training this is
 

615
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,470
how you stair-step training this is
periodization but leading into a big

616
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
periodization but leading into a big
 

617
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,030
periodization but leading into a big
event

618
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,040
event
 

619
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,790
event
you're accumulating this massive amount

620
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:06,800
you're accumulating this massive amount
 

621
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,030
you're accumulating this massive amount
of fatigue and so

622
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,040
of fatigue and so
 

623
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,870
of fatigue and so
i was performing at a level that i could

624
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
i was performing at a level that i could
 

625
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,630
i was performing at a level that i could
do it and so i knew

626
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:12,640
do it and so i knew
 

627
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,990
do it and so i knew
i was going to be able to on meet

628
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,000
i was going to be able to on meet
 

629
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,750
i was going to be able to on meet
because then you then you give yourself

630
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:15,760
because then you then you give yourself
 

631
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,030
because then you then you give yourself
that window

632
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,040
that window
 

633
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,630
that window
to be able to recover and super

634
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
to be able to recover and super
 

635
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,790
to be able to recover and super
compensate and be able to do a little

636
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:20,800
compensate and be able to do a little
 

637
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,630
compensate and be able to do a little
bit more so like that first rep when i

638
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:22,640
bit more so like that first rep when i
 

639
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,350
bit more so like that first rep when i
did it

640
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:23,360
did it
 

641
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,990
did it
strength wise i went i could do this for

642
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,000
strength wise i went i could do this for
 

643
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,630
strength wise i went i could do this for
five reps

644
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:26,640
five reps
 

645
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,750
five reps
like it went through my head i'm like

646
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:27,760
like it went through my head i'm like
 

647
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,069
like it went through my head i'm like
dealing i mean it was easy and it was

648
00:10:30,069 --> 00:10:30,079
dealing i mean it was easy and it was
 

649
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,630
dealing i mean it was easy and it was
fast and it felt like amazing and i'm

650
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:32,640
fast and it felt like amazing and i'm
 

651
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,389
fast and it felt like amazing and i'm
like i'm gonna crush this

652
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:34,399
like i'm gonna crush this
 

653
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,430
like i'm gonna crush this
and then set rep two uh the realization

654
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:37,440
and then set rep two uh the realization
 

655
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,310
and then set rep two uh the realization
kicked in is like

656
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:38,320
kicked in is like
 

657
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,150
kicked in is like
oh this is for reps with a thousand

658
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:40,160
oh this is for reps with a thousand
 

659
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,430
oh this is for reps with a thousand
pounds on your back

660
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:41,440
pounds on your back
 

661
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,990
pounds on your back
and you're fatiguing just like and then

662
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:44,000
and you're fatiguing just like and then
 

663
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,750
and you're fatiguing just like and then
the third one was

664
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
the third one was
 

665
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,150
the third one was
every last thing i could muster to just

666
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,160
every last thing i could muster to just
 

667
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:48,949
every last thing i could muster to just
finish that i mean

668
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:48,959
finish that i mean
 

669
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,269
finish that i mean
i just barely got it done because it's

670
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:51,279
i just barely got it done because it's
 

671
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,310
i just barely got it done because it's
the strength is

672
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:52,320
the strength is
 

673
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,870
the strength is
like there but like that capacity to be

674
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:54,880
like there but like that capacity to be
 

675
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:55,910
like there but like that capacity to be
able to manage

676
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:55,920
able to manage
 

677
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,990
able to manage
all those resources for that amount of

678
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
all those resources for that amount of
 

679
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,750
all those resources for that amount of
time because not just leg strength when

680
00:10:59,750 --> 00:10:59,760
time because not just leg strength when
 

681
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,590
time because not just leg strength when
we're talking about this stuff so

682
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:01,600
we're talking about this stuff so
 

683
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,110
we're talking about this stuff so
what does it take to go from the

684
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:05,120
what does it take to go from the
 

685
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,590
what does it take to go from the
from i don't know what like from 500 to

686
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:07,600
from i don't know what like from 500 to
 

687
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,030
from i don't know what like from 500 to
a thousand

688
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
a thousand
 

689
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,670
a thousand
that feels like a journey that's like

690
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:11,680
that feels like a journey that's like
 

691
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,630
that feels like a journey that's like
exponential

692
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
exponential
 

693
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,230
exponential
it's it is exponentially harder it does

694
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
it's it is exponentially harder it does
 

695
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,910
it's it is exponentially harder it does
in the early 2000s like i said i started

696
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
in the early 2000s like i said i started
 

697
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,430
in the early 2000s like i said i started
lift in 1988

698
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:19,440
lift in 1988
 

699
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,990
lift in 1988
um but my first meet in the early 2000s

700
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
um but my first meet in the early 2000s
 

701
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,630
um but my first meet in the early 2000s
my

702
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:22,640
my
 

703
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,069
my
my max deadlift was 523 and my first

704
00:11:26,069 --> 00:11:26,079
my max deadlift was 523 and my first
 

705
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,389
my max deadlift was 523 and my first
squat was 550.

706
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
squat was 550.
 

707
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,430
squat was 550.
so uh friends that's a heck of a journey

708
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:31,440
so uh friends that's a heck of a journey
 

709
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,310
so uh friends that's a heck of a journey
it is a journey for people that like to

710
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
it is a journey for people that like to
 

711
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,030
it is a journey for people that like to
lift

712
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
lift
 

713
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,470
lift
what should they understand about the

714
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:36,480
what should they understand about the
 

715
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,389
what should they understand about the
difference between doing 500 and a

716
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
difference between doing 500 and a
 

717
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,910
difference between doing 500 and a
thousand

718
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:39,920
thousand
 

719
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,910
thousand
in terms of the actual lift that you

720
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
in terms of the actual lift that you
 

721
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,269
in terms of the actual lift that you
were experiencing that day

722
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:43,279
were experiencing that day
 

723
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,710
were experiencing that day
in terms of the mechanics in terms of

724
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:44,720
in terms of the mechanics in terms of
 

725
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,550
in terms of the mechanics in terms of
all the things you have to be like the

726
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:46,560
all the things you have to be like the
 

727
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,949
all the things you have to be like the
neurological adaptation you mentioned

728
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:48,959
neurological adaptation you mentioned
 

729
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,790
neurological adaptation you mentioned
the breathing

730
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:50,800
the breathing
 

731
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,350
the breathing
the core strength what like techniques

732
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:53,360
the core strength what like techniques
 

733
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,710
the core strength what like techniques
like little tricks

734
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:54,720
like little tricks
 

735
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,629
like little tricks
psychological tricks anything that kind

736
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
psychological tricks anything that kind
 

737
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,629
psychological tricks anything that kind
of stands out to you

738
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
of stands out to you
 

739
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,350
of stands out to you
the level of intent and the opportunity

740
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:01,360
the level of intent and the opportunity
 

741
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:01,670
the level of intent and the opportunity
for

742
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:01,680
for
 

743
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,750
for
error are at a different level so

744
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:05,760
error are at a different level so
 

745
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,470
error are at a different level so
just the minutes changes of position by

746
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:08,480
just the minutes changes of position by
 

747
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,190
just the minutes changes of position by
quarter inch

748
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:09,200
quarter inch
 

749
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,550
quarter inch
half inch can be make or break at that

750
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:12,560
half inch can be make or break at that
 

751
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,350
half inch can be make or break at that
level so

752
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
level so
 

753
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,590
level so
these things everything gets amplified

754
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
these things everything gets amplified
 

755
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,230
these things everything gets amplified
so the ability to start with having

756
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
so the ability to start with having
 

757
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,310
so the ability to start with having
the pelvis just in the right orientation

758
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
the pelvis just in the right orientation
 

759
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,829
the pelvis just in the right orientation
to the diaphragm before we start

760
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:22,839
to the diaphragm before we start
 

761
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,269
to the diaphragm before we start
initiating what we call the the

762
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:25,279
initiating what we call the the
 

763
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,030
initiating what we call the the
eccentric loading of the abdominal

00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:27,040
eccentric loading of the abdominal
 

765
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:27,829
eccentric loading of the abdominal
cavity

766
00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:27,839
cavity
 

767
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,829
cavity
to create this intra-abdominal pressure

768
00:12:29,829 --> 00:12:29,839
to create this intra-abdominal pressure
 

769
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,269
to create this intra-abdominal pressure
of working against

770
00:12:31,269 --> 00:12:31,279
of working against

floor
 

783
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,350
floor
all this stuff and how you cue that

784
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:43,360
all this stuff and how you cue that
 

785
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,470
all this stuff and how you cue that
because you can't think about all this

786
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:44,480
because you can't think about all this
 

787
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,670
because you can't think about all this
stuff you need to break it down and

788
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
stuff you need to break it down and
 

789
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,590
stuff you need to break it down and
distill and practice to like it's

790
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
distill and practice to like it's
 

791
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,870
distill and practice to like it's
one simple cue that we now lock down

792
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:50,880
one simple cue that we now lock down
 

793
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,790
one simple cue that we now lock down
and control this torso stability because

794
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
and control this torso stability because
 

795
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,470
and control this torso stability because
this is what these fundamental movements

796
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:56,480
this is what these fundamental movements
 

797
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,310
this is what these fundamental movements
are about is being able to control

798
00:12:58,310 --> 00:12:58,320
are about is being able to control
 

799
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,030
are about is being able to control
our spinal mechanics and then now be

800
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
our spinal mechanics and then now be
 

801
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:01,910
our spinal mechanics and then now be
able to

802
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:01,920
able to
 

803
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,150
able to
maintain that while articulating the

804
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,160
maintain that while articulating the
 

805
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,990
maintain that while articulating the
joints around that through a range of

806
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,000
joints around that through a range of
 

807
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,829
joints around that through a range of
motion uh and then using

808
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:09,839
motion uh and then using
 

809
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,230
motion uh and then using
the main power drivers so in this

810
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:12,240
the main power drivers so in this
 

811
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,509
the main power drivers so in this
instance both instances

812
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
instance both instances
 

813
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,150
instance both instances
it's the you know the hip complex to

through to the distal end you know which
 

823
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,750
through to the distal end you know which
would be the barbell on the shoulder

824
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:25,760
would be the barbell on the shoulder
 

825
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,829
would be the barbell on the shoulder
you know there's a couple key concepts

826
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:27,839
you know there's a couple key concepts
 

827
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,430
you know there's a couple key concepts
so one is that what we just talked

828
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:29,440
so one is that what we just talked
 

829
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,150
so one is that what we just talked
through is

830
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
through is
 

831
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,069
through is
how to actually maintain that stability

832
00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:32,079
how to actually maintain that stability
 

833
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,190
how to actually maintain that stability
so if you have

834
00:13:33,190 --> 00:13:33,200
so if you have
 

835
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,990
so if you have
either the diaphragm so which is

836
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:36,000
either the diaphragm so which is
 

837
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,829
either the diaphragm so which is
connected at the rib cage so out of

838
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:37,839
connected at the rib cage so out of
 

839
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:38,470
connected at the rib cage so out of
alignment

840
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:38,480
alignment
 

841
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,030
alignment
in any position it needs to be in

842
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:41,040
in any position it needs to be in
 

843
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,750
in any position it needs to be in
alignment

844
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:41,760
alignment
 

845
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,389
alignment
with the pelvic of the pelvis so those

846
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:44,399
with the pelvic of the pelvis so those
 

847
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:45,990
with the pelvic of the pelvis so those
two in opposition so this is simple

848
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:46,000
two in opposition so this is simple
 

849
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,509
two in opposition so this is simple
engineering here

850
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:47,519
engineering here
 

851
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,670
engineering here
because what we're going to do is

852
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
because what we're going to do is
 

853
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,870
because what we're going to do is
eccentrically load this we're going to

854
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
eccentrically load this we're going to
 

855
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,470
eccentrically load this we're going to
use the diaphragm just like you would in

856
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
use the diaphragm just like you would in
 

857
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,069
use the diaphragm just like you would in
a diaphragm pump

858
00:13:54,069 --> 00:13:54,079
a diaphragm pump
 

859
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,150
a diaphragm pump
where it's going to press down on all

860
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:56,160
where it's going to press down on all
 

861
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,750
where it's going to press down on all
the tissue in there so we're not using

862
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:57,760
the tissue in there so we're not using
 

863
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,710
the tissue in there so we're not using
breath

864
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
breath
 

865
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,150
breath
so our breath was actually a lot of

866
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:00,160
so our breath was actually a lot of
 

867
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,750
so our breath was actually a lot of
times a default pattern when people do

868
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:01,760
times a default pattern when people do
 

869
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,189
times a default pattern when people do
that because they'll bring it into their

870
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:03,199
that because they'll bring it into their
 

871
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:03,990
that because they'll bring it into their
chest

872
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:04,000
chest
 

873
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,910
chest
and raise their rib cage so

874
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:07,920
and raise their rib cage so
 

875
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,750
and raise their rib cage so
what we want to do is just initiate the

876
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
what we want to do is just initiate the
 

877
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,590
what we want to do is just initiate the
diaphragm air can be used as well over

878
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:11,600
diaphragm air can be used as well over
 

879
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,389
diaphragm air can be used as well over
the top

880
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:12,399
the top
 

881
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,310
the top
at the final to create just a little bit

882
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:14,320
at the final to create just a little bit
 

883
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,509
at the final to create just a little bit
more downward pressure

884
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:15,519
more downward pressure
 

885
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,389
more downward pressure
but if we have out of alignment there we

886
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
but if we have out of alignment there we
 

887
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:18,949
but if we have out of alignment there we
have

888
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
have
 

889
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,069
have
a pressure get leak where it's going to

890
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:22,079
a pressure get leak where it's going to
 

891
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,829
a pressure get leak where it's going to
be push out the front or the rear if

892
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
be push out the front or the rear if
 

893
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,230
be push out the front or the rear if
you're either in flexion or extension

894
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:26,240
you're either in flexion or extension
 

895
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,550
you're either in flexion or extension
all right and then that causes this

896
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
all right and then that causes this
 

897
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,550
all right and then that causes this
co-contraction and all this pressure of

898
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
co-contraction and all this pressure of
 

899
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,670
co-contraction and all this pressure of
of uh the organs essentially against

900
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
of uh the organs essentially against
 

901
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,269
of uh the organs essentially against
outward against all those tissue for the

902
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:35,279
outward against all those tissue for the
 

903
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,030
outward against all those tissue for the
co-contraction as well as surrounding

904
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
co-contraction as well as surrounding
 

905
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,110
co-contraction as well as surrounding
the spine to be able to stabilize that

906
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,120
the spine to be able to stabilize that
 

907
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,949
the spine to be able to stabilize that
and then it puts all the muscles on both

908
00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:40,959
and then it puts all the muscles on both
 

909
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,310
and then it puts all the muscles on both
sides of the body

910
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:42,320
sides of the body
 

911
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,430
sides of the body
in what we call the the best length

912
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,440
in what we call the the best length
 

913
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,829
in what we call the the best length
tension relationship so if you think

914
00:14:47,829 --> 00:14:47,839
tension relationship so if you think
 

915
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,910
tension relationship so if you think
about a curl and we reach our arm out

916
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:49,920
about a curl and we reach our arm out
 

917
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,710
about a curl and we reach our arm out
at the extended length our bicep is not

918
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:52,720
at the extended length our bicep is not
 

919
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,430
at the extended length our bicep is not
as strong

920
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:53,440
as strong
 

921
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,870
as strong
and then all the way in the curl

922
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:54,880
and then all the way in the curl
 

923
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,230
and then all the way in the curl
position it's not in strong there's

924
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:56,240
position it's not in strong there's
 

925
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,430
position it's not in strong there's
somewhere in here that

926
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
somewhere in here that
 

927
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,069
somewhere in here that
this control of both and so when you're

928
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:00,079
this control of both and so when you're
 

929
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,350
this control of both and so when you're
sitting there

930
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:01,360
sitting there
 

931
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,069
sitting there
arched or bent over we have muscles that

932
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:04,079
arched or bent over we have muscles that
 

933
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:04,550
arched or bent over we have muscles that
are

934
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
are
 

935
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,629
are
past either one of those ranges so

936
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:06,639
past either one of those ranges so
 

937
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:07,990
past either one of those ranges so
they've got a lot of tension which then

938
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:08,000
they've got a lot of tension which then
 

939
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,670
they've got a lot of tension which then
will create relaxation on the other side

940
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:09,680
will create relaxation on the other side
 

941
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,710
will create relaxation on the other side
right so we want to have

942
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:10,720
right so we want to have
 

943
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,949
right so we want to have
and all of that needs to be working and

944
00:15:12,949 --> 00:15:12,959
and all of that needs to be working and
 

945
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,389
and all of that needs to be working and
now the next important thing is the foot

946
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:16,399
now the next important thing is the foot
 

947
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,629
now the next important thing is the foot
so it's actually this connection to the

948
00:15:18,629 --> 00:15:18,639
so it's actually this connection to the
 

949
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,670
so it's actually this connection to the
ground

950
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:19,680
ground
 

951
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,590
ground
and how we're actually using the foot

952
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:21,600
and how we're actually using the foot
 

953
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,269
and how we're actually using the foot
and ankle complex

954
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:23,279
and ankle complex
 

955
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,230
and ankle complex
to grab and grip this connection to the

956
00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:26,240
to grab and grip this connection to the
 

957
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:26,710
to grab and grip this connection to the
ground

958
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:26,720
ground
 

959
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,910
ground
and elicit uh an effect and because of

960
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:29,920
and elicit uh an effect and because of
 

961
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,389
and elicit uh an effect and because of
this

962
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:30,399
this
 

963
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,629
this
and then the everything between will

964
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
and then the everything between will
 

965
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,949
and then the everything between will
naturally kind of do what it needs to do

966
00:15:34,949 --> 00:15:34,959
naturally kind of do what it needs to do
 

967
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,910
naturally kind of do what it needs to do
so people like to focus on knee knee

968
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:37,920
so people like to focus on knee knee
 

969
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,150
so people like to focus on knee knee
position or how far out their hips are

970
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:40,160
position or how far out their hips are
 

971
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,269
position or how far out their hips are
or all this other stuff which is outputs

972
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
or all this other stuff which is outputs
 

973
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,150
or all this other stuff which is outputs
of this

974
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:44,160
of this
 

975
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,470
of this
so if we control the torso and the knee

976
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
so if we control the torso and the knee
 

977
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,069
so if we control the torso and the knee
the only thing that can happen from that

978
00:15:48,069 --> 00:15:48,079
the only thing that can happen from that
 

979
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,269
the only thing that can happen from that
point

980
00:15:49,269 --> 00:15:49,279
point
 

981
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,629
point
is for the squat to happen

982
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:52,639
is for the squat to happen
 

983
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,110
is for the squat to happen
all right um so this allows us to use

984
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:55,120
all right um so this allows us to use
 

985
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,269
all right um so this allows us to use
this massive

986
00:15:57,269 --> 00:15:57,279
this massive
 

987
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,509
this massive
you know the hip complex for all the

988
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
you know the hip complex for all the
 

989
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,910
you know the hip complex for all the
muscles around that that are

990
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
muscles around that that are
 

991
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,829
muscles around that that are
built to drive through hip extension to

992
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:03,839
built to drive through hip extension to
 

993
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,030
built to drive through hip extension to
complete the squat

994
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:05,040
complete the squat
 

995
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,710
complete the squat
i did actually miss one thing in there

996
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
i did actually miss one thing in there
 

997
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,150
i did actually miss one thing in there
so this torso people

998
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,160
so this torso people
 

999
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,230
so this torso people
often miss the lat is a spinal

1000
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
often miss the lat is a spinal
 

1001
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,430
often miss the lat is a spinal
stabilizer as well

1002
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:11,440
stabilizer as well
 

1003
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,509
stabilizer as well
so that's key in controlling function at

1004
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:13,519
so that's key in controlling function at
 

1005
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,749
so that's key in controlling function at
the the tl junction

1006
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:15,759
the the tl junction
 

1007
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,069
the the tl junction
which is um just above the the lumbar

1008
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:18,079
which is um just above the the lumbar
 

1009
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,030
which is um just above the the lumbar
spine so

1010
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:19,040
spine so
 

1011
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,550
spine so
kind of right opposite where your

1012
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
kind of right opposite where your
 

1013
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,990
kind of right opposite where your
sternum is and you'll see people kind of

1014
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:22,000
sternum is and you'll see people kind of
 

1015
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,430
sternum is and you'll see people kind of
roll over sometimes like an olympic

1016
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
roll over sometimes like an olympic
 

1017
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,710
roll over sometimes like an olympic
squad or something like that where they

1018
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:24,720
squad or something like that where they
 

1019
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,550
squad or something like that where they
lose position

1020
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:26,560
lose position
 

1021
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,829
lose position
and that's often because they're close

1022
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:27,839
and that's often because they're close
 

1023
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,189
and that's often because they're close
grip because you can't engage the lats

1024
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:29,199
grip because you can't engage the lats
 

1025
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,389
grip because you can't engage the lats
very well that way and they're pushing

1026
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:30,399
very well that way and they're pushing
 

1027
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,350
very well that way and they're pushing
up in the bar

1028
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,360
up in the bar
 

1029
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,269
up in the bar
but you want to be able to drive and

1030
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:33,279
but you want to be able to drive and
 

1031
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,110
but you want to be able to drive and
pull the bar to your center and that's

1032
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
pull the bar to your center and that's
 

1033
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,870
pull the bar to your center and that's
going to create and use the lats now to

1034
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
going to create and use the lats now to
 

1035
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,430
going to create and use the lats now to
drive

1036
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:37,440
drive
 

1037
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,710
drive
and connect the shoulder into this

1038
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:40,720
and connect the shoulder into this
 

1039
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,310
and connect the shoulder into this
we're kind of compressing and tightening

1040
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,320
we're kind of compressing and tightening
 

1041
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,069
we're kind of compressing and tightening
all this stuff towards that center to

1042
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:44,079
all this stuff towards that center to
 

1043
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,629
all this stuff towards that center to
create

1044
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
create
 

1045
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,470
create
that entire torso stability that's why i

1046
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
that entire torso stability that's why i
 

1047
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,629
that entire torso stability that's why i
was using torso stability not just

1048
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:48,639
was using torso stability not just
 

1049
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,350
was using torso stability not just
core stability uh in my conversation

1050
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
core stability uh in my conversation
 

1051
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,269
core stability uh in my conversation
earlier

1052
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:53,279
earlier
 

1053
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,749
earlier
okay so there's all these like modules

1054
00:16:55,749 --> 00:16:55,759
okay so there's all these like modules
 

1055
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,189
okay so there's all these like modules
yeah with the body

1056
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
yeah with the body
 

1057
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,509
yeah with the body
then connected to the grounding with

1058
00:16:59,509 --> 00:16:59,519
then connected to the grounding with
 

1059
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,069
then connected to the grounding with
like your feet on the ground

1060
00:17:02,069 --> 00:17:02,079
like your feet on the ground
 

1061
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,870
like your feet on the ground
everything you're speaking to how do you

1062
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:04,880
everything you're speaking to how do you
 

1063
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,309
everything you're speaking to how do you
work each of those modules

1064
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
work each of those modules
 

1065
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,870
work each of those modules
is this over time you kind of develop

1066
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
is this over time you kind of develop
 

1067
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,789
is this over time you kind of develop
the feel that ultimately boils down to

1068
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:10,799
the feel that ultimately boils down to
 

1069
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,870
the feel that ultimately boils down to
this one simple cue that you mentioned

1070
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:12,880
this one simple cue that you mentioned
 

1071
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,829
this one simple cue that you mentioned
or do you can you like literally study

1072
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:15,839
or do you can you like literally study
 

1073
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,909
or do you can you like literally study
each particular module and yourself and

1074
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
each particular module and yourself and
 

1075
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,270
each particular module and yourself and
see how it affects the

1076
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:19,280
see how it affects the
 

1077
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,590
see how it affects the
lift so the best way and i believe it's

1078
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:21,600
lift so the best way and i believe it's
 

1079
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,870
lift so the best way and i believe it's
because i hate just like

1080
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:22,880
because i hate just like
 

1081
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,949
because i hate just like
people getting out and just doing just

1082
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:24,959
people getting out and just doing just
 

1083
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,630
people getting out and just doing just
movement stuff and not actually adding

1084
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:26,640
movement stuff and not actually adding
 

1085
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,829
movement stuff and not actually adding
load because

1086
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:27,839
load because
 

1087
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,230
load because
we only adapt when there's load maybe we

1088
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:30,240
we only adapt when there's load maybe we
 

1089
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,190
we only adapt when there's load maybe we
can get some

1090
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:31,200
can get some
 

1091
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,789
can get some
you know some proprioception or

1092
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
you know some proprioception or
 

1093
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,470
you know some proprioception or
awareness of position and other stuff

1094
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:34,480
awareness of position and other stuff
 

1095
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,350
awareness of position and other stuff
doing some some corrective patterns and

1096
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:37,360
doing some some corrective patterns and
 

1097
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,390
doing some some corrective patterns and
other stuff

1098
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:38,400
other stuff
 

1099
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,669
other stuff
but this is basic physiology

1100
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:41,679
but this is basic physiology
 

1101
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,390
but this is basic physiology
is that there must be an imposed demand

1102
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,400
is that there must be an imposed demand
 

1103
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,310
is that there must be an imposed demand
for us to have adaptation and this is

1104
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:46,320
for us to have adaptation and this is
 

1105
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,230
for us to have adaptation and this is
mental this is emotional this is

1106
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
mental this is emotional this is
 

1107
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,430
mental this is emotional this is
all these areas um but

1108
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:51,440
all these areas um but
 

1109
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,310
all these areas um but
and people miss that so i prefer to be

1110
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:54,320
and people miss that so i prefer to be
 

1111
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,590
and people miss that so i prefer to be
able to

1112
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
able to
 

1113
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,270
able to
look at a person and this is our

1114
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:57,280
look at a person and this is our
 

1115
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,029
look at a person and this is our
methodology and do the assessment

1116
00:17:59,029 --> 00:17:59,039
methodology and do the assessment
 

1117
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,830
methodology and do the assessment
in any basic loaded movement so with

1118
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:01,840
in any basic loaded movement so with
 

1119
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,510
in any basic loaded movement so with
developing an eye for that you can

1120
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:03,520
developing an eye for that you can
 

1121
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,789
developing an eye for that you can
actually see and go

1122
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:04,799
actually see and go
 

1123
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,230
actually see and go
okay we've got a fault pattern right

1124
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:06,240
okay we've got a fault pattern right
 

1125
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,630
okay we've got a fault pattern right
here in the foot and use a queue or a

1126
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
here in the foot and use a queue or a
 

1127
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,150
here in the foot and use a queue or a
set of cues doesn't really matter until

1128
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
set of cues doesn't really matter until
 

1129
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,350
set of cues doesn't really matter until
we find the one that works

1130
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:11,360
we find the one that works
 

1131
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,950
we find the one that works
and bring that and now we know we want

1132
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
and bring that and now we know we want
 

1133
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,630
and bring that and now we know we want
to simplify this stuff i just walk

1134
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
to simplify this stuff i just walk
 

1135
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,909
to simplify this stuff i just walk
through that sounds really complicated

1136
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:15,919
through that sounds really complicated
 

1137
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:16,470
through that sounds really complicated
and it

1138
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
and it
 

1139
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,830
and it
it is if we try to break down and

1140
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:17,840
it is if we try to break down and
 

1141
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,590
it is if we try to break down and
distill it all but like let's just

1142
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:19,600
distill it all but like let's just
 

1143
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,190
distill it all but like let's just
find the basic stuff that gets us in the

1144
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:21,200
find the basic stuff that gets us in the
 

1145
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,190
find the basic stuff that gets us in the
range start working and then find the

1146
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
range start working and then find the
 

1147
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,950
range start working and then find the
next as we add load

1148
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
next as we add load
 

1149
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,110
next as we add load
now we find where's our next area that

1150
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:27,120
now we find where's our next area that
 

1151
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,870
now we find where's our next area that
we're starting to fault at and then go

1152
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:28,880
we're starting to fault at and then go
 

1153
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,230
we're starting to fault at and then go
there again next so

1154
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
there again next so
 

1155
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,750
there again next so
this is what we do what we teach in our

1156
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:31,760
this is what we do what we teach in our
 

1157
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,270
this is what we do what we teach in our
educational platform so we

1158
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:33,280
educational platform so we
 

1159
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,270
educational platform so we
are the only i believe everybody wants

1160
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:35,280
are the only i believe everybody wants
 

1161
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,830
are the only i believe everybody wants
to do a lot of these like

1162
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
to do a lot of these like
 

1163
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,150
to do a lot of these like
assessments you know on a bench on the

1164
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:40,160
assessments you know on a bench on the
 

1165
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,029
assessments you know on a bench on the
table body

1166
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:41,039
table body
 

1167
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,390
table body
and and it's like no let's let's go

1168
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
and and it's like no let's let's go
 

1169
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,909
and and it's like no let's let's go
squat let's go deadlift if you do

1170
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
squat let's go deadlift if you do
 

1171
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,909
squat let's go deadlift if you do
strongmen in a ceo carry let's go carry

1172
00:18:45,909 --> 00:18:45,919
strongmen in a ceo carry let's go carry
 

1173
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:46,950
strongmen in a ceo carry let's go carry
because these are basic human

1174
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:46,960
because these are basic human
 

1175
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,950
because these are basic human
fundamentals it's not powerlifting

1176
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:48,960
fundamentals it's not powerlifting
 

1177
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,190
fundamentals it's not powerlifting
like this is how we function this is why

1178
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
like this is how we function this is why
 

1179
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,630
like this is how we function this is why
we we work with

1180
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
we we work with
 

1181
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,110
we we work with
29 of the 30 major league baseball teams

and uh north america i do mean hockey

1194
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:04,799
and uh north america i do mean hockey
 

1195
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:06,549
and uh north america i do mean hockey
too

1196
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:06,559
too
 

1197
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,350
too
but uh these principles like you know if

1198
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
but uh these principles like you know if
 

1199
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:09,990
but uh these principles like you know if
if the dodgers

1200
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
if the dodgers
 

1201
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,310
if the dodgers
won't bring us in they're not learning

1202
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:12,320
won't bring us in they're not learning
 

1203
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,029
won't bring us in they're not learning
how to

1204
00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:13,039
how to
 

1205
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,350
how to
power lift you know we're gonna

1206
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:15,360
power lift you know we're gonna
 

1207
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,310
power lift you know we're gonna
obviously we'll probably

1208
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:16,320
obviously we'll probably
 

1209
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,710
obviously we'll probably
do we do a little bit more uh shoulder

1210
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:18,720
do we do a little bit more uh shoulder
 

1211
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,110
do we do a little bit more uh shoulder
focus than hip focus with their athletes

1212
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:21,120
focus than hip focus with their athletes
 

1213
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,710
focus than hip focus with their athletes
or their coaches we're usually working

1214
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,720
or their coaches we're usually working
 

1215
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,230
or their coaches we're usually working
with coaches not the athletes and so you

1216
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:24,240
with coaches not the athletes and so you
 

1217
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:24,950
with coaches not the athletes and so you
help them

1218
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:24,960
help them
 

1219
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,870
help them
and then the same thing on yourself and

1220
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:26,880
and then the same thing on yourself and
 

1221
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,310
and then the same thing on yourself and
to understand the role that these

1222
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:28,320
to understand the role that these
 

1223
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,990
to understand the role that these
different muscle groups have

1224
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:30,000
different muscle groups have
 

1225
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,789
different muscle groups have
yes on the holistic yeah so it's all

1226
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799
yes on the holistic yeah so it's all
 

1227
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,270
yes on the holistic yeah so it's all
about

1228
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:33,280
about
 

1229
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,870
about
getting the joints in the appropriate

1230
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:34,880
getting the joints in the appropriate
 

1231
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,510
getting the joints in the appropriate
position so that we can

1232
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:37,520
position so that we can
 

1233
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,110
position so that we can
that we can manage loads so that we're

1234
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,120
that we can manage loads so that we're
 

1235
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,630
that we can manage loads so that we're
not putting undue stress in the joint

1236
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:40,640
not putting undue stress in the joint
 

1237
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,990
not putting undue stress in the joint
we're getting the proper length tension

1238
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:42,000
we're getting the proper length tension
 

1239
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,590
we're getting the proper length tension
we're getting these basic fundamental

1240
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:43,600
we're getting these basic fundamental
 

1241
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,190
we're getting these basic fundamental
things with the body and so

1242
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:45,200
things with the body and so
 

1243
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,669
things with the body and so
the the largest global impact that you

1244
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:47,679
the the largest global impact that you
 

1245
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:48,789
the the largest global impact that you
will have

1246
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:48,799
will have
 

1247
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,270
will have
is through spinal mechanics i can't look

1248
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
is through spinal mechanics i can't look
 

1249
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,710
is through spinal mechanics i can't look
at a shoulder

1250
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:52,720
at a shoulder
 

1251
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,390
at a shoulder
if i'm not managing this because it's

1252
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:54,400
if i'm not managing this because it's
 

1253
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,830
if i'm not managing this because it's
your spine so for those that are just

1254
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:55,840
your spine so for those that are just
 

1255
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,549
your spine so for those that are just
listening like

1256
00:19:56,549 --> 00:19:56,559
listening like
 

1257
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,830
listening like
i'm arching and then and then flexing um

1258
00:19:59,830 --> 00:19:59,840
i'm arching and then and then flexing um
 

1259
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,350
i'm arching and then and then flexing um
that's going to affect shoulder

1260
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:01,360
that's going to affect shoulder
 

1261
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,710
that's going to affect shoulder
extension flexion all these sorts of

1262
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:02,720
extension flexion all these sorts of
 

1263
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,750
extension flexion all these sorts of
things so

1264
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:03,760
things so
 

1265
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,510
things so
it could even affect things down what's

1266
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:05,520
it could even affect things down what's
 

1267
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,110
it could even affect things down what's
looking at dorsiflexion issues on the

1268
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:07,120
looking at dorsiflexion issues on the
 

1269
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,070
looking at dorsiflexion issues on the
foot like

1270
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,080
foot like
 

1271
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,590
foot like
and then that's why i go to the foot

1272
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
and then that's why i go to the foot
 

1273
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,270
and then that's why i go to the foot
next because it has the second largest

1274
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,280
next because it has the second largest
 

1275
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,710
next because it has the second largest
global impact

1276
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:12,720
global impact
 

1277
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,990
global impact
and then from there now i'm going to

1278
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,000
and then from there now i'm going to
 

1279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,430
and then from there now i'm going to
look at the big energy drivers which is

1280
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:15,440
look at the big energy drivers which is
 

1281
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,390
look at the big energy drivers which is
the hip complex

1282
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:16,400
the hip complex
 

1283
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,950
the hip complex
shoulder complex and then we can start

1284
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:18,960
shoulder complex and then we can start
 

1285
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,630
shoulder complex and then we can start
looking at kind of the peripheral

1286
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:20,640
looking at kind of the peripheral
 

1287
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,070
looking at kind of the peripheral
things but usually that's some sort of

1288
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,080
things but usually that's some sort of
 

1289
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,669
things but usually that's some sort of
output of the other but

1290
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:23,679
output of the other but
 

1291
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,590
output of the other but
the knees the elbows the things like

1292
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:25,600
the knees the elbows the things like
 

1293
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,950
the knees the elbows the things like
that so it's all about

1294
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:26,960
that so it's all about
 

1295
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,710
that so it's all about
getting the stack which affects

1296
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:28,720
getting the stack which affects
 

1297
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,390
getting the stack which affects
neurology

1298
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:30,400
neurology
 

1299
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,510
neurology
so let's talk engineering terms you get

1300
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:33,520
so let's talk engineering terms you get
 

1301
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,149
so let's talk engineering terms you get
in a car

1302
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,159
in a car
 

1303
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,669
in a car
modern car today and a lot of them will

1304
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:35,679
modern car today and a lot of them will
 

1305
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,270
modern car today and a lot of them will
have this traction control button in

1306
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:37,280
have this traction control button in
 

1307
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,870
have this traction control button in
there and there's a big misconception

1308
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
there and there's a big misconception
 

1309
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,669
there and there's a big misconception
that

1310
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:39,679
that
 

1311
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,590
that
you know i'm i'm out and it's it's

1312
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:41,600
you know i'm i'm out and it's it's
 

1313
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,909
you know i'm i'm out and it's it's
snowier here in austin only rainy well

1314
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:43,919
snowier here in austin only rainy well
 

1315
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,029
snowier here in austin only rainy well
probably doesn't rain much but

1316
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
probably doesn't rain much but
 

1317
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,470
probably doesn't rain much but
you're going around a corner starts

1318
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:46,480
you're going around a corner starts
 

1319
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,590
you're going around a corner starts
slipping it's like oh it's going to send

1320
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:47,600
slipping it's like oh it's going to send
 

1321
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,710
slipping it's like oh it's going to send
the powers from the wheels that are

1322
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:48,720
the powers from the wheels that are
 

1323
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,590
the powers from the wheels that are
slipping through the ones that are

1324
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:49,600
slipping through the ones that are
 

1325
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,470
slipping through the ones that are
gripping

1326
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:50,480
gripping
 

1327
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,390
gripping
and keep me from crashing and dying a

1328
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:52,400
and keep me from crashing and dying a
 

1329
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,310
and keep me from crashing and dying a
fiery death

1330
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:54,320
fiery death
 

1331
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,149
fiery death
well that's not how it works it's the

1332
00:20:56,149 --> 00:20:56,159
well that's not how it works it's the
 

1333
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,070
well that's not how it works it's the
exact same we've got we've got the

1334
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,080
exact same we've got we've got the
 

1335
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,390
exact same we've got we've got the
we've got the tires which are our foot

1336
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:00,400
we've got the tires which are our foot
 

1337
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,310
we've got the tires which are our foot
you know the connection to the ground

1338
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:02,320
you know the connection to the ground
 

1339
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,350
you know the connection to the ground
right we've got the power driver

1340
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:05,360
right we've got the power driver
 

1341
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,190
right we've got the power driver
which is you know the the engine the

1342
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:07,200
which is you know the the engine the
 

1343
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,710
which is you know the the engine the
transmission delivering

1344
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:08,720
transmission delivering
 

1345
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,710
transmission delivering
you know the power through it and we've

1346
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
you know the power through it and we've
 

1347
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,950
you know the power through it and we've
got the stability our suspension

1348
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:12,960
got the stability our suspension
 

1349
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,230
got the stability our suspension
and then we have the neurology

1350
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:16,240
and then we have the neurology
 

1351
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,070
and then we have the neurology
and what the neurology is doing it's

1352
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,080
and what the neurology is doing it's
 

1353
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,669
and what the neurology is doing it's
sensing

1354
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
sensing
 

1355
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,630
sensing
that we don't have good stability or

1356
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:22,640
that we don't have good stability or
 

1357
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,390
that we don't have good stability or
loss of connection somewhere

1358
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
loss of connection somewhere
 

1359
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,390
loss of connection somewhere
and so i need to save you from crashing

1360
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
and so i need to save you from crashing
 

1361
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,750
and so i need to save you from crashing
and hurting yourself

1362
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:27,760
and hurting yourself
 

1363
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,909
and hurting yourself
and so it goes to the engine and says

1364
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:29,919
and so it goes to the engine and says
 

1365
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,350
and so it goes to the engine and says
let's [\h__\h] the timing

1366
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:31,360
let's [\h__\h] the timing
 

1367
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,870
let's [\h__\h] the timing
let's reduce the shift patterns and

1368
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:32,880
let's reduce the shift patterns and
 

1369
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,430
let's reduce the shift patterns and
we're just reducing the power output

1370
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:35,440
we're just reducing the power output
 

1371
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,110
we're just reducing the power output
and that's straight how the human body

1372
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:37,120
and that's straight how the human body
 

1373
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,510
and that's straight how the human body
works so when i do this stuff

1374
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:39,520
works so when i do this stuff
 

1375
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,830
works so when i do this stuff
it's actually affecting that i mean i

1376
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:41,840
it's actually affecting that i mean i
 

1377
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,270
it's actually affecting that i mean i
can take somebody and do some minute

1378
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,280
can take somebody and do some minute
 

1379
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,549
can take somebody and do some minute
changes with the neck

1380
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:44,559
changes with the neck
 

1381
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,750
changes with the neck
position at the thoracic outlet okay and

1382
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:47,760
position at the thoracic outlet okay and
 

1383
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,789
position at the thoracic outlet okay and
immediately see an enhancement in power

1384
00:21:50,789 --> 00:21:50,799
immediately see an enhancement in power
 

1385
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,149
immediately see an enhancement in power
output and i can measure it we measure

1386
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:52,159
output and i can measure it we measure
 

1387
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:52,870
output and i can measure it we measure
this stuff

1388
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:52,880
this stuff
 

1389
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,750
this stuff
with uh velocity uh devices and see like

1390
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:55,760
with uh velocity uh devices and see like
 

1391
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,870
with uh velocity uh devices and see like
a 10

1392
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:56,880
a 10
 

1393
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,590
a 10
boom jump and so if you think about that

1394
00:21:59,590 --> 00:21:59,600
boom jump and so if you think about that
 

1395
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,029
boom jump and so if you think about that
what about all your training through the

1396
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
what about all your training through the
 

1397
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,990
what about all your training through the
years

1398
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:02,000
years
 

1399
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,510
years
where you actually had additional

1400
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:03,520
where you actually had additional
 

1401
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,590
where you actually had additional
capacity

1402
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:05,600
capacity
 

1403
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,830
capacity
but you weren't using it because your

1404
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
but you weren't using it because your
 

1405
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,669
but you weren't using it because your
traction control was on

1406
00:22:09,669 --> 00:22:09,679
traction control was on
 

1407
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,950
traction control was on
now you figure this out stuff and now

1408
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:10,960
now you figure this out stuff and now
 

1409
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,350
now you figure this out stuff and now
you start stacking it now you can see

1410
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:13,360
you start stacking it now you can see
 

1411
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,390
you start stacking it now you can see
so much greater so it's not just injury

1412
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
so much greater so it's not just injury
 

1413
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,590
so much greater so it's not just injury
prevention

1414
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
prevention
 

1415
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,149
prevention
this is performance and additive

1416
00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:20,159
this is performance and additive
 

1417
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,029
this is performance and additive
performance

1418
00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:21,039
performance
 

1419
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,909
performance
over time this is huge and people don't

1420
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
over time this is huge and people don't
 

1421
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,070
over time this is huge and people don't
really think about this stuff

1422
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
really think about this stuff
 

1423
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,470
really think about this stuff
but we can turn that stuff off which is

1424
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
but we can turn that stuff off which is
 

1425
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,470
but we can turn that stuff off which is
actually going to also again make us

1426
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:30,480
actually going to also again make us
 

1427
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,070
actually going to also again make us
make us safer but what we want to do is

1428
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:32,080
make us safer but what we want to do is
 

1429
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,830
make us safer but what we want to do is
the performance tuned race car do they

1430
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:33,840
the performance tuned race car do they
 

1431
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,149
the performance tuned race car do they
have a traction control button

1432
00:22:36,149 --> 00:22:36,159
have a traction control button
 

1433
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,789
have a traction control button
no they got some amazing tires to grip

1434
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:38,799
no they got some amazing tires to grip
 

1435
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:39,350
no they got some amazing tires to grip
the ground

1436

it to the floor
 

1445
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,950
it to the floor
okay that's a performance vehicle that's

1446
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:48,960
okay that's a performance vehicle that's
 

1447
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,070
okay that's a performance vehicle that's
what we want to be

what we want to be
 

1449
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,230
what we want to be
i want to continue on that line but

1450
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:52,240
i want to continue on that line but
 

1451
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,669
i want to continue on that line but
first i have to ask

1452
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:53,679
first i have to ask
 

1453
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:55,590
first i have to ask
like how did it feel to accomplish the

1454
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:55,600
like how did it feel to accomplish the
 

1455
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,710
like how did it feel to accomplish the
grand goal oh my god

1456
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:56,720
grand goal oh my god
 

1457
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,750
grand goal oh my god
okay when you just stand back oh

1458
00:22:59,750 --> 00:22:59,760
okay when you just stand back oh
 

1459
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,630
okay when you just stand back oh
my thousand pounds for reps what it feel

mortality at that point
 

1665
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,269
mortality at that point
so good question but it is certainly not

1666

00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
that was an expression of some of my

00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,750
that was an expression of some of my
values

1678
00:26:59,750 --> 00:26:59,760
values
 

1679
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,070

and the way that i want to live it was a
 

1681

way of expressing it so
 

1683
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,710
way of expressing it so
understanding that is hugely fundamental

1684
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
understanding that is hugely fundamental
 

1685
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,789
understanding that is hugely fundamental
because we do see so many athletes

1686
00:27:10,789 --> 00:27:10,799
because we do see so many athletes

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,950
because we do see so many athletes
get to the end of a career and then they

1688
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:12,960
get to the end of a career and then they
 

1689
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,630
get to the end of a career and then they
fall into

1690
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:14,640
fall into
 

1691
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,110

drugs
 

1695
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,950
drugs
alcohol depression so on because they

1696
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:20,960
alcohol depression so on because they
 

1697
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,269
alcohol depression so on because they
lost how they identified themself and

1698
00:27:23,269 --> 00:27:23,279
lost how they identified themself and
 

1699

trying to figure out where to turn what

1700
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
trying to figure out where to turn what
 

1701
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,590
trying to figure out where to turn what
to do but a

1702
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:25,600
to do but a
 

1703
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,909
to do but a
big central component of their identity

1704
00:27:27,909 --> 00:27:27,919
big central component of their identity

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,269
big central component of their identity
is lost

1706
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:29,279
is lost
 

1707
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:32,710
is lost
so i

1708
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:32,720
so i
 

1709
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,029
so i
knew that this was one way to express

1710
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:35,039
knew that this was one way to express
 

1711
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,950
knew that this was one way to express
that and my grand goals

1712
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:36,960
that and my grand goals
 

1713
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,669
that and my grand goals
have shifted they're shifted to other

1714

have shifted they're shifted to other
 

1715
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,669
have shifted they're shifted to other
outlets that allow me to express that

1716
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
outlets that allow me to express that
 

1717
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:42,870
outlets that allow me to express that
like my companies

1718
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:42,880
like my companies
 

1719

having some guidance doing so like
if you've got mental health issues this

2604
00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:03,359
if you've got mental health issues this
 

2605
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,870
if you've got mental health issues this
isn't something that you need to tackle

2606
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:04,880
isn't something that you need to tackle
 

2607
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,670
isn't something that you need to tackle
on your own

2608
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:05,680
on your own
 

2609
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,589
on your own
like having a professional that can help

2610
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:07,599
like having a professional that can help
 

2611
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:10,069
like having a professional that can help
guide you on that introspective journey

2612
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:10,079
guide you on that introspective journey
 

2613
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,270
guide you on that introspective journey
is is something like

2614
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:13,280
is is something like
 

2615
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,950
is is something like
it's not like hey i'm big tough guy i

2616
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
it's not like hey i'm big tough guy i
 

2617
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,430
it's not like hey i'm big tough guy i
can handle everything

2618
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:17,440
can handle everything
 

2619
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,470
can handle everything
you know that's fascinating that um

2620
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:20,480
you know that's fascinating that um
 

2621
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:24,309
you know that's fascinating that um
you saved yourself that's quite

2622
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:24,319
you saved yourself that's quite
 

2623
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:27,349
you saved yourself that's quite
powerful to save yourself by uh having

2624
00:43:27,349 --> 00:43:27,359
powerful to save yourself by uh having
 

2625
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:29,750
powerful to save yourself by uh having
others depend on you and so you can't

2626
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:29,760
others depend on you and so you can't
 

2627
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,550
others depend on you and so you can't
fail you can't [\h__\h] it up and that's a

2628
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:32,560
fail you can't [\h__\h] it up and that's a
 

2629
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,230
fail you can't [\h__\h] it up and that's a
reason to keep

2630
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
reason to keep
 

2631
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,349
reason to keep
moving forward but on the flip side

2632
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:37,359
moving forward but on the flip side
 

2633
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,030
moving forward but on the flip side
that's not

2634
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
that's not
 

2635
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,069
that's not
addressing the darkness it's not and

2636
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
addressing the darkness it's not and
 

2637
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,630
addressing the darkness it's not and
it's probably not a sustainable strategy

2638
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:44,640
it's probably not a sustainable strategy
 

2639
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:45,910
it's probably not a sustainable strategy
either right so i i

2640
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:45,920
either right so i i
 

2641
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,309
either right so i i
recognize these things i don't know and

2642
00:43:48,309 --> 00:43:48,319
recognize these things i don't know and
 

2643
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:49,910
recognize these things i don't know and
uh

2644
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:49,920
uh
 

2645
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,750
uh
perhaps it is sustainable perhaps that's

2646
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:51,760
perhaps it is sustainable perhaps that's
 

2647
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:54,390
perhaps it is sustainable perhaps that's
i mean there's something beautiful about

2648
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:54,400
i mean there's something beautiful about
 

2649
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,829
i mean there's something beautiful about
giving yourself basically in service of

2650
00:43:57,829 --> 00:43:57,839
giving yourself basically in service of
 

2651
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:58,870
giving yourself basically in service of
others

2652
00:43:58,870 --> 00:43:58,880
others
 

2653
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,630
others
and thereby creating purpose

2654
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:02,640
and thereby creating purpose
 

2655
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,990
and thereby creating purpose
and then like it's almost like fake it

2656
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,000
and then like it's almost like fake it
 

2657
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,990
and then like it's almost like fake it
till you make it and then you make it

2658
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
till you make it and then you make it
 

2659
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:06,870
till you make it and then you make it
eventually

2660
00:44:06,870 --> 00:44:06,880
eventually
 

2661
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,670
eventually
that is purpose though that is purpose i

2662
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:09,680
that is purpose though that is purpose i
 

2663
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,190
that is purpose though that is purpose i
mean you have to

2664
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:11,200
mean you have to
 

2665
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,950
mean you have to
to me life is about

2666
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:14,960
to me life is about
 

2667
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,870
to me life is about
taking your cup and how you choose to

2668
00:44:16,870 --> 00:44:16,880
taking your cup and how you choose to
 

2669
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,109
taking your cup and how you choose to
pour it out how you choose to give

2670
00:44:19,109 --> 00:44:19,119
pour it out how you choose to give
 

2671
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,190
pour it out how you choose to give
what is your purpose what is that

2672
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:21,200
what is your purpose what is that
 

2673
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,870
what is your purpose what is that
connection with everybody around you

2674
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:22,880
connection with everybody around you
 

2675
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,550
connection with everybody around you
this is

2676
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:24,560
this is
 

2677
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,710
this is
that's that's the intent that's the life

2678
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:26,720
that's that's the intent that's the life
 

2679
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,550
that's that's the intent that's the life
that's that's what life is about

2680
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:28,560
that's that's what life is about
 

2681
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,710
that's that's what life is about
how are you going to help those around

2682
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:30,720
how are you going to help those around
 

2683
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,910
how are you going to help those around
you how are you going to help the world

2684
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:31,920
you how are you going to help the world
 

2685
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,309
you how are you going to help the world
you know

2686
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:32,319
you know
 

2687
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,470
you know
your purposes is right here figuring out

2688
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:34,480
your purposes is right here figuring out
 

2689
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,349
your purposes is right here figuring out
what this is

2690
00:44:35,349 --> 00:44:35,359
what this is
 

2691
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:37,990
what this is
and then how to do that but at the same

2692
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
and then how to do that but at the same
 

2693
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,870
and then how to do that but at the same
time

2694
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
time
 

2695
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,950
time
you can't let that run dry so you have

2696
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:40,960
you can't let that run dry so you have
 

2697
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,390
you can't let that run dry so you have
to make sure

2698
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:42,400
to make sure
 

2699
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,430
to make sure
right that you're filling that's the

2700
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:43,440
right that you're filling that's the
 

2701
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,230
right that you're filling that's the
other side that's the other side right

2702
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:46,240
other side that's the other side right
 

2703
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,790
other side that's the other side right
that's the other side yeah we'll return

2704
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:48,800
that's the other side yeah we'll return
 

2705
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,630
that's the other side yeah we'll return
to your engineering degree which

2706
00:44:50,630 --> 00:44:50,640
to your engineering degree which
 

2707
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,150
to your engineering degree which
you're obviously scientifically

2708
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:52,160
you're obviously scientifically
 

2709
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,190
you're obviously scientifically
engineering-minded which is fascinating

2710
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:55,200
engineering-minded which is fascinating
 

2711
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,870
engineering-minded which is fascinating
your book is titled the eagle and the

2712
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:56,880
your book is titled the eagle and the
 

2713
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,309
your book is titled the eagle and the
dragon

2714
00:44:58,309 --> 00:44:58,319
dragon
 

2715
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,470
dragon
uh what do the eagle and the dragon

2716
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
uh what do the eagle and the dragon
 

2717
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,069
uh what do the eagle and the dragon
symbolize

2718
00:45:02,069 --> 00:45:02,079
symbolize
 

2719
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,910
symbolize
they're pretty big symbols for me in

2720
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:03,920
they're pretty big symbols for me in
 

2721
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,910
they're pretty big symbols for me in
fact that covers my entire body

2722
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
fact that covers my entire body
 

2723
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,630
fact that covers my entire body
as a tattoo so the first one i had done

2724
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:08,640
as a tattoo so the first one i had done
 

2725
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,510
as a tattoo so the first one i had done
is around

2726
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:09,520
is around
 

2727
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,470
is around
19 years old and so this is or started

2728
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
19 years old and so this is or started
 

2729
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,750
19 years old and so this is or started
at 19.

2730
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:13,760
at 19.
 

2731
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,790
at 19.
uh it's an uh an eagle that covers my

2732
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:16,800
uh it's an uh an eagle that covers my
 

2733
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,349
uh it's an uh an eagle that covers my
entire

2734
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:17,359
entire
 

2735
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,470
entire
front you know my stomach rib cage and

2736
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:20,480
front you know my stomach rib cage and
 

2737
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,990
front you know my stomach rib cage and
and one that was on my back that covered

2738
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:22,000
and one that was on my back that covered
 

2739
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,390
and one that was on my back that covered
most of my back and there's

2740
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
most of my back and there's
 

2741
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:28,630
most of my back and there's
chained at the well at the claw i guess

2742
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:28,640
chained at the well at the claw i guess
 

2743
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,309
chained at the well at the claw i guess
and the chain wraps down around and

2744
00:45:30,309 --> 00:45:30,319
and the chain wraps down around and
 

2745
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,390
and the chain wraps down around and
attaches to to my ankle and there's a

2746
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:32,400
attaches to to my ankle and there's a
 

2747
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,430
attaches to to my ankle and there's a
shackle there

2748
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:33,440
shackle there
 

2749
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,430
shackle there
and so this was something that i had

2750
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
and so this was something that i had
 

2751
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,109
and so this was something that i had
done at that age because it was

2752
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:37,119
done at that age because it was
 

2753
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,510
done at that age because it was
to me it was a representation of

2754
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:41,520
to me it was a representation of
 

2755
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,750
to me it was a representation of
your potential your strengths your

2756
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:43,760

that's the funny thing about just the
 

3489
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,789
that's the funny thing about just the
human just make sure you're filling the

3490
00:58:50,789 --> 00:58:50,799
human just make sure you're filling the
 

3491
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,549
human just make sure you're filling the
cup as you're going through it

3492
00:58:52,549 --> 00:58:52,559
cup as you're going through it
 

3493
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,870
cup as you're going through it
all out so yeah that's the part to

3494
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
all out so yeah that's the part to
 

3495
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,910
all out so yeah that's the part to
figure out right sure

3496
00:58:55,910 --> 00:58:55,920
figure out right sure
 

3497
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,349

eventually eventually the cup will be

3500
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:01,200
eventually eventually the cup will be
 

3501
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:02,789
eventually eventually the cup will be
empty

3502
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:02,799
empty
 

3503
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:05,109
empty
uh this will maybe time the refilling of

3504
00:59:05,109 --> 00:59:05,119
uh this will maybe time the refilling of
 

3505
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:06,630
uh this will maybe time the refilling of
the cup correctly

3506
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:06,640
the cup correctly
 

3507
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,230
the cup correctly

00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:01,030
they're different qualities so
your training as it relates to that is

3556
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,040
your training as it relates to that is
 

3557
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,870
your training as it relates to that is
how you cycle in the development

3558
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:02,880
how you cycle in the development
 

3559
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,069
how you cycle in the development
of those qualities what we want to think

3560
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:06,079
of those qualities what we want to think
 

3561
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:06,789
of those qualities what we want to think
about is

3562
01:00:06,789 --> 01:00:06,799
about is
 

3563
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:07,990
about is
there's a lot of different frames of

3564
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:08,000
there's a lot of different frames of
 

3565
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,549
there's a lot of different frames of
thought some very uh

3566
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:10,559
thought some very uh
 

3567
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,710
thought some very uh
classical maybe not classical russian

3568
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
classical maybe not classical russian
 

3569
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,510
classical maybe not classical russian
approach because there's a lot of

3570
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
approach because there's a lot of
 

3571
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,950
approach because there's a lot of
different approach from the eastern

3572
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:14,960
different approach from the eastern
 

3573
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,270
different approach from the eastern
bloc but one of the ones is developing

3574
01:00:17,270 --> 01:00:17,280
bloc but one of the ones is developing
 

3575
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,630
bloc but one of the ones is developing
all the qualities at once you know

3576
01:00:18,630 --> 01:00:18,640
all the qualities at once you know
 

3577
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:19,589
all the qualities at once you know
focusing on

3578
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:19,599
focusing on
 

3579
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,150
focusing on
building those more of a periodization

3580
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,160
building those more of a periodization
 

3581
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,670
building those more of a periodization
effect would be

3582
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:23,680
effect would be
 

3583
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:27,109
effect would be
focusing on one quality at a time

3584
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
focusing on one quality at a time
 

3585
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,069
focusing on one quality at a time
or one quality wall maintaining other

3586
01:00:30,069 --> 01:00:30,079
or one quality wall maintaining other
 

3587
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:30,870
or one quality wall maintaining other
qualities

3588
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:30,880
qualities
 

3589
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,230
qualities
and then shifting that around so it's

3590
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:32,240
and then shifting that around so it's
 

3591
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,990
and then shifting that around so it's
just going to be a little different

3592
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:34,000
just going to be a little different
 

3593
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,270
just going to be a little different
based on

3594
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
based on
 

3595
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,950
based on
what the output is and what the desired

3596
01:00:36,950 --> 01:00:36,960
what the output is and what the desired
 

3597
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,470
what the output is and what the desired
so like

3598
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:38,480
so like
 

3599
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,069
so like
powerlifting is actually power is the

3600
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:40,079
powerlifting is actually power is the
 

3601
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:41,670
powerlifting is actually power is the
wrong word there's actually no power in

3602
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:41,680
wrong word there's actually no power in
 

3603
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:42,309
wrong word there's actually no power in
it it's

3604
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:42,319
it it's
 

3605
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,990
it it's
just brute it's it's strength um

3606
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:46,000
just brute it's it's strength um
 

3607
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,230
just brute it's it's strength um
application of force uh so olympic

3608
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:48,240
application of force uh so olympic
 

3609
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,910
application of force uh so olympic
lifting would actually be a better

3610
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:49,920
lifting would actually be a better
 

3611
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:52,789
lifting would actually be a better
for powerlifting because that is more

3612
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
for powerlifting because that is more
 

3613
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:56,069
for powerlifting because that is more
explosive uh development there's

3614
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:56,079
explosive uh development there's
 

3615
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:58,710
explosive uh development there's
strongman is again now we're getting a

3616
01:00:58,710 --> 01:00:58,720
strongman is again now we're getting a
 

3617
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,950
strongman is again now we're getting a
little bit more athletic it's equipment

3618
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:00,960
little bit more athletic it's equipment
 

3619
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,630
little bit more athletic it's equipment
based on the implements and stuff that

3620
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:02,640
based on the implements and stuff that
 

3621
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:04,950
based on the implements and stuff that
are used how fast you can move your feet

3622
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:04,960
are used how fast you can move your feet
 

3623
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,510
are used how fast you can move your feet
and run mixed with more endurance but

3624
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:07,520
and run mixed with more endurance but
 

3625
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,470
and run mixed with more endurance but
still very

3626
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:08,480
still very
 

3627
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,309
still very
strength focused and there's some things

3628
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:10,319
strength focused and there's some things
 

3629
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:11,589
strength focused and there's some things
with strong man that is straight like

3630
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:11,599
with strong man that is straight like
 

3631
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:13,109
with strong man that is straight like
each one of these is very

3632
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:13,119
each one of these is very
 

3633
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:16,309
each one of these is very
also focused on different

3634
01:01:16,309 --> 01:01:16,319
also focused on different
 

3635
01:01:16,319 --> 01:01:18,710
also focused on different
genetic dispositions so actually if you

3636
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:18,720
genetic dispositions so actually if you
 

3637
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,470
genetic dispositions so actually if you
look at the history of sports you'll

3638
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:20,480
look at the history of sports you'll
 

3639
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:21,430
look at the history of sports you'll
find that they're

3640
01:01:21,430 --> 01:01:21,440
find that they're
 

3641
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:23,750
find that they're
a lot of times based on different

3642
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:23,760
a lot of times based on different
 

3643
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:25,190
a lot of times based on different
populations that sounds like it's very

3644
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:25,200
populations that sounds like it's very
 

3645
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,710
populations that sounds like it's very
on pc but like

3646
01:01:26,710 --> 01:01:26,720
on pc but like
 

3647
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,589
on pc but like
highland games they've got deep deeper

3648
01:01:29,589 --> 01:01:29,599
highland games they've got deep deeper
 

3649
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,349
highland games they've got deep deeper
hip sockets that are shallow so you're

3650
01:01:31,349 --> 01:01:31,359
hip sockets that are shallow so you're
 

3651
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,870
hip sockets that are shallow so you're
going to see a lot of short hip hinge

3652
01:01:32,870 --> 01:01:32,880
going to see a lot of short hip hinge
 

3653
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,069
going to see a lot of short hip hinge
movements like the

3654
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
movements like the
 

3655
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:36,390
movements like the
the caber toss and things like that muay

3656
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:36,400
the caber toss and things like that muay
 

3657
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:37,510
the caber toss and things like that muay
thai wrestling

3658
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:37,520
thai wrestling
 

3659
01:01:37,520 --> 01:01:39,109
thai wrestling
they've got a completely different hip

3660
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:39,119
they've got a completely different hip
 

3661
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,510
they've got a completely different hip
joint and so strongman itself is

3662
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
joint and so strongman itself is
 

3663
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,030
joint and so strongman itself is
going to be for very large framed

3664
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:43,040
going to be for very large framed
 

3665
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,710
going to be for very large framed
individuals if you're not well over six

3666
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:44,720
individuals if you're not well over six
 

3667
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:45,349
individuals if you're not well over six
foot

3668
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:45,359
foot
 

3669
01:01:45,359 --> 01:01:46,870
foot
and a large person you're probably not

3670
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:46,880
and a large person you're probably not
 

3671
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,789
and a large person you're probably not
going to perform well very few people

3672
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:48,799
going to perform well very few people
 

3673
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,470
going to perform well very few people
sub six foot have ever done well at

3674
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:50,480
sub six foot have ever done well at
 

3675
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,230
sub six foot have ever done well at
strongman just because it's it's

3676
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:52,240
strongman just because it's it's
 

3677
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:55,910
strongman just because it's it's
leverage based right um olympic lifting

3678
01:01:55,910 --> 01:01:55,920
leverage based right um olympic lifting
 

3679
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,029
leverage based right um olympic lifting
we see consistently in in europe

3680
01:01:59,029 --> 01:01:59,039
we see consistently in in europe
 

3681
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,470
we see consistently in in europe
uh the the history tells us a high

3682
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:02,480
uh the the history tells us a high
 

3683
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,390
uh the the history tells us a high
level of hip uh and back issues

3684
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:06,400
level of hip uh and back issues
 

3685
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,150
level of hip uh and back issues
because of the depth that that hip

3686
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:08,160
because of the depth that that hip
 

3687
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,910
because of the depth that that hip
socket has to go in to be able to

3688
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:09,920
socket has to go in to be able to
 

3689
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,510
socket has to go in to be able to
complete that lift

3690
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:11,520
complete that lift
 

3691
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,270
complete that lift
and so you're going to see issues with

3692
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
and so you're going to see issues with
 

3693
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,109
and so you're going to see issues with
populations that don't have the ability

3694
01:02:15,109 --> 01:02:15,119
populations that don't have the ability
 

3695
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,470
populations that don't have the ability
to do that so

3696
01:02:16,470 --> 01:02:16,480
to do that so
 

3697
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:18,230
to do that so
so we've talked a little bit about

3698
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:18,240
so we've talked a little bit about
 

3699
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:19,510
so we've talked a little bit about
training as well as

3700
01:02:19,510 --> 01:02:19,520
training as well as
 

3701
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,390
training as well as
disposition yeah so and also crossfit

3702
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:22,400
disposition yeah so and also crossfit
 

3703
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,910
disposition yeah so and also crossfit
instance of that that's more like strong

3704
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
instance of that that's more like strong
 

3705
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:24,950
instance of that that's more like strong
man but for

3706
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:24,960
man but for
 

3707
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:27,670
man but for
a wider variety of bodies i suppose yep

3708
01:02:27,670 --> 01:02:27,680
a wider variety of bodies i suppose yep
 

3709
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,029
a wider variety of bodies i suppose yep
and definitely more metabolic

3710
01:02:29,029 --> 01:02:29,039
and definitely more metabolic
 

3711
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:30,549
and definitely more metabolic
conditioning focus than the

3712
01:02:30,549 --> 01:02:30,559
conditioning focus than the
 

3713
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,549
conditioning focus than the
than the strength aspect of it um and

3714
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:34,559
than the strength aspect of it um and
 

3715
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,150
than the strength aspect of it um and
and conditioning is an interesting thing

3716
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:36,160
and conditioning is an interesting thing
 

3717
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,069
and conditioning is an interesting thing
too so that quality

3718
01:02:38,069 --> 01:02:38,079
too so that quality
 

3719
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,390
too so that quality
in my opinion can be developed a lot

3720
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:40,400
in my opinion can be developed a lot
 

3721
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,109
in my opinion can be developed a lot
faster

3722
01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:41,119
faster
 

3723
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:44,150
faster
but kind of peaks much faster as well so

3724
01:02:44,150 --> 01:02:44,160
but kind of peaks much faster as well so
 

3725
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,870
but kind of peaks much faster as well so
you where strength we can continue to

3726
01:02:46,870 --> 01:02:46,880
you where strength we can continue to
 

3727
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:48,069
you where strength we can continue to
add and add an add over

3728
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:48,079
add and add an add over
 

3729
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,109
add and add an add over
time so it's

3730
01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:51,119
time so it's
 

3731
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:52,870
time so it's
for me like for conditioning with any

3732
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:52,880
for me like for conditioning with any
 

3733
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,309
for me like for conditioning with any
strength athlete i don't like to spend

3734
01:02:54,309 --> 01:02:54,319
strength athlete i don't like to spend
 

3735
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:55,349
strength athlete i don't like to spend
as much time

3736
01:02:55,349 --> 01:02:55,359
as much time
 

3737
01:02:55,359 --> 01:02:58,390
as much time
on that so i'll cycle the conditioning

3738
01:02:58,390 --> 01:02:58,400
on that so i'll cycle the conditioning
 

3739
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,390
on that so i'll cycle the conditioning
work for our strength athletes

3740
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
work for our strength athletes
 

3741
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,470
work for our strength athletes
and then taper that off leading into

3742
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:02,480
and then taper that off leading into
 

3743
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,829
and then taper that off leading into
meat so the more

3744
01:03:03,829 --> 01:03:03,839
meat so the more
 

3745
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:05,349
meat so the more
metabolic work that means the more

3746
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:05,359
metabolic work that means the more
 

3747
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,190
metabolic work that means the more
capacity in strength training that you

3748
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
capacity in strength training that you
 

3749
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,309
capacity in strength training that you
can accomplish

3750
01:03:08,309 --> 01:03:08,319
can accomplish
 

3751
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:12,069
can accomplish
which is the goal and recover from

3752
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
which is the goal and recover from
 

3753
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:14,309
which is the goal and recover from
but then as we lead to a competition we

3754
01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:14,319
but then as we lead to a competition we
 

3755
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,230
but then as we lead to a competition we
want to spend more time on recovering

3756
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:16,240
want to spend more time on recovering
 

3757
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:17,670
want to spend more time on recovering
from that so we have to pull things out

3758
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:17,680
from that so we have to pull things out
 

3759
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:19,430
from that so we have to pull things out
so we'd pull out less so like

3760
01:03:19,430 --> 01:03:19,440
so we'd pull out less so like
 

3761
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,069
so we'd pull out less so like
a typical approach would be like taking

3762
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
a typical approach would be like taking
 

3763
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,230
a typical approach would be like taking
a six-week cycle for conditioning

3764
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,240
a six-week cycle for conditioning
 

3765
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,789
a six-week cycle for conditioning
and ramping ramping up over three weeks

3766
01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:26,799
and ramping ramping up over three weeks
 

3767
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:28,549
and ramping ramping up over three weeks
periods time then dropping back down

3768
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:28,559
periods time then dropping back down
 

3769
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:29,430
periods time then dropping back down
again

3770
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:29,440
again
 

3771
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,510
again
and ramping up and being slightly offset

3772
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:31,520
and ramping up and being slightly offset
 

3773
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,430
and ramping up and being slightly offset
by like a week or two from your strength

3774
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:33,440
by like a week or two from your strength
 

3775
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,150
by like a week or two from your strength
peaks

3776
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:34,160
peaks
 

3777
01:03:34,160 --> 01:03:35,670
peaks
so that you've actually tapered the week

3778
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:35,680
so that you've actually tapered the week
 

3779
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,430
so that you've actually tapered the week
prior in your conditioning work to your

3780
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:37,440
prior in your conditioning work to your
 

3781
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,150
prior in your conditioning work to your
strength work

3782
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:38,160
strength work
 

3783
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:39,829
strength work
right and but that way we're not hitting

3784
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:39,839
right and but that way we're not hitting
 

3785
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:41,270
right and but that way we're not hitting
conditioning hard all the time which is

3786
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
conditioning hard all the time which is
 

3787
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:42,230
conditioning hard all the time which is
a common

3788
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:42,240
a common
 

3789
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,549
a common
common uh misstep that people make is

3790
01:03:44,549 --> 01:03:44,559
common uh misstep that people make is
 

3791
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:45,829
common uh misstep that people make is
going well i need conditioning

3792
01:03:45,829 --> 01:03:45,839
going well i need conditioning
 

3793
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,309
going well i need conditioning
so they just hammer that at a base level

3794
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
so they just hammer that at a base level
 

3795
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:49,270
so they just hammer that at a base level
over the top

3796
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:49,280
over the top
 

3797
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:52,789
over the top
instead of cycling that if we talk about

3798
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:52,799
instead of cycling that if we talk about
 

3799
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,430
instead of cycling that if we talk about
power lifting

3800
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:55,440
power lifting
 

3801
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,950
power lifting
in terms of regimen

3802
01:03:58,950 --> 01:03:58,960
in terms of regimen
 

3803
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:01,270
in terms of regimen
in terms of exercise yeah in terms of

3804
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
in terms of exercise yeah in terms of
 

3805
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,069
in terms of exercise yeah in terms of
the process

3806
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,079
the process
 

3807
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,630
the process
the wood consistent with what is there

3808
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:04,640
the wood consistent with what is there
 

3809
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:05,990
the wood consistent with what is there
something to be said about

3810
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:06,000
something to be said about
 

3811
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,990
something to be said about
general qualities of the consistency of

3812
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:08,000
general qualities of the consistency of
 

3813
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,230
general qualities of the consistency of
the regimen required to get strong

3814
01:04:10,230 --> 01:04:10,240
the regimen required to get strong
 

3815
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:13,670
the regimen required to get strong
yes so let's talk about some training

3816
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:13,680
yes so let's talk about some training
 

3817
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,829
yes so let's talk about some training
principles as a whole and this will

3818
01:04:17,829 --> 01:04:17,839
principles as a whole and this will
 

3819
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:19,589
principles as a whole and this will
i think this will break the down what

3820
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:19,599
i think this will break the down what
 

3821
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:21,190
i think this will break the down what
you're what you're one

3822
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:21,200
you're what you're one
 

3823
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,430
you're what you're one
the more work that we can fit into a

3824
01:04:23,430 --> 01:04:23,440
the more work that we can fit into a
 

3825
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:24,950
the more work that we can fit into a
given time

3826
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:24,960
given time
 

3827
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:27,750
given time
the more progress we're going to make

3828
01:04:27,750 --> 01:04:27,760
the more progress we're going to make
 

3829
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:29,670
the more progress we're going to make
but that doesn't mean doing the max

3830
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:29,680
but that doesn't mean doing the max
 

3831
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,349
but that doesn't mean doing the max
amount of work

3832
01:04:31,349 --> 01:04:31,359
amount of work
 

3833
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:34,390
amount of work
possible at any given time

3834
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:34,400
possible at any given time
 

3835
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,349
possible at any given time
so we know that we're always to to

3836
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
so we know that we're always to to
 

3837
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:38,870
so we know that we're always to to
accomplish more we're always going to

3838
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:38,880
accomplish more we're always going to
 

3839
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,510
accomplish more we're always going to
have more

3840
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:39,520
have more
 

3841
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:40,789
have more
and there's a certain ceiling that

3842
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
and there's a certain ceiling that
 

3843
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:41,910
and there's a certain ceiling that
you're going to hit that you're not

3844
01:04:41,910 --> 01:04:41,920
you're going to hit that you're not
 

3845
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:43,589
you're going to hit that you're not
going to be able to add more so

3846
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:43,599
going to be able to add more so
 

3847
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,270
going to be able to add more so
you want to start and get the most

3848
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
you want to start and get the most
 

3849
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,950
you want to start and get the most
amount of results that you can with the

3850
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:46,960
amount of results that you can with the
 

3851
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:47,430
amount of results that you can with the
least

3852
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:47,440
least
 

3853
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:50,230
least
amount of work because you're going to

3854
01:04:50,230 --> 01:04:50,240
amount of work because you're going to
 

3855
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:51,190
amount of work because you're going to
have to do it

3856
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:51,200
have to do it
 

3857
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:54,470
have to do it
again like this stair step over and over

3858
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
again like this stair step over and over
 

3859
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,829
again like this stair step over and over
year decades so on so when people is a

3860
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839
year decades so on so when people is a
 

3861
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,589
year decades so on so when people is a
big miss people got they look at

3862
01:04:59,589 --> 01:04:59,599
big miss people got they look at
 

3863
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,990
big miss people got they look at
uh a chico program from russia or so on

3864
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:02,000
uh a chico program from russia or so on
 

3865
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,029
uh a chico program from russia or so on
and they go

3866
01:05:03,029 --> 01:05:03,039
and they go
 

3867
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,589
and they go
i'm gonna follow this and it's like that

3868
01:05:05,589 --> 01:05:05,599
i'm gonna follow this and it's like that
 

3869
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:07,029
i'm gonna follow this and it's like that
was specifically written for somebody

3870
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:07,039
was specifically written for somebody
 

3871
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:09,510
was specifically written for somebody
with 20 years of experience

3872
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:09,520
with 20 years of experience
 

3873
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,270
with 20 years of experience
that's already built the capacities to

3874
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:11,280
that's already built the capacities to
 

3875
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,710
that's already built the capacities to
be at that level so it's all about

3876
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:12,720
be at that level so it's all about
 

3877
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,069
be at that level so it's all about
building that work capacity

3878
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:14,079
building that work capacity
 

3879
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:15,510
building that work capacity
so how much work can you give in a given

3880
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,520
so how much work can you give in a given
 

3881
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,430
so how much work can you give in a given
time so now we want to look at some

3882
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:17,440
time so now we want to look at some
 

3883
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:18,309
time so now we want to look at some
research

3884
01:05:18,309 --> 01:05:18,319
research
 

3885
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,950
research
as it relates to injuries because

3886
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:20,960
as it relates to injuries because
 

3887
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,630
as it relates to injuries because
injuries are going to be a big driver

3888
01:05:22,630 --> 01:05:22,640
injuries are going to be a big driver
 

3889
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:23,670
injuries are going to be a big driver
over time

3890
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:23,680
over time
 

3891
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,789
over time
of what holds you back so when we talk

3892
01:05:26,789 --> 01:05:26,799
of what holds you back so when we talk
 

3893
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:30,549
of what holds you back so when we talk
consistency training hard for three

3894
01:05:30,549 --> 01:05:30,559
consistency training hard for three
 

3895
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:31,270
consistency training hard for three
years

3896
01:05:31,270 --> 01:05:31,280
years
 

3897
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:33,750
years
five years it's gonna be really good but

3898
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:33,760
five years it's gonna be really good but
 

3899
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,109
five years it's gonna be really good but
what we find is a lot of people train

3900
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:35,119
what we find is a lot of people train
 

3901
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:37,029
what we find is a lot of people train
really hard for nine months

3902
01:05:37,029 --> 01:05:37,039
really hard for nine months
 

3903
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,950
really hard for nine months
have to slow back for a month get back

3904
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
have to slow back for a month get back
 

3905
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,950
have to slow back for a month get back
into it and miss another week because

3906
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:40,960
into it and miss another week because
 

3907
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,069
into it and miss another week because
and so on they're always like this

3908
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:42,079
and so on they're always like this
 

3909
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:44,230
and so on they're always like this
little nagging that little nagging

3910
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:44,240
little nagging that little nagging
 

3911
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:47,510
little nagging that little nagging
and so it's pretty clear in the research

3912
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
and so it's pretty clear in the research
 

3913
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:48,950
and so it's pretty clear in the research
we wanna we're looking at when we're

3914
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:48,960
we wanna we're looking at when we're
 

3915
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:51,109
we wanna we're looking at when we're
stair stepping this stuff we're looking

3916
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:51,119
stair stepping this stuff we're looking
 

3917
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:54,390
stair stepping this stuff we're looking
at acute and chronic loading so

3918
01:05:54,390 --> 01:05:54,400
at acute and chronic loading so
 

3919
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,430
at acute and chronic loading so
some fancy words for average and like

3920
01:05:57,430 --> 01:05:57,440
some fancy words for average and like
 

3921
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:59,029
some fancy words for average and like
what's happening right now

3922
01:05:59,029 --> 01:05:59,039
what's happening right now
 

3923
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,750
what's happening right now
so this given week would be our acute

3924
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:01,760
so this given week would be our acute
 

3925
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:03,430
so this given week would be our acute
chronic would be what is our average

3926
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:03,440
chronic would be what is our average
 

3927
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,029
chronic would be what is our average
loading let's say over the last six

3928
01:06:05,029 --> 01:06:05,039
loading let's say over the last six
 

3929
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:05,910
loading let's say over the last six
months

3930
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:05,920
months
 

3931
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,270
months
okay so the more that we can move the

3932
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:09,280
okay so the more that we can move the
 

3933
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:10,870
okay so the more that we can move the
chronic loading up the more work we're

3934
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:10,880
chronic loading up the more work we're
 

3935
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:11,670
chronic loading up the more work we're
getting done on

3936
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:11,680
getting done on
 

3937
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,589
getting done on
as a whole over time we're going to get

3938
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:13,599
as a whole over time we're going to get
 

3939
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,510
as a whole over time we're going to get
stronger the way that we build the

3940
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:15,520
stronger the way that we build the
 

3941
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:16,950
stronger the way that we build the
capacity to do that

3942
01:06:16,950 --> 01:06:16,960
capacity to do that
 

3943
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:20,630
capacity to do that
is having spikes in acute loading okay

3944
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
is having spikes in acute loading okay
 

3945
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,150
is having spikes in acute loading okay
now as we do this the

3946
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:24,160
now as we do this the
 

3947
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,430
now as we do this the
the acute loading if it spikes more than

3948
01:06:27,430 --> 01:06:27,440
the acute loading if it spikes more than
 

3949
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:28,390
the acute loading if it spikes more than
10

3950
01:06:28,390 --> 01:06:28,400
10
 

3951
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,829
10
maybe 15 percent from what the chronic

3952
01:06:31,829 --> 01:06:31,839
maybe 15 percent from what the chronic
 

3953
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:32,309
maybe 15 percent from what the chronic
loading

3954
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:32,319
loading
 

3955
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:35,910
loading
has been that accounts for

3956
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:35,920
has been that accounts for
 

3957
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,190
has been that accounts for
eighty percent of injuries out there

3958
01:06:39,190 --> 01:06:39,200
eighty percent of injuries out there
 

3959
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:41,270
eighty percent of injuries out there
so it's not actually the movement

3960
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:41,280
so it's not actually the movement
 

3961
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,990
so it's not actually the movement
quality or this misstep or the other

3962
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:44,000
quality or this misstep or the other
 

3963
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,230
quality or this misstep or the other
it usually happens about four five six

3964
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:46,240
it usually happens about four five six
 

3965
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,910
it usually happens about four five six
weeks later it's like oh this nagging

3966
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
weeks later it's like oh this nagging
 

3967
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,190
weeks later it's like oh this nagging
and then it gets worse and then now you

3968
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:49,200
and then it gets worse and then now you
 

3969
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:49,750
and then it gets worse and then now you
gotta

3970
01:06:49,750 --> 01:06:49,760
gotta
 

3971
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,190
gotta
you gotta do some rehab your training

3972
01:06:51,190 --> 01:06:51,200
you gotta do some rehab your training
 

3973
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,190
you gotta do some rehab your training
sessions aren't as good and so on

3974
01:06:53,190 --> 01:06:53,200
sessions aren't as good and so on
 

3975
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,470
sessions aren't as good and so on
so now we're starting to look at this

3976
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:54,480
so now we're starting to look at this
 

3977
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,710
so now we're starting to look at this
okay it's like i wanna do the

3978
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
okay it's like i wanna do the
 

3979
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,390
okay it's like i wanna do the
i wanna do the least amount of work

3980
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
i wanna do the least amount of work
 

3981
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,710
i wanna do the least amount of work
where i can still progress

3982
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:00,720
where i can still progress
 

3983
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,270
where i can still progress
i want to be able to have spikes in my

3984
01:07:03,270 --> 01:07:03,280
i want to be able to have spikes in my
 

3985
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:05,430
i want to be able to have spikes in my
weekly demand

3986
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
weekly demand
 

3987
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,029
weekly demand
that don't go above 10 to 15 percent of

3988
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
that don't go above 10 to 15 percent of
 

3989
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:10,870
that don't go above 10 to 15 percent of
what i've been averaging for the last

3990
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:10,880
what i've been averaging for the last
 

3991
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:12,710
what i've been averaging for the last
month but every time i do a spike my

3992
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:12,720
month but every time i do a spike my
 

3993
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:14,150
month but every time i do a spike my
average goes up right

3994
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:14,160
average goes up right
 

3995
01:07:14,160 --> 01:07:17,430
average goes up right
boom boom boom and then that becomes

3996
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:17,440
boom boom boom and then that becomes
 

3997
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,190
boom boom boom and then that becomes
very particular also when you take

3998
01:07:19,190 --> 01:07:19,200
very particular also when you take
 

3999
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,670
very particular also when you take
when you do take plantain time off so a

4000
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:21,680
when you do take plantain time off so a
 

4001
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,309
when you do take plantain time off so a
lot of people

4002
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
lot of people
 

4003
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,710
lot of people
uh training session maybe they're doing

4004
01:07:24,710 --> 01:07:24,720
uh training session maybe they're doing
 

4005
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,069
uh training session maybe they're doing
a five-week block with a

4006
01:07:26,069 --> 01:07:26,079
a five-week block with a
 

4007
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,109
a five-week block with a
a deload week or you go on vacation for

4008
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:29,119
a deload week or you go on vacation for
 

4009
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:29,589
a deload week or you go on vacation for
a week

4010
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
a week
 

4011
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,589
a week
or any of those things that were a

4012
01:07:31,589 --> 01:07:31,599
or any of those things that were a
 

4013
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:33,190
or any of those things that were a
downward what does that do to your

4014
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,200
downward what does that do to your
 

4015
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:34,230
downward what does that do to your
average in chronic loading

4016
01:07:34,230 --> 01:07:34,240
average in chronic loading
 

4017
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:35,750
average in chronic loading
it brings it down and then what does the

4018
01:07:35,750 --> 01:07:35,760
it brings it down and then what does the
 

4019
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,589
it brings it down and then what does the
person want to do when they come back

4020
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:37,599
person want to do when they come back
 

4021
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,750
person want to do when they come back
make up for it now they have a huge

4022
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:39,760
make up for it now they have a huge
 

4023
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,630
make up for it now they have a huge
spike above

4024
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:40,640
spike above
 

4025
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:42,789
spike above
five weeks later we're dealing with ah

4026
01:07:42,789 --> 01:07:42,799
five weeks later we're dealing with ah
 

4027
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:44,630
five weeks later we're dealing with ah
this elbow this wrist whatever's kind of

4028
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:44,640
this elbow this wrist whatever's kind of
 

4029
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:45,990
this elbow this wrist whatever's kind of
bothering me and now you're not

4030
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:46,000
bothering me and now you're not
 

4031
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,470
bothering me and now you're not
performing as much so these are some

4032
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:48,480
performing as much so these are some
 

4033
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:50,549
performing as much so these are some
really fundamental pieces of

4034
01:07:50,549 --> 01:07:50,559
really fundamental pieces of
 

4035
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,430
really fundamental pieces of
of of training and then now we can start

4036
01:07:53,430 --> 01:07:53,440
of of training and then now we can start
 

4037
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:54,870
of of training and then now we can start
overlaying the qualities that we're

4038
01:07:54,870 --> 01:07:54,880
overlaying the qualities that we're
 

4039
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:56,549
overlaying the qualities that we're
trying to develop that we were talked

4040
01:07:56,549 --> 01:07:56,559
trying to develop that we were talked
 

4041
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:58,309
trying to develop that we were talked
about earlier so now it's

4042
01:07:58,309 --> 01:07:58,319
about earlier so now it's
 

4043
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,950
about earlier so now it's
let's talk about my deadlift my thousand

4044
01:08:00,950 --> 01:08:00,960
let's talk about my deadlift my thousand
 

4045
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:02,150
let's talk about my deadlift my thousand
pound deadlift we'll talk about the

4046
01:08:02,150 --> 01:08:02,160
pound deadlift we'll talk about the
 

4047
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,829
pound deadlift we'll talk about the
training cycles for both the thousand

4048
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:03,839
training cycles for both the thousand
 

4049
01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:07,029
training cycles for both the thousand
uh deadlift and squat so backing up

4050
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:07,039
uh deadlift and squat so backing up
 

4051
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,589
uh deadlift and squat so backing up
a year out from the deadlift knowing i

4052
01:08:09,589 --> 01:08:09,599
a year out from the deadlift knowing i
 

4053
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,109
a year out from the deadlift knowing i
was training at the time

4054
01:08:11,109 --> 01:08:11,119
was training at the time
 

4055
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,150
was training at the time
heavy deadlifts once a week and usually

4056
01:08:14,150 --> 01:08:14,160
heavy deadlifts once a week and usually
 

4057
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:14,789
heavy deadlifts once a week and usually
it was

4058
01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
it was
 

4059
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:16,149
it was
two of those sessions a month were

4060
01:08:16,149 --> 01:08:16,159
two of those sessions a month were
 

4061
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:17,749
two of those sessions a month were
really heavy and the others weren't it's

4062
01:08:17,749 --> 01:08:17,759
really heavy and the others weren't it's
 

4063
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:18,149
really heavy and the others weren't it's
like

4064
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:18,159
like
 

4065
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:20,149
like
okay how can we get this up to where i'm

4066
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:20,159
okay how can we get this up to where i'm
 

4067
01:08:20,159 --> 01:08:23,110
okay how can we get this up to where i'm
deadlifting twice a week

4068
01:08:23,110 --> 01:08:23,120
deadlifting twice a week
 

4069
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,829
deadlifting twice a week
because that's where i want to be uh to

4070
01:08:25,829 --> 01:08:25,839
because that's where i want to be uh to
 

4071
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,189
because that's where i want to be uh to
be able to accomplish this i need to be

4072
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:27,199
be able to accomplish this i need to be
 

4073
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:28,470
be able to accomplish this i need to be

4081
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:32,709
goal
we're not going to go through all the

4082
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
we're not going to go through all the
 

4083
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:34,309
we're not going to go through all the
math and stuff like that and how that's

4084
01:08:34,309 --> 01:08:34,319
math and stuff like that and how that's
 

4085
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:35,430
math and stuff like that and how that's
arrived but there is

4086
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:35,440
arrived but there is
 

4087
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,070
arrived but there is
there is math behind this and so instead

4088
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,080
there is math behind this and so instead
 

4089
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:38,709
there is math behind this and so instead
of just

4090
01:08:38,709 --> 01:08:38,719
of just
 

4091
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:40,390
of just
like oh let's start dead lifting twice a

4092
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:40,400
like oh let's start dead lifting twice a
 

4093
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:41,829
like oh let's start dead lifting twice a
week no

4094
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
week no
 

4095
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:44,789
week no
so we start and we take the one session

4096
01:08:44,789 --> 01:08:44,799
so we start and we take the one session
 

4097
01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:46,149
so we start and we take the one session
that we've got

4098
01:08:46,149 --> 01:08:46,159
that we've got
 

4099
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:48,789
that we've got
and we split it part of it take part of

4100
01:08:48,789 --> 01:08:48,799
and we split it part of it take part of
 

4101
01:08:48,799 --> 01:08:50,229
and we split it part of it take part of
it away and put it in the second half of

4102
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:50,239
it away and put it in the second half of
 

4103
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:51,749
it away and put it in the second half of
the week so the total volume is still

4104
01:08:51,749 --> 01:08:51,759
the week so the total volume is still
 

4105
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:53,110
the week so the total volume is still
the same

4106
01:08:53,110 --> 01:08:53,120
the same
 

4107
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:56,870
the same
and then we start adding some volume but

4108
01:08:56,870 --> 01:08:56,880
and then we start adding some volume but
 

4109
01:08:56,880 --> 01:08:57,990
and then we start adding some volume but
i'm doing it at a

4110
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
i'm doing it at a
 

4111
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,870
i'm doing it at a
off of block so that the actual load is

4112
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
off of block so that the actual load is
 

4113
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,149
off of block so that the actual load is
the cumulative load is less because i

4114
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:02,159
the cumulative load is less because i
 

4115
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:03,430
the cumulative load is less because i
have less range of motion

4116
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:03,440
have less range of motion
 

4117
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:05,749
have less range of motion
okay and then we start building that

4118
01:09:05,749 --> 01:09:05,759
okay and then we start building that
 

4119
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:07,110
okay and then we start building that
closer to the ground closer to the

4120
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:07,120
closer to the ground closer to the
 

4121
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:08,149
closer to the ground closer to the
ground and so on

4122
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:08,159
ground and so on
 

4123
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:09,749
ground and so on
and now we start getting to where i'm

4124
01:09:09,749 --> 01:09:09,759
and now we start getting to where i'm
 

4125
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,669
and now we start getting to where i'm
almost doing two sessions full sessions

4126
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:11,679
almost doing two sessions full sessions
 

4127
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:12,630
almost doing two sessions full sessions
a week

4128
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:12,640
a week
 

4129
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:15,590
a week
and then we start adding a little bit of

4130
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:15,600
and then we start adding a little bit of
 

4131
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:16,149
and then we start adding a little bit of
load

4132
01:09:16,149 --> 01:09:16,159
load
 

4133
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,070
load
and so at my level this isn't talking

4134
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,080
and so at my level this isn't talking
 

4135
01:09:18,080 --> 01:09:20,070
and so at my level this isn't talking
about adding another set

4136
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:20,080
about adding another set
 

4137
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,030
about adding another set
or another day a week we're talking like

4138
01:09:23,030 --> 01:09:23,040
or another day a week we're talking like
 

4139
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:23,829
or another day a week we're talking like
in my squat

4140
01:09:23,829 --> 01:09:23,839
in my squat
 

4141
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:27,829
in my squat
it might be one rep instead of doing

4142
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:27,839
it might be one rep instead of doing
 

4143
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:31,030
it might be one rep instead of doing
three sets of three at one week i do two

4144
01:09:31,030 --> 01:09:31,040
three sets of three at one week i do two
 

4145
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:31,749
three sets of three at one week i do two
doubles

4146
01:09:31,749 --> 01:09:31,759
doubles
 

4147
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:33,990
doubles
or two triples then two doubles to give

4148
01:09:33,990 --> 01:09:34,000
or two triples then two doubles to give
 

4149
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,189
or two triples then two doubles to give
me one

4150
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:35,199
me one
 

4151
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:38,309
me one
more rep that's it and so we're doing

4152
01:09:38,309 --> 01:09:38,319
more rep that's it and so we're doing
 

4153
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:39,669
more rep that's it and so we're doing
that from one week

4154
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:39,679
that from one week
 

4155
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:41,349
that from one week
to the next and that's a cycle training

4156
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:41,359
to the next and that's a cycle training
 

4157
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:42,709
to the next and that's a cycle training
cycle it might be five six weeks and

4158
01:09:42,709 --> 01:09:42,719
cycle it might be five six weeks and
 

4159
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:43,269
cycle it might be five six weeks and
then so on

4160
01:09:43,269 --> 01:09:43,279
then so on
 

4161
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:45,349
then so on
the next one and slowly bringing that

4162
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
the next one and slowly bringing that
 

4163
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,390
the next one and slowly bringing that
average load

4164
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:46,400
average load
 

4165
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,990
average load
up so the last phases of the squat for

4166
01:09:49,990 --> 01:09:50,000
up so the last phases of the squat for
 

4167
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,870
up so the last phases of the squat for
example

4168
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
example
 

4169
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,550
example
we took the average loading every week

4170
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:52,560
we took the average loading every week
 

4171
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:54,070
we took the average loading every week
so my of my heavy sets

4172
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
so my of my heavy sets
 

4173
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,070
so my of my heavy sets
so once we developed all this stuff over

4174
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,080
so once we developed all this stuff over
 

4175
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,790
so once we developed all this stuff over
the last year to get to this point

4176
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
the last year to get to this point
 

4177
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,790
the last year to get to this point
now it is taking and going okay my

4178
01:10:02,790 --> 01:10:02,800
now it is taking and going okay my
 

4179
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,229
now it is taking and going okay my
average load this week

4180
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
average load this week
 

4181
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:07,750
average load this week
is eight reps at 955 pounds and then the

4182
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:07,760
is eight reps at 955 pounds and then the
 

4183
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,630
is eight reps at 955 pounds and then the
next week

4184
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:08,640
next week
 

4185
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,390
next week
let's get it to nine nine fifty seven

4186
01:10:12,390 --> 01:10:12,400
let's get it to nine nine fifty seven
 

4187
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:13,830
let's get it to nine nine fifty seven
nine sixty three and this was pretty

4188
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:13,840
nine sixty three and this was pretty
 

4189
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,590
nine sixty three and this was pretty
aggressive working up to where my

4190
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:15,600
aggressive working up to where my
 

4191
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,030
aggressive working up to where my
average loading the final

4192
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:17,040
average loading the final
 

4193
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,990
average loading the final
that fit the final was 985 pounds

4194
01:10:19,990 --> 01:10:20,000
that fit the final was 985 pounds
 

4195
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,910
that fit the final was 985 pounds
average load for eight to nine reps

4196
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:21,920
average load for eight to nine reps
 

4197
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,950
average load for eight to nine reps
and that's what i said this is the

4198
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:22,960
and that's what i said this is the
 

4199
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:24,550
and that's what i said this is the
intense part that was why it was the day

4200
01:10:24,550 --> 01:10:24,560
intense part that was why it was the day
 

4201
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,910
intense part that was why it was the day
of was much easier

4202
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
of was much easier
 

4203
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:29,910
of was much easier
that week over week is pretty brutal

4204
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:29,920
that week over week is pretty brutal
 

4205
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:32,070
that week over week is pretty brutal
may not sound oh you're just squatting

4206
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:32,080
may not sound oh you're just squatting
 

4207
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:33,510
may not sound oh you're just squatting
and now let's back up let's look at the

4208
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:33,520
and now let's back up let's look at the
 

4209
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,070
and now let's back up let's look at the
quality

4210
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,080
quality
 

4211
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,350
quality
development so a year out from the squat

4212
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:37,360
development so a year out from the squat
 

4213
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,390
development so a year out from the squat
obviously i've been working on

4214
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:38,400
obviously i've been working on
 

4215
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,630
obviously i've been working on
developing axial load capacity my

4216
01:10:40,630 --> 01:10:40,640
developing axial load capacity my
 

4217
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,110
developing axial load capacity my
capacity to withstand load from top to

4218
01:10:43,110 --> 01:10:43,120
capacity to withstand load from top to
 

4219
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,110
capacity to withstand load from top to
bottom so i like thinking about things

4220
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:45,120
bottom so i like thinking about things
 

4221
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,470
bottom so i like thinking about things
in movement vectors

4222
01:10:46,470 --> 01:10:46,480
in movement vectors
 

4223
01:10:46,480 --> 01:10:48,950
in movement vectors
so this vector is an axial loaded vector

4224
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:48,960
so this vector is an axial loaded vector
 

4225
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:50,790
so this vector is an axial loaded vector
is the hardest to recover from

4226
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:50,800
is the hardest to recover from
 

4227
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:53,990
is the hardest to recover from
uh so what's actual so like is deadlift

4228
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:54,000
uh so what's actual so like is deadlift
 

4229
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,470
uh so what's actual so like is deadlift
are they both they're both yep so a

4230
01:10:56,470 --> 01:10:56,480
are they both they're both yep so a
 

4231
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,910
are they both they're both yep so a
horizontal

4232
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:57,920
horizontal
 

4233
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,149
horizontal
a front to back would be like a row or a

4234
01:11:00,149 --> 01:11:00,159
a front to back would be like a row or a
 

4235
01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:00,950
a front to back would be like a row or a
press

4236
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
press
 

4237
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:03,830
press
why is the axial uh hard to recover from

4238
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:03,840
why is the axial uh hard to recover from
 

4239
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,270
why is the axial uh hard to recover from
because this entire body the entire

4240
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:05,280
because this entire body the entire
 

4241
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:06,870
because this entire body the entire
entire body just anything that is

4242
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:06,880
entire body just anything that is
 

4243
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,229
entire body just anything that is
that that uh taxes the the the spinal

4244
01:11:10,229 --> 01:11:10,239
that that uh taxes the the the spinal
 

4245
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:10,870
that that uh taxes the the the spinal
mechanics

4246
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
mechanics
 

4247
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,910
mechanics
i i don't i could tell you my beliefs

4248
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:13,920
i i don't i could tell you my beliefs
 

4249
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,110
i i don't i could tell you my beliefs
it's studied it is okay um

4250
01:11:17,110 --> 01:11:17,120
it's studied it is okay um
 

4251
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,550
it's studied it is okay um
we can just keep the discussion on that

4252
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:18,560
we can just keep the discussion on that
 

4253
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,709
we can just keep the discussion on that
but short like that so

4254
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:20,719
but short like that so
 

4255
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,110
but short like that so
um so we start looking at those

4256
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:23,120
um so we start looking at those
 

4257
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:24,790
um so we start looking at those
different vectors that we're training in

4258
01:11:24,790 --> 01:11:24,800
different vectors that we're training in
 

4259
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:26,229
different vectors that we're training in
so this is why

4260
01:11:26,229 --> 01:11:26,239
so this is why
 

4261
01:11:26,239 --> 01:11:27,669
so this is why
this is important to understand so i'm

4262
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
this is important to understand so i'm
 

4263
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,350
this is important to understand so i'm
not just getting into nuance here

4264
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,360
not just getting into nuance here
 

4265
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,149
not just getting into nuance here
so hey squatting is going to make me

4266
01:11:32,149 --> 01:11:32,159
so hey squatting is going to make me
 

4267
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:34,550
so hey squatting is going to make me
make me jump further because it's legs

4268
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:34,560
make me jump further because it's legs
 

4269
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,270
make me jump further because it's legs
well squatting is an axial load vector

4270
01:11:37,270 --> 01:11:37,280
well squatting is an axial load vector
 

4271
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:37,830
well squatting is an axial load vector
and

4272
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:37,840
and
 

4273
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,950
and
jumping is a vector this way so actually

4274
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:40,960
jumping is a vector this way so actually
 

4275
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:42,390
jumping is a vector this way so actually
hip thrust

4276
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
hip thrust
 

4277
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,709
hip thrust
would help with urine your and this is

4278
01:11:44,709 --> 01:11:44,719
would help with urine your and this is
 

4279
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:45,830
would help with urine your and this is
proven in science

4280
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
proven in science
 

4281
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,229
proven in science
with your forward jumping ability uh

4282
01:11:48,229 --> 01:11:48,239
with your forward jumping ability uh
 

4283
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,910
with your forward jumping ability uh
they're both working similar muscles the

4284
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
they're both working similar muscles the
 

4285
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:51,189
they're both working similar muscles the
glute extension

4286
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:51,199
glute extension
 

4287
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:53,030
glute extension
but they're working it in those

4288
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:53,040
but they're working it in those
 

4289
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,550
but they're working it in those
different platforms so it's really

4290
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:54,560
different platforms so it's really
 

4291
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,310
different platforms so it's really
important to understand because

4292
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:56,320
important to understand because
 

4293
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,830
important to understand because
people don't understand i'm building my

4294
01:11:57,830 --> 01:11:57,840
people don't understand i'm building my
 

4295
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,350
people don't understand i'm building my
work capacity by doing

4296
01:11:59,350 --> 01:11:59,360
work capacity by doing
 

4297
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,070
work capacity by doing
sled pushes you're not developing your

4298
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:02,080
sled pushes you're not developing your
 

4299
01:12:02,080 --> 01:12:04,229
sled pushes you're not developing your
work capacity for squatting

4300
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:04,239
work capacity for squatting
 

4301
01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:07,510
work capacity for squatting
most movements even ones as

4302
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:07,520
most movements even ones as
 

4303
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,550
most movements even ones as
holistic as a as a squat require

4304
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:10,560
holistic as a as a squat require
 

4305
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,990
holistic as a as a squat require
specialization

4306
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:12,000
specialization
 

4307
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,750
specialization
yeah you can't get strong at the squat

4308
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:13,760
yeah you can't get strong at the squat
 

4309
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,590
yeah you can't get strong at the squat
by doing you're going to have some

4310
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:15,600
by doing you're going to have some
 

4311
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,390
by doing you're going to have some
carryover

4312
01:12:16,390 --> 01:12:16,400
carryover
 

4313
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:19,669
carryover
right obviously but because taking an

4314
01:12:19,669 --> 01:12:19,679
right obviously but because taking an
 

4315
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:21,030
right obviously but because taking an
untrained person that hasn't done it

4316
01:12:21,030 --> 01:12:21,040
untrained person that hasn't done it
 

4317
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:22,950
untrained person that hasn't done it
it's not still not going to do as good

4318
01:12:22,950 --> 01:12:22,960
it's not still not going to do as good
 

4319
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,950
it's not still not going to do as good
as somebody that's done non-specific

4320
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
as somebody that's done non-specific
 

4321
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,229
as somebody that's done non-specific
work but done work

4322
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
work but done work
 

4323
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,390
work but done work
so but yes for the most part to get

4324
01:12:28,390 --> 01:12:28,400
so but yes for the most part to get
 

4325
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,350
so but yes for the most part to get
truly strong

4326
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:29,360
truly strong
 

4327
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:32,149
truly strong
you need to specialize so but not all

4328
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:32,159
you need to specialize so but not all
 

4329
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:32,790
you need to specialize so but not all
the time

4330
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:32,800
the time
 

4331
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,270
the time
so now we talk about quality so and if

4332
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
so now we talk about quality so and if
 

4333
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,189
so now we talk about quality so and if
we specialize in the same thing too long

4334
01:12:37,189 --> 01:12:37,199
we specialize in the same thing too long
 

4335
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:39,510
we specialize in the same thing too long
we stagnate because the body adapts to a

4336
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:39,520
we stagnate because the body adapts to a
 

4337
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,870
we stagnate because the body adapts to a
certain point and just can't make

4338
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
certain point and just can't make
 

4339
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:41,750
certain point and just can't make
progress

4340
01:12:41,750 --> 01:12:41,760
progress
 

4341
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:43,830
progress
so we wanted to save the actual

4342
01:12:43,830 --> 01:12:43,840
so we wanted to save the actual
 

4343
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:45,830
so we wanted to save the actual
squatting in the pattern with the bar

4344
01:12:45,830 --> 01:12:45,840
squatting in the pattern with the bar
 

4345
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:46,709
squatting in the pattern with the bar
that i was doing

4346
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
that i was doing
 

4347
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,790
that i was doing
for the very end so starting a year out

4348
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
for the very end so starting a year out
 

4349
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,669
for the very end so starting a year out
i started doing work front squatting

4350
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:53,679
i started doing work front squatting
 

4351
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:54,390
i started doing work front squatting
like a squat

4352
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:54,400
like a squat
 

4353
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,149
like a squat
axial loaded pattern and worked on

4354
01:12:56,149 --> 01:12:56,159
axial loaded pattern and worked on
 

4355
01:12:56,159 --> 01:12:58,070
axial loaded pattern and worked on
maximizing that up

4356
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:58,080
maximizing that up
 

4357
01:12:58,080 --> 01:13:01,830
maximizing that up
then i started shifting to doing

4358
01:13:01,830 --> 01:13:01,840
then i started shifting to doing
 

4359
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:03,750
then i started shifting to doing
transformer bar squat it's this bar i

4360
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:03,760
transformer bar squat it's this bar i
 

4361
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:04,950
transformer bar squat it's this bar i
developed that actually changed and

4362
01:13:04,950 --> 01:13:04,960
developed that actually changed and
 

4363
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,709
developed that actually changed and
manipulates spinal mechanics so i

4364
01:13:06,709 --> 01:13:06,719
manipulates spinal mechanics so i
 

4365
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:08,550
manipulates spinal mechanics so i
started loading in these more forward

4366
01:13:08,550 --> 01:13:08,560
started loading in these more forward
 

4367
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:09,510
started loading in these more forward
positions

4368
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:09,520
positions
 

4369
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:11,350
positions
and being able again so now i'm getting

4370
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
and being able again so now i'm getting
 

4371
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:13,350
and being able again so now i'm getting
closer than a front squat but not quite

4372
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:13,360
closer than a front squat but not quite
 

4373
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:14,310
closer than a front squat but not quite
squatting and then

4374
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:14,320
squatting and then
 

4375
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,550
squatting and then
i would start adjusting that bar every

4376
01:13:16,550 --> 01:13:16,560
i would start adjusting that bar every
 

4377
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:18,390
i would start adjusting that bar every
training cycle to closer to a squat

4378
01:13:18,390 --> 01:13:18,400
training cycle to closer to a squat
 

4379
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,550
training cycle to closer to a squat
toaster to a squat till it finally was

4380
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:20,560
toaster to a squat till it finally was
 

4381
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,669
toaster to a squat till it finally was
right so what's the difference between a

4382
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:21,679
right so what's the difference between a
 

4383
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:22,550
right so what's the difference between a
front squat

4384
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:22,560
front squat
 

4385
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:25,590
front squat
and a regular like a back squat like in

4386
01:13:25,590 --> 01:13:25,600
and a regular like a back squat like in
 

4387
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,110
and a regular like a back squat like in
terms of the

4388
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:27,120
terms of the
 

4389
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,669
terms of the
the stress on the body the mechanics was

4390
01:13:29,669 --> 01:13:29,679
the stress on the body the mechanics was
 

4391
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:30,870
the stress on the body the mechanics was
there something interesting to be said

4392
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:30,880
there something interesting to be said
 

4393
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,590
there something interesting to be said
about

4394
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:31,600
about
 

4395
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,030
about
like how fundamentally different are

4396
01:13:33,030 --> 01:13:33,040
like how fundamentally different are
 

4397
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,030
like how fundamentally different are
they so what's interesting

4398
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:35,040
they so what's interesting
 

4399
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,790
they so what's interesting
people think about the weight in

4400
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:36,800
people think about the weight in
 

4401
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:38,470
people think about the weight in
imposition to them like oh the bar's in

4402
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
imposition to them like oh the bar's in
 

4403
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:40,149
imposition to them like oh the bar's in
front of me the bar's behind me

4404
01:13:40,149 --> 01:13:40,159
front of me the bar's behind me
 

4405
01:13:40,159 --> 01:13:43,270
front of me the bar's behind me
which is not the case the bar

4406
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:43,280
which is not the case the bar
 

4407
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,990
which is not the case the bar
is above your midfoot the load is above

4408
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
is above your midfoot the load is above
 

4409
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,149
is above your midfoot the load is above
your midfoot

4410
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:48,159
your midfoot
 

4411
01:13:48,159 --> 01:13:50,550
your midfoot
so we're actually manipulating the spine

4412
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,560
so we're actually manipulating the spine
 

4413
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,149
so we're actually manipulating the spine
behind the bar

4414
01:13:52,149 --> 01:13:52,159
behind the bar
 

4415
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:54,229
behind the bar
so we're causing spinal uprighting

4416
01:13:54,229 --> 01:13:54,239
so we're causing spinal uprighting
 

4417
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,669
so we're causing spinal uprighting
behind the bar getting in a more erect

4418
01:13:55,669 --> 01:13:55,679
behind the bar getting in a more erect
 

4419
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:56,229
behind the bar getting in a more erect
position

4420
01:13:56,229 --> 01:13:56,239
position
 

4421
01:13:56,239 --> 01:13:57,910
position
which is going to change the

4422
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
which is going to change the
 

4423
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,510
which is going to change the
relationship of the hip angle

4424
01:13:59,510 --> 01:13:59,520
relationship of the hip angle
 

4425
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:01,350
relationship of the hip angle
it's going to change our ability to

4426
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:01,360
it's going to change our ability to
 

4427
01:14:01,360 --> 01:14:03,189
it's going to change our ability to
maintain the spine it's going to change

4428
01:14:03,189 --> 01:14:03,199
maintain the spine it's going to change
 

4429
01:14:03,199 --> 01:14:03,669
maintain the spine it's going to change
the

4430
01:14:03,669 --> 01:14:03,679
the
 

4431
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:06,550
the
uh how much the the core comes in how

4432
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:06,560
uh how much the the core comes in how
 

4433
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:07,750
uh how much the the core comes in how
hard it is to

4434
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:07,760
hard it is to
 

4435
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,430
hard it is to
maintain that sternum to diaphragm

4436
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
maintain that sternum to diaphragm
 

4437
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,189
maintain that sternum to diaphragm
relationship that we talked about

4438
01:14:11,189 --> 01:14:11,199
relationship that we talked about
 

4439
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:13,110
relationship that we talked about
all this stuff starts changing so the

4440
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
all this stuff starts changing so the
 

4441
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:14,870
all this stuff starts changing so the
bar stays in the same place the bar's

4442
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:14,880
bar stays in the same place the bar's
 

4443
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,790
bar stays in the same place the bar's
still behind you but the load

4444
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:16,800
still behind you but the load
 

4445
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,630
still behind you but the load
moves around so but we're actually

4446
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
moves around so but we're actually
 

4447
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:21,430
moves around so but we're actually
manipulating the spine around the load

4448
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:21,440
manipulating the spine around the load
 

4449
01:14:21,440 --> 01:14:23,750
manipulating the spine around the load
yeah it's incredible we can tailor it to

4450
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:23,760
yeah it's incredible we can tailor it to
 

4451
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:24,550
yeah it's incredible we can tailor it to
an athlete

4452
01:14:24,550 --> 01:14:24,560
an athlete
 

4453
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:25,830
an athlete
which is great when you've got a seven

4454
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:25,840
which is great when you've got a seven
 

4455
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:27,590
which is great when you've got a seven
foot plus tall baseball player or

4456
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:27,600
foot plus tall baseball player or
 

4457
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,550
foot plus tall baseball player or
basketball player

4458
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
basketball player
 

4459
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:29,990
basketball player
that's why we work with all these teams

4460
01:14:29,990 --> 01:14:30,000
that's why we work with all these teams
 

4461
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,510
that's why we work with all these teams
anyway so it's like you're taking

4462
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,520
anyway so it's like you're taking
 

4463
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:32,950
anyway so it's like you're taking
something and getting closer and closer

4464
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:32,960
something and getting closer and closer
 

4465
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:33,350
something and getting closer and closer
to it

4466
01:14:33,350 --> 01:14:33,360
to it
 

4467
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,709
to it
at the same time we're looking at the

4468
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:34,719
at the same time we're looking at the
 

4469
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:37,110
at the same time we're looking at the
quality so like i needed to be able to

4470
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:37,120
quality so like i needed to be able to
 

4471
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,790
quality so like i needed to be able to
really hold this torso position with the

4472
01:14:38,790 --> 01:14:38,800
really hold this torso position with the
 

4473
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:39,830
really hold this torso position with the
weight moving up here

4474
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
weight moving up here
 

4475
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,430
weight moving up here
now unlike the deadlift the ability to

4476
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:41,440
now unlike the deadlift the ability to
 

4477
01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:43,350
now unlike the deadlift the ability to
manage this tl position

4478
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:43,360
manage this tl position
 

4479
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:45,669
manage this tl position
becomes much more challenging so that

4480
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
becomes much more challenging so that
 

4481
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:47,189
becomes much more challenging so that
was also why i was choosing the

4482
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:47,199
was also why i was choosing the
 

4483
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,229
was also why i was choosing the
transformer bar

4484
01:14:48,229 --> 01:14:48,239
transformer bar
 

4485
01:14:48,239 --> 01:14:49,990
transformer bar
because it actually challenges that more

4486
01:14:49,990 --> 01:14:50,000
because it actually challenges that more
 

4487
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,669
because it actually challenges that more
in those big forward positions

4488
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:51,679
in those big forward positions
 

4489
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:53,510
in those big forward positions
i was also working on my back strength

4490
01:14:53,510 --> 01:14:53,520
i was also working on my back strength
 

4491
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:54,709
i was also working on my back strength
tremendously

4492
01:14:54,709 --> 01:14:54,719
tremendously
 

4493
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:56,709
tremendously
to be able to hold a maintained position

4494
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
to be able to hold a maintained position
 

4495
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,070
to be able to hold a maintained position
so there was a lot of like

4496
01:14:58,070 --> 01:14:58,080
so there was a lot of like
 

4497
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:00,950
so there was a lot of like
i chose a bent over rows so bent over

4498
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:00,960
i chose a bent over rows so bent over
 

4499
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,870
i chose a bent over rows so bent over
row is a mixed vector so it's a forward

4500
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:02,880
row is a mixed vector so it's a forward
 

4501
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,430
row is a mixed vector so it's a forward
to back

4502
01:15:03,430 --> 01:15:03,440
to back
 

4503
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:04,950
to back
so it wouldn't have as much carrier but

4504
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:04,960
so it wouldn't have as much carrier but
 

4505
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,350
so it wouldn't have as much carrier but
it's also um

4506
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:07,360
it's also um
 

4507
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,350
it's also um
got some axial loading components in it

4508
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:09,360
got some axial loading components in it
 

4509
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:10,470
got some axial loading components in it
as well

4510
01:15:10,470 --> 01:15:10,480
as well
 

4511
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:12,870
as well
so we're working on that and then as it

4512
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:12,880
so we're working on that and then as it
 

4513
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:14,229
so we're working on that and then as it
as we get closer and closer to

4514
01:15:14,229 --> 01:15:14,239
as we get closer and closer to
 

4515
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:15,510
as we get closer and closer to
competition i'm developing those

4516
01:15:15,510 --> 01:15:15,520
competition i'm developing those
 

4517
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:16,709
competition i'm developing those
strengths but now i need to start

4518
01:15:16,709 --> 01:15:16,719
strengths but now i need to start
 

4519
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:19,110
strengths but now i need to start
tapering those out so all of my recovery

4520
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:19,120
tapering those out so all of my recovery
 

4521
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,510
tapering those out so all of my recovery
needs can now go into the more specific

4522
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520
needs can now go into the more specific
 

4523
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,630
needs can now go into the more specific
that i'm actually ramping the load up so

4524
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:24,640
that i'm actually ramping the load up so
 

4525
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,950
that i'm actually ramping the load up so
as i'm ramping the load on the weight

4526
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
as i'm ramping the load on the weight
 

4527
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:28,870
as i'm ramping the load on the weight
i'm able to ramp it a lot faster

4528
01:15:28,870 --> 01:15:28,880
i'm able to ramp it a lot faster
 

4529
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,630
i'm able to ramp it a lot faster
because i'm tapering out the other stuff

4530
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:30,640
because i'm tapering out the other stuff
 

4531
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,350
because i'm tapering out the other stuff
so i can still keep my total load

4532
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:33,360
so i can still keep my total load
 

4533
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,110
so i can still keep my total load
high but now get it very very specific

4534
01:15:37,110 --> 01:15:37,120
high but now get it very very specific
 

4535
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:38,550
high but now get it very very specific
wow so everything i've done has always

4536
01:15:38,550 --> 01:15:38,560
wow so everything i've done has always
 

4537
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:41,030
wow so everything i've done has always
been kind of an annual training cycle

4538
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
been kind of an annual training cycle
 

4539
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:42,630
been kind of an annual training cycle
and then again this was like a this was

4540
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:42,640
and then again this was like a this was
 

4541
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,229
and then again this was like a this was
a five-year training cycle but we just

4542
01:15:44,229 --> 01:15:44,239
a five-year training cycle but we just
 

4543
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,669
a five-year training cycle but we just
kind of walked through the last year of

4544
01:15:45,669 --> 01:15:45,679
kind of walked through the last year of
 

4545
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,229
kind of walked through the last year of
each and you can see how these concepts

4546
01:15:48,229 --> 01:15:48,239
each and you can see how these concepts
 

4547
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:51,510
each and you can see how these concepts
play out in reality so in the cycling

4548
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:51,520
play out in reality so in the cycling
 

4549
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,390
play out in reality so in the cycling
so this is both for you but also for

4550
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
so this is both for you but also for
 

4551
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,470
so this is both for you but also for
more recreational

there's variety injected into the system

4556
01:16:01,350 --> 01:16:01,360
there's variety injected into the system
 

4557
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,189
there's variety injected into the system
you need variety yeah

4558
01:16:03,189 --> 01:16:03,199
you need variety yeah
 

4559
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,709
you need variety yeah
yeah because you will basically stagnate

4560
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:06,719
yeah because you will basically stagnate
 

4561
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,310
yeah because you will basically stagnate
at some level right so you should

4562
01:16:08,310 --> 01:16:08,320
at some level right so you should
 

4563
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:09,990
at some level right so you should
should always be kind of shifting a

4564
01:16:09,990 --> 01:16:10,000
should always be kind of shifting a
 

4565

can push their training a little bit
 

4677
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:56,790
can push their training a little bit
more

4678
01:17:56,790 --> 01:17:56,800
more
 

4679
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,110
more
that we can add a little bit more force

4680
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,120
that we can add a little bit more force
 

4681
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:00,149
that we can add a little bit more force
output and

4682
01:18:00,149 --> 01:18:00,159
output and
 

4683
01:18:00,159 --> 01:18:02,390
output and
be able to recover from it so the only

4684
01:18:02,390 --> 01:18:02,400
be able to recover from it so the only
 

4685
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:03,750
be able to recover from it so the only
thing they've got to do

4686
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:03,760
thing they've got to do
 

4687
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,270
thing they've got to do
is add some training but there's no

4688
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
is add some training but there's no
 

4689
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,790
is add some training but there's no
training culture there so they don't

4690
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:06,800
training culture there so they don't
 

4691
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:08,310
training culture there so they don't
have any experience which is why

4692
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:08,320
have any experience which is why
 

4693
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,149
have any experience which is why
they love the transformer bar because

4694
01:18:10,149 --> 01:18:10,159
they love the transformer bar because
 

4695
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,270
they love the transformer bar because
they don't have to worry about teaching

4696
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
they don't have to worry about teaching
 

4697
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,470
they don't have to worry about teaching
the technique we can actually set the

4698
01:18:12,470 --> 01:18:12,480
the technique we can actually set the
 

4699
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,910
the technique we can actually set the
bar on a setting that makes their squats

4700
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:13,920
bar on a setting that makes their squats
 

4701
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:14,470
bar on a setting that makes their squats
perfect

4702
01:18:14,470 --> 01:18:14,480
perfect
 

4703
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,990
perfect
by queuing all the stuff with actually

4704
01:18:15,990 --> 01:18:16,000
by queuing all the stuff with actually
 

4705
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,510
by queuing all the stuff with actually
not having to coach it because when

4706
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:17,520
not having to coach it because when
 

4707
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,350
not having to coach it because when
you're coaching a room full of athletes

4708
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,360
you're coaching a room full of athletes
 

4709
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,110
you're coaching a room full of athletes
it's really hard to teach the nuance of

4710
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
it's really hard to teach the nuance of
 

4711
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,390
it's really hard to teach the nuance of
all this and not sure

4712
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:22,400
all this and not sure
 

4713
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:24,470
all this and not sure
that all that but that's all that they

4714
01:18:24,470 --> 01:18:24,480
that all that but that's all that they
 

4715
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:25,990
that all that but that's all that they
have to do with these players with

4716
01:18:25,990 --> 01:18:26,000
have to do with these players with
 

4717
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:27,990
have to do with these players with
a huge level of skill so once you reach

4718
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:28,000
a huge level of skill so once you reach
 

4719
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:29,750
a huge level of skill so once you reach
a certain level of skill

4720
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760
a certain level of skill
 

4721
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,110
a certain level of skill
adding strength is the the only real

4722
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:33,120
adding strength is the the only real
 

4723
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:34,790
adding strength is the the only real
forward path

4724
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
forward path
 

4725
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,070
forward path
so so that's the the basic simple answer

4726
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,080
so so that's the the basic simple answer
 

4727
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,030
so so that's the the basic simple answer
to that

4728
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:39,040
to that
 

4729
01:18:39,040 --> 01:18:40,790
to that
um so one of the benefits there being

4730
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
um so one of the benefits there being
 

4731
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,310
um so one of the benefits there being
like injury prevention actually

4732
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
like injury prevention actually
 

4733
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,750
like injury prevention actually
injury resilience because especially uh

4734
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
injury resilience because especially uh
 

4735
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,669
injury resilience because especially uh
fighting sports you're going to be

4736
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:47,679
fighting sports you're going to be
 

4737
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:49,590
fighting sports you're going to be
challenged and thrown and other things

4738
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:49,600
challenged and thrown and other things
 

4739
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:50,470
challenged and thrown and other things
happen to you

4740
01:18:50,470 --> 01:18:50,480
happen to you
 

4741
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:52,149
happen to you
and the more resilient you can make your

4742
01:18:52,149 --> 01:18:52,159
and the more resilient you can make your
 

4743
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,470
and the more resilient you can make your
structures the better you're gonna be

4744
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:54,480
structures the better you're gonna be
 

4745
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,910
structures the better you're gonna be
even a cyclist

4746
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:55,920
even a cyclist
 

4747
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:57,750
even a cyclist
mountain biking why would they need it

4748
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:57,760
mountain biking why would they need it
 

4749
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:58,870
mountain biking why would they need it
why would they need to do upper body

4750
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:58,880
why would they need to do upper body
 

4751
01:18:58,880 --> 01:18:59,270
why would they need to do upper body
training

4752
01:18:59,270 --> 01:18:59,280
training
 

4753
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:02,229
training
take a crash your shoulder's gone you're

4754
01:19:02,229 --> 01:19:02,239
take a crash your shoulder's gone you're
 

4755
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:02,630
take a crash your shoulder's gone you're
done

4756
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:02,640
done
 

4757
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,470
done
your career is over unless you've done a

4758
01:19:04,470 --> 01:19:04,480
your career is over unless you've done a
 

4759
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:06,390
your career is over unless you've done a
little training

4760
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:06,400
little training
 

4761
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,630
little training
right so so there's value in all this

4762
01:19:08,630 --> 01:19:08,640
right so so there's value in all this
 

4763
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,950
right so so there's value in all this
stuff but uh the resilience is like

4764
01:19:10,950 --> 01:19:10,960
stuff but uh the resilience is like
 

4765
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:12,950
stuff but uh the resilience is like
that's that's huge and then we can

4766
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:12,960
that's that's huge and then we can
 

4767
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,149
that's that's huge and then we can
overlay strength

4768
01:19:14,149 --> 01:19:14,159
overlay strength
 

4769
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:16,630
overlay strength
the people where we miss is this focus

4770
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
the people where we miss is this focus
 

4771
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,630
the people where we miss is this focus
on strength when we haven't developed

4772
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,640
on strength when we haven't developed
 

4773
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,030
on strength when we haven't developed
quality motor patterns first so this is

4774
01:19:21,030 --> 01:19:21,040
quality motor patterns first so this is
 

4775
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,550
quality motor patterns first so this is
a huge thing with uh

4776
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:22,560
a huge thing with uh
 

4777
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,390
a huge thing with uh
children because people want to know

4778
01:19:24,390 --> 01:19:24,400
children because people want to know
 

4779
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,790
children because people want to know
what's the appropriate training age

4780
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
what's the appropriate training age
 

4781
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,390
what's the appropriate training age
i'd had my daughter training before my

4782
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
i'd had my daughter training before my
 

4783
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:30,870
i'd had my daughter training before my
son because she developed

4784
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
son because she developed
 

4785
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,550
son because she developed
movement patterns at a better quality

4786
01:19:32,550 --> 01:19:32,560
movement patterns at a better quality
 

4787
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:34,229
movement patterns at a better quality
earlier there's no age because it's

4788
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
earlier there's no age because it's
 

4789
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:35,189
earlier there's no age because it's
going to be very

4790
01:19:35,189 --> 01:19:35,199
going to be very
 

4791
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:37,430
going to be very
dependent on the individual there's no

4792
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:37,440
dependent on the individual there's no
 

4793
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,030
dependent on the individual there's no
point in having adaptation if we don't

4794
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:39,040
point in having adaptation if we don't
 

4795
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:39,750
point in having adaptation if we don't
have the right

4796
01:19:39,750 --> 01:19:39,760
have the right
 

4797
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:41,750
have the right
thing to adapt to yet and that applies

4798
01:19:41,750 --> 01:19:41,760
thing to adapt to yet and that applies
 

4799
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:43,350
thing to adapt to yet and that applies
to general movement but also

4800
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:43,360
to general movement but also
 

4801
01:19:43,360 --> 01:19:45,030
to general movement but also
the sport you see you're saying the

4802
01:19:45,030 --> 01:19:45,040
the sport you see you're saying the
 

4803
01:19:45,040 --> 01:19:46,709
the sport you see you're saying the
skills should be developed first and the

4804
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
skills should be developed first and the
 

4805
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:49,189
skills should be developed first and the
strength applied on top of that yep

4806
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:49,199
strength applied on top of that yep
 

4807
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:52,229
strength applied on top of that yep
maybe you can educate me but

4808
01:19:52,229 --> 01:19:52,239
maybe you can educate me but
 

4809
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,590
maybe you can educate me but
i actually quit lifting and powerlifting

4810
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:55,600
i actually quit lifting and powerlifting
 

4811
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,669
i actually quit lifting and powerlifting
for a long time after i started um

4812
01:19:59,669 --> 01:19:59,679
for a long time after i started um

01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,910
of combat sports
because i found that it was preventing

4818
01:20:07,910 --> 01:20:07,920
because i found that it was preventing
 

4819
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,070
because i found that it was preventing
me from

4820
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:10,080
me from
 

4821
01:20:10,080 --> 01:20:14,390
me from
relaxing my body enough to uh

4822
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:14,400
relaxing my body enough to uh
 

4823
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:17,990
relaxing my body enough to uh
load in the skill so this isn't

4824
01:20:17,990 --> 01:20:18,000
load in the skill so this isn't
 

4825
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,110
load in the skill so this isn't
a problem with the uh training this is a

4826
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:21,120
a problem with the uh training this is a
 

4827
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,070
a problem with the uh training this is a
problem with you

4828
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:22,080
problem with you
 

4829
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:25,110

yeah so this is actually really really
 

4831
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:25,669
yeah so this is actually really really

01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,590
a loadable mace a swinging mace
and because every power lifter and body

4838
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:35,600
and because every power lifter and body
 

4839
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,590
and because every power lifter and body
well not every but most

4840
01:20:37,590 --> 01:20:37,600
well not every but most
 

4841
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,270
well not every but most
serious power lifters and bodybuilders

4842
01:20:39,270 --> 01:20:39,280
serious power lifters and bodybuilders
 

4843
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,110
serious power lifters and bodybuilders
like shoulders

4844
01:20:41,110 --> 01:20:41,120
like shoulders
 

4845
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:44,229
like shoulders
mobility is pretty limited

4846
01:20:44,229 --> 01:20:44,239
mobility is pretty limited
 

4847
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,750
mobility is pretty limited
and most of them really really struggle

4848
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:45,760
and most of them really really struggle
 

4849
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:47,270
and most of them really really struggle
with this

4850
01:20:47,270 --> 01:20:47,280
with this
 

4851
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:49,110
with this
the problem is they've been taught to

4852
01:20:49,110 --> 01:20:49,120
the problem is they've been taught to
 

4853
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:52,390
the problem is they've been taught to
have tension all the time

4854
01:20:52,390 --> 01:20:52,400
have tension all the time
 

4855
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,470
have tension all the time
and that's not good so when we talk

4856
01:20:54,470 --> 01:20:54,480
and that's not good so when we talk
 

4857
01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:55,990
and that's not good so when we talk
about like the joint positions that we

4858
01:20:55,990 --> 01:20:56,000
about like the joint positions that we
 

4859
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,270
about like the joint positions that we
were talking about earlier and having

4860
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:57,280
were talking about earlier and having
 

4861
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:58,310
were talking about earlier and having
those and the muscles in the right

4862
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
those and the muscles in the right
 

4863
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,030
those and the muscles in the right
length and tension relationship

4864
01:21:01,030 --> 01:21:01,040
length and tension relationship
 

4865
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:06,709
length and tension relationship
athleticism is the speed to relaxation

4866
01:21:06,709 --> 01:21:06,719
athleticism is the speed to relaxation
 

4867
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,110
athleticism is the speed to relaxation
because the counter is speed to to speed

4868
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:09,120
because the counter is speed to to speed
 

4869
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,790
because the counter is speed to to speed
to contraction

4870
01:21:10,790 --> 01:21:10,800
to contraction

01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,669
to contraction
float like a butterfly sting like a bee

4872
01:21:13,669 --> 01:21:13,679
float like a butterfly sting like a bee
 

4873
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:14,390
float like a butterfly sting like a bee
right

4874
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
right
 

4875
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:16,629
right
and so what a mace can do is use that

4876
01:21:16,629 --> 01:21:16,639
and so what a mace can do is use that
 

4877
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:17,590
and so what a mace can do is use that
because this is a

4878
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:17,600
because this is a
 

4879
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,270
because this is a
ties back into a developmental

4880
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:19,280
ties back into a developmental
 

4881
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:20,790
ties back into a developmental
kinesiology because

4882
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:20,800
kinesiology because
 

4883
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,790
kinesiology because
a lot of like reset patterns are getting

4884
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:22,800
a lot of like reset patterns are getting
 

4885
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,709
a lot of like reset patterns are getting
back into these basic movements but it's

4886
01:21:24,709 --> 01:21:24,719
back into these basic movements but it's
 

4887
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:26,830
back into these basic movements but it's
as much about relaxation as it is

4888
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:26,840
as much about relaxation as it is
 

4889
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:27,990
as much about relaxation as it is
contraction

4890
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:28,000
contraction
 

4891
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:30,950
contraction
okay so a mace we have this weight on a

4892
01:21:30,950 --> 01:21:30,960
okay so a mace we have this weight on a
 

4893
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,310
okay so a mace we have this weight on a
big long lever

4894
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:32,320
big long lever
 

4895
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:34,149
big long lever
so i if i grab a kettlebell and be like

4896
01:21:34,149 --> 01:21:34,159
so i if i grab a kettlebell and be like
 

4897
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,229
so i if i grab a kettlebell and be like
let's say movement is a kettlebell halo

4898
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,239
let's say movement is a kettlebell halo
 

4899
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:38,390
let's say movement is a kettlebell halo
it is the same movement but here in the

4900
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:38,400
it is the same movement but here in the
 

4901
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,830
it is the same movement but here in the
halo i'm on

4902
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
halo i'm on
 

4903
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,030
halo i'm on
the whole time with the mace at the

4904
01:21:43,030 --> 01:21:43,040
the whole time with the mace at the
 

4905
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:43,910
the whole time with the mace at the
proper length

4906
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:43,920
proper length
 

4907
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,310
proper length
with the right distribution you cannot

4908
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:46,320
with the right distribution you cannot
 

4909
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,430
with the right distribution you cannot
do the movement

4910
01:21:47,430 --> 01:21:47,440
do the movement
 

4911
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,669
do the movement
you could not move force your way

4912
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:49,679
you could not move force your way
 

4913
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,350
you could not move force your way
through it the only way that you can

4914
01:21:51,350 --> 01:21:51,360
through it the only way that you can
 

4915
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,390
through it the only way that you can
accomplish that

4916
01:21:52,390 --> 01:21:52,400
accomplish that
 

4917
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,590
accomplish that
is by relaxing and then

4918
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:55,600
is by relaxing and then
 

4919
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,590
is by relaxing and then
now we now we can contract all the

4920
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:57,600
now we now we can contract all the
 

4921
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,350
now we now we can contract all the
muscles related around

4922
01:21:59,350 --> 01:21:59,360
muscles related around
 

4923
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,990
muscles related around
that shoulder girdle all at once we're

4924
01:22:01,990 --> 01:22:02,000
that shoulder girdle all at once we're
 

4925
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:02,550
that shoulder girdle all at once we're
working

4926
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:02,560
working
 

4927
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,990
working
on off on off on off with moving

4928
01:22:05,990 --> 01:22:06,000
on off on off on off with moving
 

4929
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,070
on off on off on off with moving
and contracting and now so what happens

4930
01:22:08,070 --> 01:22:08,080
and contracting and now so what happens
 

4931
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:09,669
and contracting and now so what happens
a lot of times as we

4932
01:22:09,669 --> 01:22:09,679
a lot of times as we
 

4933
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:11,590
a lot of times as we
you know this stiffness and tightness

4934
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:11,600
you know this stiffness and tightness
 

4935
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,590
you know this stiffness and tightness
happens if we're in poor positions we

4936
01:22:13,590 --> 01:22:13,600
happens if we're in poor positions we
 

4937
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:14,470
happens if we're in poor positions we
start using

4938
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:14,480
start using
 

4939
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:17,590
start using
stabilizer muscles to do the movement

4940
01:22:17,590 --> 01:22:17,600
stabilizer muscles to do the movement
 

4941
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,189
stabilizer muscles to do the movement
and then that's where this stiffness

4942
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:19,199
and then that's where this stiffness
 

4943
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:20,950
and then that's where this stiffness
come from so it means that

4944
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:20,960
come from so it means that
 

4945
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,030
come from so it means that
in some of whatever training that you're

4946
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
in some of whatever training that you're
 

4947
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,709
in some of whatever training that you're
doing there's a deficit

4948
01:22:24,709 --> 01:22:24,719
doing there's a deficit
 

4949
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,229
doing there's a deficit
in the movement quality okay or

4950
01:22:28,229 --> 01:22:28,239
in the movement quality okay or
 

4951
01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:29,350
in the movement quality okay or
there's a deficit in the training

4952
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:29,360
there's a deficit in the training
 

4953
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,790
there's a deficit in the training
program and you're not recovering from

4954
01:22:30,790 --> 01:22:30,800
program and you're not recovering from
 

4955
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:31,430
program and you're not recovering from
and 80

4956
01:22:31,430 --> 01:22:31,440
and 80
 

4957
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,870
and 80
of the time that's the right answer

4958
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:32,880
of the time that's the right answer
 

4959
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:34,870
of the time that's the right answer
right but yeah that's where the

4960
01:22:34,870 --> 01:22:34,880
right but yeah that's where the
 

4961
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,870
right but yeah that's where the
where the gap is and learning how to

4962
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
where the gap is and learning how to
 

4963
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:38,229
where the gap is and learning how to
relax

4964
01:22:38,229 --> 01:22:38,239
relax
 

4965
01:22:38,239 --> 01:22:40,709
relax
and the way a lot of the exercises are

4966
01:22:40,709 --> 01:22:40,719
and the way a lot of the exercises are
 

4967
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:41,350
and the way a lot of the exercises are
taught

4968
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:41,360
taught
 

4969
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:42,709
taught
and have been taught for a long time

4970
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:42,719
and have been taught for a long time
 

4971
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:44,629
and have been taught for a long time
which is why there's a big gap and this

4972
01:22:44,629 --> 01:22:44,639
which is why there's a big gap and this
 

4973
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:45,510
which is why there's a big gap and this
is why

4974
01:22:45,510 --> 01:22:45,520
is why
 

4975
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:47,350
is why
both clinical rehab and all these other

4976
01:22:47,350 --> 01:22:47,360
both clinical rehab and all these other
 

4977
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:49,189
both clinical rehab and all these other
components are mixed in my philosophy

4978
01:22:49,189 --> 01:22:49,199
components are mixed in my philosophy
 

4979
01:22:49,199 --> 01:22:50,550
components are mixed in my philosophy
and what i'm trying to do with kabuki

4980
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:50,560
and what i'm trying to do with kabuki
 

4981

and what i'm trying to do with kabuki
strength

4982

strength
 

4983
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,750
strength
because i'm looking at holistic movement

4984
01:22:53,750 --> 01:22:53,760
because i'm looking at holistic movement
 

4985

i'm not looking at powerlifting
bass movements are what i want to load

4988
01:22:57,430 --> 01:22:57,440
bass movements are what i want to load
 

4989
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,390
bass movements are what i want to load
and be able to assess on

4990
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:00,400
and be able to assess on
 

4991
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,510
and be able to assess on
but this affects all sports

4992
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:03,520
but this affects all sports
 

4993
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,590
but this affects all sports
all activities and strength doesn't have

4994

all activities and strength doesn't have
 

4995
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,110
all activities and strength doesn't have
to be that

to be that
 

4997
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:09,030
to be that
i mean i i'm i'm freaking a thousand

5069
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:13,030
position then i'm going to end up with
some other problems right

get in position
 

5075
01:24:16,239 --> 01:24:20,229
get in position
but go figure out why it is and fix it

5076
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:20,239
but go figure out why it is and fix it
 

5077
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:22,229
but go figure out why it is and fix it
and then maybe next you know three four

5078
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:22,239
and then maybe next you know three four
 

5079
01:24:22,239 --> 01:24:23,189
and then maybe next you know three four
months from now they're gonna get a

5080

months from now they're gonna get a
 

5081
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,270
months from now they're gonna get a
little something else going on

little something else going on
 

5083
01:24:25,280 --> 01:24:27,430
little something else going on
fix it but understand the deeper root

5084
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:27,440
fix it but understand the deeper root
 

5085
01:24:27,440 --> 01:24:29,030
fix it but understand the deeper root
reason of why

5086
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:29,040
reason of why
 

5087
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,149

you know especially guys you know when
 

5157
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:41,350
you know especially guys you know when
like a smaller

5158
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:41,360
like a smaller
 

5159
01:25:41,360 --> 01:25:45,030
like a smaller
person just destroys you dominates you

5160
01:25:45,030 --> 01:25:45,040
person just destroys you dominates you
 

5161
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:47,030
person just destroys you dominates you
when you can i don't know deadlift

5162
01:25:47,030 --> 01:25:47,040
when you can i don't know deadlift
 

5163
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,669
when you can i don't know deadlift
whatever number of pounds

5164
01:25:49,669 --> 01:25:49,679
whatever number of pounds
 

5165
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:51,910
whatever number of pounds
and uh it's hard not to use that

5166
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
and uh it's hard not to use that
 

5167
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,590
and uh it's hard not to use that
strength to then resist

5168
01:25:53,590 --> 01:25:53,600
strength to then resist
 

5169
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:57,110
strength to then resist
the slow the ultimate destruction by

5170
01:25:57,110 --> 01:25:57,120
the slow the ultimate destruction by
 

5171
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,870
the slow the ultimate destruction by
like 120 pound

5172
01:25:58,870 --> 01:25:58,880
like 120 pound
 

5173
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,470
like 120 pound
but that and that's why i recommend

5174
01:26:00,470 --> 01:26:00,480
but that and that's why i recommend
 

5175
01:26:00,480 --> 01:26:02,310
but that and that's why i recommend
developing the skill quality first

5176
01:26:02,310 --> 01:26:02,320
developing the skill quality first
 

5177
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:03,750
developing the skill quality first
but it doesn't it doesn't mean that you

5178
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:03,760
but it doesn't it doesn't mean that you
 

5179
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,229
but it doesn't it doesn't mean that you
can't i can't you can still do it so

5180
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:06,239
can't i can't you can still do it so
 

5181
01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:07,590
can't i can't you can still do it so
that don't take it as like

5182
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,600
that don't take it as like
 

5183
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:10,629
that don't take it as like
oh i can't go that direction that's fine

5184
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
oh i can't go that direction that's fine
 

5185
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,149
oh i can't go that direction that's fine
but understand those things and then

5186
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:12,159
but understand those things and then
 

5187
01:26:12,159 --> 01:26:13,750
but understand those things and then
also understand the jiu jitsu is

5188
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:13,760
also understand the jiu jitsu is
 

5189
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,110
also understand the jiu jitsu is
additional load on the body

5190
01:26:15,110 --> 01:26:15,120
additional load on the body
 

5191
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:17,189
additional load on the body
yeah so you have to you can't just add

5192
01:26:17,189 --> 01:26:17,199
yeah so you have to you can't just add
 

5193
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,470
yeah so you have to you can't just add
it on top yeah

5194
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:18,480
it on top yeah
 

5195
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:20,550
it on top yeah
you've got to taper back the other

5196
01:26:20,550 --> 01:26:20,560
you've got to taper back the other
 

5197
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:22,470
you've got to taper back the other
you're going to have to make a i'm sorry

5198
01:26:22,470 --> 01:26:22,480
you're going to have to make a i'm sorry
 

5199
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:23,510
you're going to have to make a i'm sorry
you may not want to hear

5200
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,520
you may not want to hear
 

5201
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:26,310
you may not want to hear
it but you're not going to be able to do

5202
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:26,320
it but you're not going to be able to do
 

5203
01:26:26,320 --> 01:26:27,030
it but you're not going to be able to do
as much

5204
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:27,040
as much
 

5205
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:30,629
as much
and add that here yeah it's a compromise

5206
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:30,639
and add that here yeah it's a compromise
 

5207
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,910
and add that here yeah it's a compromise
because your total volume still has to

5208
01:26:33,910 --> 01:26:33,920
because your total volume still has to
 

5209
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:35,189
because your total volume still has to
be there and there's not unfortunately

5210
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
be there and there's not unfortunately
 

5211
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,189
be there and there's not unfortunately
not really a way to measure

5212
01:26:37,189 --> 01:26:37,199
not really a way to measure
 

5213
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,189
not really a way to measure
what the jiu-jitsu volume is with this

5214
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:39,199
what the jiu-jitsu volume is with this
 

5215
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:40,709
what the jiu-jitsu volume is with this
so you've got to

5216
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:40,719
so you've got to
 

5217
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:42,149
so you've got to
take a look at that and that's where

5218
01:26:42,149 --> 01:26:42,159
take a look at that and that's where
 

5219
01:26:42,159 --> 01:26:43,669
take a look at that and that's where
like measuring like heart rate

5220
01:26:43,669 --> 01:26:43,679
like measuring like heart rate
 

5221
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:45,430
like measuring like heart rate
variability or other stuff

5222
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:45,440
variability or other stuff
 

5223
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:47,750
variability or other stuff
can be useful so you can see what is

5224
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
can be useful so you can see what is
 

5225
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,990
can be useful so you can see what is
happening from me from a sympathetic

5226
01:26:49,990 --> 01:26:50,000
happening from me from a sympathetic
 

5227
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,669
happening from me from a sympathetic
versus parasympathetic nerve nervous

5228
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:51,679
versus parasympathetic nerve nervous
 

5229
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:53,110
versus parasympathetic nerve nervous
system standpoint yeah making sure your

5230
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,120
system standpoint yeah making sure your
 

5231
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,629
system standpoint yeah making sure your
body recovers sufficiently

5232
01:26:54,629 --> 01:26:54,639
body recovers sufficiently
 

5233
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:56,870
body recovers sufficiently
and trying to put numbers to it you

5234
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:56,880
and trying to put numbers to it you
 

5235
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,550
and trying to put numbers to it you
mentioned kabuki strength

5236
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:58,560
mentioned kabuki strength
 

5237
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,110
mentioned kabuki strength
you run the kabuki strength lab

5238
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:01,120
you run the kabuki strength lab
 

5239
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,709
you run the kabuki strength lab
previously called the elite performance

5240
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:02,719
previously called the elite performance
 

5241
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:04,470
previously called the elite performance
center in oregon

01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:04,480
center in oregon
 

5243
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:07,830
center in oregon
you called it the perfect gym what makes

5244
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:07,840
you called it the perfect gym what makes
 

5245
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:08,709
you called it the perfect gym what makes
uh for

5246
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
uh for
 

5247
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,030
uh for
the perfect strength training gym where

5248
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:11,040
the perfect strength training gym where
 

5249
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:12,470
the perfect strength training gym where
i called it the program in the video

5250
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:12,480
i called it the program in the video
 

5251
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,110
i called it the program in the video
somewhere i watched oh man

5252
01:27:15,110 --> 01:27:15,120
somewhere i watched oh man
 

5253
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:17,830
somewhere i watched oh man
i mean that's where my testing grounds

5254
01:27:17,830 --> 01:27:17,840
i mean that's where my testing grounds
 

5255
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:19,430
i mean that's where my testing grounds
for developing all this stuff was

5256
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
for developing all this stuff was
 

5257
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,310
for developing all this stuff was
through the years

5258
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,320
through the years
 

5259
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,870
through the years
and and so this is like i said i started

5260
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
and and so this is like i said i started
 

5261
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,110
and and so this is like i said i started
developing relationships with

5262
01:27:25,110 --> 01:27:25,120
developing relationships with
 

5263
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:27,510
developing relationships with

01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:35,199
spine biomechanist in the world i
 

5275
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:36,950
spine biomechanist in the world i
started doing continuing education with

5276
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
started doing continuing education with
 

5277
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,629
started doing continuing education with
these clinical courses and learning this

5278
01:27:38,629 --> 01:27:38,639
these clinical courses and learning this
 

5279
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:39,350
these clinical courses and learning this
stuff and going

5280
01:27:39,350 --> 01:27:39,360
stuff and going
 

5281
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:41,510
stuff and going
but how does it work in my world right

5282
01:27:41,510 --> 01:27:41,520
but how does it work in my world right
 

5283
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:42,950
but how does it work in my world right
and then i started lecturing with them

5284
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:42,960
and then i started lecturing with them
 

5285
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,390
and then i started lecturing with them
and all this other stuff but

5286
01:27:44,390 --> 01:27:44,400
and all this other stuff but
 

5287
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,709
and all this other stuff but
the lab was like where do we test this

5288
01:27:46,709 --> 01:27:46,719
the lab was like where do we test this
 

5289
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:47,590
the lab was like where do we test this
stuff right

5290
01:27:47,590 --> 01:27:47,600
stuff right
 

5291
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,430
stuff right
and so let me get to a point there's

5292
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:49,440
and so let me get to a point there's
 

5293
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,310
and so let me get to a point there's
three things there's always three things

5294
01:27:52,310 --> 01:27:52,320
three things there's always three things
 

5295
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,629
three things there's always three things
so um to be a success

5296
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:56,639
so um to be a success
 

5297
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,229
so um to be a success
to achieve success i believe there's

5298
01:27:58,229 --> 01:27:58,239
to achieve success i believe there's
 

5299
01:27:58,239 --> 01:27:59,990
to achieve success i believe there's
three things that really really come

5300
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:00,000
three things that really really come
 

5301
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,189
three things that really really come
into place

5302
01:28:01,189 --> 01:28:01,199
into place
 

5303
01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:05,590
into place
and it's the right methodology

5304
01:28:05,590 --> 01:28:05,600
and it's the right methodology
 

5305
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:08,550
and it's the right methodology
the right tools and the right

5306
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:08,560
the right tools and the right
 

5307
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:09,830
the right tools and the right
environment

5308
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:09,840
environment
 

5309
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,189
environment
and so it was all about building that

5310
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:13,199
and so it was all about building that
 

5311
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:16,149
and so it was all about building that
and so the methodologies came from a lot

5312
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
and so the methodologies came from a lot
 

5313
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:16,709
and so the methodologies came from a lot
of that

5314
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:16,719
of that
 

5315
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:19,750
of that
different that gray area interaction of

5316
01:28:19,750 --> 01:28:19,760
different that gray area interaction of
 

5317
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:22,229
different that gray area interaction of
clinical with sports science right

5318
01:28:22,229 --> 01:28:22,239
clinical with sports science right
 

5319
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:24,390
clinical with sports science right
and then the tools i had to start

5320
01:28:24,390 --> 01:28:24,400
and then the tools i had to start
 

5321
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,550
and then the tools i had to start
creating and designing and then

5322
01:28:26,550 --> 01:28:26,560
creating and designing and then
 

5323
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:29,669
creating and designing and then
the environment is having this you know

5324
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
the environment is having this you know
 

5325
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,350
the environment is having this you know
focused environment of people that want

5326
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:31,360
focused environment of people that want
 

5327
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:32,790
focused environment of people that want
to do better and push each other and

5328
01:28:32,790 --> 01:28:32,800
to do better and push each other and
 

5329
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:33,510
to do better and push each other and
having

5330
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:33,520
having
 

5331
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,149
having
community and culture right i end up

5332
01:28:36,149 --> 01:28:36,159
community and culture right i end up
 

5333
01:28:36,159 --> 01:28:36,629
community and culture right i end up
building

5334
01:28:36,629 --> 01:28:36,639
building
 

5335
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:38,149
building
these connections this network

5336
01:28:38,149 --> 01:28:38,159
these connections this network
 

5337
01:28:38,159 --> 01:28:39,590
these connections this network
everything that i'm doing with my

5338
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:39,600
everything that i'm doing with my
 

5339
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:41,110
everything that i'm doing with my
businesses

5340
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,120
businesses
 

5341
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:43,910
businesses
is trying to create that into a scalable

5342
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:43,920
is trying to create that into a scalable
 

5343
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,270
is trying to create that into a scalable
fashion and so i'm building the

5344
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:45,280
fashion and so i'm building the
 

5345
01:28:45,280 --> 01:28:46,310
fashion and so i'm building the
groundwork because

5346
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:46,320
groundwork because
 

5347
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,550
groundwork because
to have a system that like yeah i had

5348
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:48,560
to have a system that like yeah i had
 

5349
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,070
to have a system that like yeah i had
clinicals on site that knew

5350
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
clinicals on site that knew
 

5351
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,149
clinicals on site that knew
exactly what we were doing and when it's

5352
01:28:52,149 --> 01:28:52,159
exactly what we were doing and when it's
 

5353
01:28:52,159 --> 01:28:53,990
exactly what we were doing and when it's
me and a few people in a small team and

5354
01:28:53,990 --> 01:28:54,000
me and a few people in a small team and
 

5355
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:54,950
me and a few people in a small team and
all this stuff

5356
01:28:54,950 --> 01:28:54,960
all this stuff
 

5357
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:57,350
all this stuff
we're all just like easy to manage and

5358
01:28:57,350 --> 01:28:57,360
we're all just like easy to manage and
 

5359
01:28:57,360 --> 01:28:58,870
we're all just like easy to manage and
you can see these there's other models

5360
01:28:58,870 --> 01:28:58,880
you can see these there's other models
 

5361
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,750
you can see these there's other models
around this so

5362
01:28:59,750 --> 01:28:59,760
around this so
 

5363
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:01,510
around this so
i've been other areas since maybe

5364
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:01,520
i've been other areas since maybe
 

5365
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:02,950
i've been other areas since maybe
whenever it was i filmed that video

5366
01:29:02,950 --> 01:29:02,960
whenever it was i filmed that video
 

5367
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:05,750
whenever it was i filmed that video
that said that that they have that same

5368
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:05,760
that said that that they have that same
 

5369
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,030
that said that that they have that same
same model and it's taken

5370
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:07,040
same model and it's taken
 

5371
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:08,470
same model and it's taken
probably about a decade usually to

5372
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:08,480
probably about a decade usually to
 

5373
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:10,310
probably about a decade usually to
develop that you know and

5374
01:29:10,310 --> 01:29:10,320
develop that you know and
 

5375
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,750
develop that you know and
having the right people in this

5376
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:11,760
having the right people in this
 

5377
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:13,510
having the right people in this
community they can create this

5378
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
community they can create this
 

5379
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,189
community they can create this
this network and the tool and all this

5380
01:29:15,189 --> 01:29:15,199
this network and the tool and all this
 

5381
01:29:15,199 --> 01:29:16,790
this network and the tool and all this
stuff right except they still don't have

5382
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:16,800
stuff right except they still don't have
 

5383
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,470
stuff right except they still don't have
the best tools because kabuki strength

5384
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:18,480
the best tools because kabuki strength
 

5385
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:19,270
the best tools because kabuki strength
didn't exist

5386
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,280
didn't exist
 

5387
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,709
didn't exist
um but uh but

5388
01:29:22,709 --> 01:29:22,719
um but uh but
 

5389
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:25,270
um but uh but
and so out of that was is essentially

5390
01:29:25,270 --> 01:29:25,280
and so out of that was is essentially
 

5391
01:29:25,280 --> 01:29:26,709
and so out of that was is essentially
started building

5392
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:26,719
started building
 

5393
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:28,550
started building
this business and people like when did

5394
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:28,560
this business and people like when did
 

5395
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,229
this business and people like when did
you know how all this stuff was

5396
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:30,239
you know how all this stuff was
 

5397
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,669
you know how all this stuff was
connected and i'm like

5398
01:29:31,669 --> 01:29:31,679
connected and i'm like
 

5399
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:33,350
connected and i'm like
i don't know i didn't i just started

5400
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:33,360
i don't know i didn't i just started
 

5401
01:29:33,360 --> 01:29:35,110
i don't know i didn't i just started
creating on the outset

5402
01:29:35,110 --> 01:29:35,120
creating on the outset
 

5403
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,790
creating on the outset
the things that worked until finally i'm

5404
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:36,800
the things that worked until finally i'm
 

5405
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:39,110
the things that worked until finally i'm
like oh i'm recreating

5406
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,120
like oh i'm recreating
 

5407
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,910
like oh i'm recreating
a scalable version of this stuff here's

5408
01:29:41,910 --> 01:29:41,920
a scalable version of this stuff here's
 

5409
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:43,350
a scalable version of this stuff here's
the methodologies and a coaching

5410
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,360
the methodologies and a coaching
 

5411
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,350
the methodologies and a coaching
platform that we can manage clients

5412
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:45,360
platform that we can manage clients
 

5413
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:47,030
platform that we can manage clients
around the globe and see what's working

5414
01:29:47,030 --> 01:29:47,040
around the globe and see what's working
 

5415
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:48,390
around the globe and see what's working
and not based on the scientific

5416
01:29:48,390 --> 01:29:48,400
and not based on the scientific
 

5417
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,990
and not based on the scientific
principles of training right

5418
01:29:49,990 --> 01:29:50,000
principles of training right
 

5419
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,669
principles of training right
how do we create that into a database

5420
01:29:51,669 --> 01:29:51,679
how do we create that into a database
 

5421
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:53,110
how do we create that into a database
that now we can train

5422
01:29:53,110 --> 01:29:53,120
that now we can train
 

5423
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,350
that now we can train
new coaches and they can use those same

5424
01:29:55,350 --> 01:29:55,360
new coaches and they can use those same
 

5425
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:57,270
new coaches and they can use those same
metrics and tools to create programs

5426
01:29:57,270 --> 01:29:57,280
metrics and tools to create programs
 

5427
01:29:57,280 --> 01:29:58,470
metrics and tools to create programs
that are tailored to fit

5428
01:29:58,470 --> 01:29:58,480
that are tailored to fit
 

5429
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:00,870
that are tailored to fit
a person's individual needs right now

5430
01:30:00,870 --> 01:30:00,880
a person's individual needs right now
 

5431
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,550
a person's individual needs right now
how do we integrate that with

5432
01:30:02,550 --> 01:30:02,560
how do we integrate that with
 

5433
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:04,790
how do we integrate that with
um assessment and clinical care

5434
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:04,800
um assessment and clinical care
 

5435
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:05,669
um assessment and clinical care
assessment and

5436
01:30:05,669 --> 01:30:05,679
assessment and
 

5437
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:08,070
assessment and
and all these other pieces so there's a

5438
01:30:08,070 --> 01:30:08,080
and all these other pieces so there's a
 

5439
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:09,270
and all these other pieces so there's a
lot of work in that

5440
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:09,280
lot of work in that
 

5441
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:11,189
lot of work in that
and so that's where kabuki strength is

5442
01:30:11,189 --> 01:30:11,199
and so that's where kabuki strength is
 

5443
01:30:11,199 --> 01:30:12,470
and so that's where kabuki strength is
the genesis but we have

5444
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:12,480
the genesis but we have
 

5445
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:16,390
the genesis but we have
we call our gym the kabuki strength lab

5446
01:30:16,390 --> 01:30:16,400
we call our gym the kabuki strength lab
 

5447
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:19,030
we call our gym the kabuki strength lab
literally people find about our gym in

5448
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
literally people find about our gym in
 

5449
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,229
literally people find about our gym in
the neighborhood like how long have you

5450
01:30:20,229 --> 01:30:20,239
the neighborhood like how long have you
 

5451
01:30:20,239 --> 01:30:21,030
the neighborhood like how long have you
been here why

5452
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:21,040
been here why
 

5453
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:22,709
been here why
why do i not know about this we don't

5454
01:30:22,709 --> 01:30:22,719
why do i not know about this we don't
 

5455
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:24,790
why do i not know about this we don't
advertise our gym at all

5456
01:30:24,790 --> 01:30:24,800
advertise our gym at all
 

5457
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:28,550
advertise our gym at all
i feel like that makes no sense well

5458
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
i feel like that makes no sense well
 

5459
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,790
i feel like that makes no sense well
it's because the only reason is to have

5460
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:30,800
it's because the only reason is to have
 

5461
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:32,229
it's because the only reason is to have
a testing environment

5462
01:30:32,229 --> 01:30:32,239
a testing environment
 

5463
01:30:32,239 --> 01:30:34,070
a testing environment
for the tools and methodology and having

5464
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:34,080
for the tools and methodology and having
 

5465
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:35,270
for the tools and methodology and having
enough people to have

5466
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:35,280
enough people to have
 

5467
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:37,669
enough people to have
the culture and fit and to be able to be

5468
01:30:37,669 --> 01:30:37,679
the culture and fit and to be able to be
 

5469
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,669
the culture and fit and to be able to be
part of the experiment

5470
01:30:39,669 --> 01:30:39,679
part of the experiment
 

5471
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:41,510
part of the experiment
what about the environment of the the

5472
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:41,520
what about the environment of the the
 

5473
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,990
what about the environment of the the
feel of it the actual gym

5474
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
feel of it the actual gym
 

5475
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,709
feel of it the actual gym
there's a i don't know a grunginess to

5476
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:46,719

5615
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:06,550
in the walls in the space present there
yeah and we somehow can plug into that

5616
01:33:06,550 --> 01:33:06,560
yeah and we somehow can plug into that
 

5617
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:07,510
yeah and we somehow can plug into that
energy yeah

5618
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:07,520
energy yeah
 

5619
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:10,629
energy yeah
it's we can go down and

5620

there's stuff that's basic foundational
 

5665
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:57,750
there's stuff that's basic foundational
that's been around forever because it

5666
01:33:57,750 --> 01:33:57,760
that's been around forever because it
 

5667
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:00,070
that's been around forever because it
works

works
 

5669
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:03,430
works
but there's always more it could be

5670
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
but there's always more it could be
 

5671
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:04,149
but there's always more it could be
better

it's going to break your wrist and crush
 

5783
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:55,350
it's going to break your wrist and crush
into your face and it just

into your face and it just
 

5785
01:35:55,360 --> 01:35:58,550

it just doesn't feel good pressing but

5786
01:35:58,550 --> 01:35:58,560
it just doesn't feel good pressing but
 

5787
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,310
it just doesn't feel good pressing but
it alleviates the strain on the wrist so

5788
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:00,320
it alleviates the strain on the wrist so
 

5789
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,669
it alleviates the strain on the wrist so
people use it for that reason

5790
01:36:01,669 --> 01:36:01,679
people use it for that reason
 

5791
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:04,709
people use it for that reason
and the the the trap bar same thing it's

5792
01:36:04,709 --> 01:36:04,719
and the the the trap bar same thing it's
 

5793
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:06,709
and the the the trap bar same thing it's
always diving forward in your hand so

5794
01:36:06,709 --> 01:36:06,719
always diving forward in your hand so
 

5795
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:08,470
always diving forward in your hand so

so as soon as the center of rotation

5806
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:19,679
so as soon as the center of rotation
 

5807
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,790
so as soon as the center of rotation
is on the same axis as the

5808
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:22,800
is on the same axis as the
 

5809
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:26,149
is on the same axis as the
center of mass and the handle

5810
01:36:26,149 --> 01:36:26,159
center of mass and the handle
 

5811
01:36:26,159 --> 01:36:28,229
center of mass and the handle
is off center you have you have a

5812
01:36:28,229 --> 01:36:28,239
is off center you have you have a
 

5813
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:30,629
is off center you have you have a
teeter-totter

teeter-totter
 

5815
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,550
teeter-totter
so and a teeter-totter has a balance

5816
01:36:32,550 --> 01:36:32,560
so and a teeter-totter has a balance
 

5817
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:34,709
so and a teeter-totter has a balance
point but it's infinitely perfect so

01:36:34,709 --> 01:36:34,719
point but it's infinitely perfect so
 

5819
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:36,149

and that's what these bars are designed

5826
01:36:40,229 --> 01:36:40,239
and that's what these bars are designed
 

5827
01:36:40,239 --> 01:36:42,229
and that's what these bars are designed
so you got in instability right here you

5828
01:36:42,229 --> 01:36:42,239
so you got in instability right here you
 

5829
01:36:42,239 --> 01:36:43,430
so you got in instability right here you
can't find the center the bar is always

so you can't do carries with it because

5836
01:36:46,470 --> 01:36:46,480
so you can't do carries with it because
 

5837
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:47,669
so you can't do carries with it because
you're doing forward momentum and it

for the shoulder
 

5917
01:37:56,400 --> 01:37:58,790
for the shoulder
and i i can't i haven't been able to

and i i can't i haven't been able to
 

5919
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,629
and i i can't i haven't been able to
take a bar to my chest i mean i'd really

5920
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:00,639
take a bar to my chest i mean i'd really
 

5921
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:02,709
take a bar to my chest i mean i'd really
love to it's been five years since i've

5922
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:02,719
love to it's been five years since i've
 

5923
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,510
love to it's been five years since i've
i've been able to uh to xx train and i'm

5924
01:38:05,510 --> 01:38:05,520
i've been able to uh to xx train and i'm
 

5925
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,629
i've been able to uh to xx train and i'm
like

5926
01:38:06,629 --> 01:38:06,639
like
 

5927
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:08,390
like
just try it like i can't even get a bar

5928
01:38:08,390 --> 01:38:08,400
just try it like i can't even get a bar
 

5929
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:09,750
just try it like i can't even get a bar
to my chest without pain like just try

5930
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:09,760
to my chest without pain like just try
 

5931
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,189
to my chest without pain like just try
it

5932
01:38:11,189 --> 01:38:11,199
it
 

5933
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:12,950
it
that feels good now the arc makes it

5934
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
that feels good now the arc makes it
 

5935
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,189
that feels good now the arc makes it
actually three inches deeper

5936
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:15,199
actually three inches deeper
 

5937
01:38:15,199 --> 01:38:16,629
actually three inches deeper
so people are automatically scared i

5938
01:38:16,629 --> 01:38:16,639
so people are automatically scared i
 

5939
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:17,830
so people are automatically scared i
can't do that because that's an extra

5940
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:17,840
can't do that because that's an extra
 

5941
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:19,430
can't do that because that's an extra
range of motion right

5942
01:38:19,430 --> 01:38:19,440
range of motion right
 

5943
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,870
range of motion right
like oh put a plate on there they're

5944
01:38:20,870 --> 01:38:20,880
like oh put a plate on there they're
 

5945
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,709
like oh put a plate on there they're
doing it by the time the staff's like

5946
01:38:22,709 --> 01:38:22,719
doing it by the time the staff's like
 

5947
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:23,830
doing it by the time the staff's like
they're all standing around

they're all standing around
 

5949
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:25,510
they're all standing around
you see like what's going on put two

5950
01:38:25,510 --> 01:38:25,520
you see like what's going on put two
 

5951
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,750
you see like what's going on put two
plates on you see the

01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:30,470
plates on you see the
just like it gets up how do you feel

5954
01:38:30,470 --> 01:38:30,480
just like it gets up how do you feel
 

5955
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:31,830
just like it gets up how do you feel
like

5956
01:38:31,830 --> 01:38:31,840
like
 

5957
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,030
like
i feel fine no pain at all yeah i did

5958
01:38:35,030 --> 01:38:35,040
i feel fine no pain at all yeah i did
 

5959
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:35,590
i feel fine no pain at all yeah i did
this

5960
01:38:35,590 --> 01:38:35,600
this
 

5961
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,470
this
with five teams with five of the it

5962
01:38:38,470 --> 01:38:38,480
with five teams with five of the it
 

5963
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:38,950
with five teams with five of the it
happening

5964
01:38:38,950 --> 01:38:38,960
happening
 

5965
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:42,390
happening
repeatedly five times and that

5966
01:38:42,390 --> 01:38:42,400
repeatedly five times and that
 

5967
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:43,750
repeatedly five times and that
they and every one of them worked up the

5968
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
they and every one of them worked up the
 

5969
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,390
they and every one of them worked up the
two plates and did the reps varied

5970
01:38:46,390 --> 01:38:46,400
two plates and did the reps varied
 

5971
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,629
two plates and did the reps varied
with zero pain to a three inch range of

5972
01:38:48,629 --> 01:38:48,639
with zero pain to a three inch range of
 

5973
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:49,750
with zero pain to a three inch range of
greater range of mass because what did

5974
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:49,760
greater range of mass because what did
 

5975
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:50,149
greater range of mass because what did
we do

5976
01:38:50,149 --> 01:38:50,159
we do
 

5977
01:38:50,159 --> 01:38:51,350
we do
we stacked all the joints and we

5978
01:38:51,350 --> 01:38:51,360
we stacked all the joints and we
 

5979
01:38:51,360 --> 01:38:52,709
we stacked all the joints and we
provided stability at the end we

5980
01:38:52,709 --> 01:38:52,719
provided stability at the end we
 

5981
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:53,669
provided stability at the end we
balanced the internal and external

5982
01:38:53,669 --> 01:38:53,679
balanced the internal and external
 

5983
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:54,229
balanced the internal and external
rotation

5984
01:38:54,229 --> 01:38:54,239
rotation
 

5985
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:57,030
rotation
i mean just basic playground physics and

5986
01:38:57,030 --> 01:38:57,040
i mean just basic playground physics and
 

5987
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,149
i mean just basic playground physics and
it changed the game

5988
01:38:58,149 --> 01:38:58,159
it changed the game
 

5989
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:00,229
it changed the game
now we get a greater range of motion

5990
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:00,239
now we get a greater range of motion
 

5991
01:39:00,239 --> 01:39:01,910
now we get a greater range of motion
with a greater training effect with the

5992
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
with a greater training effect with the
 

5993
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,510
with a greater training effect with the
negative stresses removed

5994
01:39:03,510 --> 01:39:03,520
negative stresses removed
 

5995
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:05,990
negative stresses removed
our trap bar opened up one side which

5996
01:39:05,990 --> 01:39:06,000
our trap bar opened up one side which
 

5997
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,350
our trap bar opened up one side which
there was already something like that

5998
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:07,360
there was already something like that
 

5999
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:07,750
there was already something like that
out there

6000
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
out there
 

6001
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:10,950
out there
created um it pops up so you can pick up

6002
01:39:10,950 --> 01:39:10,960
created um it pops up so you can pick up
 

6003
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:12,229
created um it pops up so you can pick up
take the weights on and off it's got a

6004
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:12,239
take the weights on and off it's got a
 

6005
01:39:12,239 --> 01:39:13,430
take the weights on and off it's got a
built-in jack

6006
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:13,440
built-in jack
 

6007
01:39:13,440 --> 01:39:15,590
built-in jack
and then created the high handle

6008
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:15,600
and then created the high handle
 

6009
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:16,790
and then created the high handle
position which already did everybody

6010
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
position which already did everybody
 

6011
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,310
position which already did everybody
uses the high handle on a trap bar they

6012
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:18,320
uses the high handle on a trap bar they
 

6013
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:19,830
uses the high handle on a trap bar they
just don't know why they like it

6014
01:39:19,830 --> 01:39:19,840
just don't know why they like it
 

6015
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,510
just don't know why they like it
the handle that's on center we offset

6016
01:39:21,510 --> 01:39:21,520
the handle that's on center we offset
 

6017
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:22,950
the handle that's on center we offset
just a little bit not enough to make a

6018
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:22,960
just a little bit not enough to make a
 

6019
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,629
just a little bit not enough to make a
difference on the range of motion lift

6020
01:39:24,629 --> 01:39:24,639
difference on the range of motion lift
 

6021
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:26,709
difference on the range of motion lift
or even notice visibly but it still has

6022
01:39:26,709 --> 01:39:26,719
or even notice visibly but it still has
 

6023
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,550
or even notice visibly but it still has
the same effect so both handles now have

6024
01:39:28,550 --> 01:39:28,560
the same effect so both handles now have
 

6025
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:29,990
the same effect so both handles now have
that

6026
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,000
that
 

6027
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:31,750
that
we added the option of different handle

6028
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:31,760
we added the option of different handle
 

6029
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,270
we added the option of different handle
sizes based on whatever your needs are

6030
01:39:33,270 --> 01:39:33,280
sizes based on whatever your needs are
 

6031
01:39:33,280 --> 01:39:35,910
sizes based on whatever your needs are
even the one that rolls to develop a

01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
even the one that rolls to develop a
 

6033
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,669
even the one that rolls to develop a
grip and then different widths that you

6034
01:39:37,669 --> 01:39:37,679
grip and then different widths that you
 

6035
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:38,790
grip and then different widths that you
could choose from based on whether

6036
01:39:38,790 --> 01:39:38,800
could choose from based on whether
 

6037
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:39,990
could choose from based on whether
you're training a teen athlete

6038
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:40,000
you're training a teen athlete
 

6039
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,870
you're training a teen athlete
or a seven foot six nba player or a nfl

6040
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:42,880
or a seven foot six nba player or a nfl

um so that we can accommodate for all

6044
01:39:45,910 --> 01:39:45,920
um so that we can accommodate for all
 

6045
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:47,590
um so that we can accommodate for all
these uh differences

6046
01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:47,600
these uh differences
 

6047
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:49,430
these uh differences
and so and then now it becomes the most

6048
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:49,440
and so and then now it becomes the most
 

6049
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:50,629
and so and then now it becomes the most

something real
and then that team picks it up uh but in

6100
01:40:33,669 --> 01:40:33,679
and then that team picks it up uh but in
 

6101
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:35,590
and then that team picks it up uh but in
the old days starting out i just walk

6102
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
the old days starting out i just walk

i just walk out and do it i you talk
 

6107
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,629
i just walk out and do it i you talk
about engineering i'm actually more i

6108
01:40:40,629 --> 01:40:40,639
about engineering i'm actually more i
 

6109
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:41,990
about engineering i'm actually more i
work more of an artist fashion it's in

6110
01:40:41,990 --> 01:40:42,000
work more of an artist fashion it's in
 

6111
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,629
work more of an artist fashion it's in
my head and i just go create

6112
01:40:44,629 --> 01:40:44,639
my head and i just go create
 

6113
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:46,790
my head and i just go create
with no plans and so they have to pick

6114
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:46,800
with no plans and so they have to pick
 

6115
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:48,870
with no plans and so they have to pick
that up and actually do the engineering

6116
01:40:48,870 --> 01:40:48,880
that up and actually do the engineering
 

6117
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,149
that up and actually do the engineering
and testing and all that

6118
01:40:50,149 --> 01:40:50,159
and testing and all that
 

6119
01:40:50,159 --> 01:40:51,590
and testing and all that
and then we got two other products came

6120
01:40:51,590 --> 01:40:51,600
and then we got two other products came
 

6121
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,270
and then we got two other products came
out this year freaking wild are you

6122
01:40:53,270 --> 01:40:53,280
out this year freaking wild are you
 

6123
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,470
out this year freaking wild are you
familiar with uh training with a

6124
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:54,480
familiar with uh training with a
 

6125
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:55,830
familiar with uh training with a
flywheel

6126
01:40:55,830 --> 01:40:55,840
flywheel
 

6127
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,950
flywheel
no no it's a flywheel maybe a flywheel

6128
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
no no it's a flywheel maybe a flywheel
 

6129
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,070
no no it's a flywheel maybe a flywheel
is a spinning object

6130
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:00,080
is a spinning object
 

6131
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:02,790
is a spinning object
that uh creates an inertial mass yeah

6132
01:41:02,790 --> 01:41:02,800
that uh creates an inertial mass yeah
 

6133
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,390
that uh creates an inertial mass yeah
and then it reverses direction

6134
01:41:04,390 --> 01:41:04,400
and then it reverses direction
 

6135
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,149
and then it reverses direction
so whatever you put into it and there's

6136
01:41:06,149 --> 01:41:06,159
so whatever you put into it and there's
 

6137
01:41:06,159 --> 01:41:07,830
so whatever you put into it and there's
one's out there um

6138
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:07,840
one's out there um
 

6139
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:10,390
one's out there um
but ours is the first patent pending

6140
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
but ours is the first patent pending
 

6141
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:11,109
but ours is the first patent pending
that's all

6142
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
that's all
 

6143
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:13,430
that's all
everything all in one unit so it's a

6144
01:41:13,430 --> 01:41:13,440
everything all in one unit so it's a
 

6145
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:15,350
everything all in one unit so it's a
floor based as well as a horizontal so

6146
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
floor based as well as a horizontal so
 

6147
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:16,870
floor based as well as a horizontal so
you can basically do any pulley movement

6148
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
you can basically do any pulley movement
 

6149
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,510
you can basically do any pulley movement
in the world

6150
01:41:17,510 --> 01:41:17,520
in the world
 

6151
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,510
in the world
and now everything that you put into it

6152
01:41:19,510 --> 01:41:19,520
and now everything that you put into it
 

6153
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:20,870
and now everything that you put into it
on a concentric force it whips right

6154
01:41:20,870 --> 01:41:20,880
on a concentric force it whips right
 

6155
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,910
on a concentric force it whips right
back is

6156
01:41:21,910 --> 01:41:21,920
back is
 

6157
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,709
back is
is centric load gosh sure so there's an

6158
01:41:24,709 --> 01:41:24,719
is centric load gosh sure so there's an
 

6159
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:26,470
is centric load gosh sure so there's an
accelerating whipping motion

6160
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:26,480
accelerating whipping motion
 

6161
01:41:26,480 --> 01:41:29,830
accelerating whipping motion
it just yeah basically yeah i mean okay

6162
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:29,840
it just yeah basically yeah i mean okay
 

6163
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:30,390
it just yeah basically yeah i mean okay
i have to

6164
01:41:30,390 --> 01:41:30,400
i have to
 

6165
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,950
i have to
have trouble imagining exactly many of

6166
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:32,960
have trouble imagining exactly many of
 

6167
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,470
have trouble imagining exactly many of
the things you're describing

6168
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:34,480
the things you're describing
 

6169
01:41:34,480 --> 01:41:36,870
the things you're describing
i i suppose have to be experienced right

6170
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:36,880
i i suppose have to be experienced right
 

6171
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,750
i i suppose have to be experienced right
yes

6172
01:41:37,750 --> 01:41:37,760
yes
 

6173
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:39,669
yes
so it's imaginable and there's a lot of

6174
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:39,679
so it's imaginable and there's a lot of
 

6175
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:41,109
so it's imaginable and there's a lot of
research they've been around they're

6176
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:41,119
research they've been around they're
 

6177
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:43,189
research they've been around they're
adopted more heavily in europe quite

6178
01:41:43,189 --> 01:41:43,199
adopted more heavily in europe quite
 

6179
01:41:43,199 --> 01:41:44,790
adopted more heavily in europe quite
heavily in europe but not as much in the

6180
01:41:44,790 --> 01:41:44,800
heavily in europe but not as much in the
 

6181
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:45,669
heavily in europe but not as much in the
us

6182
01:41:45,669 --> 01:41:45,679
us
 

6183
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:46,870
us
because they sell them as a be-all

6184
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:46,880
because they sell them as a be-all
 

6185
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,390
because they sell them as a be-all
end-all tool which they're not they're

6186
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:48,400
end-all tool which they're not they're
 

6187
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:49,750
end-all tool which they're not they're
crazy for what they do

6188
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:49,760
crazy for what they do
 

6189
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,629
crazy for what they do
but it's not the it's another tool and

6190
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
but it's not the it's another tool and
 

6191
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:53,750
but it's not the it's another tool and
so we have

6192
01:41:53,750 --> 01:41:53,760
so we have
 

6193
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:56,149
so we have
um a very high quality unit now that is

6194
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
um a very high quality unit now that is
 

6195
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,590
um a very high quality unit now that is
half the cost of everybody else's

6196
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
half the cost of everybody else's
 

6197
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,550
half the cost of everybody else's
because

6198
01:41:58,550 --> 01:41:58,560
because
 

6199
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,310
because
the innovation of a movable mount point

6200
01:42:00,310 --> 01:42:00,320
the innovation of a movable mount point
 

6201
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:02,070
the innovation of a movable mount point
that you for them you have to have

6202
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:02,080
that you for them you have to have
 

6203
01:42:02,080 --> 01:42:05,270
that you for them you have to have
two pieces of equipment we have one so

6204
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:05,280
two pieces of equipment we have one so
 

6205
01:42:05,280 --> 01:42:06,870
two pieces of equipment we have one so
um and then a few other things better

6206
01:42:06,870 --> 01:42:06,880
um and then a few other things better
 

6207
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:08,790
um and then a few other things better
platform to be able to do things and

6208
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,800
platform to be able to do things and
 

6209
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,189
platform to be able to do things and
that we can do what we call off platform

6210
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:11,199
that we can do what we call off platform
 

6211
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,109
that we can do what we call off platform
work which allows us to do

6212
01:42:13,109 --> 01:42:13,119
work which allows us to do
 

6213
01:42:13,119 --> 01:42:16,229
work which allows us to do
movements like uh punches and stand-ups

6214
01:42:16,229 --> 01:42:16,239
movements like uh punches and stand-ups
 

6215
01:42:16,239 --> 01:42:16,950
movements like uh punches and stand-ups
things like that

6216
01:42:16,950 --> 01:42:16,960
things like that
 

6217
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:18,229
things like that
and then i've got a handheld weight

6218
01:42:18,229 --> 01:42:18,239
and then i've got a handheld weight
 

6219
01:42:18,239 --> 01:42:20,390
and then i've got a handheld weight
coming out next month that we can

6220
01:42:20,390 --> 01:42:20,400
coming out next month that we can
 

6221
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,350
coming out next month that we can
actually play with

6222
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:21,360
actually play with
 

6223
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,990
actually play with
so varying the load with it never

6224
01:42:23,990 --> 01:42:24,000
so varying the load with it never
 

6225
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,350
so varying the load with it never
leaving your hand by changing the

6226
01:42:25,350 --> 01:42:25,360
leaving your hand by changing the
 

6227
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:30,229
leaving your hand by changing the
leverage point

6228
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239

 

6229
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:31,750

we're talking about here anything that

6230
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:31,760
we're talking about here anything that
 

6231
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:33,990
we're talking about here anything that
would be a a dumbbell or a kettlebell

6232
01:42:33,990 --> 01:42:34,000
would be a a dumbbell or a kettlebell
 

6233
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,790
would be a a dumbbell or a kettlebell
movement

6234
01:42:34,790 --> 01:42:34,800
movement
 

6235
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:36,550
movement
so it functions it does the function of

6236
01:42:36,550 --> 01:42:36,560
so it functions it does the function of
 

6237
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,149
so it functions it does the function of
a kettlebell a dumbbell and what we call

6238
01:42:38,149 --> 01:42:38,159
a kettlebell a dumbbell and what we call
 

6239
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:39,270
a kettlebell a dumbbell and what we call
a center mass bell

6240
01:42:39,270 --> 01:42:39,280
a center mass bell
 

6241
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:40,950
a center mass bell
as well as provides variable loading

6242
01:42:40,950 --> 01:42:40,960
as well as provides variable loading
 

6243
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:42,390
as well as provides variable loading
within a range so

6244
01:42:42,390 --> 01:42:42,400
within a range so
 

6245
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:45,189
within a range so
how can you change like how can you

6246
01:42:45,189 --> 01:42:45,199
how can you change like how can you
 

6247
01:42:45,199 --> 01:42:46,790
how can you change like how can you
change the load

6248
01:42:46,790 --> 01:42:46,800
change the load
 

6249
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,310
change the load
because the load well we don't actually

6250
01:42:48,310 --> 01:42:48,320
because the load well we don't actually
 

6251
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:50,629
because the load well we don't actually
change the load we change the torque

6252
01:42:50,629 --> 01:42:50,639
change the load we change the torque
 

6253
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:52,550
change the load we change the torque
on the on the joint that we're working

6254
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:52,560
on the on the joint that we're working
 

6255
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:54,229
on the on the joint that we're working
which is the same that's actually what

6256
01:42:54,229 --> 01:42:54,239
which is the same that's actually what
 

6257
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,070
which is the same that's actually what
is creating the force right so if i'm

6258
01:42:56,070 --> 01:42:56,080
is creating the force right so if i'm
 

6259
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:57,350
is creating the force right so if i'm
doing a front raise

6260
01:42:57,350 --> 01:42:57,360
doing a front raise
 

6261
01:42:57,360 --> 01:43:00,229
doing a front raise
it's where this this downward force is

6262
01:43:00,229 --> 01:43:00,239
it's where this this downward force is
 

6263
01:43:00,239 --> 01:43:02,310
it's where this this downward force is
times the distance away right

6264
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:02,320
times the distance away right
 

6265
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:04,629
times the distance away right
which also then makes it no force when

6266
01:43:04,629 --> 01:43:04,639
which also then makes it no force when
 

6267
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:05,830
which also then makes it no force when
i've got at the bottom of the front ways

6268
01:43:05,830 --> 01:43:05,840
i've got at the bottom of the front ways
 

6269
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,350
i've got at the bottom of the front ways
which is why it's so easy

6270
01:43:07,350 --> 01:43:07,360
which is why it's so easy
 

6271
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:10,070
which is why it's so easy
with this it's like a kettlebell it's

6272
01:43:10,070 --> 01:43:10,080
with this it's like a kettlebell it's
 

6273
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,430
with this it's like a kettlebell it's
offset except it has three different

6274
01:43:11,430 --> 01:43:11,440
offset except it has three different
 

6275
01:43:11,440 --> 01:43:12,550
offset except it has three different
handles

6276
01:43:12,550 --> 01:43:12,560
handles
 

6277
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:14,149
handles
but it's offset just a kettlebell you

6278
01:43:14,149 --> 01:43:14,159
but it's offset just a kettlebell you
 

6279
01:43:14,159 --> 01:43:15,750
but it's offset just a kettlebell you
can't do it because the offset so far it

6280
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:15,760
can't do it because the offset so far it
 

6281
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:17,590
can't do it because the offset so far it
becomes a wrist movement

6282
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:17,600
becomes a wrist movement
 

6283
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:19,750
becomes a wrist movement
so ours has three different sizes in the

6284
01:43:19,750 --> 01:43:19,760
so ours has three different sizes in the
 

6285
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:21,109
so ours has three different sizes in the
offset just enough

6286
01:43:21,109 --> 01:43:21,119
offset just enough
 

6287
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,870
offset just enough
so that you can pick if i put it in the

6288
01:43:22,870 --> 01:43:22,880
so that you can pick if i put it in the
 

6289
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,390
so that you can pick if i put it in the
front raised position or curl position i

6290
01:43:24,390 --> 01:43:24,400
front raised position or curl position i
 

6291
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,310
front raised position or curl position i
could put it in outward position

6292
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,320
could put it in outward position
 

6293
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,470
could put it in outward position
and the force is almost what it is at

6294
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:28,480
and the force is almost what it is at
 

6295
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,470
and the force is almost what it is at
the at the top but then i get the top

6296
01:43:30,470 --> 01:43:30,480
the at the top but then i get the top
 

6297
01:43:30,480 --> 01:43:32,149
the at the top but then i get the top
and it's the same exact or the curl

6298
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:32,159
and it's the same exact or the curl
 

6299
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:33,910
and it's the same exact or the curl
so i can actually change the force curve

6300
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:33,920
so i can actually change the force curve
 

6301
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,430
so i can actually change the force curve
in the movement and then

6302
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:35,440
in the movement and then
 

6303
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,790
in the movement and then
i can just release the pressure a little

6304
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:36,800
i can just release the pressure a little
 

6305
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:38,229
i can just release the pressure a little
bit and let it swing into position and

6306
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:38,239
bit and let it swing into position and
 

6307
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,830
bit and let it swing into position and
keep doing a drop set with never letting

6308
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:39,840
keep doing a drop set with never letting
 

6309
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:40,390
keep doing a drop set with never letting
it down

6310
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,400
it down
 

6311
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,990
it down
yeah yeah so it's got a really nice

6312
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:42,000
yeah yeah so it's got a really nice
 

6313
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:43,590
yeah yeah so it's got a really nice
textured grip that allows you to hold it

6314
01:43:43,590 --> 01:43:43,600
textured grip that allows you to hold it
 

6315
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:44,870
textured grip that allows you to hold it
in different positions

6316
01:43:44,870 --> 01:43:44,880
in different positions
 

6317
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:46,790
in different positions
and then the load offset is just enough

6318
01:43:46,790 --> 01:43:46,800
and then the load offset is just enough
 

6319
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,470
and then the load offset is just enough
that it doesn't overpower the wrist

6320
01:43:48,470 --> 01:43:48,480
that it doesn't overpower the wrist
 

6321
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,070
that it doesn't overpower the wrist
and then you got different hand sizes so

6322
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:50,080
and then you got different hand sizes so
 

6323
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:51,910
and then you got different hand sizes so
that you can maximize this relationship

6324
01:43:51,910 --> 01:43:51,920
that you can maximize this relationship
 

6325
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:52,550
that you can maximize this relationship
and hit

6326
01:43:52,550 --> 01:43:52,560
and hit
 

6327
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,790
and hit
whatever joint that you're applying that

6328
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:54,800
whatever joint that you're applying that
 

6329
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:55,750
whatever joint that you're applying that
sounds incredible

6330
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:55,760
sounds incredible
 

6331
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,350
sounds incredible
it's really freaking well it's awesome

6332
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:57,360
it's really freaking well it's awesome
 

6333
01:43:57,360 --> 01:43:58,709
it's really freaking well it's awesome
because you can because the variable

6334
01:43:58,709 --> 01:43:58,719
because you can because the variable
 

6335
01:43:58,719 --> 01:43:59,430
because you can because the variable
load

6336
01:43:59,430 --> 01:43:59,440
load
 

6337
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,870
load
now i could go straight from front

6338
01:44:00,870 --> 01:44:00,880
now i could go straight from front
 

6339
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:03,109
now i could go straight from front
raises to side raises or rear or curl

6340
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:03,119
raises to side raises or rear or curl
 

6341
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,709
raises to side raises or rear or curl
because without like because i don't

6342
01:44:04,709 --> 01:44:04,719
because without like because i don't
 

6343
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:06,229
because without like because i don't
have to put it down so now my time under

6344
01:44:06,229 --> 01:44:06,239
have to put it down so now my time under
 

6345
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,109
have to put it down so now my time under
tension

6346
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
tension
 

6347
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:09,189
tension
goes through the roof and by the way the

6348
01:44:09,189 --> 01:44:09,199
goes through the roof and by the way the
 

6349
01:44:09,199 --> 01:44:10,709
goes through the roof and by the way the
same effect with a flywheel trainer

6350
01:44:10,709 --> 01:44:10,719
same effect with a flywheel trainer
 

6351
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:11,910
same effect with a flywheel trainer
because the variable res

6352
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:11,920
because the variable res
 

6353
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:13,109
because the variable res
whatever you put into it is what it

6354
01:44:13,109 --> 01:44:13,119
whatever you put into it is what it
 

6355
01:44:13,119 --> 01:44:15,350
whatever you put into it is what it
kicks back so you have

6356
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:15,360
kicks back so you have
 

6357
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,030
kicks back so you have
an constant time under tension because

6358
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
an constant time under tension because
 

6359
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:18,390
an constant time under tension because
there's no rest points either so all

6360
01:44:18,390 --> 01:44:18,400
there's no rest points either so all
 

6361
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:20,149
there's no rest points either so all
this stuff is working on maximizing time

6362
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:20,159
this stuff is working on maximizing time
 

6363
01:44:20,159 --> 01:44:21,109
this stuff is working on maximizing time
under tension

6364
01:44:21,109 --> 01:44:21,119
under tension
 

6365
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:24,149
under tension
um which anyway it it's that's cool

6366
01:44:24,149 --> 01:44:24,159
um which anyway it it's that's cool
 

6367
01:44:24,159 --> 01:44:24,709
um which anyway it it's that's cool
stuff

6368
01:44:24,709 --> 01:44:24,719
stuff
 

6369
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:28,070
stuff
anyway i get i get excited uh well let

6370
01:44:28,070 --> 01:44:28,080
anyway i get i get excited uh well let
 

6371
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,350
anyway i get i get excited uh well let
me ask you about another thing you've

6372
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:29,360
me ask you about another thing you've
 

6373
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:30,550
me ask you about another thing you've
already mentioned but

6374
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560
already mentioned but
 

6375
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:31,910
already mentioned but
i find this really interesting which is

6376
01:44:31,910 --> 01:44:31,920
i find this really interesting which is
 

6377
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:36,070
i find this really interesting which is
barefoot running and

6378
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:36,080

 

6379
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:39,030

your sort of uh company barefoot

01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:43,600
yeah b-e-a-r and the tagline is
 

6385
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,950
yeah b-e-a-r and the tagline is
optimizing the human

6386

optimizing the human
to ground interface we've talked about

6388
01:44:46,790 --> 01:44:46,800
to ground interface we've talked about
 

6389
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:48,310
to ground interface we've talked about
this a little bit

6390
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:48,320
this a little bit
 

6391
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,430
this a little bit
with uh the power lifting how do you

6392
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:51,440
with uh the power lifting how do you
 

6393
01:44:51,440 --> 01:44:52,709
with uh the power lifting how do you
think about

6394
01:44:52,709 --> 01:44:52,719
think about
 

6395
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:57,669
think about
the the foot ground interface

6396
01:44:57,669 --> 01:44:57,679
the the foot ground interface
 

6397
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,830
the the foot ground interface
it's interesting that we know

6398
01:45:01,830 --> 01:45:01,840
it's interesting that we know
 

6399
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:04,709
it's interesting that we know
that we should train all these parts of

6400
01:45:04,709 --> 01:45:04,719
that we should train all these parts of
 

6401
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:06,709
that we should train all these parts of
our body to be able to be stronger

6402
01:45:06,709 --> 01:45:06,719
our body to be able to be stronger
 

6403
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:10,229
our body to be able to be stronger
be more resilient like

6404
01:45:10,229 --> 01:45:10,239
be more resilient like
 

6405
01:45:10,239 --> 01:45:13,830
be more resilient like
but we think that the foot is different

6406
01:45:13,830 --> 01:45:13,840
but we think that the foot is different
 

6407
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:15,910
but we think that the foot is different
that we need to package it and modify it

6408
01:45:15,910 --> 01:45:15,920
that we need to package it and modify it
 

6409
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,590
that we need to package it and modify it
and somehow that that's the science of

6410
01:45:17,590 --> 01:45:17,600
and somehow that that's the science of
 

6411
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:18,550
and somehow that that's the science of
making

6412
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
making
 

6413
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,910

you know it healthy where i challenge

6414
01:45:21,910 --> 01:45:21,920
you know it healthy where i challenge

01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:22,310
you know it healthy where i challenge
people

6416
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
people
 

6417
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,470
people
think about that like first thing you do

6418
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
think about that like first thing you do
 

6419
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,910
think about that like first thing you do
in the morning is

6420
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:25,920
in the morning is
 

6421
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:26,950
in the morning is
roll out of bed and put your

6422
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:26,960
roll out of bed and put your
 

6423
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:28,390
roll out of bed and put your
weightlifting belt on and wrap it on

6424
01:45:28,390 --> 01:45:28,400
weightlifting belt on and wrap it on
 

6425
01:45:28,400 --> 01:45:30,070
weightlifting belt on and wrap it on
tight and wear it till you go to bed at

6426
01:45:30,070 --> 01:45:30,080
tight and wear it till you go to bed at
 

6427
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:30,870
tight and wear it till you go to bed at
night

6428
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:30,880
night
 

6429
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,950
night
do it with your shoulders your knees

6430
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:32,960
do it with your shoulders your knees
 

6431
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,870
do it with your shoulders your knees
wake up and put some knee wraps on

6432
01:45:34,870 --> 01:45:34,880
wake up and put some knee wraps on
 

6433

some elections and spinal stabilization
so

6754
01:50:33,270 --> 01:50:33,280
so
 

6755
01:50:33,280 --> 01:50:35,430
so
the raised heel and toe will make you

6756
01:50:35,430 --> 01:50:35,440
the raised heel and toe will make you
 

6757
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,950
the raised heel and toe will make you
stride further

6758
01:50:36,950 --> 01:50:36,960
stride further
 

6759
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,189
stride further
because of just how it operates but that

6760
01:50:39,189 --> 01:50:39,199
because of just how it operates but that
 

6761
01:50:39,199 --> 01:50:40,310
because of just how it operates but that
over stride

6762
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,320
over stride
 

6763
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:43,669
over stride
is a result of opening this so we opened

6764
01:50:43,669 --> 01:50:43,679
is a result of opening this so we opened
 

6765
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:44,950
is a result of opening this so we opened
the pelvis and diaphragm did we talk

6766
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:44,960
the pelvis and diaphragm did we talk
 

6767
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:46,229
the pelvis and diaphragm did we talk
about that and the impact that that has

6768
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:46,239
about that and the impact that that has
 

6769
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:47,750
about that and the impact that that has
for controlling in spine yeah i think we

6770
01:50:47,750 --> 01:50:47,760
for controlling in spine yeah i think we
 

6771
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:48,870
for controlling in spine yeah i think we
touched on that yeah

6772
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:48,880
touched on that yeah
 

6773
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:52,070
touched on that yeah
um but it it's all this stuff plays

6774
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:52,080
um but it it's all this stuff plays
 

6775
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:53,990
um but it it's all this stuff plays
together so the gate affects that and so

6776
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
together so the gate affects that and so
 

6777
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,669
together so the gate affects that and so
the shoe affects the gate and then

6778
01:50:55,669 --> 01:50:55,679
the shoe affects the gate and then
 

6779
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:57,910
the shoe affects the gate and then
so it's all connected all connected let

6780
01:50:57,910 --> 01:50:57,920
so it's all connected all connected let
 

6781
01:50:57,920 --> 01:50:59,750
so it's all connected all connected let
me be very

6782
01:50:59,750 --> 01:50:59,760
me be very
 

6783
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,350
me be very
purposeful with some conversation here

6784
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:01,360
purposeful with some conversation here
 

6785
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:03,589
purposeful with some conversation here
though we've talked about periodization

6786
01:51:03,589 --> 01:51:03,599
though we've talked about periodization
 

6787
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:06,070
though we've talked about periodization
this was a big gap so people go yeah

6788
01:51:06,070 --> 01:51:06,080
this was a big gap so people go yeah
 

6789
01:51:06,080 --> 01:51:07,589
this was a big gap so people go yeah
well when people started running with

6790
01:51:07,589 --> 01:51:07,599
well when people started running with
 

6791
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:09,109
well when people started running with
those they started having injuries

6792
01:51:09,109 --> 01:51:09,119
those they started having injuries
 

6793
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:11,669
those they started having injuries
back when the finger company produced

6794
01:51:11,669 --> 01:51:11,679
back when the finger company produced
 

6795
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,270
back when the finger company produced
those and didn't do the education around

6796
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:13,280
those and didn't do the education around
 

6797
01:51:13,280 --> 01:51:14,709
those and didn't do the education around
this very simple concept

6798
01:51:14,709 --> 01:51:14,719
this very simple concept
 

6799
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:15,990
this very simple concept
you do not walk into the gym if you

6800
01:51:15,990 --> 01:51:16,000
you do not walk into the gym if you
 

6801
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,990
you do not walk into the gym if you
haven't squatted and start squatting 225

6802
01:51:17,990 --> 01:51:18,000
haven't squatted and start squatting 225
 

6803
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:18,390
haven't squatted and start squatting 225
from

6804
01:51:18,390 --> 01:51:18,400
from
 

6805
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,790
from
for max rex every week day or every day

6806
01:51:20,790 --> 01:51:20,800
for max rex every week day or every day
 

6807
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:21,510
for max rex every week day or every day
over day

6808
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:21,520
over day
 

6809
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:23,589
over day
yeah and that's what people did because

6810
01:51:23,589 --> 01:51:23,599
yeah and that's what people did because
 

6811
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:25,669
yeah and that's what people did because
they did weren't told that

6812
01:51:25,669 --> 01:51:25,679
they did weren't told that
 

6813
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:27,830
they did weren't told that
you need to build the capacity to do

6814
01:51:27,830 --> 01:51:27,840
you need to build the capacity to do
 

6815
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:29,030
you need to build the capacity to do
this

6816
01:51:29,030 --> 01:51:29,040
this
 

6817
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,189
this
you go wear these and walk around in

6818
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:31,199
you go wear these and walk around in
 

6819

you go wear these and walk around in
your office or wherever all day long

be sore

6824
01:51:36,790 --> 01:51:36,800

 

6825
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:40,310

do it for 10 of your time yeah

6826
01:51:40,310 --> 01:51:40,320
do it for 10 of your time yeah
 

6827
01:51:40,320 --> 01:51:42,870
do it for 10 of your time yeah
do that for a month then add some that

6828
01:51:42,870 --> 01:51:42,880
do that for a month then add some that
 

6829
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:44,390
do that for a month then add some that
will build the capacity

6830
01:51:44,390 --> 01:51:44,400
will build the capacity
 

6831
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,669
will build the capacity
to do this and then that's going to

6832
01:51:45,669 --> 01:51:45,679
to do this and then that's going to
 

6833
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:47,589
to do this and then that's going to
start having the ability to strengthen

6834
01:51:47,589 --> 01:51:47,599
start having the ability to strengthen
 

6835
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:48,790
start having the ability to strengthen
manage the foot there's a whole lot of

6836

manage the foot there's a whole lot of
 

6837
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:50,470

because it is so
simple and it has such a profound impact

01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:01,360
simple and it has such a profound impact
 

6851
01:52:01,360 --> 01:52:02,709
simple and it has such a profound impact
yeah it does i

6852
01:52:02,709 --> 01:52:02,719
yeah it does i
 

6853

you're spending some time without the

6858
01:52:08,070 --> 01:52:08,080
you're spending some time without the
 

6859
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,629
you're spending some time without the
last shoes on

6860
01:52:10,629 --> 01:52:10,639
last shoes on
 

6861
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:13,350
last shoes on
uh well what i did um i think it's

6862
01:52:13,350 --> 01:52:13,360
uh well what i did um i think it's
 

6863
01:52:13,360 --> 01:52:14,709
uh well what i did um i think it's
already now two years ago when i was

6864
01:52:14,709 --> 01:52:14,719
already now two years ago when i was
 

6865
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:16,790
already now two years ago when i was
doing a lot of running i do like a 10

6866
01:52:16,790 --> 01:52:16,800
doing a lot of running i do like a 10
 

6867
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,910
doing a lot of running i do like a 10
mile run

6868
01:52:17,910 --> 01:52:17,920
mile run
 

6869
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:19,830
mile run
i would take my shoes off for the last

6870
01:52:19,830 --> 01:52:19,840
i would take my shoes off for the last
 

6871
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:22,070
i would take my shoes off for the last
like half mile and i run like that

6872
01:52:22,070 --> 01:52:22,080
like half mile and i run like that
 

6873
01:52:22,080 --> 01:52:24,790
like half mile and i run like that
and that was for me really helpful to

6874
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:24,800
and that was for me really helpful to
 

6875
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:26,950
and that was for me really helpful to
ensure that i have proper form

6876
01:52:26,950 --> 01:52:26,960
ensure that i have proper form
 

6877
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:29,189
ensure that i have proper form
form that minimizes pain on the way i

6878
01:52:29,189 --> 01:52:29,199
form that minimizes pain on the way i
 

6879
01:52:29,199 --> 01:52:30,950
form that minimizes pain on the way i
run i still like shoes

6880
01:52:30,950 --> 01:52:30,960
run i still like shoes
 

6881
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:32,310
run i still like shoes
i benefit a lot from shoes the

6882
01:52:32,310 --> 01:52:32,320
i benefit a lot from shoes the
 

6883
01:52:32,320 --> 01:52:34,390
i benefit a lot from shoes the
protection they provide but

6884
01:52:34,390 --> 01:52:34,400
protection they provide but
 

6885
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:37,430
protection they provide but
it's for running um we're referring to

6886
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:37,440
it's for running um we're referring to
 

6887
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:40,629
it's for running um we're referring to
especially trail lining and so on and in

6888
01:52:40,629 --> 01:52:40,639
especially trail lining and so on and in
 

6889
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:41,830
especially trail lining and so on and in
the city when there's glass and all

6890
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:41,840
the city when there's glass and all
 

6891
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:43,350
the city when there's glass and all
those kinds of things

6892
01:52:43,350 --> 01:52:43,360
those kinds of things
 

6893
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:44,950
those kinds of things
but it's really important to have

6894
01:52:44,950 --> 01:52:44,960
but it's really important to have
 

6895
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,870
but it's really important to have
minimal sort of protection on your feet

6896
01:52:46,870 --> 01:52:46,880
minimal sort of protection on your feet
 

6897
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:50,470
minimal sort of protection on your feet
for me at least it was to figure out

6898
01:52:50,470 --> 01:52:50,480
for me at least it was to figure out
 

6899
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:53,669
for me at least it was to figure out
the ways that my form basic movement

6900
01:52:53,669 --> 01:52:53,679
the ways that my form basic movement
 

6901
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,070
the ways that my form basic movement
and like the positioning in the foot the

6902
01:52:56,070 --> 01:52:56,080
and like the positioning in the foot the
 

6903
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,510
and like the positioning in the foot the
impact of the foot

6904
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:57,520
impact of the foot
 

6905
01:52:57,520 --> 01:52:59,750
impact of the foot
and everything you know the the the

6906
01:52:59,750 --> 01:52:59,760
and everything you know the the the
 

6907
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:01,109
and everything you know the the the
lower leg

6908
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:01,119
lower leg
 

6909
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:03,589
lower leg
the entirety of the torso really how

6910
01:53:03,589 --> 01:53:03,599
the entirety of the torso really how
 

6911
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:06,229
the entirety of the torso really how
it's improperly positioned

6912
01:53:06,229 --> 01:53:06,239

have from a performance aspect
carbohydrates necessarily because the

6968
01:54:01,270 --> 01:54:01,280
carbohydrates necessarily because the
 

6969
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:02,790
carbohydrates necessarily because the
other ones can convert into injury

for a performance athlete carbohydrates
 

6975
01:54:06,080 --> 01:54:08,470
for a performance athlete carbohydrates
can be very beneficial

6976
01:54:08,470 --> 01:54:08,480
can be very beneficial
 

6977
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:12,470
can be very beneficial
as well so so i look at it as

6978
01:54:12,470 --> 01:54:12,480
as well so so i look at it as
 

6979
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,550
as well so so i look at it as
you want you need a base level fats you

6980
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:14,560
you want you need a base level fats you
 

6981
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:16,390
you want you need a base level fats you
need a base level of proteins and then

6982
01:54:16,390 --> 01:54:16,400
need a base level of proteins and then
 

6983
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:17,189
need a base level of proteins and then
you adjust

6984
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:17,199
you adjust
 

6985
01:54:17,199 --> 01:54:19,109
you adjust
the carbohydrate intake based on the

6986
01:54:19,109 --> 01:54:19,119
the carbohydrate intake based on the
 

6987

6989
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,830
needs i'm not anti-carbohydrate by any
means

6990
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:23,840
means
 

6991
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:25,030
means
because a lot of people will they look

6992
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:25,040
because a lot of people will they look
 

6993
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:26,629
because a lot of people will they look
at me now when they see like how lean i

6994
01:54:26,629 --> 01:54:26,639
at me now when they see like how lean i
 

6995
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:27,750
at me now when they see like how lean i
am and they are they jump to a

conclusion you must be keto you must be

6998
01:54:29,510 --> 01:54:29,520
conclusion you must be keto you must be
 

6999

they're like what's your fasting window

7012
01:54:44,629 --> 01:54:44,639
they're like what's your fasting window
 

7013
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:47,430
they're like what's your fasting window
if i'm if i'm doing fasting it's just

7014
01:54:47,430 --> 01:54:47,440
if i'm if i'm doing fasting it's just
 

7015
01:54:47,440 --> 01:54:49,430
if i'm if i'm doing fasting it's just
because it works with my

7016
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
because it works with my
 

7017
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:50,950
because it works with my
my environment sometimes i do it

7018
01:54:50,950 --> 01:54:50,960
my environment sometimes i do it
 

7019
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,629
my environment sometimes i do it
sometimes i don't

7020
01:54:52,629 --> 01:54:52,639
sometimes i don't
 

7021
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:54,470
sometimes i don't
all that does is control how much

7022
01:54:54,470 --> 01:54:54,480
all that does is control how much
 

7023
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:55,910
all that does is control how much
calories that you take

7024

big success with keto and carnivore

7026
01:54:57,669 --> 01:54:57,679
big success with keto and carnivore
 

7027
01:54:57,679 --> 01:54:59,750
big success with keto and carnivore
diets it's hard to eat a lot

7028
01:54:59,750 --> 01:54:59,760
diets it's hard to eat a lot
 

7029
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:02,149
diets it's hard to eat a lot
uh and and put on weight with those with

7030
01:55:02,149 --> 01:55:02,159
uh and and put on weight with those with
 

7031
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:03,350
uh and and put on weight with those with
those diets

7032
01:55:03,350 --> 01:55:03,360
those diets
 

7033
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:05,589
those diets
um you know protein actually has a

7034
01:55:05,589 --> 01:55:05,599
um you know protein actually has a
 

7035
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:06,870
um you know protein actually has a
thermogenic effect

7036
01:55:06,870 --> 01:55:06,880
thermogenic effect
 

7037
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,109
thermogenic effect
and so you have to have a massive amount

7038
01:55:09,109 --> 01:55:09,119
and so you have to have a massive amount
 

7039
01:55:09,119 --> 01:55:10,550
and so you have to have a massive amount
of fats if you have a

7040
01:55:10,550 --> 01:55:10,560
of fats if you have a
 

7041
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:12,629
of fats if you have a
only meat diet because you can literally

7042
01:55:12,629 --> 01:55:12,639
only meat diet because you can literally
 

7043
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:13,669
only meat diet because you can literally
starve to death

7044
01:55:13,669 --> 01:55:13,679
starve to death
 

7045
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:16,229

7467
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:41,910
everybody eats bread well not everyone
and so it's a little hard to test

7468
02:02:41,910 --> 02:02:41,920
and so it's a little hard to test
 

7469
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:45,030
and so it's a little hard to test
for no matter what you do at any level

for no matter what you do at any level
 

7471
02:02:45,040 --> 02:02:46,870
for no matter what you do at any level
so that's an extreme example

7472
02:02:46,870 --> 02:02:46,880
so that's an extreme example
 

7473
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:49,589
so that's an extreme example
but other examples um you're drinking a

7474
02:02:49,589 --> 02:02:49,599
but other examples um you're drinking a
 

7475
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:50,870
but other examples um you're drinking a
an energy drink in that

in canada that's too dangerous you can
 

7485
02:03:00,159 --> 02:03:01,910
in canada that's too dangerous you can

but you could work around these things
 

7527
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:46,470
but you could work around these things
with nutritional ways or other ways

7528

with nutritional ways or other ways
 

7529
02:03:46,480 --> 02:03:47,990
with nutritional ways or other ways
versus taking a chemical structure and

versus taking a chemical structure and
 

7531
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,510

there's a whole lot of ways to do this

02:03:49,510 --> 02:03:49,520
there's a whole lot of ways to do this
 

7533
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:49,910
there's a whole lot of ways to do this
but

7534
02:03:49,910 --> 02:03:49,920
but
 

7535
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:51,350

you need to define it for yourself
 

7547
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:01,910
you need to define it for yourself
unless you're competing in an

7714
02:06:43,109 --> 02:06:43,119
lines are
 

7715
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:45,030
lines are
so now when it comes to strength here's

7716
02:06:45,030 --> 02:06:45,040
so now when it comes to strength here's
 

7717
02:06:45,040 --> 02:06:47,189
so now when it comes to strength here's
an interesting thing in powerlifting

7718
02:06:47,189 --> 02:06:47,199
an interesting thing in powerlifting
 

7719
02:06:47,199 --> 02:06:48,790
an interesting thing in powerlifting
there's tested federations and

7720
02:06:48,790 --> 02:06:48,800
there's tested federations and
 

7721
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:50,390
there's tested federations and
non-tested federations so we can

7722
02:06:50,390 --> 02:06:50,400
non-tested federations so we can
 

7723
02:06:50,400 --> 02:06:52,310
non-tested federations so we can
literally look at the statistical data

7724
02:06:52,310 --> 02:06:52,320
literally look at the statistical data
 

7725
02:06:52,320 --> 02:06:55,270
literally look at the statistical data
and actually find out what do steroids

7726
02:06:55,270 --> 02:06:55,280
and actually find out what do steroids
 

7727
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:56,310
and actually find out what do steroids
do

7728
02:06:56,310 --> 02:06:56,320
do
 

7729
02:06:56,320 --> 02:06:58,470
do
and so it's pretty clear that steroids

7730
02:06:58,470 --> 02:06:58,480
and so it's pretty clear that steroids
 

7731
02:06:58,480 --> 02:07:00,310
and so it's pretty clear that steroids
provide about a ten percent

7732
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:00,320
provide about a ten percent
 

7733
02:07:00,320 --> 02:07:03,750
provide about a ten percent
increase in strength on average over

7734
02:07:03,750 --> 02:07:03,760
increase in strength on average over
 

7735
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:06,149
increase in strength on average over
not now that does take out the fact that

7736
02:07:06,149 --> 02:07:06,159
not now that does take out the fact that
 

7737
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:07,430
not now that does take out the fact that
steroids will put you in

7738
02:07:07,430 --> 02:07:07,440
steroids will put you in
 

7739
02:07:07,440 --> 02:07:09,430
steroids will put you in
uh allow you to put on more mass so

7740
02:07:09,430 --> 02:07:09,440
uh allow you to put on more mass so
 

7741
02:07:09,440 --> 02:07:11,270
uh allow you to put on more mass so
you'll go up a weight class

7742
02:07:11,270 --> 02:07:11,280
you'll go up a weight class
 

7743
02:07:11,280 --> 02:07:13,830
you'll go up a weight class
a lot of times so as a whole you could

7744
02:07:13,830 --> 02:07:13,840
a lot of times so as a whole you could
 

7745
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:15,030
a lot of times so as a whole you could
definitely lift

7746
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:15,040
definitely lift
 

7747
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:18,470
definitely lift
more probably than the 10 over time

7748
02:07:18,470 --> 02:07:18,480
more probably than the 10 over time
 

7749
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,629
more probably than the 10 over time
right and then we think about steroids

7750
02:07:20,629 --> 02:07:20,639
right and then we think about steroids
 

7751
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:23,030
right and then we think about steroids
as the ability to just put on muscle

7752
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:23,040
as the ability to just put on muscle
 

7753
02:07:23,040 --> 02:07:25,030
as the ability to just put on muscle
and here's where things get a little

7754
02:07:25,030 --> 02:07:25,040
and here's where things get a little
 

7755
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:26,550
and here's where things get a little
interesting even with people that use

7756
02:07:26,550 --> 02:07:26,560
interesting even with people that use
 

7757
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:28,149
interesting even with people that use
steroids is not understanding the

7758
02:07:28,149 --> 02:07:28,159
steroids is not understanding the
 

7759
02:07:28,159 --> 02:07:29,510
steroids is not understanding the
neurological impacts

7760
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
neurological impacts
 

7761
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:31,669
neurological impacts
that steroids have because you could

7762
02:07:31,669 --> 02:07:31,679
that steroids have because you could
 

7763
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:32,950
that steroids have because you could
take some steroids

7764
02:07:32,950 --> 02:07:32,960
take some steroids
 

7765
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:36,629
take some steroids
right now and be stronger in 10 minutes

7766
02:07:36,629 --> 02:07:36,639
right now and be stronger in 10 minutes
 

7767
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:38,870
right now and be stronger in 10 minutes
that's clearly not done anything you

7768
02:07:38,870 --> 02:07:38,880
that's clearly not done anything you
 

7769
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:40,069
that's clearly not done anything you
know from a physiology

7770
02:07:40,069 --> 02:07:40,079
know from a physiology
 

7771
02:07:40,079 --> 02:07:42,310
know from a physiology
standpoint to make you stronger but we

7772
02:07:42,310 --> 02:07:42,320
standpoint to make you stronger but we
 

7773
02:07:42,320 --> 02:07:43,510
standpoint to make you stronger but we
have a tapped in

7774
02:07:43,510 --> 02:07:43,520
have a tapped in
 

7775
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:46,790
have a tapped in
neurologically to to elicit those gains

7776
02:07:46,790 --> 02:07:46,800
neurologically to to elicit those gains
 

7777
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,390
neurologically to to elicit those gains
and there's a whole lot that happens

7778
02:07:48,390 --> 02:07:48,400
and there's a whole lot that happens
 

7779
02:07:48,400 --> 02:07:51,910
and there's a whole lot that happens
neurologically like how much science

7780
02:07:51,910 --> 02:07:51,920
neurologically like how much science
 

7781
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:54,709
neurologically like how much science
is there in terms of all the different

7782
02:07:54,709 --> 02:07:54,719
is there in terms of all the different
 

7783
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:56,149
is there in terms of all the different
ways you could take steroids

7784
02:07:56,149 --> 02:07:56,159
ways you could take steroids
 

7785
02:07:56,159 --> 02:07:58,709
ways you could take steroids
which kinds of steroids the timing the

7786
02:07:58,709 --> 02:07:58,719
which kinds of steroids the timing the
 

7787
02:07:58,719 --> 02:07:59,830
which kinds of steroids the timing the
the dose

7788
02:07:59,830 --> 02:07:59,840
the dose
 

7789
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:02,069
the dose
the all of those things to develop the

7790
02:08:02,069 --> 02:08:02,079
the all of those things to develop the
 

7791
02:08:02,079 --> 02:08:03,589
the all of those things to develop the
the neurological the physical the

7792
02:08:03,589 --> 02:08:03,599
the neurological the physical the
 

7793
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:04,790
the neurological the physical the
skeleton like all

7794
02:08:04,790 --> 02:08:04,800
skeleton like all
 

7795
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:07,270
skeleton like all
all the you know you've talked with such

7796
02:08:07,270 --> 02:08:07,280
all the you know you've talked with such
 

7797
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,109
all the you know you've talked with such
depth about the science

7798
02:08:09,109 --> 02:08:09,119
depth about the science
 

7799
02:08:09,119 --> 02:08:12,470
depth about the science
of strength building in terms of

7800
02:08:12,470 --> 02:08:12,480
of strength building in terms of
 

7801
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:15,589
of strength building in terms of
form uh in terms of the equipment that

7802
02:08:15,589 --> 02:08:15,599
form uh in terms of the equipment that
 

7803
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:16,149
form uh in terms of the equipment that
you use

7804
02:08:16,149 --> 02:08:16,159
you use
 

7805
02:08:16,159 --> 02:08:19,430
you use
it seems like a component

7806
02:08:19,430 --> 02:08:19,440
it seems like a component
 

7807
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,830
it seems like a component
you know the use of steroids should be

7808
02:08:21,830 --> 02:08:21,840
you know the use of steroids should be
 

7809
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:23,270
you know the use of steroids should be
an equal

7810
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:23,280
an equal
 

7811
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:25,189
an equal
level of scientific rigor when applying

7812
02:08:25,189 --> 02:08:25,199
level of scientific rigor when applying
 

7813
02:08:25,199 --> 02:08:26,470
level of scientific rigor when applying
them it is

7814
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
them it is
 

7815
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:29,510
them it is
now the research is harder to to get

7816
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:29,520
now the research is harder to to get
 

7817
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:32,790
now the research is harder to to get
because of what it is um but there is a

7818
02:08:32,790 --> 02:08:32,800
because of what it is um but there is a
 

7819
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:33,910
because of what it is um but there is a
lot of research

7820
02:08:33,910 --> 02:08:33,920
lot of research
 

7821
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:36,310
lot of research
that was done when they were legal so

7822
02:08:36,310 --> 02:08:36,320
that was done when they were legal so
 

7823
02:08:36,320 --> 02:08:37,270
that was done when they were legal so
they were legal up in

7824
02:08:37,270 --> 02:08:37,280
they were legal up in
 

7825
02:08:37,280 --> 02:08:38,950
they were legal up in
through the uh through i think the mid

7826
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:38,960
through the uh through i think the mid
 

7827
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:40,709
through the uh through i think the mid
80s and so

7828
02:08:40,709 --> 02:08:40,719
80s and so
 

7829
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:44,390
80s and so
a lot of the classical um high

7830
02:08:44,390 --> 02:08:44,400
a lot of the classical um high
 

7831
02:08:44,400 --> 02:08:47,589
a lot of the classical um high
high benefit to low risk steroids were

7832
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
high benefit to low risk steroids were
 

7833
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:48,470
high benefit to low risk steroids were
studied

7834
02:08:48,470 --> 02:08:48,480
studied
 

7835
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,069
studied
and then since then there's a lot of

7836
02:08:50,069 --> 02:08:50,079
and then since then there's a lot of
 

7837
02:08:50,079 --> 02:08:52,069
and then since then there's a lot of
like designer steroids or new steroids

7838
02:08:52,069 --> 02:08:52,079
like designer steroids or new steroids
 

7839
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:53,270
like designer steroids or new steroids
that have come up that

7840
02:08:53,270 --> 02:08:53,280
that have come up that
 

7841
02:08:53,280 --> 02:08:56,149
that have come up that
don't have a lot of research around

7842
02:08:56,149 --> 02:08:56,159
don't have a lot of research around
 

7843
02:08:56,159 --> 02:08:56,790
don't have a lot of research around
safety

7844
02:08:56,790 --> 02:08:56,800
safety
 

7845
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,390
safety
and risk and things of that nature and

7846
02:08:58,390 --> 02:08:58,400
and risk and things of that nature and
 

7847
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:00,470
and risk and things of that nature and
we can't do that because it's

7848
02:09:00,470 --> 02:09:00,480
we can't do that because it's
 

7849
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:02,629
we can't do that because it's
you know because of the legality around

7850
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:02,639
you know because of the legality around
 

7851
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:04,149
you know because of the legality around
these things

7852
02:09:04,149 --> 02:09:04,159
these things
 

7853
02:09:04,159 --> 02:09:05,270
these things
but some of the stuff on the

7854
02:09:05,270 --> 02:09:05,280
but some of the stuff on the
 

7855
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,589
but some of the stuff on the
neurological function is really

7856
02:09:07,589 --> 02:09:07,599
neurological function is really
 

7857
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:09,669
neurological function is really
just understanding how that chemical

7858
02:09:09,669 --> 02:09:09,679
just understanding how that chemical
 

7859
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:10,870
just understanding how that chemical
structure uh

7860
02:09:10,870 --> 02:09:10,880
structure uh
 

7861
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:13,589
structure uh
works and what it's doing to the

7862
02:09:13,589 --> 02:09:13,599
works and what it's doing to the
 

7863
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:16,870
works and what it's doing to the
neurotransmitters what it's doing

7864
02:09:16,870 --> 02:09:16,880
neurotransmitters what it's doing
 

7865
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:20,390
neurotransmitters what it's doing
and so some of it is is really talking

7866
02:09:20,390 --> 02:09:20,400
and so some of it is is really talking
 

7867
02:09:20,400 --> 02:09:22,629
and so some of it is is really talking
to people that have experience with it

7868
02:09:22,629 --> 02:09:22,639
to people that have experience with it
 

7869
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:23,589
to people that have experience with it
um

7870
02:09:23,589 --> 02:09:23,599
um
 

7871
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:25,189
um
and the other is understanding those

7872
02:09:25,189 --> 02:09:25,199
and the other is understanding those
 

7873
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:26,870
and the other is understanding those
structures and what they do

7874
02:09:26,870 --> 02:09:26,880
structures and what they do
 

7875
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:29,430
structures and what they do
the neurological component i think is

7876
02:09:29,430 --> 02:09:29,440
the neurological component i think is
 

7877
02:09:29,440 --> 02:09:31,430
the neurological component i think is
more interesting than

7878
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:31,440
more interesting than
 

7879
02:09:31,440 --> 02:09:34,629
more interesting than
than most because the most steroids act

7880
02:09:34,629 --> 02:09:34,639
than most because the most steroids act
 

7881
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:36,310
than most because the most steroids act
through increasing muscle protein

7882
02:09:36,310 --> 02:09:36,320
through increasing muscle protein
 

7883
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:38,629
through increasing muscle protein
synthesis that's how you add more muscle

7884
02:09:38,629 --> 02:09:38,639
synthesis that's how you add more muscle
 

7885
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:41,589
synthesis that's how you add more muscle
is they have an anti-catabolic effect

7886
02:09:41,589 --> 02:09:41,599
is they have an anti-catabolic effect
 

7887
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:43,910
is they have an anti-catabolic effect
and they have a muscle protein synthesis

7888
02:09:43,910 --> 02:09:43,920
and they have a muscle protein synthesis
 

7889
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:46,470
and they have a muscle protein synthesis
enhancing effect so it reduces the

7890
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:46,480
enhancing effect so it reduces the
 

7891
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,149
enhancing effect so it reduces the
amount of muscle that you waste and

7892
02:09:48,149 --> 02:09:48,159
amount of muscle that you waste and
 

7893
02:09:48,159 --> 02:09:49,589
amount of muscle that you waste and
increases the amount of muscle that you

7894
02:09:49,589 --> 02:09:49,599
increases the amount of muscle that you
 

7895
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:51,270
increases the amount of muscle that you
put on

7896
02:09:51,270 --> 02:09:51,280
put on
 

7897
02:09:51,280 --> 02:09:54,629
put on
but the neurological component

7898
02:09:54,629 --> 02:09:54,639
but the neurological component
 

7899
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:57,750
but the neurological component
is is tremendously valuable for what it

7900
02:09:57,750 --> 02:09:57,760
is is tremendously valuable for what it
 

7901
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,229
is is tremendously valuable for what it
can do

7902
02:09:58,229 --> 02:09:58,239
can do
 

7903
02:09:58,239 --> 02:10:00,950
can do
for your training workout like if i

7904
02:10:00,950 --> 02:10:00,960
for your training workout like if i
 

7905
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:02,629
for your training workout like if i
handle more load over time

7906
02:10:02,629 --> 02:10:02,639
handle more load over time
 

7907
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:05,109
handle more load over time
i'm going to make more progress if i can

7908
02:10:05,109 --> 02:10:05,119
i'm going to make more progress if i can
 

7909
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:06,310
i'm going to make more progress if i can
actually just stimulate more

7910
02:10:06,310 --> 02:10:06,320
actually just stimulate more
 

7911
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:08,069
actually just stimulate more
neurological effects for a specific

7912
02:10:08,069 --> 02:10:08,079
neurological effects for a specific
 

7913
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:08,629
neurological effects for a specific
event

7914
02:10:08,629 --> 02:10:08,639
event
 

7915
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:11,669
event
it's going to have an impact right but

7916
02:10:11,669 --> 02:10:11,679
it's going to have an impact right but
 

7917
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:13,430
it's going to have an impact right but
there's other ways that you can tap into

7918
02:10:13,430 --> 02:10:13,440
there's other ways that you can tap into
 

7919
02:10:13,440 --> 02:10:14,229
there's other ways that you can tap into
this too

7920
02:10:14,229 --> 02:10:14,239
this too
 

7921
02:10:14,239 --> 02:10:15,990
this too
things that you can tap into mentally

7922
02:10:15,990 --> 02:10:16,000
things that you can tap into mentally
 

7923
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,910
things that you can tap into mentally
with great practice with meditation and

7924
02:10:17,910 --> 02:10:17,920
with great practice with meditation and
 

7925
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:18,790
with great practice with meditation and
other stuff that

7926
02:10:18,790 --> 02:10:18,800
other stuff that
 

7927
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:21,750
other stuff that
will have the same effect people

7928
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:21,760
will have the same effect people
 

7929
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:22,870
will have the same effect people
probably think i'm over speaking

7930
02:10:22,870 --> 02:10:22,880
probably think i'm over speaking
 

7931
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:23,510
probably think i'm over speaking
especially

7932
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:23,520
especially
 

7933
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:25,750
especially
steroid users that are listening to this

7934
02:10:25,750 --> 02:10:25,760
steroid users that are listening to this
 

7935
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:27,589
steroid users that are listening to this
at least i'm talking out my ass

7936
02:10:27,589 --> 02:10:27,599
at least i'm talking out my ass
 

7937
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:31,589
at least i'm talking out my ass
but i'm not because i i

7938
02:10:31,589 --> 02:10:31,599
but i'm not because i i
 

7939
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:34,229
but i'm not because i i
i have experience with this stuff on

7940
02:10:34,229 --> 02:10:34,239
i have experience with this stuff on
 

7941
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:35,830
i have experience with this stuff on
both ends and some of those areas a lot

7942
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:35,840
both ends and some of those areas a lot
 

7943
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,350
both ends and some of those areas a lot
of people don't have

7944
02:10:37,350 --> 02:10:37,360
of people don't have
 

7945
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:39,990
of people don't have
the experience with that what i've kind

7946
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:40,000
the experience with that what i've kind
 

7947
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:40,550
the experience with that what i've kind
of

7948
02:10:40,550 --> 02:10:40,560
of
 

7949
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:43,510
of
heard from people is the the confidence

7950
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:43,520
heard from people is the the confidence
 

7951
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:46,390
heard from people is the the confidence
that comes with steroids it feels like

7952
02:10:46,390 --> 02:10:46,400
that comes with steroids it feels like
 

7953
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,790
that comes with steroids it feels like
not to call it placebo but it seems like

7954
02:10:48,790 --> 02:10:48,800
not to call it placebo but it seems like
 

7955
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,790
not to call it placebo but it seems like
the psychological benefits of steroids

7956
02:10:50,790 --> 02:10:50,800
the psychological benefits of steroids
 

7957
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,669
the psychological benefits of steroids
is huge

7958
02:10:51,669 --> 02:10:51,679
is huge
 

7959
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:54,790
is huge
and that you feel like uh there's a

7960
02:10:54,790 --> 02:10:54,800
and that you feel like uh there's a
 

7961
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:55,669
and that you feel like uh there's a
confidence

7962
02:10:55,669 --> 02:10:55,679
confidence
 

7963
02:10:55,679 --> 02:10:57,990
confidence
that seems to be uh coupled with the

7964
02:10:57,990 --> 02:10:58,000
that seems to be uh coupled with the
 

7965
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:00,390
that seems to be uh coupled with the
actual biological and chemical effects

7966
02:11:00,390 --> 02:11:00,400
actual biological and chemical effects
 

7967
02:11:00,400 --> 02:11:02,069
actual biological and chemical effects
i have a actually a neurological

7968
02:11:02,069 --> 02:11:02,079
i have a actually a neurological
 

7969
02:11:02,079 --> 02:11:04,229
i have a actually a neurological
condition um so i actually don't

7970
02:11:04,229 --> 02:11:04,239
condition um so i actually don't
 

7971
02:11:04,239 --> 02:11:05,830
condition um so i actually don't
feel a lot of that stuff that people

7972
02:11:05,830 --> 02:11:05,840
feel a lot of that stuff that people
 

7973
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:07,030
feel a lot of that stuff that people
because there's certain steroids that

7974
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:07,040
because there's certain steroids that
 

7975
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,910
because there's certain steroids that
like people will like

7976
02:11:09,910 --> 02:11:09,920

 

7977
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:13,030

you're like very extreme ones um

7978
02:11:13,030 --> 02:11:13,040
you're like very extreme ones um
 

7979
02:11:13,040 --> 02:11:14,229
you're like very extreme ones um
like that would make somebody bite

7980
02:11:14,229 --> 02:11:14,239
like that would make somebody bite
 

7981
02:11:14,239 --> 02:11:16,149
like that would make somebody bite
someone's ear off in a fight for example

7982
02:11:16,149 --> 02:11:16,159
someone's ear off in a fight for example
 

7983
02:11:16,159 --> 02:11:16,629
someone's ear off in a fight for example
yeah

7984
02:11:16,629 --> 02:11:16,639
yeah
 

7985
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:19,990
yeah
um aggression that and

7986
02:11:19,990 --> 02:11:20,000
um aggression that and
 

7987
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:21,510
um aggression that and
they'll literally do nothing i'm like

7988
02:11:21,510 --> 02:11:21,520
they'll literally do nothing i'm like
 

7989
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:23,350
they'll literally do nothing i'm like
always just chilling and

7990
02:11:23,350 --> 02:11:23,360
always just chilling and
 

7991
02:11:23,360 --> 02:11:26,629
always just chilling and
they don't like effect

7992
02:11:26,629 --> 02:11:26,639
they don't like effect
 

7993
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:28,870
they don't like effect
but but neurologically they're still

7994
02:11:28,870 --> 02:11:28,880
but but neurologically they're still
 

7995
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:30,310
but but neurologically they're still
having those effects but i don't get

7996
02:11:30,310 --> 02:11:30,320
having those effects but i don't get
 

7997
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:31,510
having those effects but i don't get
those feels that

7998
02:11:31,510 --> 02:11:31,520
those feels that
 

7999
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:34,790
those feels that
other people uh have from those but yes

8000
02:11:34,790 --> 02:11:34,800
other people uh have from those but yes
 

8001
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,510
other people uh have from those but yes
there's that immediate boost in

8002
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:37,520
there's that immediate boost in
 

8003
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:38,310
there's that immediate boost in
aggression

8004
02:11:38,310 --> 02:11:38,320
aggression
 

8005
02:11:38,320 --> 02:11:39,669
aggression
and the confidence and stuff that come

8006
02:11:39,669 --> 02:11:39,679
and the confidence and stuff that come
 

8007
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:41,030
and the confidence and stuff that come
with a lot of those ones that deal on

8008
02:11:41,030 --> 02:11:41,040
with a lot of those ones that deal on
 

8009
02:11:41,040 --> 02:11:42,709
with a lot of those ones that deal on
the neurological

8010
02:11:42,709 --> 02:11:42,719
the neurological
 

8011
02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:44,709
the neurological
overall a good sense of well-being just

8012
02:11:44,709 --> 02:11:44,719
overall a good sense of well-being just
 

8013
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:46,550
overall a good sense of well-being just
like from being on testosterone like

8014
02:11:46,550 --> 02:11:46,560
like from being on testosterone like
 

8015
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,350
like from being on testosterone like
it's going to affect your mood and it's

8016
02:11:49,350 --> 02:11:49,360
it's going to affect your mood and it's
 

8017
02:11:49,360 --> 02:11:51,270
it's going to affect your mood and it's
interesting so testosterone replacement

8018
02:11:51,270 --> 02:11:51,280
interesting so testosterone replacement
 

8019
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:52,149
interesting so testosterone replacement
therapy

8020
02:11:52,149 --> 02:11:52,159
therapy
 

8021
02:11:52,159 --> 02:11:53,669
therapy
if we walk down that path now and kind

8022
02:11:53,669 --> 02:11:53,679
if we walk down that path now and kind
 

8023
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:55,910
if we walk down that path now and kind
of switch gears

8024
02:11:55,910 --> 02:11:55,920
of switch gears
 

8025
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:58,550
of switch gears
you know we find that men today have

8026
02:11:58,550 --> 02:11:58,560
you know we find that men today have
 

8027
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:00,229
you know we find that men today have
declining testosterone

8028
02:12:00,229 --> 02:12:00,239
declining testosterone
 

8029
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:02,390
declining testosterone
over what has historically been in the

8030
02:12:02,390 --> 02:12:02,400
over what has historically been in the
 

8031
02:12:02,400 --> 02:12:03,430
over what has historically been in the
past so

8032
02:12:03,430 --> 02:12:03,440
past so
 

8033
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,990
past so
right now i think a 35 year old

8034
02:12:05,990 --> 02:12:06,000
right now i think a 35 year old
 

8035
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:07,030
right now i think a 35 year old
testosterone

8036
02:12:07,030 --> 02:12:07,040
testosterone
 

8037
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:10,870
testosterone
is shown to be about half what it was

8038
02:12:10,870 --> 02:12:10,880
is shown to be about half what it was
 

8039
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:14,310
is shown to be about half what it was
just 50 years ago so i don't know if

8040
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:14,320
just 50 years ago so i don't know if
 

8041
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:16,069
just 50 years ago so i don't know if
we could argue the point we don't really

8042
02:12:16,069 --> 02:12:16,079
we could argue the point we don't really
 

8043
02:12:16,079 --> 02:12:17,990
we could argue the point we don't really
have the science to validate any of it

8044
02:12:17,990 --> 02:12:18,000
have the science to validate any of it
 

8045
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:18,550
have the science to validate any of it
but

8046
02:12:18,550 --> 02:12:18,560
but
 

8047
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:21,750
but
it could be uh society as far as the

8048
02:12:21,750 --> 02:12:21,760
it could be uh society as far as the
 

8049
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:23,430
it could be uh society as far as the
impact that it's having on the

8050
02:12:23,430 --> 02:12:23,440
impact that it's having on the
 

8051
02:12:23,440 --> 02:12:26,470
impact that it's having on the
mental uh health uh for

8052
02:12:26,470 --> 02:12:26,480
mental uh health uh for
 

8053
02:12:26,480 --> 02:12:28,470
mental uh health uh for
men it could be the the estrogens

8054
02:12:28,470 --> 02:12:28,480
men it could be the the estrogens
 

8055
02:12:28,480 --> 02:12:29,990
men it could be the the estrogens
floating around in the water

floating around in the water
 

8057
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:32,310
floating around in the water
from all the chemicals and birth control

02:12:32,310 --> 02:12:32,320
from all the chemicals and birth control
 

8059
02:12:32,320 --> 02:12:33,669
from all the chemicals and birth control
and all this sort of stuff could be a

8060
02:12:33,669 --> 02:12:33,679
and all this sort of stuff could be a
 

8061
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:36,310
and all this sort of stuff could be a
lot of things

8062
02:12:36,310 --> 02:12:36,320
lot of things
 

8063
02:12:36,320 --> 02:12:38,390
lot of things
but it is a fact that average

8064
02:12:38,390 --> 02:12:38,400
but it is a fact that average
 

8065
02:12:38,400 --> 02:12:40,550
but it is a fact that average
testosterone is significantly lower

8066
02:12:40,550 --> 02:12:40,560
testosterone is significantly lower
 

8067
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:42,790
testosterone is significantly lower
and that is going to end up affecting

8068
02:12:42,790 --> 02:12:42,800
and that is going to end up affecting
 

8069
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:43,589
and that is going to end up affecting
life

8070
02:12:43,589 --> 02:12:43,599
life
 

8071
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:44,870

02:12:47,189 --> 02:12:47,199
longevity because it will affect those
 

8075
02:12:47,199 --> 02:12:48,629
longevity because it will affect those
things but on the other end

8076
02:12:48,629 --> 02:12:48,639
things but on the other end
 

8077
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:51,270
things but on the other end
steroids and trt particularly steroids

8078

steroids and trt particularly steroids
 

8079
02:12:51,280 --> 02:12:52,950
steroids and trt particularly steroids
come with a lot of negative health

02:12:52,950 --> 02:12:52,960
come with a lot of negative health

ramifications
 

8087
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:00,310
ramifications
and so you know if i knew what i know

8088
02:13:00,310 --> 02:13:00,320
and so you know if i knew what i know
 

8089
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,030
and so you know if i knew what i know
now

8090
02:13:01,030 --> 02:13:01,040
now
 

8091
02:13:01,040 --> 02:13:02,390
now
i don't know that i would have gone that

8092
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:02,400
i don't know that i would have gone that
 

8093
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,470
i don't know that i would have gone that
path i didn't i didn't tell i was 33

8094
02:13:04,470 --> 02:13:04,480
path i didn't i didn't tell i was 33
 

8095
02:13:04,480 --> 02:13:06,069
path i didn't i didn't tell i was 33
which is kind of an outlier for a

8096
02:13:06,069 --> 02:13:06,079
which is kind of an outlier for a

before i

before i
 

8107
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:19,270
before i
went down that path uh and that's

8108
02:13:19,270 --> 02:13:19,280
went down that path uh and that's
 

8109
02:13:19,280 --> 02:13:20,310
went down that path uh and that's
because i wanted to see what i was

8110
02:13:20,310 --> 02:13:20,320
because i wanted to see what i was
 

8111
02:13:20,320 --> 02:13:22,149
because i wanted to see what i was
capable of but i was reaching a point

8112
02:13:22,149 --> 02:13:22,159
capable of but i was reaching a point

that
 

8115
02:13:22,480 --> 02:13:24,470
that
it was either i need to do that or not

8116
02:13:24,470 --> 02:13:24,480
it was either i need to do that or not

8121
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:30,069

were actually um i think below 300

were actually um i think below 300
 

8123
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:32,069
were actually um i think below 300
is actually the threshold so i was being

02:13:32,069 --> 02:13:32,079
is actually the threshold so i was being
 

8125
02:13:32,079 --> 02:13:34,069
is actually the threshold so i was being
told to go on trt for the last

told to go on trt for the last
 

8127
02:13:34,079 --> 02:13:35,589
told to go on trt for the last
couple years probably just because i was

8128
02:13:35,589 --> 02:13:35,599
couple years probably just because i was
 

8129
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:37,350
couple years probably just because i was
pushing so hard and the stress level was

8130
02:13:37,350 --> 02:13:37,360
pushing so hard and the stress level was
 

8131
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:38,709
pushing so hard and the stress level was
driving my test down so it was

8132
02:13:38,709 --> 02:13:38,719
driving my test down so it was
 

8133
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:39,589
driving my test down so it was

self-imposed
 

8135
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:42,470
self-imposed
more than likely but i put it off

8136
02:13:42,470 --> 02:13:42,480
more than likely but i put it off
 

8137
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:43,510
more than likely but i put it off
because i wanted to set all the

because i wanted to set all the
 

8139
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:43,990
because i wanted to set all the

02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:52,069
you know entering the age category and
i'm like i'm going to go on trt

02:13:52,069 --> 02:13:52,079
i'm like i'm going to go on trt
 

8149
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:55,109
i'm like i'm going to go on trt
i did not feel like i should be with trt

8150
02:13:55,109 --> 02:13:55,119
i did not feel like i should be with trt
 

8151

below a certain level but you're still

8164
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
below a certain level but you're still
 

8165
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:07,350

on
 

8167
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,189
on
which but for me i'm like that's not

8168
02:14:09,189 --> 02:14:09,199
which but for me i'm like that's not
 

8169
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,550
which but for me i'm like that's not
over you won't come so i'm like i may as

8170
02:14:10,550 --> 02:14:10,560
over you won't come so i'm like i may as
 

8171
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:13,350
over you won't come so i'm like i may as
well at this point use steroids

8172
02:14:13,350 --> 02:14:13,360
well at this point use steroids
 

8173
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:16,790
well at this point use steroids
um but since then you know understanding

8174
02:14:16,790 --> 02:14:16,800
um but since then you know understanding
 

8175
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:18,470
um but since then you know understanding
all those ramifications

8176
02:14:18,470 --> 02:14:18,480
all those ramifications
 

8177
02:14:18,480 --> 02:14:20,390
all those ramifications
uh you know i might not have gone down

8178
02:14:20,390 --> 02:14:20,400
uh you know i might not have gone down
 

8179
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:22,149
uh you know i might not have gone down
that route quite so fast

8180
02:14:22,149 --> 02:14:22,159
that route quite so fast
 

8181
02:14:22,159 --> 02:14:26,390
that route quite so fast
and easily but i continued because i

8182
02:14:26,390 --> 02:14:26,400
and easily but i continued because i
 

8183
02:14:26,400 --> 02:14:28,229
and easily but i continued because i
also have a lot of resources that other

8184
02:14:28,229 --> 02:14:28,239
also have a lot of resources that other
 

8185
02:14:28,239 --> 02:14:30,310
also have a lot of resources that other
people don't in being able to assess and

8186
02:14:30,310 --> 02:14:30,320
people don't in being able to assess and
 

8187
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:31,990
people don't in being able to assess and
understand and put things in place to

8188
02:14:31,990 --> 02:14:32,000
understand and put things in place to
 

8189
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:33,589
understand and put things in place to
mitigate that so you need to be

8190
02:14:33,589 --> 02:14:33,599
mitigate that so you need to be
 

8191
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:35,669
mitigate that so you need to be
and the other thing is once you go on

8192
02:14:35,669 --> 02:14:35,679
and the other thing is once you go on
 

8193
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:38,950
and the other thing is once you go on
it's literally a decision for life

8194
02:14:38,950 --> 02:14:38,960
it's literally a decision for life
 

8195
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:42,629
it's literally a decision for life
not neces but realistically is because

8196
02:14:42,629 --> 02:14:42,639
not neces but realistically is because
 

8197
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:45,030
not neces but realistically is because
your your quality of life your feeling

8198
02:14:45,030 --> 02:14:45,040
your your quality of life your feeling
 

8199
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,430
your your quality of life your feeling
is going to be enhanced quite a bit

8200
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:47,440
is going to be enhanced quite a bit
 

8201
02:14:47,440 --> 02:14:48,950
is going to be enhanced quite a bit
and you're not going to want to go back

8202
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:48,960
and you're not going to want to go back
 

8203
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:50,550
and you're not going to want to go back
and if you go back it's going to be less

8204
02:14:50,550 --> 02:14:50,560
and if you go back it's going to be less
 

8205
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:52,790
and if you go back it's going to be less
than it was before

8206
02:14:52,790 --> 02:14:52,800
than it was before
 

8207
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:54,709
than it was before
that's how the endocrine system works

8208
02:14:54,709 --> 02:14:54,719
that's how the endocrine system works
 

8209
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:56,149
that's how the endocrine system works
there are ways to try to recover and

8210
02:14:56,149 --> 02:14:56,159
there are ways to try to recover and
 

8211
02:14:56,159 --> 02:14:58,310
there are ways to try to recover and
bring that up but it might be a while

8212
02:14:58,310 --> 02:14:58,320
bring that up but it might be a while
 

8213
02:14:58,320 --> 02:14:59,750
bring that up but it might be a while
and if you've been on for a while it

8214
02:14:59,750 --> 02:14:59,760
and if you've been on for a while it
 

8215
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:01,830
and if you've been on for a while it
definitely is not an option

8216
02:15:01,830 --> 02:15:01,840
definitely is not an option
 

8217
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:04,069
definitely is not an option
so those are big things that people need

8218
02:15:04,069 --> 02:15:04,079
so those are big things that people need
 

8219
02:15:04,079 --> 02:15:06,229
so those are big things that people need
to understand that you're going to have

8220
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:06,239
to understand that you're going to have
 

8221
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:07,270
to understand that you're going to have
some things in there

8222
02:15:07,270 --> 02:15:07,280
some things in there
 

8223
02:15:07,280 --> 02:15:10,709
some things in there
and even trt has some potential

8224
02:15:10,709 --> 02:15:10,719
and even trt has some potential
 

8225
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:13,589
and even trt has some potential
especially with at higher levels that

8226
02:15:13,589 --> 02:15:13,599
especially with at higher levels that
 

8227
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:14,870
especially with at higher levels that
it's going to

8228
02:15:14,870 --> 02:15:14,880
it's going to
 

8229
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,270
it's going to
you know increase the risk for prostate

8230
02:15:17,270 --> 02:15:17,280
you know increase the risk for prostate
 

8231
02:15:17,280 --> 02:15:17,910
you know increase the risk for prostate
cancer

8232
02:15:17,910 --> 02:15:17,920
cancer
 

8233
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:21,510
cancer
it's going to potentially cause some

8234
02:15:21,510 --> 02:15:21,520
it's going to potentially cause some
 

8235
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:23,270
it's going to potentially cause some
hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the

8236
02:15:23,270 --> 02:15:23,280
hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the
 

8237
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:24,709
hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the
heart and some potential

8238
02:15:24,709 --> 02:15:24,719
heart and some potential
 

8239
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:26,310
heart and some potential
plaque buildup of the some of those key

8240
02:15:26,310 --> 02:15:26,320
plaque buildup of the some of those key
 

8241
02:15:26,320 --> 02:15:27,669
plaque buildup of the some of those key
arteries around there that's going to

8242
02:15:27,669 --> 02:15:27,679
arteries around there that's going to
 

8243
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:29,030
arteries around there that's going to
have an impact on

8244
02:15:29,030 --> 02:15:29,040
have an impact on
 

8245
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:30,790
have an impact on
your cardiovascular health there's

8246
02:15:30,790 --> 02:15:30,800
your cardiovascular health there's
 

8247
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:32,069
your cardiovascular health there's
things that you can do

8248
02:15:32,069 --> 02:15:32,079
things that you can do
 

8249
02:15:32,079 --> 02:15:34,310
things that you can do
again but everything is like the shoe

8250
02:15:34,310 --> 02:15:34,320
again but everything is like the shoe
 

8251
02:15:34,320 --> 02:15:37,109
again but everything is like the shoe
story right where i'm anti-anti-shu

8252
02:15:37,109 --> 02:15:37,119
story right where i'm anti-anti-shu
 

8253
02:15:37,119 --> 02:15:38,790
story right where i'm anti-anti-shu
but i'm going well we can put band-aids

8254
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:38,800
but i'm going well we can put band-aids
 

8255
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:42,310
but i'm going well we can put band-aids
on this yeah um so it's

8256
02:15:42,310 --> 02:15:42,320
on this yeah um so it's
 

8257
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,669
on this yeah um so it's
there's a quality of life that comes

8258
02:15:43,669 --> 02:15:43,679
there's a quality of life that comes
 

8259
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:45,589
there's a quality of life that comes
with it the increase in quality of life

8260
02:15:45,589 --> 02:15:45,599
with it the increase in quality of life
 

8261
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:47,589
with it the increase in quality of life
and if you do it correctly i think and i

8262
02:15:47,589 --> 02:15:47,599
and if you do it correctly i think and i
 

8263
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:49,270
and if you do it correctly i think and i
think for me for me i definitely would

8264
02:15:49,270 --> 02:15:49,280
think for me for me i definitely would
 

8265
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,430
think for me for me i definitely would
not live without trt even with knowing

8266
02:15:51,430 --> 02:15:51,440
not live without trt even with knowing
 

8267
02:15:51,440 --> 02:15:52,550
not live without trt even with knowing
what i know now

8268
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:52,560
what i know now
 

8269
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:55,669
what i know now
um it this age and the quality of life

8270
02:15:55,669 --> 02:15:55,679
um it this age and the quality of life
 

8271
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:58,310
um it this age and the quality of life
and being able to be there have the

8272
02:15:58,310 --> 02:15:58,320
and being able to be there have the
 

8273
02:15:58,320 --> 02:15:59,030
and being able to be there have the
energy

8274
02:15:59,030 --> 02:15:59,040
energy
 

8275
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:01,430
energy
the recovery that's a big thing where

8276
02:16:01,430 --> 02:16:01,440
the recovery that's a big thing where
 

8277
02:16:01,440 --> 02:16:02,629
the recovery that's a big thing where
all this so i talked about

8278
02:16:02,629 --> 02:16:02,639
all this so i talked about
 

8279
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:05,109
all this so i talked about
muscle protein synthesis and

8280
02:16:05,109 --> 02:16:05,119
muscle protein synthesis and
 

8281
02:16:05,119 --> 02:16:07,350
muscle protein synthesis and
anti-catabolism as being big drivers

8282
02:16:07,350 --> 02:16:07,360
anti-catabolism as being big drivers
 

8283
02:16:07,360 --> 02:16:10,550
anti-catabolism as being big drivers
but recovery is the other big aspect

8284
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:10,560
but recovery is the other big aspect
 

8285
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:12,310
but recovery is the other big aspect
that they that they offer probably as a

8286
02:16:12,310 --> 02:16:12,320
that they that they offer probably as a
 

8287
02:16:12,320 --> 02:16:13,910
that they that they offer probably as a
result of those but

8288
02:16:13,910 --> 02:16:13,920
result of those but
 

8289
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,229
result of those but
um that's gonna those are gonna be the

8290
02:16:16,229 --> 02:16:16,239
um that's gonna those are gonna be the
 

8291
02:16:16,239 --> 02:16:18,149
um that's gonna those are gonna be the
big enhancements so

8292
02:16:18,149 --> 02:16:18,159
big enhancements so
 

8293
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:21,350
big enhancements so
just doing steroids steroids is going to

8294
02:16:21,350 --> 02:16:21,360
just doing steroids steroids is going to
 

8295
02:16:21,360 --> 02:16:23,669
just doing steroids steroids is going to
increase all the other stuff that you do

8296
02:16:23,669 --> 02:16:23,679
increase all the other stuff that you do
 

8297
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:24,390
increase all the other stuff that you do
so if you've

8298
02:16:24,390 --> 02:16:24,400
so if you've
 

8299
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:25,990
so if you've
if you have good training you have good

8300
02:16:25,990 --> 02:16:26,000
if you have good training you have good
 

8301
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,990
if you have good training you have good
diet good quality of sleep like all this

8302
02:16:27,990 --> 02:16:28,000
diet good quality of sleep like all this
 

8303
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:28,550
diet good quality of sleep like all this
other stuff

8304
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:28,560
other stuff
 

8305
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,270
other stuff
then you can take advantage of that but

8306
02:16:31,270 --> 02:16:31,280
then you can take advantage of that but
 

8307
02:16:31,280 --> 02:16:32,790
then you can take advantage of that but
you could shoot steroids and nobody

8308
02:16:32,790 --> 02:16:32,800
you could shoot steroids and nobody
 

8309
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:35,110
you could shoot steroids and nobody
would know

8310
02:16:35,110 --> 02:16:35,120
would know
 

8311
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:36,549
would know
and honestly you go down to 24-hour

8312
02:16:36,549 --> 02:16:36,559
and honestly you go down to 24-hour
 

8313
02:16:36,559 --> 02:16:38,389
and honestly you go down to 24-hour
fitness and you'll see a bunch of

8314
02:16:38,389 --> 02:16:38,399
fitness and you'll see a bunch of
 

8315
02:16:38,399 --> 02:16:41,030
fitness and you'll see a bunch of
you know late you know 19 to 21 year old

8316
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:41,040
you know late you know 19 to 21 year old
 

8317
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:42,629
you know late you know 19 to 21 year old
kids that are all kind of red and

8318
02:16:42,629 --> 02:16:42,639
kids that are all kind of red and
 

8319
02:16:42,639 --> 02:16:44,709
kids that are all kind of red and
150 pounds that look like that don't

8320
02:16:44,709 --> 02:16:44,719
150 pounds that look like that don't
 

8321
02:16:44,719 --> 02:16:46,230
150 pounds that look like that don't
look like anything yeah

8322
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:46,240
look like anything yeah
 

8323
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:48,389
look like anything yeah
and there a bunch of them will be using

8324
02:16:48,389 --> 02:16:48,399
and there a bunch of them will be using
 

8325
02:16:48,399 --> 02:16:49,270
and there a bunch of them will be using
steroids

8326
02:16:49,270 --> 02:16:49,280
steroids
 

8327
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:53,110
steroids
because yeah they're not like so it's

8328
02:16:53,110 --> 02:16:53,120
because yeah they're not like so it's
 

8329
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,709
because yeah they're not like so it's
it's not the it's not going to make a

8330
02:16:54,709 --> 02:16:54,719
it's not the it's not going to make a
 

8331
02:16:54,719 --> 02:16:56,950
it's not the it's not going to make a
champion like you said it's not going to

8332
02:16:56,950 --> 02:16:56,960
champion like you said it's not going to
 

8333
02:16:56,960 --> 02:16:57,910
champion like you said it's not going to
at most

8334
02:16:57,910 --> 02:16:57,920
at most
 

8335
02:16:57,920 --> 02:16:59,509
at most
guess what i was already at an elite

8336
02:16:59,509 --> 02:16:59,519
guess what i was already at an elite
 

8337
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:01,830
guess what i was already at an elite
level i was one of the best in the world

8338
02:17:01,830 --> 02:17:01,840
level i was one of the best in the world
 

8339
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:04,950
level i was one of the best in the world
before i started using it doesn't it

8340
02:17:04,950 --> 02:17:04,960
before i started using it doesn't it
 

8341
02:17:04,960 --> 02:17:05,830
before i started using it doesn't it
doesn't do that

8342
02:17:05,830 --> 02:17:05,840
doesn't do that
 

8343
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:08,790
doesn't do that
it does a 10 increase at best yeah and

8344
02:17:08,790 --> 02:17:08,800
it does a 10 increase at best yeah and
 

8345
02:17:08,800 --> 02:17:10,309
it does a 10 increase at best yeah and
that's proven in the statistics which is

8346
02:17:10,309 --> 02:17:10,319
that's proven in the statistics which is
 

8347
02:17:10,319 --> 02:17:11,270
that's proven in the statistics which is
interesting because most people don't

8348
02:17:11,270 --> 02:17:11,280
interesting because most people don't
 

8349
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:12,870
interesting because most people don't
know this like

8350
02:17:12,870 --> 02:17:12,880
know this like
 

8351
02:17:12,880 --> 02:17:16,790
know this like
it the data is right there yeah

8352
02:17:16,790 --> 02:17:16,800
it the data is right there yeah
 

8353
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:20,150
it the data is right there yeah

something that is not going to have some
 

8465
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:05,270
something that is not going to have some
sort of regurgitatory effect or

8466
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:05,280
sort of regurgitatory effect or
 

8467
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:07,589

bloating effect or anything like that
 

8469
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:09,110
bloating effect or anything like that
but you want to have the quick hit of

8470
02:19:09,110 --> 02:19:09,120
but you want to have the quick hit of
 

8471
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:10,070
but you want to have the quick hit of
energy so it's a

8472
02:19:10,070 --> 02:19:10,080
energy so it's a
 

8473
02:19:10,080 --> 02:19:12,230
energy so it's a
preferential energy source moves above

8474
02:19:12,230 --> 02:19:12,240
preferential energy source moves above
 

8475
02:19:12,240 --> 02:19:13,349

8543
02:20:08,800 --> 02:20:10,389
shot of vodka or something before they
go lyft and i'm like there's something

8544
02:20:10,389 --> 02:20:10,399
go lyft and i'm like there's something
 

8545
02:20:10,399 --> 02:20:11,110
go lyft and i'm like there's something
here

8546
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:11,120
here
 

8547
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,349
here
so i started experimenting with it and

8548
02:20:13,349 --> 02:20:13,359
so i started experimenting with it and
 

8549
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:15,349
so i started experimenting with it and
i'm like that works and then i started

8550

i'm like that works and then i started
 

8551
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:16,790
i'm like that works and then i started
researching nobody talks about this

8552
02:20:16,790 --> 02:20:16,800
researching nobody talks about this
 

8553
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:18,150
researching nobody talks about this
stuff so it takes a while to start

8554
02:20:18,150 --> 02:20:18,160
stuff so it takes a while to start
 

8555
02:20:18,160 --> 02:20:19,349
stuff so it takes a while to start
piecing together

8556
02:20:19,349 --> 02:20:19,359
piecing together
 

8557
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:21,030
piecing together
all the stuff that actually happens to

8558
02:20:21,030 --> 02:20:21,040
all the stuff that actually happens to
 

8559
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:22,950
all the stuff that actually happens to
make that happen but

8560
02:20:22,950 --> 02:20:22,960
make that happen but
 

8561
02:20:22,960 --> 02:20:25,349
make that happen but
it moves away the things that you're

8562
02:20:25,349 --> 02:20:25,359
it moves away the things that you're
 

8563
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:25,990
it moves away the things that you're
going to

8564
02:20:25,990 --> 02:20:26,000
going to
 

8565
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:28,150
going to
the concerns about the ramifications in

8566
02:20:28,150 --> 02:20:28,160
the concerns about the ramifications in
 

8567
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,230
the concerns about the ramifications in
the future and the other stuff so the

8568
02:20:30,230 --> 02:20:30,240
the future and the other stuff so the
 

8569
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:32,710
the future and the other stuff so the
um but brings you into the moment and

8570
02:20:32,710 --> 02:20:32,720
um but brings you into the moment and
 

8571
02:20:32,720 --> 02:20:33,429
um but brings you into the moment and
then the

8572
02:20:33,429 --> 02:20:33,439
then the
 

8573
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:35,030
then the
the dopamine hit in the other and then

8574
02:20:35,030 --> 02:20:35,040
the dopamine hit in the other and then
 

8575
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:37,349
the dopamine hit in the other and then
it uh enhances whatever mood that you're

8576
02:20:37,349 --> 02:20:37,359
it uh enhances whatever mood that you're
 

8577
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:39,670
it uh enhances whatever mood that you're
in but all of a sudden you get

8578
02:20:39,670 --> 02:20:39,680
in but all of a sudden you get
 

8579
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:42,950
in but all of a sudden you get
in the state much

8580
02:20:42,950 --> 02:20:42,960
in the state much
 

8581
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:46,070
in the state much
easier and so it's really really

8582
02:20:46,070 --> 02:20:46,080
easier and so it's really really
 

8583
02:20:46,080 --> 02:20:47,030
easier and so it's really really
interesting but it's

8584
02:20:47,030 --> 02:20:47,040
interesting but it's
 

8585
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,750
interesting but it's
very it's a very small amount needed and

8586
02:20:49,750 --> 02:20:49,760
very it's a very small amount needed and
 

8587
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:51,110
very it's a very small amount needed and
very time sensitive

8588
02:20:51,110 --> 02:20:51,120
very time sensitive
 

8589
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:53,990
very time sensitive
but it can be so much more powerful than

8590
02:20:53,990 --> 02:20:54,000
but it can be so much more powerful than
 

8591
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,670
but it can be so much more powerful than
like drugs people use

8592
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:55,680
like drugs people use
 

8593
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:57,910
like drugs people use
for this stuff it ties really together

8594
02:20:57,910 --> 02:20:57,920
for this stuff it ties really together
 

8595
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:59,830
for this stuff it ties really together

yeah so so that i can save the energy

9094
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640
yeah so so that i can save the energy
 

9095
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:27,670
yeah so so that i can save the energy
from here

02:29:27,670 --> 02:29:27,680
from here
 

9097
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:29,270
from here
from lifting those up and the fatigue of

9098
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:29,280
from lifting those up and the fatigue of
 

9099
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:30,870

that's all i say because
it's gonna add up but you could spend

9212
02:31:35,429 --> 02:31:35,439
it's gonna add up but you could spend
 

9213
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:36,630
it's gonna add up but you could spend
six months

and not take that one step
 

9221
02:31:44,319 --> 02:31:46,790
and not take that one step
so you've got to distill stuff down

9222
02:31:46,790 --> 02:31:46,800
so you've got to distill stuff down
 

9223
02:31:46,800 --> 02:31:48,309
so you've got to distill stuff down
you've got to really understand

9224

surprised
and then from there this is the tech

9250
02:32:14,950 --> 02:32:14,960
and then from there this is the tech
 

9251
02:32:14,960 --> 02:32:17,750
and then from there this is the tech
okay then of that what can i

9252
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:17,760
okay then of that what can i
 

9253
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:20,790
okay then of that what can i
what can i automate what can i

9254
02:32:20,790 --> 02:32:20,800
what can i automate what can i
 

9255
02:32:20,800 --> 02:32:23,270
what can i automate what can i
not have to do in a repeated fashion and

9256
02:32:23,270 --> 02:32:23,280
not have to do in a repeated fashion and
 

9257
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:23,990

point uh around
just doing it there's a point to like

9294
02:32:59,750 --> 02:32:59,760
just doing it there's a point to like
 

9295
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:00,630
just doing it there's a point to like
experiencing

9296
02:33:00,630 --> 02:33:00,640
experiencing
 

9297
02:33:00,640 --> 02:33:02,950
experiencing
all levels to really understand things

9298
02:33:02,950 --> 02:33:02,960
all levels to really understand things
 

9299
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:04,150
all levels to really understand things
you need

9300
02:33:04,150 --> 02:33:04,160
you need
 

9301
02:33:04,160 --> 02:33:06,950
you need
to spend time at the same time doing all

9302
02:33:06,950 --> 02:33:06,960
to spend time at the same time doing all
 

9303
02:33:06,960 --> 02:33:08,630
to spend time at the same time doing all
those things because there could be good

9304
02:33:08,630 --> 02:33:08,640
those things because there could be good
 

9305
02:33:08,640 --> 02:33:11,670
