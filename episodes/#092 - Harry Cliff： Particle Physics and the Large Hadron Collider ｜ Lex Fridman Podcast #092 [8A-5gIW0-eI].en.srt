00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,039
let's start with probably one of the
coolest things that human beings have

00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:55,049
coolest things that human beings have
 

197
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,920
coolest things that human beings have
ever created the Large Hadron Collider

ohc what is it how does it work

200
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:01,709
ohc what is it how does it work
 

201
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:05,750
ohc what is it how does it work
okay so is essentially this gigantic 27

202
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
okay so is essentially this gigantic 27
 

203
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,729
okay so is essentially this gigantic 27

00:04:09,949 --> 00:04:09,959
accelerators this big ring it's buried
 

207
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,140
accelerators this big ring it's buried
100 100 meters underneath the surface in

208
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,150
100 100 meters underneath the surface in
 

209
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,759
100 100 meters underneath the surface in
the countryside just outside Geneva in

00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:13,769
the countryside just outside Geneva in
 

211
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:15,770
the countryside just outside Geneva in
Switzerland and really what it's for

212
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:15,780
Switzerland and really what it's for
 

213
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,770
Switzerland and really what it's for
ultimately is to try to understand what

214
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:18,780
ultimately is to try to understand what
 

215
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,539
ultimately is to try to understand what
are the basic building blocks of the

216
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:20,549
are the basic building blocks of the
 

217
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,909
are the basic building blocks of the
universe so you can think of it in a way

218
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:22,919
universe so you can think of it in a way
 

219
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:24,770
universe so you can think of it in a way
as like a gigantic microscope and and

220
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:24,780
as like a gigantic microscope and and
 

221
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,290
as like a gigantic microscope and and
the analogy is actually fairly precise

222
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:27,300
the analogy is actually fairly precise
 

223
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,680
the analogy is actually fairly precise
so gigantic microscope effectively

224
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:30,690
so gigantic microscope effectively
 

225
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,409
so gigantic microscope effectively
except it's a microscope that looks at

226
00:04:33,409 --> 00:04:33,419
except it's a microscope that looks at
 

227
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,010
except it's a microscope that looks at
the structure of the vacuum in order for

228
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:37,020
the structure of the vacuum in order for
 

229
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,700
the structure of the vacuum in order for
this kind of thing to study particles

230
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:39,710
this kind of thing to study particles
 

231
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,460
this kind of thing to study particles
which are microscopic entities it has to

232
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:43,470
which are microscopic entities it has to
 

233
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,700
which are microscopic entities it has to
be huge yes gigantic Waxhaw so what do

234
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:46,710
be huge yes gigantic Waxhaw so what do
 

235
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:49,430
be huge yes gigantic Waxhaw so what do
you mean by studying vacuum okay so I

236
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
you mean by studying vacuum okay so I
 

237
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,070
you mean by studying vacuum okay so I
mean so particle physics as a field is

238
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,080
mean so particle physics as a field is
 

239
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,779
mean so particle physics as a field is
kind of badly named in a way because

240
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:53,789
kind of badly named in a way because
 

241
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:56,089
kind of badly named in a way because
particles are not the fundamental

242
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:56,099
particles are not the fundamental
 

243
00:04:56,099 --> 00:04:58,010
particles are not the fundamental
ingredients of the universe they're not

244
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,020
ingredients of the universe they're not
 

245
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,719
ingredients of the universe they're not
fundamental at all so the things that we

246
00:04:59,719 --> 00:04:59,729
fundamental at all so the things that we
 

247
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,219
fundamental at all so the things that we
believe are the real building blocks of

248
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:01,229
believe are the real building blocks of
 

249
00:05:01,229 --> 00:05:04,460
believe are the real building blocks of
the universe are objects invisible fluid

250
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:04,470
the universe are objects invisible fluid
 

251
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,580
the universe are objects invisible fluid
like objects called quantum fields so

252
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:07,590
like objects called quantum fields so
 

253
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,800
like objects called quantum fields so
these are fields like like the magnetic

254
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:09,810
these are fields like like the magnetic
 

255
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,540
these are fields like like the magnetic
field around a magnet that exists

256
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:11,550
field around a magnet that exists
 

257
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,310
field around a magnet that exists
everywhere in space they're always there

258
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,320
everywhere in space they're always there
 

259
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,110
everywhere in space they're always there
in fact actually it's funny they were in

260
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
in fact actually it's funny they were in
 

261
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,399
in fact actually it's funny they were in
the wrong institution because this is

262
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:16,409
the wrong institution because this is
 

263
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:19,129
the wrong institution because this is
where the idea of the field was

264
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:19,139
where the idea of the field was
 

265
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,930
where the idea of the field was
effectively invented by Michael Faraday

266
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:20,940
effectively invented by Michael Faraday
 

267
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,969
effectively invented by Michael Faraday
doing experiments with magnets and coils

268
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:22,979
doing experiments with magnets and coils
 

269
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,850
doing experiments with magnets and coils
of wire so he noticed that you know if

270
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:25,860
of wire so he noticed that you know if
 

271
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,250
of wire so he noticed that you know if
he was very famous experiment that he

272
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:28,260
he was very famous experiment that he
 

273
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,899
he was very famous experiment that he
did where he got a magnet and put it on

274
00:05:29,899 --> 00:05:29,909
did where he got a magnet and put it on
 

275
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,460
did where he got a magnet and put it on
top of it a piece of paper and then

276
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:31,470
top of it a piece of paper and then
 

277
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,140
top of it a piece of paper and then
sprinkled iron filings and he found the

278
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,150
sprinkled iron filings and he found the
 

279
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,700
sprinkled iron filings and he found the
iron filings arrange themselves into

280
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:34,710
iron filings arrange themselves into
 

281
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,760
iron filings arrange themselves into
these kind of loops of which was

282
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:37,770
these kind of loops of which was
 

283
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,649
these kind of loops of which was
actually mapping out the invisible

284
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:39,659
actually mapping out the invisible
 

285
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:41,420
actually mapping out the invisible
influence of this magnetic field which

286
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,430
influence of this magnetic field which
 

287
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,620
influence of this magnetic field which
is a thing you know we've all

288
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:42,630
is a thing you know we've all
 

289
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,210
is a thing you know we've all
experienced we're all felt held a magnet

290
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:44,220
experienced we're all felt held a magnet
 

291
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,189
experienced we're all felt held a magnet
and or two poles the magnet and pushing

292
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:46,199
and or two poles the magnet and pushing
 

293
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,899
and or two poles the magnet and pushing
together and felt this thing this force

294
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:47,909
together and felt this thing this force
 

295
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,240
together and felt this thing this force
pushing back so these are real physical

296
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:50,250
pushing back so these are real physical
 

297
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,520
pushing back so these are real physical
objects and the the way we think of

298
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,530
objects and the the way we think of
 

299
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,409
objects and the the way we think of
particles in modern physics is that they

300
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:54,419
particles in modern physics is that they
 

301
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:56,870
particles in modern physics is that they
are essentially little vibrations little

302
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:56,880
are essentially little vibrations little

it seems to I seem to be able to
visualize that kind of idea easier yeah

326
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:28,780
visualize that kind of idea easier yeah
 

327
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,200
visualize that kind of idea easier yeah
are you comfortable psychologically with

328
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:31,210
are you comfortable psychologically with
 

329
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,030
are you comfortable psychologically with
the idea that the basic building block

330
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:33,040
the idea that the basic building block
 

331
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,820
the idea that the basic building block
is not a block but a field I think it's

332
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:35,830
is not a block but a field I think it's
 

333
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,250
is not a block but a field I think it's
um I think it's quite a magical idea I

334
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:38,260
um I think it's quite a magical idea I
 

335
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,740
um I think it's quite a magical idea I
find it quite appealing and it's well it

336
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:40,750
find it quite appealing and it's well it
 

337
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,180
find it quite appealing and it's well it
comes from a misunderstanding of what

338
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,190
comes from a misunderstanding of what
 

339
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,040
comes from a misunderstanding of what
particles are so like when you when we

340
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,050
particles are so like when you when we
 

341
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,870
particles are so like when you when we
do science at school and we draw a

342
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:45,880
do science at school and we draw a
 

343
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,460
do science at school and we draw a
picture of an atom you draw a like you

344
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:47,470
picture of an atom you draw a like you
 

345
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,260
picture of an atom you draw a like you
know nucleus with some protons or

346
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:49,270
know nucleus with some protons or
 

347
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,670
know nucleus with some protons or
neutrons these little spheres in the

348
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:50,680
neutrons these little spheres in the
 

349
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,840
neutrons these little spheres in the
middle and then you have some electrons

350
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:51,850
middle and then you have some electrons
 

351
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,180
middle and then you have some electrons
are like little flies flying around the

352
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:54,190
are like little flies flying around the
 

353
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,950
are like little flies flying around the
atom and that is a completely misleading

354
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:55,960
atom and that is a completely misleading
 

355
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,810
atom and that is a completely misleading
picture of what an atom is like it's

356
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:57,820
picture of what an atom is like it's
 

357
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,190
picture of what an atom is like it's
nothing like that the electron is not

358
00:06:59,190 --> 00:06:59,200
nothing like that the electron is not
 

359
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,290
nothing like that the electron is not
like a little planet orbiting the atom

360
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:01,300
like a little planet orbiting the atom
 

361
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,560
like a little planet orbiting the atom
it's this spread out wibbly-wobbly

362
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:04,570
it's this spread out wibbly-wobbly
 

363
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,450
it's this spread out wibbly-wobbly
wave-like thing and we know we've known

364
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:06,460
wave-like thing and we know we've known
 

365
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,250
wave-like thing and we know we've known
that since you know the early 20th

366
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:08,260
that since you know the early 20th
 

367
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,290
that since you know the early 20th
century thanks to quantum mechanics so

368
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:10,300
century thanks to quantum mechanics so
 

369
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,540
century thanks to quantum mechanics so
when we carry on using this word

370
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:12,550
when we carry on using this word
 

371
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,670
when we carry on using this word
particle because sometimes when we do

372
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:14,680
particle because sometimes when we do
 

373
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,860
particle because sometimes when we do
experiments particles do behave like

374
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:16,870
experiments particles do behave like
 

375
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,870
experiments particles do behave like
they're little marbles or little bullets

376
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:18,880
they're little marbles or little bullets
 

377
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,090
they're little marbles or little bullets
you know so in the LHC when we collide

378
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,100
you know so in the LHC when we collide
 

379
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:23,400
you know so in the LHC when we collide
particles together you'll get you know

380
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:23,410
particles together you'll get you know
 

381
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,900
particles together you'll get you know
you'll get like hundreds of particles

382
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:24,910
you'll get like hundreds of particles
 

383
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,340
you'll get like hundreds of particles
will fly out through the detector and

384
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,350
will fly out through the detector and
 

385
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,170
will fly out through the detector and
they all take a trajectory and you can

386
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:28,180
they all take a trajectory and you can
 

387
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,730
they all take a trajectory and you can
see from the detector where they've gone

388
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:29,740
see from the detector where they've gone
 

389
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,020
see from the detector where they've gone
and they look like they're little

390
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,030
and they look like they're little
 

391
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,480
and they look like they're little
bullets so they behave that way um you

392
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:33,490
bullets so they behave that way um you
 

393
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:35,640
bullets so they behave that way um you
know a lot of the time but when you

394
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:35,650
know a lot of the time but when you
 

395
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,830
know a lot of the time but when you
really study them carefully you'll see

396
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:37,840
really study them carefully you'll see
 

397
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,200
really study them carefully you'll see
that they are not little spheres they

398
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,210
that they are not little spheres they
 

399
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:43,740
that they are not little spheres they
are these virial disturbances in in

400
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:43,750
are these virial disturbances in in
 

401
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,600
are these virial disturbances in in
these underlying fields so this is this

402
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:45,610
these underlying fields so this is this
 

403
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,870
these underlying fields so this is this
is really how we think nature is which

404
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:48,880
is really how we think nature is which
 

405
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,180
is really how we think nature is which
is surprising but also I think kind of

406
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:51,190
is surprising but also I think kind of
 

407
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,430
is surprising but also I think kind of
magic so here we are our bodies are

408
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
magic so here we are our bodies are
 

409
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,590
magic so here we are our bodies are
basically made up of like little knots

410
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:55,600
basically made up of like little knots
 

411
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,010
basically made up of like little knots
of energy in these invisible objects

412
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,020
of energy in these invisible objects
 

413
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:03,510
of energy in these invisible objects
that are all around us and what what is

414
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:03,520
that are all around us and what what is
 

415
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,020
that are all around us and what what is
the story of the vacuum when it comes to

416
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,030
the story of the vacuum when it comes to
 

417
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,120
the story of the vacuum when it comes to
LHC so what why did you mention the word

418
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,130
LHC so what why did you mention the word
 

419
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:12,120
LHC so what why did you mention the word
vacuum okay so if we just if we go back

420
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,130
vacuum okay so if we just if we go back
 

421
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,160
vacuum okay so if we just if we go back
to let us the physics we do know so

422
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,170
to let us the physics we do know so
 

423
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,650
to let us the physics we do know so
atoms are made of electrons which were

424
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:16,660
atoms are made of electrons which were
 

425
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,760
atoms are made of electrons which were
discovered 100 or so years ago and then

426
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:18,770
discovered 100 or so years ago and then
 

427
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,650
discovered 100 or so years ago and then
nucleus of the atom you have two other

428
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:20,660
nucleus of the atom you have two other
 

429
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,119
nucleus of the atom you have two other
types of particles there's an up

430
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:22,129
types of particles there's an up
 

431
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:23,890
types of particles there's an up
something called an up quark and a down

432
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:23,900
something called an up quark and a down
 

433
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,749
something called an up quark and a down
quark and those three particles make up

434
00:08:25,749 --> 00:08:25,759
quark and those three particles make up
 

435
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,809
quark and those three particles make up
every atom in the universe so we think

436
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:28,819
every atom in the universe so we think
 

437
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:30,909
every atom in the universe so we think
of these as ripples in fields so there

438
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:30,919
of these as ripples in fields so there
 

439
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:33,519
of these as ripples in fields so there
is something called the electron field

440
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:33,529
is something called the electron field
 

441
00:08:33,529 --> 00:08:36,279
is something called the electron field
and every electron in the universe is a

442
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:36,289
and every electron in the universe is a
 

443
00:08:36,289 --> 00:08:38,709
and every electron in the universe is a
ripple moving about in this electron

444
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:38,719
ripple moving about in this electron
 

445
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
ripple moving about in this electron
field the electron field is all around

446
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,010
field the electron field is all around
 

447
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,620
field the electron field is all around
we can't see it but every electron in

448
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:41,630
we can't see it but every electron in
 

449
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,240
we can't see it but every electron in
our body is a little ripple in this

450
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:43,250
our body is a little ripple in this
 

451
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,030
our body is a little ripple in this
thing that's there all the time and the

452
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,040
thing that's there all the time and the
 

453
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,410
thing that's there all the time and the
quark feels the same so there's an up

454
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:47,420
quark feels the same so there's an up
 

455
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,150
quark feels the same so there's an up
quark field and an up quark isn't a

456
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:49,160
quark field and an up quark isn't a
 

457
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,440
quark field and an up quark isn't a
ripple in the up quark field and the

458
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:50,450
ripple in the up quark field and the
 

459
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,819
ripple in the up quark field and the
down quark is a little ripple in

460
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:51,829
down quark is a little ripple in
 

461
00:08:51,829 --> 00:08:52,960
down quark is a little ripple in
something else called the down quark

462
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:52,970
something else called the down quark
 

463
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,430
something else called the down quark
field so these fields are always there

464
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:54,440
field so these fields are always there
 

465
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,240
field so these fields are always there
now there are potentially we know about

466
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,250
now there are potentially we know about
 

467
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,620
now there are potentially we know about
a certain number of fields in what we

468
00:08:59,620 --> 00:08:59,630
a certain number of fields in what we
 

469
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,550
a certain number of fields in what we
call the standard model of particle

470
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
call the standard model of particle
 

471
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,079
call the standard model of particle
physics and the most recent one we

472
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:02,089
physics and the most recent one we
 

473
00:09:02,089 --> 00:09:04,569
physics and the most recent one we
discovered was the Higgs field and the

474
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:04,579
discovered was the Higgs field and the
 

475
00:09:04,579 --> 00:09:07,480
discovered was the Higgs field and the
way we discovered the Higgs field was to

476
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:07,490
way we discovered the Higgs field was to
 

477
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,040
way we discovered the Higgs field was to
make a little ripple in it so what the

478
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,050
make a little ripple in it so what the
 

479
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,130
make a little ripple in it so what the
LHC did it fired two protons into each

480
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:12,140
LHC did it fired two protons into each
 

481
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,560
LHC did it fired two protons into each
other very very hard with enough energy

482
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:14,570
other very very hard with enough energy
 

483
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,319
other very very hard with enough energy
that you could create a disturbance in

484
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:17,329
that you could create a disturbance in
 

485
00:09:17,329 --> 00:09:19,150
that you could create a disturbance in
this Higgs field and that's what shows

486
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:19,160
this Higgs field and that's what shows
 

487
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,949
this Higgs field and that's what shows
up as what we call the Higgs boson so

488
00:09:20,949 --> 00:09:20,959
up as what we call the Higgs boson so
 

489
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,540
up as what we call the Higgs boson so
this particle that everyone was going on

490
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,550
this particle that everyone was going on
 

491
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:25,210
this particle that everyone was going on
about eight or so years ago is proof

492
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:25,220
about eight or so years ago is proof
 

493
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,519
about eight or so years ago is proof
really the particle in itself is I mean

494
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:27,529
really the particle in itself is I mean
 

495
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:29,170
really the particle in itself is I mean
it's interesting but the things really

496
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:29,180
it's interesting but the things really
 

497
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,060
it's interesting but the things really
interesting is the field because it's

498
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:31,070
interesting is the field because it's
 

499
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,460
interesting is the field because it's
the the Higgs field that we believe is

500
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:33,470
the the Higgs field that we believe is
 

501
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:36,639
the the Higgs field that we believe is
the reason that electrons and quarks

502
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:36,649
the reason that electrons and quarks
 

503
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:39,550
the reason that electrons and quarks
have mass and it's that invisible field

504
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:39,560
have mass and it's that invisible field
 

505
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,800
have mass and it's that invisible field
that's always there that gives mass to

506
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:41,810
that's always there that gives mass to
 

507
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,930
that's always there that gives mass to
the particles the Higgs boson is just

508
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:43,940
the particles the Higgs boson is just
 

509
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,850
the particles the Higgs boson is just
our way of checking it's there basically

510
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:45,860
our way of checking it's there basically
 

511
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,480
our way of checking it's there basically
and so the Large Hadron Collider in

512
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:49,490
and so the Large Hadron Collider in
 

513
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,130
and so the Large Hadron Collider in
order to get that ripple in the Higgs

514
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,140
order to get that ripple in the Higgs
 

515
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,800
order to get that ripple in the Higgs
field you it requires a huge amount of

516
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:53,810
field you it requires a huge amount of
 

517
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,310
field you it requires a huge amount of
energy

518
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,320
energy
 

519
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,230
energy
yes opposes so that's why you need this

520
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,240
yes opposes so that's why you need this
 

521
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,510
yes opposes so that's why you need this
huge that's why size matters here so

522
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:58,520
huge that's why size matters here so
 

523
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:01,420
huge that's why size matters here so
maybe there's a million questions here

524
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:01,430
maybe there's a million questions here
 

525
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:04,530
maybe there's a million questions here
but let's backtrack why does size matter

526
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:04,540
but let's backtrack why does size matter
 

527
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,120
but let's backtrack why does size matter
in the context of a particle collider so

528
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,130
in the context of a particle collider so
 

529
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:14,260
in the context of a particle collider so
why does bigger allow you for higher

530
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,270
why does bigger allow you for higher
 

531
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,810
why does bigger allow you for higher
energy collisions right so the reason

532
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:16,820
energy collisions right so the reason
 

533
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,670
energy collisions right so the reason
well it is kind of simple really which

534
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:18,680
well it is kind of simple really which
 

535
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,500
well it is kind of simple really which
is that there are two types of particle

536
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:20,510
is that there are two types of particle
 

537
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,210
is that there are two types of particle
accelerator that you can build one is

538
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:22,220
accelerator that you can build one is
 

539
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,860
accelerator that you can build one is
circular which is like the LHC the other

540
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:23,870
circular which is like the LHC the other
 

541
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,560
circular which is like the LHC the other
is a great long line so the advantage of

542
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:26,570
is a great long line so the advantage of
 

543
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,530
is a great long line so the advantage of
a circular machine is that you can send

544
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:29,540
a circular machine is that you can send
 

545
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,120
a circular machine is that you can send
particles around a ring and you can give

546
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:31,130
particles around a ring and you can give
 

547
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,890
particles around a ring and you can give
them a kick every

548
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:31,900
them a kick every
 

549
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,240
them a kick every
and they go round so imagine you have a

550
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,250
and they go round so imagine you have a
 

551
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,860
and they go round so imagine you have a
is actually a bit of the LHC that's

552
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:34,870
is actually a bit of the LHC that's
 

553
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,110
is actually a bit of the LHC that's
about only 30 meters long where you have

554
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,120
about only 30 meters long where you have
 

555
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,880
about only 30 meters long where you have
a bunch of metal boxes which have

556
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:38,890
a bunch of metal boxes which have
 

557
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,460
a bunch of metal boxes which have
oscillating to million volt electric

558
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:41,470
oscillating to million volt electric
 

559
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,590
oscillating to million volt electric
fields inside them which are timed so

560
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:43,600
fields inside them which are timed so
 

561
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,880
fields inside them which are timed so
that when a proton goes through one of

562
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:44,890
that when a proton goes through one of
 

563
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:46,680
that when a proton goes through one of
these boxes the field it sees as it

564
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:46,690
these boxes the field it sees as it
 

565
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,600
these boxes the field it sees as it
approaches is attractive then as it

566
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:48,610
approaches is attractive then as it
 

567
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,520
approaches is attractive then as it
leaves the box it flips and becomes

568
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,530
leaves the box it flips and becomes
 

569
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,290
leaves the box it flips and becomes
repulsive and the proton gets attracted

570
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:52,300
repulsive and the proton gets attracted
 

571
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,640
repulsive and the proton gets attracted
then kicked out the other side so it

572
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:53,650
then kicked out the other side so it
 

573
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,740
then kicked out the other side so it
gets a bit faster so you send it but

574
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:55,750
gets a bit faster so you send it but
 

575
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,850
gets a bit faster so you send it but
then you send it back round again and

576
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:56,860
then you send it back round again and
 

577
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,220
then you send it back round again and
it's incredible like the timing of that

578
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,230
it's incredible like the timing of that
 

579
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,930
it's incredible like the timing of that
the synchronization that wait really

580
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:00,940
the synchronization that wait really
 

581
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,060
the synchronization that wait really
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's I think

582
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,070
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's I think
 

583
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,010
yeah yeah yeah yeah that's I think
there's going to be a multiplicative

584
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,020
there's going to be a multiplicative
 

585
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,070
there's going to be a multiplicative
effect on the questions I have is that

586
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,080
effect on the questions I have is that
 

587
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,200
effect on the questions I have is that
okay let me just take that attention for

588
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,210
okay let me just take that attention for
 

589
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,680
okay let me just take that attention for
a second how the orchestration of that

590
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:13,690
a second how the orchestration of that
 

591
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,630
a second how the orchestration of that
is that a fundamentally a hardware

592
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:15,640
is that a fundamentally a hardware
 

593
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,120
is that a fundamentally a hardware
problem or software a problem like what

594
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,130
problem or software a problem like what
 

595
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,850
problem or software a problem like what
how do you get that I mean I might so I

596
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:20,860
how do you get that I mean I might so I
 

597
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,140
how do you get that I mean I might so I
should first of all say I'm not an

598
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,150
should first of all say I'm not an
 

599
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,060
should first of all say I'm not an
engineer so the guys I did not build the

600
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,070
engineer so the guys I did not build the
 

601
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:25,830
engineer so the guys I did not build the
LHC so they're people much much better

602
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:25,840
LHC so they're people much much better
 

603
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,330
LHC so they're people much much better
at this stuff than I for sure but maybe

604
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:29,340
at this stuff than I for sure but maybe
 

605
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,120
at this stuff than I for sure but maybe
but from from your sort of intuition

606
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,130
but from from your sort of intuition
 

607
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:36,690
but from from your sort of intuition
from the the the echoes of what you

608
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:36,700
from the the the echoes of what you
 

609
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,150
from the the the echoes of what you
understand you heard of house design

610
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:39,160
understand you heard of house design
 

611
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,450
understand you heard of house design
what's your sense how what's the

612
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:41,460
what's your sense how what's the
 

613
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,440
what's your sense how what's the
engineering aspects that the

614
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:43,450
engineering aspects that the
 

615
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,690
engineering aspects that the
acceleration bit is not challenging okay

616
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:45,700
acceleration bit is not challenging okay
 

617
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,070
acceleration bit is not challenging okay
okay there is always challenges

618
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,080
okay there is always challenges
 

619
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,340
okay there is always challenges
everything but basically you have these

620
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:49,350
everything but basically you have these
 

621
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,990
everything but basically you have these
the beams that go around you like see

622
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:52,000
the beams that go around you like see
 

623
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,270
the beams that go around you like see
the beams of particles are divided into

624
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:54,280
the beams of particles are divided into
 

625
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,520
the beams of particles are divided into
little bunches so they're called their

626
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:56,530
little bunches so they're called their
 

627
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:58,770
little bunches so they're called their
bit like swarms of bees if you like and

628
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:58,780
bit like swarms of bees if you like and
 

629
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,720
bit like swarms of bees if you like and
there are around I think it's something

630
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:00,730
there are around I think it's something
 

631
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,290
there are around I think it's something
of the order 2000 bunches spaced around

632
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:04,300
of the order 2000 bunches spaced around
 

633
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,360
of the order 2000 bunches spaced around
the ring and they if you were if you're

634
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,370
the ring and they if you were if you're
 

635
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,190
the ring and they if you were if you're
a given point on the ring counting

636
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:08,200
a given point on the ring counting
 

637
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,990
a given point on the ring counting
bunches you get 40 million bunches

638
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,000
bunches you get 40 million bunches
 

639
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
bunches you get 40 million bunches
passing you every second so they come in

640
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:11,770
passing you every second so they come in
 

641
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,860
passing you every second so they come in
like you know just like cars going past

642
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:13,870
like you know just like cars going past
 

643
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:16,770
like you know just like cars going past
from a very fast motorway so you need to

644
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:16,780
from a very fast motorway so you need to
 

645
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,330
from a very fast motorway so you need to
have if you're a electric field that

646
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:18,340
have if you're a electric field that
 

647
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,890
have if you're a electric field that
you're using to accelerate the particles

648
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:19,900
you're using to accelerate the particles
 

649
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,260
you're using to accelerate the particles
that needs to be timed so that as a

650
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,270
that needs to be timed so that as a
 

651
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:24,090
that needs to be timed so that as a
bunch of protons arrives it's got the

652
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:24,100
bunch of protons arrives it's got the
 

653
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,190
bunch of protons arrives it's got the
right sign to attract them and then

654
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,200
right sign to attract them and then
 

655
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,960
right sign to attract them and then
flips at the right moment but I think

656
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:27,970
flips at the right moment but I think
 

657
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,280
flips at the right moment but I think
the the voltage in those boxes

658
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,290
the the voltage in those boxes
 

659
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,290
the the voltage in those boxes
oscillates at hundreds of megahertz so

660
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:31,300
oscillates at hundreds of megahertz so
 

661
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,450
oscillates at hundreds of megahertz so
the beams at like 40 megahertz but is

662
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:33,460
the beams at like 40 megahertz but is
 

663
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,920
the beams at like 40 megahertz but is
oscillating much more quickly than the

664
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:34,930
oscillating much more quickly than the
 

665
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,600
oscillating much more quickly than the
beam so and I think you know it's

666
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:36,610
beam so and I think you know it's
 

667
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:38,700
beam so and I think you know it's
difficult engineering but in principle

668
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:38,710
difficult engineering but in principle
 

669
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:40,230
difficult engineering but in principle
it's not you know a really serious

670
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:40,240
it's not you know a really serious
 

671
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
it's not you know a really serious
challenge the bigger problem this

672
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,250
challenge the bigger problem this
 

673
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:43,980
challenge the bigger problem this
probably engineers like screaming at

674
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:43,990
probably engineers like screaming at
 

675
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,270
probably engineers like screaming at
ureña probably yeah

676
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:45,280
ureña probably yeah
 

677
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:45,660
ureña probably yeah
what

678
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:45,670
what
 

679
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:47,610
what
okay so in terms of coming back to this

680
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:47,620
okay so in terms of coming back to this
 

681
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,530
okay so in terms of coming back to this
thing why is it so big well the reason

682
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:49,540
thing why is it so big well the reason
 

683
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,750
thing why is it so big well the reason
is you wanna get the particles through

684
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
is you wanna get the particles through
 

685
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,400
is you wanna get the particles through
that accelerating element over over

686
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:53,410
that accelerating element over over
 

687
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,810
that accelerating element over over
again so you want to bring them back

688
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:54,820
again so you want to bring them back
 

689
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,610
again so you want to bring them back
round that's why it's round the question

690
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:56,620
round that's why it's round the question
 

691
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,680
round that's why it's round the question
is why couldn't you make it smaller well

692
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:58,690
is why couldn't you make it smaller well
 

693
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:01,320
is why couldn't you make it smaller well
the basic answer is that these particles

694
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,330
the basic answer is that these particles
 

695
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,360
the basic answer is that these particles
are going unbelievably quickly so they

696
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:03,370
are going unbelievably quickly so they
 

697
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,120
are going unbelievably quickly so they
travel at 99.999999 1% of the speed of

698
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:09,130
travel at 99.999999 1% of the speed of
 

699
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:12,000
travel at 99.999999 1% of the speed of
light in the LHC and if you think about

700
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,010
light in the LHC and if you think about
 

701
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,970
light in the LHC and if you think about
say driving your car round a corner high

702
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:14,980
say driving your car round a corner high
 

703
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,910
say driving your car round a corner high
speed if you go fast you need a very you

704
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
speed if you go fast you need a very you
 

705
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,560
speed if you go fast you need a very you
need a lot of friction in the tires to

706
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:19,570
need a lot of friction in the tires to
 

707
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:20,940
need a lot of friction in the tires to
make sure you don't slide off the road

708
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:20,950
make sure you don't slide off the road
 

709
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:24,510
make sure you don't slide off the road
so the the limiting factor is the how

710
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:24,520
so the the limiting factor is the how
 

711
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,550
so the the limiting factor is the how
powerful a magnet can you make because

712
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:26,560
powerful a magnet can you make because
 

713
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
powerful a magnet can you make because
it's what we do is magnets are used to

714
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:28,570
it's what we do is magnets are used to
 

715
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,630
it's what we do is magnets are used to
bend the particles around the ring and

716
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:30,640
bend the particles around the ring and
 

717
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,700
bend the particles around the ring and
essentially the LHC when it was designed

718
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:32,710
essentially the LHC when it was designed
 

719
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,560
essentially the LHC when it was designed
was designed with the most powerful

720
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:34,570
was designed with the most powerful
 

721
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,480
was designed with the most powerful
magnets that could conceivably be built

722
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:36,490
magnets that could conceivably be built
 

723
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,600
magnets that could conceivably be built
at the time and so that's your kind of

724
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:39,610
at the time and so that's your kind of
 

725
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,950
at the time and so that's your kind of
limiting factors if you wanted to make

726
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:40,960
limiting factors if you wanted to make
 

727
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,120
limiting factors if you wanted to make
the machines smaller that means a

728
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,130
the machines smaller that means a
 

729
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,380
the machines smaller that means a
tighter bend you need to have a more

730
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:43,390
tighter bend you need to have a more
 

731
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,870
tighter bend you need to have a more
powerful magnet so it's this toss-up

732
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:45,880
powerful magnet so it's this toss-up
 

733
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:48,540
powerful magnet so it's this toss-up
between how strong your magnets versus

734
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:48,550
between how strong your magnets versus
 

735
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,980
between how strong your magnets versus
how big a tunnel can you afford the

736
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:49,990
how big a tunnel can you afford the
 

737
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:51,240
how big a tunnel can you afford the
bigger the tunnel the weaker the magnets

738
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,250
bigger the tunnel the weaker the magnets
 

739
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,680
bigger the tunnel the weaker the magnets
can be the smaller a tunnel the stronger

740
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:52,690
can be the smaller a tunnel the stronger
 

741
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,830
can be the smaller a tunnel the stronger
they've got to be okay so maybe can we

742
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:55,840
they've got to be okay so maybe can we
 

743
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,440
they've got to be okay so maybe can we
backtrack to the data model and say what

744
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,450
backtrack to the data model and say what
 

745
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,130
backtrack to the data model and say what
kind of particles there are period and

746
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:01,140
kind of particles there are period and
 

747
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:04,110
kind of particles there are period and
maybe the history of kind of assembling

748
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:04,120
maybe the history of kind of assembling
 

749
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,990
maybe the history of kind of assembling
that the standard model of physics and

750
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,000
that the standard model of physics and
 

751
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,960
that the standard model of physics and
then how that leads up to the hopes and

752
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:09,970
then how that leads up to the hopes and
 

753
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:11,640
then how that leads up to the hopes and
dreams and the accomplishments of the

754
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:11,650
dreams and the accomplishments of the
 

755
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,100
dreams and the accomplishments of the
Large Hadron Collider yeah sure okay so

756
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,110
Large Hadron Collider yeah sure okay so
 

757
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:15,960

five minutes
 

761
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,720
five minutes
yeah please okay so okay the story

762
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:18,730
yeah please okay so okay the story
 

763
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:21,930
yeah please okay so okay the story
really begins properly end of the 19th

764
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:21,940
really begins properly end of the 19th
 

765
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,810
really begins properly end of the 19th
century the basic view of matter is that

766
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:24,820
century the basic view of matter is that
 

767
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,030
century the basic view of matter is that
matter is made of atoms and the atoms

spheres like the things we were talking

772
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:31,120
spheres like the things we were talking
 

773
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,940
spheres like the things we were talking
about they don't really exist and

774
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:32,950
about they don't really exist and
 

775
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:34,110
about they don't really exist and
there's you know one atom for every

776
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:34,120
there's you know one atom for every
 

777
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,330
there's you know one atom for every
chemical element as an atom for hydrogen

778
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:36,340
chemical element as an atom for hydrogen
 

779
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,730
chemical element as an atom for hydrogen
for helium for carbon photon etc and

780
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:38,740
for helium for carbon photon etc and
 

781
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,270
for helium for carbon photon etc and
they're all different

782
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,280
they're all different
 

783
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,940
they're all different
then in 1897 experiments done at the

784
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:41,950
then in 1897 experiments done at the
 

785
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,500
then in 1897 experiments done at the
Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge where

786
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:43,510
Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge where
 

787
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:46,350
Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge where
I am still where I'm based showed that

788
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:46,360
I am still where I'm based showed that
 

789
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,540
I am still where I'm based showed that
there are actually smaller particles

790
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:48,550
there are actually smaller particles
 

791
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,520
there are actually smaller particles
inside the atom which eventually became

792
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:50,530
inside the atom which eventually became
 

793
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,990
inside the atom which eventually became
known as electrons these are these

794
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,000
known as electrons these are these
 

795
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,610
known as electrons these are these
negatively charged things that go around

796
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:53,620
negatively charged things that go around
 

797
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,340
negatively charged things that go around

Rutherford very famous nuclear physics

800
00:14:59,220 --> 00:14:59,230
Rutherford very famous nuclear physics
 

801
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,080
Rutherford very famous nuclear physics
nuclear physics shows that the atom has

802
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,090
nuclear physics shows that the atom has
 

803
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,690
nuclear physics shows that the atom has
a tiny nugget in the center which we

804
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:03,700
a tiny nugget in the center which we
 

805
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,100
a tiny nugget in the center which we
call the nucleus which is a positively

806
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:05,110
call the nucleus which is a positively
 

807
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,840
call the nucleus which is a positively
charged object so then by in light

808
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:06,850
charged object so then by in light
 

809
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:08,820
charged object so then by in light
1910-11 we have this model of the atom

810
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:08,830
1910-11 we have this model of the atom
 

811
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,440
1910-11 we have this model of the atom
that we learn in school which is you've

812
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:10,450
that we learn in school which is you've
 

813
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:12,570
that we learn in school which is you've
got a nucleus electrons go round there

814
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:12,580
got a nucleus electrons go round there
 

815
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,690
got a nucleus electrons go round there
fast forward you know a few years the

00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,210
radioactive elements as as bullets and
they fire them other atoms and by

826
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:27,220
they fire them other atoms and by
 

827
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,710
they fire them other atoms and by
banging things into each other they see

828
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:28,720
banging things into each other they see
 

829
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,690
banging things into each other they see
that they can knock bits out of the

00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:30,700
that they can knock bits out of the
 

831
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,490
that they can knock bits out of the
nucleus so these things come out called

832
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:32,500
nucleus so these things come out called
 

833
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,170

neutron so those are the three basic

844
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:45,670
neutron so those are the three basic
 

845
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:47,210

and you have electrons in orbit around

854
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:54,940
and you have electrons in orbit around
 

855
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,180

00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,330
forces of nature that's sort of where we
 

861
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,130
forces of nature that's sort of where we
get to by late 1932 more or less then

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:05,140
get to by late 1932 more or less then
 

863
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,230
get to by late 1932 more or less then
what happens is physics is nice and neat

864
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:07,240
what happens is physics is nice and neat
 

865
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,030
what happens is physics is nice and neat
in 1932 everything looks great got three

866
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
in 1932 everything looks great got three
 

867
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,230
in 1932 everything looks great got three
particles and all the atoms are made of

868
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:10,240
particles and all the atoms are made of
 

869
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,290
particles and all the atoms are made of
that's fine but then cloud chamber

870
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:13,300
that's fine but then cloud chamber
 

871
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
that's fine but then cloud chamber
experiments these are devices that can

872
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,310
experiments these are devices that can
 

873
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:17,250
experiments these are devices that can
be used to the first devices capable of

874
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,260
be used to the first devices capable of
 

875
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,870
be used to the first devices capable of
imaging subatomic particles so you can

876
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
imaging subatomic particles so you can
 

877
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,310
imaging subatomic particles so you can
see their tracks and they use to study

878
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,320
see their tracks and they use to study
 

879
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,710
see their tracks and they use to study
cosmic rays particles that come from

880
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:22,720
cosmic rays particles that come from
 

881
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
cosmic rays particles that come from
outer space and bang into the atmosphere

882
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:24,490
outer space and bang into the atmosphere
 

883
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,560
outer space and bang into the atmosphere
and in these experiments people start to

884
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:28,570
and in these experiments people start to
 

885
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:29,910
and in these experiments people start to
see a whole load of new particles so

886
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
see a whole load of new particles so
 

887
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,380
see a whole load of new particles so
they discover for one thing antimatter

888
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:31,390
they discover for one thing antimatter
 

889
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,600
they discover for one thing antimatter
which is a sort of a mirror image of the

890
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:33,610
which is a sort of a mirror image of the
 

891
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,190
which is a sort of a mirror image of the
particles so we discovered that there's

892
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:35,200
particles so we discovered that there's
 

893
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,990
particles so we discovered that there's
also as well as a negatively charged

894
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,000
also as well as a negatively charged
 

895
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:37,950
also as well as a negatively charged
electron there's something called a

896
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:37,960
electron there's something called a
 

897
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,510
electron there's something called a
positron which is a positively charged

898
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:39,520
positron which is a positively charged
 

899
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,800
positron which is a positively charged
version of the electron and there's an

900
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:40,810
version of the electron and there's an
 

901
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,990
version of the electron and there's an
antiproton which is negatively charged

902
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:43,000
antiproton which is negatively charged
 

903
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,060
antiproton which is negatively charged
and and then a whole load of other weird

904
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:45,070
and and then a whole load of other weird
 

905
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,680
and and then a whole load of other weird
particle start to get discovered and no

906
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:46,690
particle start to get discovered and no
 

907
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,050
particle start to get discovered and no
one really knows what they are this is

908
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:49,060
one really knows what they are this is
 

909
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,270
one really knows what they are this is
known as the zoo of particles are these

910
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:51,280
known as the zoo of particles are these
 

911
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,770
known as the zoo of particles are these
discoveries fundamentally first

912
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:52,780
discoveries fundamentally first
 

913
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,620
discoveries fundamentally first
theoretical discoveries or the

914
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:55,630
theoretical discoveries or the
 

915
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,710
theoretical discoveries or the
discoveries in an experiment so like

916
00:16:58,710 --> 00:16:58,720
discoveries in an experiment so like
 

917
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,600
discoveries in an experiment so like
well yeah what was the process of

918
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:00,610
well yeah what was the process of
 

919
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:03,750
well yeah what was the process of
discovery for these early it's a mixture

920
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:03,760
discovery for these early it's a mixture
 

921
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,130
discovery for these early it's a mixture
I mean that the early stuff around the

922
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:05,140
I mean that the early stuff around the
 

923
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,080
I mean that the early stuff around the
atom is really experimentally driven

924
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,090
atom is really experimentally driven
 

925
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,300
atom is really experimentally driven
it's not based on some theory it's

926
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,310
it's not based on some theory it's
 

927
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,550
it's not based on some theory it's
exploration in the lab using equipment

928
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:11,560
exploration in the lab using equipment
 

929
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,110
exploration in the lab using equipment
so it's really people just figuring out

930
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
so it's really people just figuring out
 

931
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,760
so it's really people just figuring out
hands-on with the fenomena figuring out

932
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:14,770
hands-on with the fenomena figuring out
 

933
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,740
hands-on with the fenomena figuring out
what these things are the theory comes a

934
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:16,750
what these things are the theory comes a
 

935
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,269
what these things are the theory comes a
bit later that there is that's not

936
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:18,279
bit later that there is that's not
 

937
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,069
bit later that there is that's not
always the case so in the discovery of

938
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:20,079
always the case so in the discovery of
 

939
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,740
always the case so in the discovery of
the anti-electron the positron that was

940
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:22,750
the anti-electron the positron that was
 

941
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,590
the anti-electron the positron that was
predicted from quantum mechanics and

942
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:25,600
predicted from quantum mechanics and
 

943
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,830
predicted from quantum mechanics and
relativity by a very clever theoretical

944
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:28,840
relativity by a very clever theoretical
 

945
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,570
relativity by a very clever theoretical
physicist called Paul Dirac who was

946
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:30,580
physicist called Paul Dirac who was
 

947
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,519
physicist called Paul Dirac who was
probably the second brightest you know

948
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:32,529
probably the second brightest you know
 

949
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:34,320
probably the second brightest you know
physicist of the 20th century apart from

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,330
physicist of the 20th century apart from
 

951
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,909
physicist of the 20th century apart from
Einstein but isn't as well anywhere near

952
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
Einstein but isn't as well anywhere near
 

953
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,440
Einstein but isn't as well anywhere near
as well known so he predicted the

954
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:37,450
as well known so he predicted the
 

955
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,419
as well known so he predicted the
existence of the anti electron from

956
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:39,429
existence of the anti electron from
 

957
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:41,760
existence of the anti electron from
basically a combination of the theories

958
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:41,770
basically a combination of the theories
 

959
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,260
basically a combination of the theories
of quantum mechanics and relativity and

960
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:43,270
of quantum mechanics and relativity and
 

961
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,700
of quantum mechanics and relativity and
it was discovered about a year after he

962
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:44,710
it was discovered about a year after he
 

963
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:47,190
it was discovered about a year after he
made their prediction what happens when

964
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
made their prediction what happens when
 

965
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,320
made their prediction what happens when
an electron meets a positron they

966
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:49,330
an electron meets a positron they
 

967
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,560
an electron meets a positron they
annihilate each other so if you when you

968
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:52,570
annihilate each other so if you when you
 

969
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:53,519
annihilate each other so if you when you
bring a particle in its antiparticle

970
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:53,529
bring a particle in its antiparticle
 

971
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:56,250
bring a particle in its antiparticle
together they they react well they react

972
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:56,260
together they they react well they react
 

973
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,750
together they they react well they react
they just wipe each other out and they

974
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:57,760
they just wipe each other out and they
 

975
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,760
they just wipe each other out and they
turn their mass is turned into energy

976
00:17:59,760 --> 00:17:59,770
turn their mass is turned into energy
 

977
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,799
turn their mass is turned into energy
usually in the form of photons so you'll

978
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:01,809
usually in the form of photons so you'll
 

979
00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:06,000
usually in the form of photons so you'll
get light produced so when you have that

980
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,010
get light produced so when you have that
 

981
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:07,830
get light produced so when you have that
kind of situation why why does the

982
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:07,840
kind of situation why why does the
 

983
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,419
kind of situation why why does the
universe exists at all if there's matter

984
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:09,429
universe exists at all if there's matter
 

985
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:11,039
universe exists at all if there's matter
in any matter oh god now we're getting

986
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:11,049
in any matter oh god now we're getting
 

987
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,490
in any matter oh god now we're getting
into the really big questions so you

988
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:14,500
into the really big questions so you
 

989
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,240
into the really big questions so you
want to go there now

990
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:15,250
want to go there now
 

991
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,760
want to go there now
yeah that's me maybe let's go there

992
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:17,770
yeah that's me maybe let's go there
 

993
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,649
yeah that's me maybe let's go there
later that's because I mean that is a

994
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:19,659
later that's because I mean that is a
 

995
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,320
later that's because I mean that is a
very big question yeah let's let's take

996
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:22,330
very big question yeah let's let's take
 

997
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:24,690
very big question yeah let's let's take
it slow with the standard model so okay

998
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:24,700
it slow with the standard model so okay
 

999
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,880
it slow with the standard model so okay
so there's matter and antimatter in the

1000
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:26,890
so there's matter and antimatter in the
 

1001
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:28,019
so there's matter and antimatter in the
30s mmm

1002
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:28,029
30s mmm
 

1003
00:18:28,029 --> 00:18:30,510
30s mmm
so what else so matter antimatter and

1004
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:30,520
so what else so matter antimatter and
 

1005
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,460
so what else so matter antimatter and
then a load of new particles start

1006
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,470
then a load of new particles start
 

1007
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,190
then a load of new particles start
turning up in these cosmic ray

1008
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:35,200
turning up in these cosmic ray
 

1009
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,860
turning up in these cosmic ray
experiments first of all and they don't

1010
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:37,870
experiments first of all and they don't
 

1011
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,990
experiments first of all and they don't
seem to be particles that make up atoms

1012
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:40,000
seem to be particles that make up atoms
 

1013
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,210
seem to be particles that make up atoms
there's something else they all mostly

1014
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:42,220
there's something else they all mostly
 

1015
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,220
there's something else they all mostly
interact with a strong nuclear force so

1016
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:44,230
interact with a strong nuclear force so
 

1017
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,840
interact with a strong nuclear force so
they're a bit like protons and neutrons

1018
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:45,850
they're a bit like protons and neutrons
 

1019
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,710
they're a bit like protons and neutrons
and by in the 1960s in America

1020
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:49,720
and by in the 1960s in America
 

1021
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,149
and by in the 1960s in America
particularly but also in Europe and

1022
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:51,159
particularly but also in Europe and

accelerators so these are the

1026
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:54,610
accelerators so these are the
 

1027
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:56,519
accelerators so these are the
forerunners of the LHC so big ring

1028
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:56,529
forerunners of the LHC so big ring
 

1029
00:18:56,529 --> 00:18:57,960
forerunners of the LHC so big ring
shaped machines that were you know

1030
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:57,970
shaped machines that were you know
 

1031
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,700
shaped machines that were you know
hundreds of meters long which in those

1032
00:18:59,700 --> 00:18:59,710
hundreds of meters long which in those
 

1033
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,289
hundreds of meters long which in those
days was enormous you never you know

1034
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:01,299
days was enormous you never you know
 

1035
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,820
days was enormous you never you know
most physics up until that point had

1036
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:02,830
most physics up until that point had
 

1037
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,740
most physics up until that point had
been done in labs in universities you

1038
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:04,750
been done in labs in universities you
 

1039
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,570
been done in labs in universities you
know with small bits of kit so this is a

1040
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:06,580
know with small bits of kit so this is a
 

1041
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,580
know with small bits of kit so this is a
big change and when these accelerators

1042
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:08,590
big change and when these accelerators
 

1043
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,870
big change and when these accelerators
are built they start to find they can

1044
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:09,880
are built they start to find they can
 

1045
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,299
are built they start to find they can
produce even more of these particles so

1046
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:12,309
produce even more of these particles so
 

1047
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:14,700
produce even more of these particles so
I don't know the exact numbers but by

1048
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:14,710
I don't know the exact numbers but by
 

1049
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,210
I don't know the exact numbers but by
around 1960 there are of order a hundred

1050
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:18,220
around 1960 there are of order a hundred
 

1051
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,649
around 1960 there are of order a hundred
of these things that have been

1052
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:19,659
of these things that have been
 

1053
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,149
of these things that have been
discovered and physicists are kind of

1054
00:19:21,149 --> 00:19:21,159
discovered and physicists are kind of
 

1055
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:24,000
discovered and physicists are kind of
tearing the hair out because physics is

1056
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,010
tearing the hair out because physics is
 

1057
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,470
tearing the hair out because physics is
all about simplification and suddenly

1058
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:25,480
all about simplification and suddenly
 

1059
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,049
all about simplification and suddenly
what was simple as

1060
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:27,059
what was simple as
 

1061
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,180
what was simple as
come messy and complicated and everyone

1062
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,190
come messy and complicated and everyone
 

1063
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,649
come messy and complicated and everyone
sort of wants to understand what's going

1064
00:19:30,649 --> 00:19:30,659
sort of wants to understand what's going
 

1065
00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:33,200
sort of wants to understand what's going
on it's a quick kind of a side and the

1066
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,210
on it's a quick kind of a side and the
 

1067
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,379
on it's a quick kind of a side and the
probably really dumb question but how is

1068
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:36,389
probably really dumb question but how is
 

1069
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:38,419
probably really dumb question but how is
it possible to take something like a

1070
00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:38,429
it possible to take something like a
 

1071
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:42,350
it possible to take something like a
like a photon or electron and be able to

1072
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:42,360
like a photon or electron and be able to
 

1073
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,389
like a photon or electron and be able to
control it enough like to be able to do

1074
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:47,399
control it enough like to be able to do
 

1075
00:19:47,399 --> 00:19:49,249
control it enough like to be able to do
a controlled experiment where you

1076
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:49,259
a controlled experiment where you
 

1077
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:51,110
a controlled experiment where you
collide it against something else

1078
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:51,120
collide it against something else
 

1079
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,440
collide it against something else
yeah is that is that that seems like an

1080
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:54,450
yeah is that is that that seems like an
 

1081
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,769
yeah is that is that that seems like an
exceptionally difficult engineering

1082
00:19:57,769 --> 00:19:57,779
exceptionally difficult engineering
 

1083
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,480
exceptionally difficult engineering
challenge because you mention vacuum to

1084
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,490
challenge because you mention vacuum to
 

1085
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,369
challenge because you mention vacuum to
so you basically want to remove every

1086
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:01,379
so you basically want to remove every
 

1087
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:04,159
so you basically want to remove every
other distraction and really focus on

1088
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:04,169
other distraction and really focus on
 

1089
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:05,629
other distraction and really focus on
this collision how difficult of an

1090
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:05,639
this collision how difficult of an
 

1091
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,129
this collision how difficult of an
engineering challenge is that just to

1092
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:07,139
engineering challenge is that just to
 

1093
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:10,249
engineering challenge is that just to
get a sense and it's very hard I mean in

1094
00:20:10,249 --> 00:20:10,259
get a sense and it's very hard I mean in
 

1095
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,539
get a sense and it's very hard I mean in
the early days particularly when the

1096
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:11,549
the early days particularly when the
 

1097
00:20:11,549 --> 00:20:13,070
the early days particularly when the
first accelerators are being built in

1098
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:13,080
first accelerators are being built in
 

1099
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,480
first accelerators are being built in
like 1932 Ernest Lawrence builds the

1100
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:17,490
like 1932 Ernest Lawrence builds the
 

1101
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:19,009
like 1932 Ernest Lawrence builds the
first what we call the cyclotron which

1102
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:19,019
first what we call the cyclotron which
 

1103
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,440
first what we call the cyclotron which
is like a little celery - this big or so

1104
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:21,450
is like a little celery - this big or so
 

1105
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,850
is like a little celery - this big or so
there's another widely they're big

1106
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:22,860
there's another widely they're big
 

1107
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,769
there's another widely they're big
there's a tiny little thing yeah I mean

1108
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:24,779
there's a tiny little thing yeah I mean
 

1109
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:28,220
there's a tiny little thing yeah I mean
so most of the first accelerators were

1110
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:28,230
so most of the first accelerators were
 

1111
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:31,129
so most of the first accelerators were
what we call fixed argot experiments so

1112
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:31,139
what we call fixed argot experiments so
 

1113
00:20:31,139 --> 00:20:33,409
what we call fixed argot experiments so
you had a ring you accelerate particles

1114
00:20:33,409 --> 00:20:33,419
you had a ring you accelerate particles
 

1115
00:20:33,419 --> 00:20:34,639
you had a ring you accelerate particles
around the ring and then you fire them

1116
00:20:34,639 --> 00:20:34,649
around the ring and then you fire them
 

1117
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:38,029
around the ring and then you fire them
out the side into some target so is eat

1118
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:38,039
out the side into some target so is eat
 

1119
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,190
out the side into some target so is eat
that makes the kind of the colliding bit

1120
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:40,200
that makes the kind of the colliding bit
 

1121
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,509
that makes the kind of the colliding bit
is relatively straightforward to use

1122
00:20:41,509 --> 00:20:41,519
is relatively straightforward to use
 

1123
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:43,190
is relatively straightforward to use
fire it whatever it is you want to fire

1124
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:43,200
fire it whatever it is you want to fire
 

1125
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,859
fire it whatever it is you want to fire
it out the hard bit is the steering the

1126
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:45,869
it out the hard bit is the steering the
 

1127
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,269
it out the hard bit is the steering the
beams with the magnetic fields getting

1128
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:47,279
beams with the magnetic fields getting
 

1129
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,859
beams with the magnetic fields getting
you know strong enough electric fields

1130
00:20:48,859 --> 00:20:48,869
you know strong enough electric fields
 

1131
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:50,029
you know strong enough electric fields
to accelerate them all that kind of

1132
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:50,039
to accelerate them all that kind of
 

1133
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:50,299
to accelerate them all that kind of
stuff

1134
00:20:50,299 --> 00:20:50,309
stuff
 

1135
00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:52,430
stuff
the first colliders where you have two

1136
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:52,440
the first colliders where you have two
 

1137
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,269
the first colliders where you have two
beams colliding head-on that comes later

1138
00:20:56,269 --> 00:20:56,279
beams colliding head-on that comes later
 

1139
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,810
beams colliding head-on that comes later
and I don't think it's done until maybe

1140
00:20:59,810 --> 00:20:59,820
and I don't think it's done until maybe
 

1141
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,310
and I don't think it's done until maybe
the 1980s

1142
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:01,320
the 1980s
 

1143
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,249
the 1980s
I'm not entirely sure but it takes is

1144
00:21:04,249 --> 00:21:04,259
I'm not entirely sure but it takes is
 

1145
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,200
I'm not entirely sure but it takes is
much harder problem that's crazy because

1146
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:06,210
much harder problem that's crazy because
 

1147
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,200
much harder problem that's crazy because
yet it's like perfectly you had them to

1148
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:09,210
yet it's like perfectly you had them to
 

1149
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,879
yet it's like perfectly you had them to
hit each other I mean we're talking

1150
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:10,889
hit each other I mean we're talking
 

1151
00:21:10,889 --> 00:21:13,340
hit each other I mean we're talking
about I mean what scale it takes what's

1152
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:13,350
about I mean what scale it takes what's
 

1153
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,359
about I mean what scale it takes what's
this this I mean the temporal thing is a

1154
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:17,369
this this I mean the temporal thing is a
 

1155
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:20,720
this this I mean the temporal thing is a
giant mess but the spatially like the

1156
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:20,730
giant mess but the spatially like the
 

1157
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,109
giant mess but the spatially like the
size mmm it's tiny well to give you a

1158
00:21:24,109 --> 00:21:24,119
size mmm it's tiny well to give you a
 

1159
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:26,180
size mmm it's tiny well to give you a
sense so the LHC beams the

1160
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:26,190
sense so the LHC beams the
 

1161
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:29,600
sense so the LHC beams the
cross-sectional diameter is I think

1162
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:29,610
cross-sectional diameter is I think
 

1163
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:33,590
cross-sectional diameter is I think
around a dozen or so microns so you know

1164
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:33,600
around a dozen or so microns so you know
 

1165
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,310
around a dozen or so microns so you know
ten ten millionths of a meters then a

1166
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:37,320
ten ten millionths of a meters then a
 

1167
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,460
ten ten millionths of a meters then a
beam sorry just to clarify a beam

1168
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:40,470
beam sorry just to clarify a beam
 

1169
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,620
beam sorry just to clarify a beam
how many is it the bunches that you

1170
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:42,630
how many is it the bunches that you
 

1171
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,720
how many is it the bunches that you
mentioned yes multiple poles is just one

1172
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:44,730
mentioned yes multiple poles is just one
 

1173
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,790
mentioned yes multiple poles is just one
part oh no no the bunches contained say

1174
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:46,800
part oh no no the bunches contained say
 

1175
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,130
part oh no no the bunches contained say
a hundred billion protons each so a

1176
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:49,140
a hundred billion protons each so a
 

1177
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,140
a hundred billion protons each so a
bunch is not really one shape they're

1178
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,150
bunch is not really one shape they're
 

1179
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,670
bunch is not really one shape they're
actually quite long they're like 30

1180
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:52,680
actually quite long they're like 30
 

1181
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,350
actually quite long they're like 30
centimeters long but thinner than a

1182
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:54,360
centimeters long but thinner than a
 

1183
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,260
centimeters long but thinner than a
human hair so like very very narrow long

1184
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,270
human hair so like very very narrow long
 

1185
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:58,910
human hair so like very very narrow long
sort of object so those are the things

1186
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:58,920
sort of object so those are the things
 

1187
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,520
sort of object so those are the things
so what happens in the LHC is you steer

1188
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:01,530
so what happens in the LHC is you steer
 

1189
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,740
so what happens in the LHC is you steer
the beams so that they cross in the

1190
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:03,750
the beams so that they cross in the
 

1191
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,070
the beams so that they cross in the
middle of the detector so the basically

1192
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,080
middle of the detector so the basically
 

1193
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,900
middle of the detector so the basically
have these swarms of protons are flying

1194
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:08,910
have these swarms of protons are flying
 

1195
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,120
have these swarms of protons are flying
through each other and most of that you

1196
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,130
through each other and most of that you
 

1197
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,500
through each other and most of that you
have so you have 100 billion coming one

1198
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:12,510
have so you have 100 billion coming one
 

1199
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:15,950
have so you have 100 billion coming one
way 100 billion another way maybe 10 of

1200
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:15,960
way 100 billion another way maybe 10 of
 

1201
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,930
way 100 billion another way maybe 10 of
them will hit each other okay so this

1202
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:17,940
them will hit each other okay so this
 

1203
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,580
them will hit each other okay so this
okay that makes a lot more sense that's

1204
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:19,590
okay that makes a lot more sense that's
 

1205
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,500
okay that makes a lot more sense that's
nice so there you're trying to use sort

1206
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:21,510
nice so there you're trying to use sort
 

1207
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,810
nice so there you're trying to use sort
of it's like probabilistically you're

1208
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:23,820
of it's like probabilistically you're
 

1209
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,670
of it's like probabilistically you're
not you can't make a single particle

1210
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:25,680
not you can't make a single particle
 

1211
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,110
not you can't make a single particle
collide with a single oh yeah so that's

1212
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:27,120
collide with a single oh yeah so that's
 

1213
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,340
collide with a single oh yeah so that's
not an efficient way to do it you'd be

1214
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:28,350
not an efficient way to do it you'd be
 

1215
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,200
not an efficient way to do it you'd be
waiting a very long time to get anything

1216
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:30,210
waiting a very long time to get anything
 

1217
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,410
waiting a very long time to get anything
yeah so you you're basically right see

1218
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:33,420
yeah so you you're basically right see
 

1219
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,740
yeah so you you're basically right see
you're relying on probability to be that

1220
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:36,750
you're relying on probability to be that
 

1221
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,240
you're relying on probability to be that
some fraction of them are gonna collide

1222
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,250
some fraction of them are gonna collide
 

1223
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,090
some fraction of them are gonna collide
yeah and then you know which is it's

1224
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,100
yeah and then you know which is it's
 

1225
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,700
yeah and then you know which is it's
it's a it's a swarm of the same kind of

1226
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:43,710
it's a it's a swarm of the same kind of
 

1227
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:45,380
it's a it's a swarm of the same kind of
particle so it doesn't matter which ones

1228
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:45,390
particle so it doesn't matter which ones
 

1229
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,150
particle so it doesn't matter which ones
each other exactly I mean that that's

1230
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,160
each other exactly I mean that that's
 

1231
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,530
each other exactly I mean that that's
not to say it's not hard you've got a

1232
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:48,540
not to say it's not hard you've got a
 

1233
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,780
not to say it's not hard you've got a
one of the challenges to make the

1234
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:50,790
one of the challenges to make the
 

1235
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,520
one of the challenges to make the
collisions work is you have to squash

1236
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:52,530
collisions work is you have to squash
 

1237
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:54,950
collisions work is you have to squash
these beams to very very the basic their

1238
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:54,960
these beams to very very the basic their
 

1239
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,240
these beams to very very the basic their
narrower they are the better because the

1240
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,250
narrower they are the better because the
 

1241
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,880
narrower they are the better because the
higher the chances of them colliding if

1242
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:58,890
higher the chances of them colliding if
 

1243
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,080
higher the chances of them colliding if
you think about two flocks of birds

1244
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,090
you think about two flocks of birds
 

1245
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:01,400
you think about two flocks of birds
flying through each other

1246
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:01,410
flying through each other
 

1247
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:03,230
flying through each other
the birds are all far apart in the

1248
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,240
the birds are all far apart in the
 

1249
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,490
the birds are all far apart in the
flocks there's not much chance that

1250
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:04,500
flocks there's not much chance that
 

1251
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,570
flocks there's not much chance that
they'll collide if they're all flying

1252
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:05,580
they'll collide if they're all flying
 

1253
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,130
they'll collide if they're all flying
densely together and they very much more

1254
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:07,140
densely together and they very much more
 

1255
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,570
densely together and they very much more
likely to collide with each other so

1256
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:08,580
likely to collide with each other so
 

1257
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:11,090
likely to collide with each other so
that's the sort of problem it's tuning

1258
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,100
that's the sort of problem it's tuning
 

1259
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,650
that's the sort of problem it's tuning
those magnetic fields getting them angry

1260
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:12,660
those magnetic fields getting them angry
 

1261
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,060
those magnetic fields getting them angry
feels powerful not that you squash the

1262
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,070
feels powerful not that you squash the
 

1263
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:15,890
feels powerful not that you squash the
beams and focus them so that you get

1264
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:15,900
beams and focus them so that you get
 

1265
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,990
beams and focus them so that you get
enough collisions that's super cool do

1266
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
enough collisions that's super cool do
 

1267
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,700
enough collisions that's super cool do
you know how much software is involved

1268
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:19,710
you know how much software is involved
 

1269
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,500
you know how much software is involved
here I mean it's sort of I come in the

1270
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:21,510
here I mean it's sort of I come in the
 

1271
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,950
here I mean it's sort of I come in the
software world and it's fascinating this

1272
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:24,960
software world and it's fascinating this
 

1273
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,560
software world and it's fascinating this
seems like it's a software is buggy and

1274
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:27,570
seems like it's a software is buggy and
 

1275
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,530
seems like it's a software is buggy and
messy and so like you almost don't want

1276
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:30,540
messy and so like you almost don't want
 

1277
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,300
messy and so like you almost don't want
to rely on software too much like if you

1278
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:32,310
to rely on software too much like if you
 

1279
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,120
to rely on software too much like if you
do it has to be like low-level like

1280
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:34,130
do it has to be like low-level like
 

1281
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,590
do it has to be like low-level like
Fortran style programming do you know

1282
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:36,600
Fortran style programming do you know
 

1283
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,690
Fortran style programming do you know
how much software isn't a Large Hadron

1284
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:38,700
how much software isn't a Large Hadron
 

1285
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,760
how much software isn't a Large Hadron
Collider I mean it depends at which

1286
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:40,770
Collider I mean it depends at which
 

1287
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:42,320
Collider I mean it depends at which
level a lot I mean the whole thing is

1288
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:42,330
level a lot I mean the whole thing is
 

1289
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,090
level a lot I mean the whole thing is
obviously computer-controlled so I mean

1290
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:44,100
obviously computer-controlled so I mean
 

1291
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,830
obviously computer-controlled so I mean
I I don't know a huge amount about how

1292
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:45,840
I I don't know a huge amount about how
 

1293
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,020
I I don't know a huge amount about how
the software for the actual accelerator

1294
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:48,030
the software for the actual accelerator
 

1295
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:50,510
the software for the actual accelerator
works but you know I've been in the

1296
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:50,520
works but you know I've been in the
 

1297
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,130
works but you know I've been in the
control center so has CERN there's this

1298
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:52,140
control center so has CERN there's this
 

1299
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,140
control center so has CERN there's this
big control room which is like

1300
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,150
big control room which is like
 

1301
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,730
big control room which is like
bit like a NASA mission control with big

1302
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:55,740
bit like a NASA mission control with big
 

1303
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,320
bit like a NASA mission control with big
banks of you know desk where the engine

1304
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,330
banks of you know desk where the engine
 

1305
00:23:57,330 --> 00:23:59,120
banks of you know desk where the engine
is sit and they monitor the LHC because

1306
00:23:59,120 --> 00:23:59,130
is sit and they monitor the LHC because
 

1307
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,410
is sit and they monitor the LHC because
you obviously can't be in the tunnel

1308
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:00,420
you obviously can't be in the tunnel
 

1309
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:02,270
you obviously can't be in the tunnel
when it's running so everything's remote

1310
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:02,280
when it's running so everything's remote
 

1311
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:06,260
when it's running so everything's remote
I mean one sort of anecdote about the

1312
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:06,270
I mean one sort of anecdote about the
 

1313
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,020
I mean one sort of anecdote about the
sort of software side in 2008 when the

1314
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,030
sort of software side in 2008 when the
 

1315
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,880
sort of software side in 2008 when the
LHC first switched on they had this big

1316
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:10,890
LHC first switched on they had this big
 

1317
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,430
LHC first switched on they had this big
launch event and then you know big press

1318
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:13,440
launch event and then you know big press
 

1319
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,560
launch event and then you know big press
conference party to inaugurate the

1320
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:15,570
conference party to inaugurate the
 

1321
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:17,990
conference party to inaugurate the
machine and about ten days after that

1322
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:18,000
machine and about ten days after that
 

1323
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,540
machine and about ten days after that
they were doing some tests and the this

1324
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:20,550
they were doing some tests and the this
 

1325
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,910
they were doing some tests and the this
dramatic event happened where a huge

1326
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:22,920
dramatic event happened where a huge
 

1327
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,260
dramatic event happened where a huge
explosion basically took place in a

1328
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:24,270
explosion basically took place in a
 

1329
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,420
explosion basically took place in a
tunnel that destroyed were damaged badly

1330
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:26,430
tunnel that destroyed were damaged badly
 

1331
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:28,400
tunnel that destroyed were damaged badly
damaged about about half a kilometer of

1332
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:28,410
damaged about about half a kilometer of
 

1333
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,010
damaged about about half a kilometer of
the machine but the story is viewed the

1334
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,020
the machine but the story is viewed the
 

1335
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,300
the machine but the story is viewed the
engineers here in the control room that

1336
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:32,310
engineers here in the control room that
 

1337
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,700
engineers here in the control room that
day they'd one guy told me the story

1338
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:34,710
day they'd one guy told me the story
 

1339
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:35,810
day they'd one guy told me the story
about you know basically there's all

1340
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820
about you know basically there's all
 

1341
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,010
about you know basically there's all
these screens they have in the control

1342
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,020
these screens they have in the control
 

1343
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:39,470
these screens they have in the control
room started going red so these alarms

1344
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:39,480
room started going red so these alarms
 

1345
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,960
room started going red so these alarms
like you know kind of in software going

1346
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:41,970
like you know kind of in software going
 

1347
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,160
like you know kind of in software going
off and then they assume that lists all

1348
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:43,170
off and then they assume that lists all
 

1349
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,510
off and then they assume that lists all
wrong with the software cuz there's no

1350
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:44,520
wrong with the software cuz there's no
 

1351
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,700
wrong with the software cuz there's no
way something this catastrophic could

1352
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:46,710
way something this catastrophic could
 

1353
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:49,130
way something this catastrophic could
have could have happened yeah but I mean

1354
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,140
have could have happened yeah but I mean
 

1355
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,860
have could have happened yeah but I mean
when I worked on one when I was a PhD

1356
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:51,870
when I worked on one when I was a PhD
 

1357
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,130
when I worked on one when I was a PhD
student one of my Jobs was to help to

1358
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:55,140
student one of my Jobs was to help to
 

1359
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,480
student one of my Jobs was to help to
maintain the software that's used to

1360
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:56,490
maintain the software that's used to
 

1361
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,670
maintain the software that's used to
control the detector that we work on and

1362
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:58,680
control the detector that we work on and
 

1363
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,700
control the detector that we work on and
that was it's relatively robust not so

1364
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:01,710
that was it's relatively robust not so
 

1365
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:02,960
that was it's relatively robust not so
you don't want it to be too fancy you

1366
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:02,970
you don't want it to be too fancy you
 

1367
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,190
you don't want it to be too fancy you
don't want to sort of fall over too

1368
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,200
don't want to sort of fall over too
 

1369
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,160
don't want to sort of fall over too
easily the more clever stuff comes when

1370
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,170
easily the more clever stuff comes when
 

1371
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:08,270
easily the more clever stuff comes when
you're talking about analyzing the data

1372
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:08,280
you're talking about analyzing the data
 

1373
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,560
you're talking about analyzing the data
and that's where they're sort of you

1374
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,570
and that's where they're sort of you
 

1375
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,810
and that's where they're sort of you
know are we jumping around too much do

1376
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:11,820
know are we jumping around too much do
 

1377
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,250
know are we jumping around too much do
we finish for the standard model we

1378
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:13,260
we finish for the standard model we
 

1379

1387
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,310
particles go back there if it's okay
okay that's take us the rest of the

1388
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:25,320
okay that's take us the rest of the
 

1389
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,170
okay that's take us the rest of the
history of physics in the 20th century

1390
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,180
history of physics in the 20th century
 

1391
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,700
history of physics in the 20th century
okay sure

1392
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:28,710
okay sure
 

1393
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:32,090
okay sure
okay so circa 1960 you have this you

1394
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:32,100
okay so circa 1960 you have this you
 

1395
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,800
okay so circa 1960 you have this you
have these hundred or so particles it's

1396
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:33,810
have these hundred or so particles it's
 

1397
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:34,940
have these hundred or so particles it's
a bit like the periodic table all over

1398
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:34,950
a bit like the periodic table all over
 

1399
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,100
a bit like the periodic table all over
again so you've got like like having a

1400
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:37,110
again so you've got like like having a
 

1401
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,540
again so you've got like like having a
hundred elements sort of a bit like that

1402
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:38,550
hundred elements sort of a bit like that
 

1403
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,910
hundred elements sort of a bit like that
and people try to start to try to impose

1404
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:40,920
and people try to start to try to impose
 

1405
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:44,930
and people try to start to try to impose
some order so Murray Gelman he's a

York he realizes that there are these
 

1411
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:51,830
York he realizes that there are these
symmetries in these particles that if

1412
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:51,840
symmetries in these particles that if
 

1413
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,180
symmetries in these particles that if
you arrange them in certain ways that

1414
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:53,190
you arrange them in certain ways that
 

1415
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,860
you arrange them in certain ways that
they relate to each other and he uses

00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,730
these symmetry principles to predict the
existence of particles that haven't been

00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:58,740
existence of particles that haven't been
 

1421
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,260
existence of particles that haven't been
discovered which are then discovered in

00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,270
discovered which are then discovered in
 

1423
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,390
discovered which are then discovered in
accelerators so this starts to suggest

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
accelerators so this starts to suggest
 

1425
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,130

there's not just random collections of

there's not just random collections of

there's not just random collections of

the these symmetries arise because just

1438
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,270
the these symmetries arise because just
 

1439
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,789
the these symmetries arise because just
like the patterns in the periodic table

1440
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
like the patterns in the periodic table
 

1441
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,500
like the patterns in the periodic table
arise because atoms are made of

arise because atoms are made of
 

1443

arise because atoms are made of
electrons and protons that these

electrons and protons that these
 

1445
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,280
electrons and protons that these
patterns are due to the fact that these

00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,290
patterns are due to the fact that these
 

1447
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,900
patterns are due to the fact that these
particles are made of smaller things and

particles are made of smaller things and
 

1449
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,390
particles are made of smaller things and
they are called quarks so these are the

they are called quarks so these are the
 

1451
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,890
they are called quarks so these are the

there are kind of theoretical

00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:53,240
her so the idea if protons and neutrons
say made of quarks you should work to

say made of quarks you should work to
 

1473
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,250
say made of quarks you should work to
knock a quark out and see the quark that

00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:55,260
knock a quark out and see the quark that

actually managed to do that really no so

actually managed to do that really no so

light at protons and when you do these

1492
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:17,190
light at protons and when you do these
 

1493
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,159

hard objects inside the proton so it's a

1498
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:25,710
hard objects inside the proton so it's a
 

1499
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,010
hard objects inside the proton so it's a
bit like taking an x-ray of the proton

1500
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:28,020
bit like taking an x-ray of the proton

00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,850
you're firing these very light
high-energy particles and they're

1504
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:31,860
high-energy particles and they're
 

1505
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,919
high-energy particles and they're
pinging off little things inside the

proton that are like ball bearings if
 

1509
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,299
proton that are like ball bearings if
you like so you actually that way they

1510
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:38,309
you like so you actually that way they
 

1511
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:40,640
you like so you actually that way they
resolve that there are three things

1512
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:40,650
resolve that there are three things
 

1513
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,860
resolve that there are three things
inside the proton which are quarks the

1514
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:42,870
inside the proton which are quarks the
 

1515
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,690
inside the proton which are quarks the
quarks that governance why I could

1516
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:44,700
quarks that governance why I could
 

1517
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,490
quarks that governance why I could
predicted so that's really the evidence

1518
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:46,500
predicted so that's really the evidence
 

1519
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,320
predicted so that's really the evidence
that convinces people that these things

1520
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,330
that convinces people that these things
 

1521
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,510
that convinces people that these things
are real the fact that we've never seen

1522
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:50,520
are real the fact that we've never seen
 

1523
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,100
are real the fact that we've never seen
one in an experiment directly they're

1524
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,110
one in an experiment directly they're
 

1525
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,940
one in an experiment directly they're
always stuck inside other particles and

1526
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:55,950
always stuck inside other particles and
 

1527
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:58,280
always stuck inside other particles and
the reason for that is essentially to do

1528
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:58,290
the reason for that is essentially to do
 

1529
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,750
the reason for that is essentially to do
with the strong force the strong forces

1530
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
with the strong force the strong forces
 

1531
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,940
with the strong force the strong forces
the force holds quarks together and it's

1532
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:01,950
the force holds quarks together and it's
 

1533
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:04,430
the force holds quarks together and it's
so strongly it's impossible to actually

1534
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:04,440
so strongly it's impossible to actually
 

1535
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,130
so strongly it's impossible to actually
liberate a quark so if you try and pull

1536
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:07,140
liberate a quark so if you try and pull
 

1537
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,600
liberate a quark so if you try and pull
a quark out of a proton what actually

1538
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:08,610
a quark out of a proton what actually
 

1539
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:11,150
a quark out of a proton what actually
ends up happening is that the you kind

1540
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,160
ends up happening is that the you kind
 

1541
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,580
ends up happening is that the you kind
of create this that this spring-like

1542
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:13,590
of create this that this spring-like
 

1543
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:15,320
of create this that this spring-like
bond in the strong force we've imagined

1544
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,330
bond in the strong force we've imagined
 

1545
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,820
bond in the strong force we've imagined
two quarks that are held together by

1546
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:16,830
two quarks that are held together by
 

1547
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:18,980
two quarks that are held together by
very powerful spring you pull it pull

1548
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:18,990
very powerful spring you pull it pull
 

1549
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,870
very powerful spring you pull it pull
and pull more and more energy gets

1550
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:20,880
and pull more and more energy gets
 

1551
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,680
and pull more and more energy gets
stored in there

1552
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:21,690
stored in there
 

1553
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:23,450
stored in there
bond like stretching a spring and

1554
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:23,460
bond like stretching a spring and
 

1555
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,400
bond like stretching a spring and
eventually the tension gets so great the

1556
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:25,410
eventually the tension gets so great the
 

1557
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:28,460
eventually the tension gets so great the
spring snaps and the energy in that bond

1558
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,470
spring snaps and the energy in that bond
 

1559
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:31,130
spring snaps and the energy in that bond
gets turned into two new quarks that go

1560
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:31,140
gets turned into two new quarks that go
 

1561
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,900
gets turned into two new quarks that go
on the broken ends so you started with

1562
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:32,910
on the broken ends so you started with
 

1563
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:34,490
on the broken ends so you started with
two quarks to end up with four quarks

1564
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:34,500
two quarks to end up with four quarks
 

1565
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,560
two quarks to end up with four quarks
so you never actually get to take a

1566
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:36,570
so you never actually get to take a
 

1567
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,150
so you never actually get to take a
quark out you just end up making loads

1568
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:38,160
quark out you just end up making loads
 

1569
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,340
quark out you just end up making loads
of more quarks in the process so how do

1570
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:40,350
of more quarks in the process so how do
 

1571
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:43,040
of more quarks in the process so how do
we again forgive the dumb question how

1572
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,050
we again forgive the dumb question how
 

1573
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,230
we again forgive the dumb question how
do we know quarks are real then well eh

1574
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:45,240
do we know quarks are real then well eh
 

1575
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,060
do we know quarks are real then well eh
from these experiments where we can

1576
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:47,070
from these experiments where we can
 

1577
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,220
from these experiments where we can
scatter you fire electrons into the

1578
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:49,230
scatter you fire electrons into the
 

1579
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,830
scatter you fire electrons into the
protons they can burrow into the proton

1580
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:51,840
protons they can burrow into the proton
 

1581
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,810
protons they can burrow into the proton
and knock off and they can bounce off

1582
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:53,820
and knock off and they can bounce off
 

1583
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,030
and knock off and they can bounce off
these quarks so you can see from the

1584
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:56,040
these quarks so you can see from the
 

1585
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,610
these quarks so you can see from the
angles the electrons come Alice you can

1586
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:58,620
angles the electrons come Alice you can
 

1587
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,260
angles the electrons come Alice you can
infer you can infer that these things

1588
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:00,270
infer you can infer that these things
 

1589
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,320
infer you can infer that these things
are there the quark model can also be

1590
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,330
are there the quark model can also be
 

1591
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:05,180
are there the quark model can also be
used it has a lot of successes you can

1592
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:05,190
used it has a lot of successes you can
 

1593
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:06,950
used it has a lot of successes you can
use it to predict the existence of new

1594
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:06,960
use it to predict the existence of new
 

1595
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,200
use it to predict the existence of new
particles that hadn't been seen so and

1596
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:09,210
particles that hadn't been seen so and
 

1597
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:11,030
particles that hadn't been seen so and
basically there's lots of data basically

1598
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:11,040
basically there's lots of data basically
 

1599
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,830
basically there's lots of data basically
showing from you know when we fire

1600
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:12,840
showing from you know when we fire
 

1601
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,640
showing from you know when we fire
protons at each other at the LHC a lot

1602
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:16,650
protons at each other at the LHC a lot
 

1603
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,140
protons at each other at the LHC a lot
of quarks get knocked all over the place

1604
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:18,150
of quarks get knocked all over the place
 

1605
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:20,390
of quarks get knocked all over the place
and every time they try and escape from

1606
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:20,400
and every time they try and escape from
 

1607
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,160
and every time they try and escape from
say one of their protons they make a

1608
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,170
say one of their protons they make a
 

1609
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,740
say one of their protons they make a
whole jet of quarks that go flying off

1610
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:24,750
whole jet of quarks that go flying off
 

1611
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,950
whole jet of quarks that go flying off
it has bound up in other sorts of

1612
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:26,960
it has bound up in other sorts of
 

1613
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,300
it has bound up in other sorts of
particles made of quarks so they're all

1614
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:29,310
particles made of quarks so they're all
 

1615
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,710
particles made of quarks so they're all
the sort of the theoretical predictions

1616
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
the sort of the theoretical predictions
 

1617
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,450
the sort of the theoretical predictions
from the basic theory of the strong

1618
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:32,460
from the basic theory of the strong
 

1619
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,340
from the basic theory of the strong
force and the quarks all agrees with

1620
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:34,350
force and the quarks all agrees with
 

1621
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,540
force and the quarks all agrees with
what we are seeing experiments we've

1622
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:35,550
what we are seeing experiments we've
 

1623
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,820
what we are seeing experiments we've
just never seen a an actual quark on its

1624
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:37,830
just never seen a an actual quark on its
 

1625
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:39,290
just never seen a an actual quark on its
own because unfortunate it's impossible

1626
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:39,300
own because unfortunate it's impossible
 

1627
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,430
own because unfortunate it's impossible
to get them out on their own

1628
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:40,440
to get them out on their own
 

1629
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,540
to get them out on their own
so quarks these crazy smaller things

1630
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:44,550
so quarks these crazy smaller things
 

1631
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,540
so quarks these crazy smaller things
that are hard to imagine a real so what

1632
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:47,550
that are hard to imagine a real so what
 

1633
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:49,640
that are hard to imagine a real so what
else what else is part of the story here

1634
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:49,650
else what else is part of the story here
 

1635
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,110
else what else is part of the story here
so the other thing that's going on at

1636
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:51,120
so the other thing that's going on at
 

1637
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,270
so the other thing that's going on at
the time around the sixties it's an

1638
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:53,280
the time around the sixties it's an
 

1639
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,520
the time around the sixties it's an
attempt to understand the forces that

1640
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:57,530
attempt to understand the forces that
 

1641
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,660
attempt to understand the forces that
make these particles interact with each

1642
00:29:59,660 --> 00:29:59,670
make these particles interact with each
 

1643
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,310
make these particles interact with each
other so you have the electromagnetic

1644
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:01,320
other so you have the electromagnetic
 

1645
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,410
other so you have the electromagnetic
force which is the force that was sort

1646
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:03,420
force which is the force that was sort
 

1647
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,670
force which is the force that was sort
of discovered to some extent in this

1648
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:04,680
of discovered to some extent in this
 

1649
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,430
of discovered to some extent in this
room or at least in this building so the

1650
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:07,440
room or at least in this building so the
 

1651
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,710
room or at least in this building so the
first what we call quantum field theory

1652
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:09,720
first what we call quantum field theory
 

1653
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,250
first what we call quantum field theory
of the electromagnetic force is

00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:12,260
of the electromagnetic force is
 

1655
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:16,570
of the electromagnetic force is
developed in the 1940s and 50s by

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,390
people julian schwinger tominaga who
come up with the first what we call a

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:23,400
come up with the first what we call a
 

1663
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,860
come up with the first what we call a

electromagnetic field and the attempt
then is made to try what can we come up

1682
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:40,770
then is made to try what can we come up
 

1683
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,620
then is made to try what can we come up
with a quantum field theory of the other

the other third the third force which we
 

1689
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,630
the other third the third force which we
haven't discussed which is the weak

1690
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:47,640
haven't discussed which is the weak
 

1691
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,990
haven't discussed which is the weak
force which is a nuclear force we don't

1693
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,039
force which is a nuclear force we don't
really experience it in our everyday

1694
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:52,049
really experience it in our everyday
 

1695
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:53,570
really experience it in our everyday
lives but it's responsible for

1696
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:53,580
lives but it's responsible for
 

1697
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,549
lives but it's responsible for
radioactive decay is the force that

1698
00:30:55,549 --> 00:30:55,559
radioactive decay is the force that
 

1699
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,400
radioactive decay is the force that
allows you know in a radioactive atom to

1700
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:58,410
allows you know in a radioactive atom to
 

1701
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:00,350
allows you know in a radioactive atom to
turn into a different element for

1702
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:00,360
turn into a different element for
 

1703
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,299
turn into a different element for
example and there are a few we've

1704
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:02,309
example and there are a few we've
 

1705
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:04,000
example and there are a few we've
explicitly mentioned but so there's

1706
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,010
explicitly mentioned but so there's
 

1707
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:07,190
explicitly mentioned but so there's
technically four forces yes I guess

1708
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:07,200
technically four forces yes I guess
 

1709
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,080
technically four forces yes I guess
three of them were being in in the

1710
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,090
three of them were being in in the
 

1711
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,909
three of them were being in in the
standard model like the weak there's the

1712
00:31:10,909 --> 00:31:10,919
standard model like the weak there's the
 

1713
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:13,700
standard model like the weak there's the
strong and the electromagnetic and then

1714
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:13,710
strong and the electromagnetic and then
 

1715
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,320
strong and the electromagnetic and then
there's gravity in this gravity which we

1716
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:15,330
there's gravity in this gravity which we
 

1717
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:18,080
there's gravity in this gravity which we
don't worry about that because maybe

1718
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:18,090
don't worry about that because maybe
 

1719
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:19,700
don't worry about that because maybe
maybe we bring that up at the end yeah

1720
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:19,710
maybe we bring that up at the end yeah
 

1721
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,620
maybe we bring that up at the end yeah
gravity so far we don't have a quantum

1722
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:21,630
gravity so far we don't have a quantum
 

1723
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,180
gravity so far we don't have a quantum
theory of and if you can solve that

1724
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:23,190
theory of and if you can solve that
 

1725
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,400
theory of and if you can solve that
problem you win a Nobel Prize well we're

1726
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:25,410
problem you win a Nobel Prize well we're
 

1727
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:27,080
problem you win a Nobel Prize well we're
gonna have to bring up the graviton at

1728
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:27,090
gonna have to bring up the graviton at
 

1729
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:29,419
gonna have to bring up the graviton at
some point I'm gonna ask you but let's

1730
00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:29,429
some point I'm gonna ask you but let's
 

1731
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,310
some point I'm gonna ask you but let's
let's leave that to the side for now so

1732
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:31,320
let's leave that to the side for now so
 

1733
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,630
let's leave that to the side for now so
those three okay fine man a

1734
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:34,640
those three okay fine man a
 

1735
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,490
those three okay fine man a
electromagnetic force the the quantum

1736
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:37,500
electromagnetic force the the quantum
 

1737
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,419
electromagnetic force the the quantum
field yeah where does the weak force

1738
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:41,429
field yeah where does the weak force
 

1739
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:43,700
field yeah where does the weak force
come in so so yeah well first of I mean

1740
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:43,710
come in so so yeah well first of I mean
 

1741
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:44,840
come in so so yeah well first of I mean
the strong force a bit easiest the

1742
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:44,850
the strong force a bit easiest the
 

1743
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:46,730
the strong force a bit easiest the
strong force is a little bit like the

1744
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:46,740
strong force is a little bit like the
 

1745
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,080
strong force is a little bit like the
electromagnetic force it's a force that

1746
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,090
electromagnetic force it's a force that
 

1747
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,580
electromagnetic force it's a force that
binds things together so that's the

1748
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:49,590
binds things together so that's the
 

1749
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:51,380
binds things together so that's the
force that holds quarks together inside

1750
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:51,390
force that holds quarks together inside
 

1751
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,350
force that holds quarks together inside
the proton for example so a quantum

1752
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:54,360
the proton for example so a quantum
 

1753
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,539
the proton for example so a quantum
field theory of that force is discovered

1754
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:56,549
field theory of that force is discovered
 

1755
00:31:56,549 --> 00:32:00,350
field theory of that force is discovered
in I think it's in the sixties and it

1756
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:00,360
in I think it's in the sixties and it
 

1757
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,480
in I think it's in the sixties and it
predicts the existence of new force

1758
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:02,490
predicts the existence of new force
 

1759
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,690
predicts the existence of new force
particles called gluons so gluons are a

1760
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:05,700
particles called gluons so gluons are a
 

1761
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,460
particles called gluons so gluons are a
bit like the photon the photon is the

1762
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:07,470
bit like the photon the photon is the
 

1763
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:10,190
bit like the photon the photon is the
particle of electromagnetism gluons are

1764
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:10,200
particle of electromagnetism gluons are
 

1765
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,530
particle of electromagnetism gluons are
the the particles of the strong force

1766
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:12,540
the the particles of the strong force
 

1767
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,750
the the particles of the strong force
and so there's there's just like there's

1768
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:14,760
and so there's there's just like there's
 

1769
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,039
and so there's there's just like there's
an electromagnetic field there's

1770
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:16,049
an electromagnetic field there's
 

1771
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:17,780
an electromagnetic field there's
something called a gluon field which is

1772
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:17,790
something called a gluon field which is
 

1773
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:20,000
something called a gluon field which is
also all around us but these part

1774
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,010
also all around us but these part
 

1775
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,620
also all around us but these part
there's some of these particles I guess

1776
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:21,630
there's some of these particles I guess
 

1777
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,780
there's some of these particles I guess
the force carriers or whatever they

1778
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:23,790
the force carriers or whatever they
 

1779
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,370
the force carriers or whatever they
carry that well it depends how you want

1780
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:25,380
carry that well it depends how you want
 

1781
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,419
carry that well it depends how you want
to think about it I mean really the

1782
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:26,429
to think about it I mean really the
 

1783
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:28,850
to think about it I mean really the
field the strong force field the gluon

1784
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:28,860
field the strong force field the gluon
 

1785
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,610
field the strong force field the gluon
field is the thing that binds the quarks

1786
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:31,620
field is the thing that binds the quarks
 

1787
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,280
field is the thing that binds the quarks
together the gluons are the little

1788
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,290
together the gluons are the little
 

1789
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,200
together the gluons are the little
ripples in that field so that like in

1790
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,210
ripples in that field so that like in
 

1791
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,580
ripples in that field so that like in
the same way that the photon is a ripple

1792
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:37,590
the same way that the photon is a ripple
 

1793
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,799
the same way that the photon is a ripple
in there in the electromagnetic field

1794
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:39,809
in there in the electromagnetic field
 

1795
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:41,060
in there in the electromagnetic field
but the thing that really does the

1796
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,070
but the thing that really does the
 

1797
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,510
but the thing that really does the
binding is the field I mean you may have

1798
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:44,520
binding is the field I mean you may have
 

1799
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,680
binding is the field I mean you may have
heard people talk about things like

1800
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:45,690
heard people talk about things like
 

1801
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:47,720
heard people talk about things like
verge as you've heard the phrase virtual

1802
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:47,730
verge as you've heard the phrase virtual
 

1803
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,160
verge as you've heard the phrase virtual
particle

1804
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:49,170
particle
 

1805
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,650
particle
so sometimes in some if you hear people

1806
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:51,660
so sometimes in some if you hear people
 

1807
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,690
so sometimes in some if you hear people
describing how forces are exchanged

1808
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:53,700
describing how forces are exchanged
 

1809
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,550
describing how forces are exchanged
between particles they quite often talk

1810
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:55,560
between particles they quite often talk
 

1811
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,960
between particles they quite often talk
about the idea that you know if you have

1812
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:56,970
about the idea that you know if you have
 

1813
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,120
about the idea that you know if you have
an electron and another electron say and

1814
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,130
an electron and another electron say and
 

1815
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,920
an electron and another electron say and
they're repelling each other through the

1816
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:00,930
they're repelling each other through the
 

1817
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:03,200
they're repelling each other through the
electro bratok electromagnetic force you

1818
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:03,210
electro bratok electromagnetic force you
 

1819
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,610
electro bratok electromagnetic force you
can think of that as if they're

1820
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:04,620
can think of that as if they're
 

1821
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,320
can think of that as if they're
exchanging photons so they're kind of

1822
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:06,330
exchanging photons so they're kind of
 

1823
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,670
exchanging photons so they're kind of
firing photons backwards and forwards

1824
00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:07,680
firing photons backwards and forwards
 

1825
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,410
firing photons backwards and forwards
between each other and that causes them

1826
00:33:09,410 --> 00:33:09,420
between each other and that causes them
 

1827
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,080
between each other and that causes them
to repel therefore time is then a

1828
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,090
to repel therefore time is then a
 

1829
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,730
to repel therefore time is then a
virtual particle yes that's what we call

1830
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:13,740
virtual particle yes that's what we call
 

1831
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,900
virtual particle yes that's what we call
a virtual particle in other words it's

1832
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:14,910
a virtual particle in other words it's
 

1833
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,190
a virtual particle in other words it's
not a real thing doesn't actually exist

1834
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:16,200
not a real thing doesn't actually exist
 

1835
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,890
not a real thing doesn't actually exist
so it's an artifact of the way theorists

1836
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:18,900
so it's an artifact of the way theorists
 

1837
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,450
so it's an artifact of the way theorists
do calculations so when they do

1838
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:20,460
do calculations so when they do
 

1839
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,130
do calculations so when they do
calculations in quantum field theory

1840
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,140
calculations in quantum field theory
 

1841
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,110
calculations in quantum field theory
rather than there's no one's discovered

1842
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:24,120
rather than there's no one's discovered
 

1843
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,670
rather than there's no one's discovered
a way of just treating the whole field

1844
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:25,680
a way of just treating the whole field
 

1845
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,350
a way of just treating the whole field
you have to break the field down into

1846
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
you have to break the field down into
 

1847
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,210
you have to break the field down into
simpler things so you can basically

1848
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:29,220
simpler things so you can basically
 

1849
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,160
simpler things so you can basically
treat the field as if it's made up of

1850
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:31,170
treat the field as if it's made up of
 

1851
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,680
treat the field as if it's made up of
lots of these virtual photons but

1852
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:33,690
lots of these virtual photons but
 

1853
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,150
lots of these virtual photons but
there's no experiment that you can do

1854
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,160
there's no experiment that you can do
 

1855
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,580
there's no experiment that you can do
that couldn't detect these particles

1856
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:37,590
that couldn't detect these particles
 

1857
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:39,440
that couldn't detect these particles
being exchanged what's really happening

1858
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:39,450
being exchanged what's really happening
 

1859
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,600
being exchanged what's really happening
in reality is the electromagnetic field

1860
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:41,610
in reality is the electromagnetic field
 

1861
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,180
in reality is the electromagnetic field
is warped by the charge of the electron

1862
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,190
is warped by the charge of the electron
 

1863
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,640
is warped by the charge of the electron
and that causes the force but the way we

1864
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:46,650
and that causes the force but the way we
 

1865
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,190
and that causes the force but the way we
do calculations involves parties let's

1866
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:49,200
do calculations involves parties let's
 

1867
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,260
do calculations involves parties let's
say it's a bit confusing but it is

1868
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,270
say it's a bit confusing but it is
 

1869
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,600
say it's a bit confusing but it is
really a mathematical technique it's not

1870
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:53,610
really a mathematical technique it's not
 

1871
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,610
really a mathematical technique it's not
something that corresponds to reality I

1872
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:55,620
something that corresponds to reality I
 

1873
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,500
something that corresponds to reality I
mean that's part I guess of the fireman

1874
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:57,510
mean that's part I guess of the fireman
 

1875
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,870
mean that's part I guess of the fireman
diagrams yes is this virtual product

1876
00:33:59,870 --> 00:33:59,880
diagrams yes is this virtual product
 

1877
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,910
diagrams yes is this virtual product
okay that's right yeah some of these

1878
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:01,920
okay that's right yeah some of these
 

1879
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,580
okay that's right yeah some of these
have mass some of them don't mm-hmm is

1880
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:04,590
have mass some of them don't mm-hmm is
 

1881
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,890
have mass some of them don't mm-hmm is
that is that what what does that even

1882
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:06,900
that is that what what does that even
 

1883
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,770
that is that what what does that even
mean not to have mass and maybe you can

1884
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:09,780
mean not to have mass and maybe you can
 

1885
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,750
mean not to have mass and maybe you can
say well which one of them's have mass

1886
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:11,760
say well which one of them's have mass
 

1887
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,720
say well which one of them's have mass
or which don't okay so and why is mass

1888
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:14,730
or which don't okay so and why is mass

ish protons so that's really massive we

1958
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:39,840
ish protons so that's really massive we
 

1959
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,170
ish protons so that's really massive we
don't know why is so massive but they're

1960
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:42,180
don't know why is so massive but they're
 

1961
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,280
don't know why is so massive but they're
coming back to the weak force so that

1962
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:43,290
coming back to the weak force so that
 

1963
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,920
coming back to the weak force so that
the the problem in the 60s and 70s was

1964
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:45,930
the the problem in the 60s and 70s was
 

1965
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:49,820
the the problem in the 60s and 70s was
that the reason that the electromagnetic

1966
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:49,830
that the reason that the electromagnetic
 

1967
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,200
that the reason that the electromagnetic
force is a force that we can experience

1968
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,210
force is a force that we can experience
 

1969
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:52,610
force is a force that we can experience
our everyday live so if we have a magnet

1970
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:52,620
our everyday live so if we have a magnet
 

1971
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,930
our everyday live so if we have a magnet
and a piece of metal you can hold it you

1972
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:53,940
and a piece of metal you can hold it you
 

1973
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,910
and a piece of metal you can hold it you
know a meter apart if it's powerful

1974
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
know a meter apart if it's powerful
 

1975
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,380
know a meter apart if it's powerful
laughs and you'll feel a force whereas

1976
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:57,390
laughs and you'll feel a force whereas
 

1977
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,110
laughs and you'll feel a force whereas
the weak force only is becomes apparent

1978
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,120
the weak force only is becomes apparent
 

1979
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,510
the weak force only is becomes apparent
when you basically have two particles

1980
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:02,520
when you basically have two particles
 

1981
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,630
when you basically have two particles
touching at the scale of a nucleus so if

1982
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:05,640
touching at the scale of a nucleus so if
 

1983
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,100
touching at the scale of a nucleus so if
you get two very short distances before

1984
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:07,110
you get two very short distances before
 

1985
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,950
you get two very short distances before
this force becomes manifest it's not

1986
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:09,960
this force becomes manifest it's not
 

1987
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,480
this force becomes manifest it's not
doesn't we don't get weak forces going

1988
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:11,490
doesn't we don't get weak forces going
 

1989
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,090
doesn't we don't get weak forces going
on in this room they don't notice them

1990
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:13,100
on in this room they don't notice them
 

1991
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,350
on in this room they don't notice them
and the reason for that is that the

1992
00:36:15,350 --> 00:36:15,360
and the reason for that is that the
 

1993
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,140
and the reason for that is that the
particle well the the field that

1994
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:18,150
particle well the the field that
 

1995
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:21,110
particle well the the field that
transmits the weak force the particle

1996
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,120
transmits the weak force the particle
 

1997
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,430
transmits the weak force the particle
that's associated with that field has a

1998
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:22,440
that's associated with that field has a
 

1999
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,050
that's associated with that field has a
very large mass which means that the

2000
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:24,060
very large mass which means that the
 

2001
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,630
very large mass which means that the
field dies off very quickly says you

2002
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:26,640
field dies off very quickly says you
 

2003
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,760
field dies off very quickly says you
whereas an electric charge if you were

2004
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:28,770
whereas an electric charge if you were
 

2005
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:30,230
whereas an electric charge if you were
to look at the shape of the electric

2006
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:30,240
to look at the shape of the electric
 

2007
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,240
to look at the shape of the electric
field it would fall off with this you

2008
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,250
field it would fall off with this you
 

2009
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:33,290
field it would fall off with this you
know this one called the inverse square

2010
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:33,300
know this one called the inverse square
 

2011
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,970
know this one called the inverse square
law which is the idea that the force

2012
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:34,980
law which is the idea that the force
 

2013
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,190
law which is the idea that the force
halves every time you double the

2014
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,200
halves every time you double the
 

2015
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,800
halves every time you double the
distance no sorry it doesn't have it

2016
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:39,810
distance no sorry it doesn't have it
 

2017
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,510
distance no sorry it doesn't have it
quarters every time you see every time

2018
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
quarters every time you see every time
 

2019
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,340
quarters every time you see every time
you double the distance between say the

2020
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:43,350
you double the distance between say the
 

2021
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,840
you double the distance between say the
two particles whereas the weak force

2022
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:44,850
two particles whereas the weak force
 

2023
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,640
two particles whereas the weak force
kind of you move a little bit away from

2024
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:46,650
kind of you move a little bit away from
 

2025
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:49,460
kind of you move a little bit away from
the nucleus and just disappears the

2026
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:49,470
the nucleus and just disappears the
 

2027
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,020
the nucleus and just disappears the
reason for that is because these these

2028
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,030
reason for that is because these these
 

2029
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:53,060
reason for that is because these these
fields the particles that go with them

2030
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,070
fields the particles that go with them
 

2031
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,940
fields the particles that go with them
have a very large mass but the problem

2032
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:55,950
have a very large mass but the problem
 

2033
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:59,270
have a very large mass but the problem
that was that theorists faced in the

2034
00:36:59,270 --> 00:36:59,280
that was that theorists faced in the
 

2035
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,880
that was that theorists faced in the
sixties was that if you tried to

2036
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:00,890
sixties was that if you tried to
 

2037
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:04,370
sixties was that if you tried to
introduce massive force fields the

2038
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:04,380
introduce massive force fields the
 

2039
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,200
introduce massive force fields the
theory who gave you nonsensical answers

2040
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:06,210
theory who gave you nonsensical answers
 

2041
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,270
theory who gave you nonsensical answers
so you'd end up with infinite results

2042
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:08,280
so you'd end up with infinite results
 

2043
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,250
so you'd end up with infinite results
for a lot of the calculations you tried

2044
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:10,260
for a lot of the calculations you tried
 

2045
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,500
for a lot of the calculations you tried
to do so the basically it turned it

2046
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:12,510
to do so the basically it turned it
 

2047
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,760
to do so the basically it turned it
seemed that quantum field theory was

2048
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:13,770
seemed that quantum field theory was
 

2049
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:16,460
seemed that quantum field theory was
incompatible with having massive

2050
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:16,470
incompatible with having massive
 

2051
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,260
incompatible with having massive
articles not just the force particles

2052
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,270
articles not just the force particles
 

2053
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,750
articles not just the force particles
actually but even the electron was a

2054
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,760
actually but even the electron was a
 

2055
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,960
actually but even the electron was a
problem so this is where the Higgs that

2056
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:23,970
problem so this is where the Higgs that
 

2057
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,060
problem so this is where the Higgs that
we sort of alluded to comes in and the

2058
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,070
we sort of alluded to comes in and the
 

2059
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,370
we sort of alluded to comes in and the
solution was to say okay well actually

2060
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:28,380
solution was to say okay well actually
 

2061
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,020
solution was to say okay well actually
all the particles in the standard model

2062
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,030
all the particles in the standard model
 

2063
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,060
all the particles in the standard model
of mass they have no mass so the quarks

2064
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:32,070
of mass they have no mass so the quarks
 

2065
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,990
of mass they have no mass so the quarks
the electron they don't have a mass

2066
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:33,000
the electron they don't have a mass
 

2067
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,910
the electron they don't have a mass
neither do these weak particles they

2068
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:34,920
neither do these weak particles they
 

2069
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,400
neither do these weak particles they
don't have mass either what happens is

2070
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:37,410
don't have mass either what happens is
 

2071
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,830
don't have mass either what happens is
they actually acquire mass through

2072
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:38,840
they actually acquire mass through
 

2073
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,030
they actually acquire mass through
another process they get it from

2074
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:41,040
another process they get it from
 

2075
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,200
another process they get it from
somewhere else they don't actually have

2076
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,210
somewhere else they don't actually have
 

2077
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,470
somewhere else they don't actually have
it intrinsically so this idea that was

2078
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:45,480
it intrinsically so this idea that was
 

2079
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,240
it intrinsically so this idea that was
introduced by what Peter Higgs is the

2080
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:47,250
introduced by what Peter Higgs is the
 

2081
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:48,410
introduced by what Peter Higgs is the
most famous but actually they're about

2082
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:48,420
most famous but actually they're about
 

2083
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:50,120
most famous but actually they're about
six people that come up with the idea

2084
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,130
six people that come up with the idea
 

2085
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:52,400
six people that come up with the idea
more or less at the same time is that

2086
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:52,410
more or less at the same time is that
 

2087
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,339
more or less at the same time is that
you introduce a new quantum field which

2088
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:55,349
you introduce a new quantum field which
 

2089
00:37:55,349 --> 00:37:56,780
you introduce a new quantum field which
is another one of these invisible things

2090
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:56,790
is another one of these invisible things
 

2091
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,330
is another one of these invisible things
as everywhere and it's through the

2092
00:37:59,330 --> 00:37:59,340
as everywhere and it's through the
 

2093
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,640
as everywhere and it's through the
interaction with this field that

2094
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:01,650
interaction with this field that
 

2095
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,380
interaction with this field that
particles get mass so you can think of

2096
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:03,390
particles get mass so you can think of
 

2097
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,070
particles get mass so you can think of
say an electron in the Higgs field it

2098
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:07,080
say an electron in the Higgs field it
 

2099
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,440
say an electron in the Higgs field it
kind of Higgs field kind of bunches

2100
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,450
kind of Higgs field kind of bunches
 

2101
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:11,690
kind of Higgs field kind of bunches
around the electron it sort of a drawn

2102
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:11,700
around the electron it sort of a drawn
 

2103
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,849
around the electron it sort of a drawn
towards the electron and that energy

2104
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:13,859
towards the electron and that energy
 

2105
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:15,859
towards the electron and that energy
that's stored in that field around the

2106
00:38:15,859 --> 00:38:15,869
that's stored in that field around the
 

2107
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:18,440
that's stored in that field around the
electron is what we see as the mass of

2108
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:18,450
electron is what we see as the mass of
 

2109
00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:19,940
electron is what we see as the mass of
the electron but if you could somehow

2110
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:19,950
the electron but if you could somehow
 

2111
00:38:19,950 --> 00:38:22,040
the electron but if you could somehow
turn off the Higgs field then all the

2112
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,050
turn off the Higgs field then all the
 

2113
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,329
turn off the Higgs field then all the
particles in nature would become

2114
00:38:23,329 --> 00:38:23,339
particles in nature would become
 

2115
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:25,520
particles in nature would become
massless and fly around at the speed of

2116
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:25,530
massless and fly around at the speed of
 

2117
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:29,599
massless and fly around at the speed of
light so this this idea of the Higgs

2118
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:29,609
light so this this idea of the Higgs
 

2119
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:32,630
light so this this idea of the Higgs
field allowed other people other

2120
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:32,640
field allowed other people other
 

2121
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,349
field allowed other people other
theorists to come up with a well it was

2122
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:36,359
theorists to come up with a well it was
 

2123
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,120
theorists to come up with a well it was
another a unit basically a unified

2124
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:38,130
another a unit basically a unified
 

2125
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:40,940
another a unit basically a unified
theory of the electromagnetic force on

2126
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:40,950
theory of the electromagnetic force on
 

2127
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,589
theory of the electromagnetic force on
the weak force so once you bring in the

2128
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:42,599
the weak force so once you bring in the
 

2129
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:44,210
the weak force so once you bring in the
Higgs field you can combine two of the

2130
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:44,220
Higgs field you can combine two of the
 

2131
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,339
Higgs field you can combine two of the
forces into one so it turns out the

2132
00:38:46,339 --> 00:38:46,349
forces into one so it turns out the
 

2133
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:48,200
forces into one so it turns out the
electromagnetic force and the weak force

2134
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,210
electromagnetic force and the weak force
 

2135
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,060
electromagnetic force and the weak force
are just two aspects of the same

2136
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,070
are just two aspects of the same
 

2137
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:53,839
are just two aspects of the same
fundamental force and at the LHC we go

2138
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:53,849
fundamental force and at the LHC we go
 

2139
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:55,250
fundamental force and at the LHC we go
to high enough energies that you see

2140
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:55,260
to high enough energies that you see
 

2141
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:59,630
to high enough energies that you see
these two forces unifying effectively so

2142
00:38:59,630 --> 00:38:59,640
these two forces unifying effectively so
 

2143
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:03,050
these two forces unifying effectively so
that so first of all it started as a

2144
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:03,060
that so first of all it started as a
 

2145
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,700
that so first of all it started as a
theoretical notion like this is just

2146
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:04,710
theoretical notion like this is just
 

2147
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,060
theoretical notion like this is just
something and then I mean wasn't the

2148
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,070
something and then I mean wasn't the
 

2149
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,130
something and then I mean wasn't the
Higgs called the god particle at some

2150
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:10,140
Higgs called the god particle at some
 

2151
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,260
Higgs called the god particle at some
point it was by a guy trying to sell

2152
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:12,270
point it was by a guy trying to sell
 

2153
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:15,560
point it was by a guy trying to sell
popular science books yeah yeah but by

2154
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:15,570
popular science books yeah yeah but by
 

2155
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:17,930
popular science books yeah yeah but by
me I am because when I was hearing it I

2156
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:17,940
me I am because when I was hearing it I
 

2157
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:21,380
me I am because when I was hearing it I
thought it would I mean that would solve

2158
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,390
thought it would I mean that would solve
 

2159
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:23,240
thought it would I mean that would solve
a lot of the you know file a lot of our

2160
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:23,250
a lot of the you know file a lot of our
 

2161
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:25,670
a lot of the you know file a lot of our
ideas of physics was Molloy's my notion

2162
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:25,680
ideas of physics was Molloy's my notion
 

2163
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,260
ideas of physics was Molloy's my notion
but maybe you can speak to that was is

2164
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:29,270
but maybe you can speak to that was is
 

2165
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,380
but maybe you can speak to that was is
as big of a leap is it as a god particle

2166
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,390
as big of a leap is it as a god particle
 

2167
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,030
as big of a leap is it as a god particle
is it a Jesus particle which which you

2168
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
is it a Jesus particle which which you
 

2169
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,620
is it a Jesus particle which which you
know what's the big contribution of

2170
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:38,630
know what's the big contribution of
 

2171
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:40,540
know what's the big contribution of
Higgs in terms of this unification power

2172
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:40,550
Higgs in terms of this unification power
 

2173
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,870
Higgs in terms of this unification power
yeah I mean to understand that I maybe

2174
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:43,880
yeah I mean to understand that I maybe
 

2175
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,250
yeah I mean to understand that I maybe
helps know the history a little bit so

2176
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,260
helps know the history a little bit so
 

2177
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,650
helps know the history a little bit so
when the what we call electroweak theory

2178
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:47,660
when the what we call electroweak theory
 

2179
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,330
when the what we call electroweak theory
was put together which is where you

2180
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:49,340
was put together which is where you
 

2181
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,920
was put together which is where you
unify electromagnetism with the weak

2182
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:50,930
unify electromagnetism with the weak
 

2183
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,510
unify electromagnetism with the weak
force and the Higgs is involved in all

2184
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:52,520
force and the Higgs is involved in all
 

2185
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,460
force and the Higgs is involved in all
of that so that theory which was written

2186
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:54,470
of that so that theory which was written
 

2187
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,440
of that so that theory which was written
in the mid-70s predicted the existence

2188
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:56,450
in the mid-70s predicted the existence
 

2189
00:39:56,450 --> 00:40:00,640
in the mid-70s predicted the existence
of four new particles the w+ boson the

2190
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:00,650
of four new particles the w+ boson the
 

2191
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:03,190
of four new particles the w+ boson the
w- boson the z boson and the Higgs boson

2192
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,200
w- boson the z boson and the Higgs boson
 

2193
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,900
w- boson the z boson and the Higgs boson
so there were these four particles that

2194
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:04,910
so there were these four particles that
 

2195
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:06,580
so there were these four particles that
came with the theory that were predicted

2196
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:06,590
came with the theory that were predicted
 

2197
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:09,310
came with the theory that were predicted
by the theory in 1983-84

2198
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,320
by the theory in 1983-84
 

2199
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,680
by the theory in 1983-84
the W's and the z particles were

2200
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:11,690
the W's and the z particles were
 

2201
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:14,500
the W's and the z particles were
discovered an accelerator at CERN called

2202
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:14,510
discovered an accelerator at CERN called
 

2203
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,270
discovered an accelerator at CERN called
the super proton synchrotron which was a

2204
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:16,280
the super proton synchrotron which was a
 

2205
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,390
the super proton synchrotron which was a
seven kilometer particle collider so

2206
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:19,400
seven kilometer particle collider so
 

2207
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,880
seven kilometer particle collider so
three of the bits of this theory had

2208
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:21,890
three of the bits of this theory had
 

2209
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,770
three of the bits of this theory had
already been found so people are pretty

2210
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:23,780
already been found so people are pretty
 

2211
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,930
already been found so people are pretty
confident from the 80s that the Higgs

2212
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:25,940
confident from the 80s that the Higgs
 

2213
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:28,600
confident from the 80s that the Higgs
must exist because it was a part of this

2214
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:28,610
must exist because it was a part of this
 

2215
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:31,480
must exist because it was a part of this
family of particles that this

2216
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:31,490
family of particles that this
 

2217
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,220
family of particles that this
theoretical structure only works if the

2218
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:33,230
theoretical structure only works if the
 

2219
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,970
theoretical structure only works if the
Higgs is there so what then happens this

2220
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:36,980
Higgs is there so what then happens this
 

2221
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,410
Higgs is there so what then happens this
question right why is the LHC the size

2222
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:38,420
question right why is the LHC the size
 

2223
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,750
question right why is the LHC the size
it is yes well actually the tunnel that

2224
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:40,760
it is yes well actually the tunnel that
 

2225
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,520
it is yes well actually the tunnel that
the LHC is in was not built for the LHC

2226
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:42,530
the LHC is in was not built for the LHC
 

2227
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:44,260
the LHC is in was not built for the LHC
it was built from for a previous

2228
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:44,270
it was built from for a previous
 

2229
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,810
it was built from for a previous
accelerator called the large electron

2230
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:46,820
accelerator called the large electron
 

2231
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,050
accelerator called the large electron
positron Collider so that that was bit

2232
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:50,060
positron Collider so that that was bit
 

2233
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,359
positron Collider so that that was bit
began operation in the late 80s early

2234
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:52,369
began operation in the late 80s early
 

2235
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,910
began operation in the late 80s early
90s they basically did that's when they

2236
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:54,920
90s they basically did that's when they
 

2237
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,830
90s they basically did that's when they
dug the 27 kilometer tunnel they put as

2238
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:56,840
dug the 27 kilometer tunnel they put as
 

2239
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,200
dug the 27 kilometer tunnel they put as
accelerator into it the collider defiers

2240
00:40:59,200 --> 00:40:59,210
accelerator into it the collider defiers
 

2241
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,940
accelerator into it the collider defiers
electrons and anti electrons at each

2242
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:00,950
electrons and anti electrons at each
 

2243
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:03,430
electrons and anti electrons at each
other electrons and positrons so the

2244
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:03,440
other electrons and positrons so the
 

2245
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,650
other electrons and positrons so the
purpose of that machine was well it was

2246
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:05,660
purpose of that machine was well it was
 

2247
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,880
purpose of that machine was well it was
actually to look for the Higgs that was

2248
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:06,890
actually to look for the Higgs that was
 

2249
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,800
actually to look for the Higgs that was
one of the things it was trying to do it

2250
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:08,810
one of the things it was trying to do it
 

2251
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:09,940
one of the things it was trying to do it
didn't man I didn't have enough energy

2252
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:09,950
didn't man I didn't have enough energy
 

2253
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,099
didn't man I didn't have enough energy
to do it in the end but the main thing

2254
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:12,109
to do it in the end but the main thing
 

2255
00:41:12,109 --> 00:41:14,950
to do it in the end but the main thing
it was it studied the W and the Z

2256
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:14,960
it was it studied the W and the Z
 

2257
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,710
it was it studied the W and the Z
particles at very high precision so it

2258
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:17,720
particles at very high precision so it
 

2259
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,660
particles at very high precision so it
made loads of these things previously

2260
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:19,670
made loads of these things previously
 

2261
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:20,680
made loads of these things previously
can you make a few of them at the

2262
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:20,690
can you make a few of them at the
 

2263
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,270
can you make a few of them at the
previous accelerator you could study

2264
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:22,280
previous accelerator you could study
 

2265
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,700
previous accelerator you could study
these really really precisely and by

2266
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:24,710
these really really precisely and by
 

2267
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,870
these really really precisely and by
studying their properties you could

2268
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:25,880
studying their properties you could
 

2269
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,330
studying their properties you could
really test this electroweak theory that

2270
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:28,340
really test this electroweak theory that
 

2271
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,560
really test this electroweak theory that
had been invented in the seventies and

2272
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,570
had been invented in the seventies and
 

2273
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,420
had been invented in the seventies and
really make sure that it worked so

2274
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,430
really make sure that it worked so
 

2275
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,080
really make sure that it worked so
actually by 1999 when this machine

2276
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:35,090
actually by 1999 when this machine
 

2277
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:38,890
actually by 1999 when this machine
turned off people knew well okay you

2278
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:38,900
turned off people knew well okay you
 

2279
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,109
turned off people knew well okay you
never know until you until you find the

2280
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:41,119
never know until you until you find the
 

2281
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,099
never know until you until you find the
thing but people were really confident

2282
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:43,109
thing but people were really confident
 

2283
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:45,079
thing but people were really confident
electroweak theory was right and that

2284
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:45,089
electroweak theory was right and that
 

2285
00:41:45,089 --> 00:41:47,749
electroweak theory was right and that
the Higgs almost the Higgs or something

2286
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:47,759
the Higgs almost the Higgs or something
 

2287
00:41:47,759 --> 00:41:49,880
the Higgs almost the Higgs or something
very like the Higgs had to exist because

2288
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:49,890
very like the Higgs had to exist because
 

2289
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,950
very like the Higgs had to exist because
otherwise the whole thing doesn't work

2290
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:51,960
otherwise the whole thing doesn't work
 

2291
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,569
otherwise the whole thing doesn't work
it'd be really weird if you could

2292
00:41:53,569 --> 00:41:53,579
it'd be really weird if you could
 

2293
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,190
it'd be really weird if you could
discover and these particles they all

2294
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
discover and these particles they all
 

2295
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,660
discover and these particles they all
behave exactly just theory tells you

2296
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:56,670
behave exactly just theory tells you
 

2297
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,700
behave exactly just theory tells you
they should but somehow this key piece

2298
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:58,710
they should but somehow this key piece
 

2299
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:01,039
they should but somehow this key piece
of the picture isn't it's not there so

2300
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:01,049
of the picture isn't it's not there so
 

2301
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:03,620
of the picture isn't it's not there so
in a way it depends how you look at it

2302
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:03,630
in a way it depends how you look at it
 

2303
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:07,009
in a way it depends how you look at it
the discovery of the Higgs on its own is

2304
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:07,019
the discovery of the Higgs on its own is
 

2305
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:09,710
the discovery of the Higgs on its own is
it's also a huge achievement in many

2306
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:09,720
it's also a huge achievement in many
 

2307
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,380
it's also a huge achievement in many
both experimenting and theoretically on

2308
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:12,390
both experimenting and theoretically on
 

2309
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:14,059
both experimenting and theoretically on
the other hand it's this it's like

2310
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:14,069
the other hand it's this it's like
 

2311
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,130
the other hand it's this it's like
having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece

2312
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:16,140
having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece
 

2313
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,720
having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece
has been filled in you've this beautiful

2314
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:17,730
has been filled in you've this beautiful
 

2315
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,609
has been filled in you've this beautiful
image there's one gap and you kind of

2316
00:42:19,609 --> 00:42:19,619
image there's one gap and you kind of
 

2317
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:21,829
image there's one gap and you kind of
know that that piece must be there

2318
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:21,839
know that that piece must be there
 

2319
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,970
know that that piece must be there
something right so yeah so the discovery

2320
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:25,980
something right so yeah so the discovery
 

2321
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,509
something right so yeah so the discovery
in itself although it's important is not

2322
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:29,519
in itself although it's important is not
 

2323
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:31,549
in itself although it's important is not
so interesting it's a good confirmation

2324
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:31,559
so interesting it's a good confirmation
 

2325
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:34,430
so interesting it's a good confirmation
of the obvious yes at that point but

2326
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:34,440
of the obvious yes at that point but
 

2327
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,859
of the obvious yes at that point but
what makes it interesting is not that it

2328
00:42:36,859 --> 00:42:36,869
what makes it interesting is not that it
 

2329
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:38,210
what makes it interesting is not that it
just completes the standard model which

2330
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,220
just completes the standard model which
 

2331
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,249
just completes the standard model which
is a theory that we've known had the

2332
00:42:40,249 --> 00:42:40,259
is a theory that we've known had the
 

2333
00:42:40,259 --> 00:42:43,279
is a theory that we've known had the
basic layout offs for 40 years or more

2334
00:42:43,279 --> 00:42:43,289
basic layout offs for 40 years or more
 

2335
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:47,150
basic layout offs for 40 years or more
now it's that the Higgs actually is a is

2336
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:47,160
now it's that the Higgs actually is a is
 

2337
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,579
now it's that the Higgs actually is a is
a unique particle is very different to

2338
00:42:49,579 --> 00:42:49,589
a unique particle is very different to
 

2339
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,660
a unique particle is very different to
any of the other particles in the

2340
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:50,670
any of the other particles in the
 

2341
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,509
any of the other particles in the
standard model and it's a theoretically

2342
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:53,519
standard model and it's a theoretically
 

2343
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:55,489
standard model and it's a theoretically
very troublesome particle there are a

2344
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:55,499
very troublesome particle there are a
 

2345
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:59,150
very troublesome particle there are a
lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs

2346
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,160
lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs
 

2347
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,279
lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs
but also opportunities so that we

2348
00:43:01,279 --> 00:43:01,289
but also opportunities so that we
 

2349
00:43:01,289 --> 00:43:02,599
but also opportunities so that we
basically don't really understand how

2350
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:02,609
basically don't really understand how
 

2351
00:43:02,609 --> 00:43:05,660
basically don't really understand how
such an object can exist in the form

2352
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:05,670
such an object can exist in the form
 

2353
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:07,160
such an object can exist in the form
that it does so there are lots of

2354
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,170
that it does so there are lots of
 

2355
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:09,890
that it does so there are lots of
reasons for thinking that the Higgs must

2356
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:09,900
reasons for thinking that the Higgs must
 

2357
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,349
reasons for thinking that the Higgs must
come with a bunch of other particles or

2358
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:12,359
come with a bunch of other particles or
 

2359
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:14,930
come with a bunch of other particles or
that it's perhaps made of other things

2360
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:14,940
that it's perhaps made of other things
 

2361
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,549
that it's perhaps made of other things
so it's not a fundamental particle that

2362
00:43:16,549 --> 00:43:16,559
so it's not a fundamental particle that
 

2363
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,259
so it's not a fundamental particle that
it's made of smaller things I can talk

2364
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:18,269
it's made of smaller things I can talk
 

2365
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:19,370
it's made of smaller things I can talk
about that if you like a bit that's

2366
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:19,380
about that if you like a bit that's
 

2367
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,789
about that if you like a bit that's
that's still an ocean so yeah so the

2368
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:22,799
that's still an ocean so yeah so the
 

2369
00:43:22,799 --> 00:43:24,229
that's still an ocean so yeah so the
Higgs might not be a fundamental

2370
00:43:24,229 --> 00:43:24,239
Higgs might not be a fundamental
 

2371
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:26,749
Higgs might not be a fundamental
particle there may be some in my oh man

2372
00:43:26,749 --> 00:43:26,759
particle there may be some in my oh man
 

2373
00:43:26,759 --> 00:43:28,880
particle there may be some in my oh man
so that that is an idea it's not you

2374
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:28,890
so that that is an idea it's not you
 

2375
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,620
so that that is an idea it's not you
know it's not been demonstrated to be

2376
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:30,630
know it's not been demonstrated to be
 

2377
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:32,839
know it's not been demonstrated to be
true but I mean there's all of these

2378
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:32,849
true but I mean there's all of these
 

2379
00:43:32,849 --> 00:43:35,920
true but I mean there's all of these
ideas basically come from the fact that

2380
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:35,930
ideas basically come from the fact that
 

2381
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:37,789
ideas basically come from the fact that
it's a this is this is a problem

2382
00:43:37,789 --> 00:43:37,799
it's a this is this is a problem
 

2383
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:39,680
it's a this is this is a problem
motivated a lot of development in

2384
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:39,690
motivated a lot of development in
 

2385
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:42,380
motivated a lot of development in
physics in the last 30 years or so and

2386
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:42,390
physics in the last 30 years or so and
 

2387
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,359
physics in the last 30 years or so and
there's this basic fact that the higgs

2388
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:44,369
there's this basic fact that the higgs
 

2389
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:45,710
there's this basic fact that the higgs
field which is this field that's

2390
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:45,720
field which is this field that's
 

2391
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,599
field which is this field that's
everywhere in the universe this is the

2392
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:47,609
everywhere in the universe this is the
 

2393
00:43:47,609 --> 00:43:48,920
everywhere in the universe this is the
thing that gives mass to the particles

2394
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:48,930
thing that gives mass to the particles
 

2395
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:50,239
thing that gives mass to the particles
and the Higgs field is different from

2396
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:50,249
and the Higgs field is different from
 

2397
00:43:50,249 --> 00:43:52,339
and the Higgs field is different from
ever all the other fields in that let's

2398
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:52,349
ever all the other fields in that let's
 

2399
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:53,930
ever all the other fields in that let's
say you take the electromagnetic field

2400
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:53,940
say you take the electromagnetic field
 

2401
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,789
say you take the electromagnetic field
which is you know if we actually were to

2402
00:43:55,789 --> 00:43:55,799
which is you know if we actually were to
 

2403
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,990
which is you know if we actually were to
measure the electromagnetic field

2404
00:43:56,990 --> 00:43:57,000
measure the electromagnetic field
 

2405
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,550
measure the electromagnetic field
we would measure all kinds of stuff

2406
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,560
we would measure all kinds of stuff
 

2407
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,780
we would measure all kinds of stuff
going on because there's light there's

2408
00:43:59,780 --> 00:43:59,790
going on because there's light there's
 

2409
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,730
going on because there's light there's
gonna be microwaves and radio waves and

2410
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:01,740
gonna be microwaves and radio waves and
 

2411
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,170
gonna be microwaves and radio waves and
stuff but let's say we could go to a

2412
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:03,180
stuff but let's say we could go to a
 

2413
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,599
stuff but let's say we could go to a
really really remote part of empty space

2414
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:05,609
really really remote part of empty space
 

2415
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,460
really really remote part of empty space
and shield it and put a big box around

2416
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:07,470
and shield it and put a big box around
 

2417
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,570
and shield it and put a big box around
it and then measure the electromagnetic

2418
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:08,580
it and then measure the electromagnetic
 

2419
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,730
it and then measure the electromagnetic
field in that box the field would be

2420
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:10,740
field in that box the field would be
 

2421
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:13,130
field in that box the field would be
almost zero apart from some little

2422
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:13,140
almost zero apart from some little
 

2423
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:15,650
almost zero apart from some little
quantum fluctuations but basically it

2424
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:15,660
quantum fluctuations but basically it
 

2425
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,960
quantum fluctuations but basically it
goes to naught the Higgs field has a

2426
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:17,970
goes to naught the Higgs field has a
 

2427
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:19,940
goes to naught the Higgs field has a
value everywhere so it's a bit like the

2428
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:19,950
value everywhere so it's a bit like the
 

2429
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,280
value everywhere so it's a bit like the
hole it's like the entire of space has

2430
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:22,290
hole it's like the entire of space has
 

2431
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:24,170
hole it's like the entire of space has
got this energy stored in the Higgs

2432
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:24,180
got this energy stored in the Higgs
 

2433
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,359
got this energy stored in the Higgs
field which is not zero it's it's finite

2434
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:26,369
field which is not zero it's it's finite
 

2435
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:27,830
field which is not zero it's it's finite
it's got some it's a bit like having the

2436
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:27,840
it's got some it's a bit like having the
 

2437
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:30,560
it's got some it's a bit like having the
the temperature of space raised to you

2438
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:30,570
the temperature of space raised to you
 

2439
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:34,010
the temperature of space raised to you
know some background temperature and

2440
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:34,020
know some background temperature and
 

2441
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:36,349
know some background temperature and
it's that energy that gives mass to the

2442
00:44:36,349 --> 00:44:36,359
it's that energy that gives mass to the
 

2443
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:37,970
it's that energy that gives mass to the
particles so the reason that electrons

2444
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:37,980
particles so the reason that electrons
 

2445
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:41,030
particles so the reason that electrons
and quarks have mass is through the

2446
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,040
and quarks have mass is through the
 

2447
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,560
and quarks have mass is through the
interaction with this energy that's

2448
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:42,570
interaction with this energy that's
 

2449
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:46,520
interaction with this energy that's
stored in the Higgs field now it turns

2450
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:46,530
stored in the Higgs field now it turns
 

2451
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:49,550
stored in the Higgs field now it turns
out that the precise value this energy

2452
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:49,560
out that the precise value this energy
 

2453
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,690
out that the precise value this energy
has has to be very carefully tuned if

2454
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:53,700
has has to be very carefully tuned if
 

2455
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,990
has has to be very carefully tuned if
you want a universe where interesting

2456
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:57,000
you want a universe where interesting
 

2457
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,089
you want a universe where interesting
stuff can happen so if you push the

2458
00:44:59,089 --> 00:44:59,099
stuff can happen so if you push the
 

2459
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:01,700
stuff can happen so if you push the
higgs field down it has a tendency to

2460
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:01,710
higgs field down it has a tendency to
 

2461
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,160
higgs field down it has a tendency to
collapse to what there's a tenon if you

2462
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:04,170
collapse to what there's a tenon if you
 

2463
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,570
collapse to what there's a tenon if you
do you're sort of naive calculations

2464
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:05,580
do you're sort of naive calculations
 

2465
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,460
do you're sort of naive calculations
they're basically two possible likely

2466
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:07,470
they're basically two possible likely
 

2467
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,990
they're basically two possible likely
configurations for the Higgs field which

2468
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:09,000
configurations for the Higgs field which
 

2469
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,570
configurations for the Higgs field which
is either it's zero everywhere in which

2470
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:11,580
is either it's zero everywhere in which
 

2471
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,040
is either it's zero everywhere in which
case you have a universe which is just

2472
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:13,050
case you have a universe which is just
 

2473
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:15,380
case you have a universe which is just
particles with no mass that can't form

2474
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:15,390
particles with no mass that can't form
 

2475
00:45:15,390 --> 00:45:17,000
particles with no mass that can't form
atoms and just fly by at the speed of

2476
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:17,010
atoms and just fly by at the speed of
 

2477
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:20,359
atoms and just fly by at the speed of
light or it explodes to an enormous

2478
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:20,369
light or it explodes to an enormous
 

2479
00:45:20,369 --> 00:45:21,530
light or it explodes to an enormous
value what we call the Planck scale

2480
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:21,540
value what we call the Planck scale
 

2481
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,599
value what we call the Planck scale
which is the scale of quantum gravity

2482
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:23,609
which is the scale of quantum gravity
 

2483
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:25,849
which is the scale of quantum gravity
and at that point if the Hicksville was

2484
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:25,859
and at that point if the Hicksville was
 

2485
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,980
and at that point if the Hicksville was
that strong even an electron would

2486
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:27,990
that strong even an electron would
 

2487
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,480
that strong even an electron would
become so massive that it would collapse

2488
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:29,490
become so massive that it would collapse
 

2489
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,670
become so massive that it would collapse
into a black hole and then you have a

2490
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:31,680
into a black hole and then you have a
 

2491
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,589
into a black hole and then you have a
universe made of black holes and nothing

2492
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:33,599
universe made of black holes and nothing
 

2493
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,410
universe made of black holes and nothing
like us so it seems that the the

2494
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:36,420
like us so it seems that the the
 

2495
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,240
like us so it seems that the the
strength of the Higgs field is - it

2496
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:38,250
strength of the Higgs field is - it
 

2497
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,040
strength of the Higgs field is - it
could achieve the value that we see

2498
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:40,050
could achieve the value that we see
 

2499
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:42,290
could achieve the value that we see
requires what we call fine-tuning of the

2500
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:42,300
requires what we call fine-tuning of the
 

2501
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,370
requires what we call fine-tuning of the
laws of physics you have to fiddle

2502
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:43,380
laws of physics you have to fiddle
 

2503
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,470
laws of physics you have to fiddle
around with the other fields in the

2504
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:45,480
around with the other fields in the
 

2505
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,089
around with the other fields in the
standard model and their properties to

2506
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:47,099
standard model and their properties to
 

2507
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:49,400
standard model and their properties to
just get it to this right sort of

2508
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:49,410
just get it to this right sort of
 

2509
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,740
just get it to this right sort of
Goldilocks value that allows atoms to

2510
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:51,750
Goldilocks value that allows atoms to
 

2511
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,280
Goldilocks value that allows atoms to
exist this is deeply fishy people really

2512
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,290
exist this is deeply fishy people really
 

2513
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,490
exist this is deeply fishy people really
dislike this well yeah I guess well so

2514
00:45:58,490 --> 00:45:58,500
dislike this well yeah I guess well so
 

2515
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,410
dislike this well yeah I guess well so
what would be a so - two explanations

2516
00:46:00,410 --> 00:46:00,420
what would be a so - two explanations
 

2517
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,329
what would be a so - two explanations
one there's a god the design this

2518
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:02,339
one there's a god the design this
 

2519
00:46:02,339 --> 00:46:05,180
one there's a god the design this
perfectly and two is there's an infinite

2520
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,190
perfectly and two is there's an infinite
 

2521
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,310
perfectly and two is there's an infinite
number of alternate universes and we'll

2522
00:46:07,310 --> 00:46:07,320
number of alternate universes and we'll
 

2523
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,800
number of alternate universes and we'll
just happen to being the one in which

2524
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:09,810
just happen to being the one in which
 

2525
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:10,970
just happen to being the one in which
life is possible

2526
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:10,980
life is possible
 

2527
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,880
life is possible
yeah complexity so when you say I mean

2528
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:13,890
yeah complexity so when you say I mean
 

2529
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,920
yeah complexity so when you say I mean
life any kind of complexity that's not

2530
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:15,930
life any kind of complexity that's not
 

2531
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:19,490
life any kind of complexity that's not
either complete chaos or black holes

2532
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:19,500
either complete chaos or black holes
 

2533
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,339
either complete chaos or black holes
yeah yeah I mean how does that make you

2534
00:46:22,339 --> 00:46:22,349
yeah yeah I mean how does that make you
 

2535
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:24,109
yeah yeah I mean how does that make you
feel what do you make that has such a

2536
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:24,119
feel what do you make that has such a
 

2537
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,569
feel what do you make that has such a
fascinating notion that this perfectly

2538
00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:26,579
fascinating notion that this perfectly
 

2539
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:29,569
fascinating notion that this perfectly
tuned field that's the same everywhere

2540
00:46:29,569 --> 00:46:29,579
tuned field that's the same everywhere
 

2541
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:32,290
tuned field that's the same everywhere
yeah is there what do you make of that

2542
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:32,300
yeah is there what do you make of that
 

2543
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,760
yeah is there what do you make of that
yeah well you make of that I mean yeah

2544
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:34,770
yeah well you make of that I mean yeah
 

2545
00:46:34,770 --> 00:46:35,839
yeah well you make of that I mean yeah
you like that two of the possible

2546
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:35,849
you like that two of the possible
 

2547
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:39,170
you like that two of the possible
explanations yeah I mean well someone

2548
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:39,180
explanations yeah I mean well someone
 

2549
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:41,270
explanations yeah I mean well someone
you know some cosmic creator way yeah

2550
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,280
you know some cosmic creator way yeah
 

2551
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,160
you know some cosmic creator way yeah
let's fix that to be at the right level

2552
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:43,170
let's fix that to be at the right level
 

2553
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,630
let's fix that to be at the right level
that's more possibility I guess it's not

2554
00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:44,640
that's more possibility I guess it's not
 

2555
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,280
that's more possibility I guess it's not
a scientifically test for one but you

2556
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:46,290
a scientifically test for one but you
 

2557
00:46:46,290 --> 00:46:48,109
a scientifically test for one but you
know theoretically I guess it's possible

2558
00:46:48,109 --> 00:46:48,119
know theoretically I guess it's possible
 

2559
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:50,120
know theoretically I guess it's possible
sorry to interrupt but there could also

2560
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:50,130
sorry to interrupt but there could also
 

2561
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:52,880
sorry to interrupt but there could also
be not a designer but could never be

2562
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:52,890
be not a designer but could never be
 

2563
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,640
be not a designer but could never be
just I guess I'm not sure what that

2564
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:55,650
just I guess I'm not sure what that
 

2565
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,980
just I guess I'm not sure what that
would be but as some kind of force that

2566
00:46:59,980 --> 00:46:59,990

 

2567
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:04,240

that some kind of mechanism by which

2568
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,250
that some kind of mechanism by which
 

2569
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:09,770
that some kind of mechanism by which
this this this kind of field is enforced

2570
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:09,780
this this this kind of field is enforced
 

2571
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:11,630
this this this kind of field is enforced
in order to create complexity basic

2572
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:11,640
in order to create complexity basic
 

2573
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:16,160
in order to create complexity basic
basically forces that pull the universe

2574
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,170
basically forces that pull the universe
 

2575
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,030
basically forces that pull the universe
towards an interesting complexity I mean

2576
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:20,040
towards an interesting complexity I mean
 

2577
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,430
towards an interesting complexity I mean
yeah I mean I has those ideas I don't

2578
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:22,440
yeah I mean I has those ideas I don't
 

2579
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,200
yeah I mean I has those ideas I don't
really subscribe to them as I'm saying

2580
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:24,210
really subscribe to them as I'm saying
 

2581
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,000
really subscribe to them as I'm saying
it sounds really stupid no I mean yeah

2582
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,010
it sounds really stupid no I mean yeah
 

2583
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:27,140
it sounds really stupid no I mean yeah
and there are definitely people that

2584
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:27,150
and there are definitely people that
 

2585
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:29,390
and there are definitely people that
make those kind of arguments you know

2586
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:29,400
make those kind of arguments you know
 

2587
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,940
make those kind of arguments you know
there's ideas that I think it's Lise

2588
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:31,950
there's ideas that I think it's Lise
 

2589
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:35,020
there's ideas that I think it's Lise
Mullins idea one I think that you know

2590
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:35,030
Mullins idea one I think that you know
 

2591
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:37,220
Mullins idea one I think that you know
universes are born inside black holes

2592
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:37,230
universes are born inside black holes
 

2593
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,400
universes are born inside black holes
and so universe is that behaved like

2594
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:40,410
and so universe is that behaved like
 

2595
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:42,170
and so universe is that behaved like
Darwinian evolution of the universe

2596
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:42,180
Darwinian evolution of the universe
 

2597
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:43,880
Darwinian evolution of the universe
where universes give birth to other

2598
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:43,890
where universes give birth to other
 

2599
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,680
where universes give birth to other
universes and they've universes where

2600
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:45,690
universes and they've universes where
 

2601
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:47,420
universes and they've universes where
black holes can form are more likely to

2602
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:47,430
black holes can form are more likely to
 

2603
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:49,250
black holes can form are more likely to
give birth to more universes so you end

2604
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:49,260
give birth to more universes so you end
 

2605
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,690
give birth to more universes so you end
up with universes which have similar

2606
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:50,700
up with universes which have similar
 

2607
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,760
up with universes which have similar
laws I mean I don't whatever but why I

2608
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:52,770
laws I mean I don't whatever but why I
 

2609
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,240
laws I mean I don't whatever but why I
talked to dr. Lee recently understand

2610
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:56,250
talked to dr. Lee recently understand
 

2611
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:59,390
talked to dr. Lee recently understand
this podcast and he's he's a reminder to

2612
00:47:59,390 --> 00:47:59,400
this podcast and he's he's a reminder to
 

2613
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:02,839
this podcast and he's he's a reminder to
me that the physics community has like

2614
00:48:02,839 --> 00:48:02,849
me that the physics community has like
 

2615
00:48:02,849 --> 00:48:05,720
me that the physics community has like
so many interesting characters yeah it's

2616
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:05,730
so many interesting characters yeah it's
 

2617
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,270
so many interesting characters yeah it's
fascinating yeah anyway so so I mean as

2618
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:08,280
fascinating yeah anyway so so I mean as
 

2619
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:09,740
fascinating yeah anyway so so I mean as
an experimentalist I tend to sort of

2620
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:09,750
an experimentalist I tend to sort of
 

2621
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:11,089
an experimentalist I tend to sort of
think these are interesting ideas but

2622
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:11,099
think these are interesting ideas but
 

2623
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,490
think these are interesting ideas but
they're not really testable so I tend

2624
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:13,500
they're not really testable so I tend
 

2625
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,630
they're not really testable so I tend
not to think about very much

2626
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:14,640
not to think about very much
 

2627
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,400
not to think about very much
so I mean going back to the science of

2628
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:16,410
so I mean going back to the science of
 

2629
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,650
so I mean going back to the science of
this there wasn't that there is an

2630
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:18,660
this there wasn't that there is an
 

2631
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,910
this there wasn't that there is an
explanation there is a possible solution

2632
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:19,920
explanation there is a possible solution
 

2633
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,380
explanation there is a possible solution
to this problem of the Higgs which

2634
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:21,390
to this problem of the Higgs which
 

2635
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:24,410
to this problem of the Higgs which
doesn't involve multiverses or creators

2636
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:24,420
doesn't involve multiverses or creators
 

2637
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:24,950
doesn't involve multiverses or creators
fiddling

2638
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
fiddling
 

2639
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,410
fiddling
about were the laws of physics if the

2640
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:27,420
about were the laws of physics if the
 

2641
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,730
about were the laws of physics if the
most popular solution was something

2642
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:28,740
most popular solution was something
 

2643
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:31,339
most popular solution was something
called supersymmetry which is a theory

2644
00:48:31,339 --> 00:48:31,349
called supersymmetry which is a theory
 

2645
00:48:31,349 --> 00:48:34,579
called supersymmetry which is a theory
which is involves a new type of symmetry

2646
00:48:34,579 --> 00:48:34,589
which is involves a new type of symmetry
 

2647
00:48:34,589 --> 00:48:36,530
which is involves a new type of symmetry
of the universe in fact it's one of the

2648
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:36,540
of the universe in fact it's one of the
 

2649
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,849
of the universe in fact it's one of the
last types of symmetries that is

2650
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:37,859
last types of symmetries that is
 

2651
00:48:37,859 --> 00:48:39,109
last types of symmetries that is
possible to have that we haven't already

2652
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:39,119
possible to have that we haven't already
 

2653
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:41,089
possible to have that we haven't already
seen in nature which is a symmetry

2654
00:48:41,089 --> 00:48:41,099
seen in nature which is a symmetry
 

2655
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,940
seen in nature which is a symmetry
between force particles and matter

2656
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:43,950
between force particles and matter
 

2657
00:48:43,950 --> 00:48:46,579
between force particles and matter
particles so what we call fermions which

2658
00:48:46,579 --> 00:48:46,589
particles so what we call fermions which
 

2659
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:47,990
particles so what we call fermions which
held before the matter particles and

2660
00:48:47,990 --> 00:48:48,000
held before the matter particles and
 

2661
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,120
held before the matter particles and
bosons which were force particles and if

2662
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:50,130
bosons which were force particles and if
 

2663
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,650
bosons which were force particles and if
you have supersymmetry then there is a

2664
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:51,660
you have supersymmetry then there is a
 

2665
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:54,770
you have supersymmetry then there is a
superpartner for every particle in the

2666
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:54,780
superpartner for every particle in the
 

2667
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,020
superpartner for every particle in the
standard model and the without going to

2668
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:57,030
standard model and the without going to
 

2669
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,550
standard model and the without going to
the details the effect of this basically

2670
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:58,560
the details the effect of this basically
 

2671
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,020
the details the effect of this basically
is that you have a whole bunch of other

2672
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:00,030
is that you have a whole bunch of other
 

2673
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:03,859
is that you have a whole bunch of other
fields and these fields cancel out the

2674
00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:03,869
fields and these fields cancel out the
 

2675
00:49:03,869 --> 00:49:05,660
fields and these fields cancel out the
effect of the standard model fields and

2676
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:05,670
effect of the standard model fields and
 

2677
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:08,210
effect of the standard model fields and
they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice

2678
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:08,220
they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice
 

2679
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:10,700
they stabilize the Higgs field at a nice
sensible value so in supersymmetry you

2680
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:10,710
sensible value so in supersymmetry you
 

2681
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,740
sensible value so in supersymmetry you
naturally without any concurring about

2682
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:12,750
naturally without any concurring about
 

2683
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:14,630
naturally without any concurring about
with the constants of nature or anything

2684
00:49:14,630 --> 00:49:14,640
with the constants of nature or anything
 

2685
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,820
with the constants of nature or anything
you get a Higgs field with a nice value

2686
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:16,830
you get a Higgs field with a nice value
 

2687
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:19,550
you get a Higgs field with a nice value
which is the one we see so this is one

2688
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:19,560
which is the one we see so this is one
 

2689
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:20,930
which is the one we see so this is one
of the written supersymmetry has also

00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:20,940
of the written supersymmetry has also
 

2691
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,760
of the written supersymmetry has also
got lots of other things going for it it

2692
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:22,770
got lots of other things going for it it
 

2693
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:24,650

2697
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,849

00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:28,859

00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:30,930
the strong force and the electroweak
 

2701
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:33,109
the strong force and the electroweak
force unify high energy so lots of

00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
force unify high energy so lots of
 

2703
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,040

reasons people thought this was a

2704
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:34,050
reasons people thought this was a
 

2705
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:36,260
reasons people thought this was a
productive idea and when the LHC was

2706
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:36,270
productive idea and when the LHC was
 

2707
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:38,030
productive idea and when the LHC was
just before it was turned on there was a

2708
00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:38,040
just before it was turned on there was a
 

2709
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,400
just before it was turned on there was a
lot of hype I guess a lot of an

2710
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:40,410
lot of hype I guess a lot of an
 

2711
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,530
lot of hype I guess a lot of an
expectation that we would discover these

2712
00:49:42,530 --> 00:49:42,540
expectation that we would discover these
 

2713
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:44,900
expectation that we would discover these
super partners because and particularly

2714
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:44,910
super partners because and particularly
 

2715
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,970
super partners because and particularly
the main reason was that if if

00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:46,980
the main reason was that if if

00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:49,970
the main reason was that if if
supersymmetry stabilizes the higgs field

2718
00:49:49,970 --> 00:49:49,980
supersymmetry stabilizes the higgs field
 

2719
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,089
supersymmetry stabilizes the higgs field
at this nice Goldilocks value these

2720
00:49:53,089 --> 00:49:53,099
at this nice Goldilocks value these
 

2721
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:55,220
at this nice Goldilocks value these
super particles should have a mass

2722
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:55,230
super particles should have a mass
 

2723
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,829
super particles should have a mass
around the energy that we're probing at

2724
00:49:57,829 --> 00:49:57,839
around the energy that we're probing at
 

2725
00:49:57,839 --> 00:49:59,599
around the energy that we're probing at
the LHC around the energy of the Higgs

2726
00:49:59,599 --> 00:49:59,609
the LHC around the energy of the Higgs
 

2727
00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:01,250
the LHC around the energy of the Higgs
so it was kind of thought you discovered

2728
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:01,260
so it was kind of thought you discovered
 

2729
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:02,349
so it was kind of thought you discovered
the Higgs you probably discover

2730
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:02,359
the Higgs you probably discover
 

2731
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:04,550
the Higgs you probably discover
superpartners so once you start creating

2732
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:04,560
superpartners so once you start creating
 

2733
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,589
superpartners so once you start creating
ripples in this fix field you should be

2734
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:06,599
ripples in this fix field you should be
 

2735
00:50:06,599 --> 00:50:09,079
ripples in this fix field you should be
able to see these kinds of you should be

2736
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:09,089
able to see these kinds of you should be
 

2737
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:11,150
able to see these kinds of you should be
yeah super fields would be there but I

2738
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:11,160
yeah super fields would be there but I
 

2739
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,290
yeah super fields would be there but I
said well at the very beginning I said

2740
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:12,300
said well at the very beginning I said
 

2741
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,300
said well at the very beginning I said
we're probing the vacuum what I mean is

2742
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:14,310
we're probing the vacuum what I mean is
 

2743
00:50:14,310 --> 00:50:15,650
we're probing the vacuum what I mean is
really that you know okay let's say

2744
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:15,660
really that you know okay let's say
 

2745
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,060
really that you know okay let's say
these super fields exist the vacuum

2746
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:17,070
these super fields exist the vacuum
 

2747
00:50:17,070 --> 00:50:18,530
these super fields exist the vacuum
contains super fields they're they're

2748
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:18,540
contains super fields they're they're
 

2749
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,420
contains super fields they're they're
these super symmetric fields if we hit

2750
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:20,430
these super symmetric fields if we hit
 

2751
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,620
these super symmetric fields if we hit
them hard enough we can make them

2752
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:21,630
them hard enough we can make them
 

2753
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,200
them hard enough we can make them
vibrate we see super particles come

2754
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:24,210
vibrate we see super particles come
 

2755
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,910
vibrate we see super particles come
flying out that's the sort of that's the

2756
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:25,920
flying out that's the sort of that's the
 

2757
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,630
flying out that's the sort of that's the
idea the hope ok that's the whole alone

2758
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
idea the hope ok that's the whole alone
 

2759
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,180
idea the hope ok that's the whole alone
but we haven't but we haven't so so far

2760
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,190
but we haven't but we haven't so so far
 

2761
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:35,480
but we haven't but we haven't so so far
at least I mean we've had now a decade

2762
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:35,490
at least I mean we've had now a decade
 

2763
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:38,360
at least I mean we've had now a decade
of data taking at the LHC

particles beyond the standard model have
 

2773
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,470

00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,630
I haven't heard that before that's
really that's an issue but could you

really that's an issue but could you
 

2791
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,900
really that's an issue but could you
maybe linger on that like what what

00:51:10,370 --> 00:51:10,380
made of well so the the oldest I think

00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,810

the original ideas about this was these

2798
00:51:11,810 --> 00:51:11,820
the original ideas about this was these
 

2799
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,900
the original ideas about this was these
theories called Technicolor which were

2800
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:14,910
theories called Technicolor which were
 

2801
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:16,490
theories called Technicolor which were
basically like an analogy with the

00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:16,500
basically like an analogy with the
 

2803
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:18,440
basically like an analogy with the
strong force so the idea was the Higgs

2804
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:18,450
strong force so the idea was the Higgs
 

2805
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,790
strong force so the idea was the Higgs
boson was a bound state of two very

00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:22,800
boson was a bound state of two very
 

2807
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,620
boson was a bound state of two very
strongly interacting particles that were

00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:24,630
strongly interacting particles that were
 

2809
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,690
strongly interacting particles that were
a bit like quarks so like quarks but I

2810
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:26,700
a bit like quarks so like quarks but I
 

2811
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:29,810
a bit like quarks so like quarks but I
guess higher energy things with a super

guess higher energy things with a super
 

2813
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,220
guess higher energy things with a super

00:51:31,220 --> 00:51:31,230
strong force so not the strong force but
 

2815
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,170
strong force so not the strong force but
a new force that was very strong and the

2816
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:33,180
a new force that was very strong and the
 

2817
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,570
a new force that was very strong and the
Higgs was a bound state of these these

2818
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:35,580
Higgs was a bound state of these these
 

2819
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,670
Higgs was a bound state of these these
objects and the Higgs wouldn't principle

2820
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:37,680
objects and the Higgs wouldn't principle
 

2821
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,260
objects and the Higgs wouldn't principle
if that was right would be the first in

2822
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,270
if that was right would be the first in
 

2823
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,840
if that was right would be the first in
a series of Technicolor particles

2824
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:41,850
a series of Technicolor particles
 

2825
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,530
a series of Technicolor particles
Technicolor I think not being a theorist

2826
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:45,540
Technicolor I think not being a theorist
 

2827
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,150
Technicolor I think not being a theorist
but it's not biz basically not done very

2828
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:47,160
but it's not biz basically not done very
 

2829
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,980
but it's not biz basically not done very
well there's particularly since the LHC

2830
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:48,990
well there's particularly since the LHC
 

2831
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:51,230
well there's particularly since the LHC
found the Higgs that kind of it rules

2832
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:51,240
found the Higgs that kind of it rules
 

2833
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,090
found the Higgs that kind of it rules
out you know a lot of these Technicolor

2834
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:53,100
out you know a lot of these Technicolor
 

2835
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,350
out you know a lot of these Technicolor
theories but there are other things that

2836
00:51:54,350 --> 00:51:54,360
theories but there are other things that
 

2837
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,540
theories but there are other things that
are a bit like Technicolor so there's a

2838
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:56,550
are a bit like Technicolor so there's a
 

2839
00:51:56,550 --> 00:52:00,320
are a bit like Technicolor so there's a
theory called partial composite nurse

2840
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:00,330
theory called partial composite nurse
 

2841
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,030
theory called partial composite nurse
which is an idea that some of my

2842
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:02,040
which is an idea that some of my
 

2843
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,740
which is an idea that some of my
colleagues that Cambridge have worked on

2844
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:03,750
colleagues that Cambridge have worked on
 

2845
00:52:03,750 --> 00:52:06,560
colleagues that Cambridge have worked on
which is a similar sort of idea that the

2846
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:06,570
which is a similar sort of idea that the
 

2847
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,930
which is a similar sort of idea that the
Higgs is a bound state of some strongly

2848
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:08,940
Higgs is a bound state of some strongly
 

2849
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,760
Higgs is a bound state of some strongly
interacting particles and that the

2850
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:10,770
interacting particles and that the
 

2851
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:13,070
interacting particles and that the
standard model particles themselves the

2852
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:13,080
standard model particles themselves the
 

2853
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,920
standard model particles themselves the
more exotic ones like the top quark are

2854
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:15,930
more exotic ones like the top quark are
 

2855
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,980
more exotic ones like the top quark are
also sort of mixtures of these composite

2856
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:18,990
also sort of mixtures of these composite
 

2857
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,340
also sort of mixtures of these composite
particles so it's a kind of an extension

2858
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:22,350
particles so it's a kind of an extension
 

2859
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:24,590
particles so it's a kind of an extension
to the standard model which explains

2860
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:24,600
to the standard model which explains
 

2861
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,470
to the standard model which explains
this problem with the Higgs bosons

2862
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,480
this problem with the Higgs bosons
 

2863
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,140
this problem with the Higgs bosons
Goldilocks value but also helps us

2864
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:30,150
Goldilocks value but also helps us
 

2865
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:31,610
Goldilocks value but also helps us
understand we have we're in a situation

2866
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:31,620
understand we have we're in a situation
 

2867
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,430
understand we have we're in a situation
now again a bit like the periodic table

2868
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:34,440
now again a bit like the periodic table
 

2869
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,850
now again a bit like the periodic table
where we have six quarks six leptons in

2870
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:37,860
where we have six quarks six leptons in
 

2871
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:39,380
where we have six quarks six leptons in
this kind of you can range in this nice

2872
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,390
this kind of you can range in this nice
 

2873
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:40,820
this kind of you can range in this nice
table and there you can see these

2874
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:40,830
table and there you can see these
 

2875
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:42,560
table and there you can see these
columns where the patterns repeat and

2876
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:42,570
columns where the patterns repeat and
 

2877
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,380
columns where the patterns repeat and
you go okay maybe there's something

2878
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:45,390
you go okay maybe there's something
 

2879
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:47,480
you go okay maybe there's something
deeper going on here is that you know

2880
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:47,490
deeper going on here is that you know
 

2881
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:48,980
deeper going on here is that you know
and and so this would potentially be

2882
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:48,990
and and so this would potentially be
 

2883
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,720
and and so this would potentially be
something this partial composite NOS

2884
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:50,730
something this partial composite NOS
 

2885
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:51,930
something this partial composite NOS
theory could

Lane sort of enlarged this picture that

2888
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:54,430
Lane sort of enlarged this picture that
 

2889
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,100
Lane sort of enlarged this picture that
allows us to see the whole symmetrical

2890
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:56,110
allows us to see the whole symmetrical
 

2891
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,390
allows us to see the whole symmetrical
pattern and understand what the

2892
00:52:57,390 --> 00:52:57,400
pattern and understand what the
 

2893
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,280
pattern and understand what the
ingredients why do we have wind so one

2894
00:52:59,280 --> 00:52:59,290
ingredients why do we have wind so one
 

2895
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:00,630
ingredients why do we have wind so one
of the big questions in particle physics

2896
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:00,640
of the big questions in particle physics
 

2897
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,650
of the big questions in particle physics
is why are there three copies of the

2898
00:53:04,650 --> 00:53:04,660
is why are there three copies of the
 

2899
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:07,110
is why are there three copies of the
matter particles so in what we call the

2900
00:53:07,110 --> 00:53:07,120
matter particles so in what we call the
 

2901
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,400
matter particles so in what we call the
first generation which is what we're

2902
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:08,410
first generation which is what we're
 

2903
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,410
first generation which is what we're
made of there's the electron the

2904
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:10,420
made of there's the electron the
 

2905
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,330
made of there's the electron the
electron neutrino the up quark on the

2906
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:12,340
electron neutrino the up quark on the
 

2907
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,830
electron neutrino the up quark on the
down quark they're the most common

2908
00:53:13,830 --> 00:53:13,840
down quark they're the most common
 

2909
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,660
down quark they're the most common
matter particles in the universe but

2910
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:15,670
matter particles in the universe but
 

2911
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,940
matter particles in the universe but
then there are copies of these four

2912
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:17,950
then there are copies of these four
 

2913
00:53:17,950 --> 00:53:19,500
then there are copies of these four
particles in the second and the third

2914
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:19,510
particles in the second and the third
 

2915
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:21,840
particles in the second and the third
generations so things like muons and top

2916
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:21,850
generations so things like muons and top
 

2917
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:23,700

quarks and other stuff we don't know why

2918
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:23,710

2919
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:25,680
quarks and other stuff we don't know why
we see these patterns we have no idea

2920
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:25,690
we see these patterns we have no idea
 

2921
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:27,780
we see these patterns we have no idea
where it comes from so that's another

2922
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:27,790
where it comes from so that's another
 

2923
00:53:27,790 --> 00:53:29,820
where it comes from so that's another
big question you know can we find out

2924
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:29,830
big question you know can we find out
 

2925
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,000
big question you know can we find out
the deeper order that explains this

2926
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:33,010
the deeper order that explains this
 

2927
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:35,310
the deeper order that explains this
particular tape period table of

2928
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:35,320
particular tape period table of
 

2929
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,140
particular tape period table of
particles that we see is it possible

2930
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,150
particles that we see is it possible
 

2931
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:40,320
particles that we see is it possible
that the the deeper order includes like

2932
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:40,330
that the the deeper order includes like
 

2933
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:43,380
that the the deeper order includes like
almost a single entity so like something

2934
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:43,390
almost a single entity so like something
 

2935
00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:45,210
almost a single entity so like something
that I guess like string theory dreams

2936
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:45,220
that I guess like string theory dreams
 

2937
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:48,510
that I guess like string theory dreams
about is this is this part is this

2938
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:48,520
about is this is this part is this
 

2939
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,910
about is this is this part is this
essentially the dream is to discover

2940
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:50,920
essentially the dream is to discover
 

2941
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,730
essentially the dream is to discover
something simple beautiful and unifying

2942
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:53,740
something simple beautiful and unifying
 

2943
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,480
something simple beautiful and unifying
yeah I mean that is the dream and it I

2944
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:57,490
yeah I mean that is the dream and it I
 

2945
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,190
yeah I mean that is the dream and it I
think for some people for a lot of

2946
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,200
think for some people for a lot of
 

2947
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,020
think for some people for a lot of
people it still is the dream so there's

2948
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:01,030
people it still is the dream so there's
 

2949
00:54:01,030 --> 00:54:04,170
people it still is the dream so there's
a great book by Steven Weinberg who is

2950
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:04,180
a great book by Steven Weinberg who is
 

2951
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,910
a great book by Steven Weinberg who is
one of the theoretical physicists who

2952
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:05,920
one of the theoretical physicists who
 

2953
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,650
one of the theoretical physicists who
was instrumental in building the

2954
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:07,660
was instrumental in building the
 

2955
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,960
was instrumental in building the
standard model so he came up with some

2956
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:09,970
standard model so he came up with some
 

2957
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:12,120
standard model so he came up with some
others with the electroweak theory the

2958
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:12,130
others with the electroweak theory the
 

2959
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,800
others with the electroweak theory the
theory that unified electromagnetism and

2960
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:13,810
theory that unified electromagnetism and
 

2961
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:15,750
theory that unified electromagnetism and
the weak force and here at this book I

2962
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:15,760
the weak force and here at this book I
 

2963
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,280
the weak force and here at this book I
think it was towards the end of the 80s

2964
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:17,290
think it was towards the end of the 80s
 

2965
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,200
think it was towards the end of the 80s
early 90s called dreams of a final

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:19,210
early 90s called dreams of a final
 

2967
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,690
early 90s called dreams of a final
theory which is a very lovely quite

2968
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:21,700
theory which is a very lovely quite
 

2969
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,110
theory which is a very lovely quite

unifying theory that brings everything

2972
00:54:26,790 --> 00:54:26,800
unifying theory that brings everything
 

2973
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,650
unifying theory that brings everything
together and I think you get a sense

2974
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:28,660
together and I think you get a sense
 

2975
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,330
together and I think you get a sense

2976
00:54:30,330 --> 00:54:30,340
reading his book written at the end of
 

2977
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,250
reading his book written at the end of
80s and early 90s that there was this

2978
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:32,260
80s and early 90s that there was this
 

2979
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:35,900
80s and early 90s that there was this
feeling that such a theory was coming

2980
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:35,910
feeling that such a theory was coming
 

2981
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:39,180
feeling that such a theory was coming
and that was the time when string theory

2982
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:39,190
and that was the time when string theory
 

2983
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:41,580
and that was the time when string theory
had been was was very exciting so string

2984
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:41,590
had been was was very exciting so string
 

2985
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:42,840
had been was was very exciting so string
theory there's been this thing called

2986
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:42,850
theory there's been this thing called
 

2987
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:44,190
theory there's been this thing called
the superstring revolution and

2988
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:44,200
the superstring revolution and
 

2989
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,170
the superstring revolution and
theoretical physical very excited they

2990
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:46,180
theoretical physical very excited they
 

2991
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:47,550
theoretical physical very excited they
discovered these theoretical objects

2992
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:47,560
discovered these theoretical objects
 

2993
00:54:47,560 --> 00:54:49,290
discovered these theoretical objects
these little vibrating loops of string

2994
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:49,300
these little vibrating loops of string
 

2995
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,540
these little vibrating loops of string
that in principle not only was a quantum

2996
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:51,550
that in principle not only was a quantum
 

2997
00:54:51,550 --> 00:54:53,370
that in principle not only was a quantum
theory of gravity but could explain all

2998
00:54:53,370 --> 00:54:53,380
theory of gravity but could explain all
 

2999
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,870
theory of gravity but could explain all
the particles in the standard model and

3000
00:54:54,870 --> 00:54:54,880
the particles in the standard model and
 

3001
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,460
the particles in the standard model and
bring it all together and you as you say

3002
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:56,470
bring it all together and you as you say
 

3003
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,760
bring it all together and you as you say
you have one object the string and you

3004
00:54:59,760 --> 00:54:59,770
you have one object the string and you
 

3005
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:02,310
you have one object the string and you
can pluck it and the way it vibrates

3006
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:02,320
can pluck it and the way it vibrates
 

3007
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:04,110
can pluck it and the way it vibrates
gives you these different notes each of

3008
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:04,120
gives you these different notes each of
 

3009
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,799
gives you these different notes each of
which is a different part

3010
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:05,809
which is a different part
 

3011
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,220
which is a different part
so it's a very lovely idea but the

3012
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:09,230
so it's a very lovely idea but the
 

3013
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,289
so it's a very lovely idea but the
problem is that well there's a there's a

3014
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:11,299
problem is that well there's a there's a
 

3015
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:13,420
problem is that well there's a there's a
few people discover their mathematics is

3016
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:13,430
few people discover their mathematics is
 

3017
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,910
few people discover their mathematics is
very difficult so people have spent

3018
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:15,920
very difficult so people have spent
 

3019
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,039
very difficult so people have spent
three decades and more trying to

3020
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:18,049
three decades and more trying to
 

3021
00:55:18,049 --> 00:55:19,750
three decades and more trying to
understand string theory and I think you

3022
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:19,760
understand string theory and I think you
 

3023
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:21,250
understand string theory and I think you
know if you spoke to most string

3024
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:21,260
know if you spoke to most string
 

3025
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:22,270
know if you spoke to most string
theorists they would probably freely

3026
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:22,280
theorists they would probably freely
 

3027
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:23,559
theorists they would probably freely
admit that no one really knows what

3028
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:23,569
admit that no one really knows what
 

3029
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:25,420
admit that no one really knows what
string theory is yet I mean there's been

3030
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:25,430
string theory is yet I mean there's been
 

3031
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,740
string theory is yet I mean there's been
a lot of work but it's not really

3032
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:26,750
a lot of work but it's not really
 

3033
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:30,460
a lot of work but it's not really
understood and the other problem is that

3034
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:30,470
understood and the other problem is that
 

3035
00:55:30,470 --> 00:55:31,990
understood and the other problem is that
string theory mostly makes predictions

3036
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,000
string theory mostly makes predictions
 

3037
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,069
string theory mostly makes predictions
about physics that occurs energies far

3038
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:36,079
about physics that occurs energies far
 

3039
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,990
about physics that occurs energies far
beyond what we will ever be able to

3040
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:38,000
beyond what we will ever be able to
 

3041
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,530
beyond what we will ever be able to
probe in the laboratory yeah probably

3042
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:41,540
probe in the laboratory yeah probably
 

3043
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:43,839
probe in the laboratory yeah probably
ever by the way so sorry they take a

3044
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:43,849
ever by the way so sorry they take a
 

3045
00:55:43,849 --> 00:55:46,630
ever by the way so sorry they take a
million tangents but is there room for

3046
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:46,640
million tangents but is there room for
 

3047
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,150
million tangents but is there room for
complete innovation of how to build a

3048
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:49,160
complete innovation of how to build a
 

3049
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,280
complete innovation of how to build a
particle collider that could give us an

3050
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:51,290
particle collider that could give us an
 

3051
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:54,370
particle collider that could give us an
order of magnitude increase in any kind

3052
00:55:54,370 --> 00:55:54,380
order of magnitude increase in any kind
 

3053
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:56,890
order of magnitude increase in any kind
of energies or do we need to keep just

3054
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:56,900
of energies or do we need to keep just
 

3055
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:58,359
of energies or do we need to keep just
increasing the size of thing

3056
00:55:58,359 --> 00:55:58,369
increasing the size of thing
 

3057
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:00,190
increasing the size of thing
I mean maybe yeah I mean there are ideas

3058
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:00,200
I mean maybe yeah I mean there are ideas
 

3059
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:02,319
I mean maybe yeah I mean there are ideas
but to give you a sense of the Gulf that

3060
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:02,329
but to give you a sense of the Gulf that
 

3061
00:56:02,329 --> 00:56:03,549
but to give you a sense of the Gulf that
has to be bridged

3062
00:56:03,549 --> 00:56:03,559
has to be bridged
 

3063
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:08,559
has to be bridged
so the LHC collides particles at an

3064
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:08,569
so the LHC collides particles at an
 

3065
00:56:08,569 --> 00:56:12,460
so the LHC collides particles at an
energy of what we call fourteen terror

3066
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:12,470
energy of what we call fourteen terror
 

3067
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:14,079
energy of what we call fourteen terror
electron volts so that's basically

3068
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,089
electron volts so that's basically
 

3069
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:16,359
electron volts so that's basically
equivalent of you accelerated a proton

3070
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:16,369
equivalent of you accelerated a proton
 

3071
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:19,870
equivalent of you accelerated a proton
through 14 trillion volts that gets us

3072
00:56:19,870 --> 00:56:19,880
through 14 trillion volts that gets us
 

3073
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,250
through 14 trillion volts that gets us
to the energies where the Higgs and

3074
00:56:21,250 --> 00:56:21,260
to the energies where the Higgs and
 

3075
00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:23,559
to the energies where the Higgs and
these weak particles live they're very

3076
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:23,569
these weak particles live they're very
 

3077
00:56:23,569 --> 00:56:25,870
these weak particles live they're very
massive the the scale where strings

3078
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:25,880
massive the the scale where strings
 

3079
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,270
massive the the scale where strings
become manifest is something called the

3080
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:28,280
become manifest is something called the
 

3081
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,309
become manifest is something called the
Planck scale which i think is of the

3082
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:30,319
Planck scale which i think is of the
 

3083
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,099
Planck scale which i think is of the
order 10 to the hang on again that's

3084
00:56:33,099 --> 00:56:33,109
order 10 to the hang on again that's
 

3085
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:35,740
order 10 to the hang on again that's
right is 10 to the 18 Giga electron volt

3086
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:35,750
right is 10 to the 18 Giga electron volt
 

3087
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:40,720
right is 10 to the 18 Giga electron volt
so about 10 to the 15 terror electron

3088
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:40,730
so about 10 to the 15 terror electron
 

3089
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,309
so about 10 to the 15 terror electron
volts so you're talking you know

3090
00:56:42,309 --> 00:56:42,319
volts so you're talking you know
 

3091
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,150
volts so you're talking you know
trillions of times more energy more the

3092
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:45,160
trillions of times more energy more the
 

3093
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,980
trillions of times more energy more the
10 to the 15 the 10 to the 14th larger

3094
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:49,990
10 to the 15 the 10 to the 14th larger
 

3095
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:53,589
10 to the 15 the 10 to the 14th larger
it's a very big number so you know we're

3096
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:53,599
it's a very big number so you know we're
 

3097
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:54,910
it's a very big number so you know we're
not talking just an order of magnitude

3098
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:54,920
not talking just an order of magnitude
 

3099
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,680
not talking just an order of magnitude
increase in energy we're talking 14

3100
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:56,690
increase in energy we're talking 14
 

3101
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:58,839
increase in energy we're talking 14
orders of magnitude energy increase so

3102
00:56:58,839 --> 00:56:58,849
orders of magnitude energy increase so
 

3103
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:00,460
orders of magnitude energy increase so
to give you a sense of what that would

3104
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:00,470
to give you a sense of what that would
 

3105
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:02,349
to give you a sense of what that would
look like were you to build a particle

3106
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:02,359
look like were you to build a particle
 

3107
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:04,299
look like were you to build a particle
accelerator with today's technology

3108
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:04,309
accelerator with today's technology
 

3109
00:57:04,309 --> 00:57:06,579
accelerator with today's technology
bigger or smaller and then our solar

3110
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:06,589
bigger or smaller and then our solar
 

3111
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:09,010
bigger or smaller and then our solar
system as start the size of the galaxy

3112
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:09,020
system as start the size of the galaxy
 

3113
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,930
system as start the size of the galaxy
the galaxy so you need to put a particle

3114
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:10,940
the galaxy so you need to put a particle
 

3115
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:12,700
the galaxy so you need to put a particle
accelerator that circled the Milky Way

3116
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:12,710
accelerator that circled the Milky Way
 

3117
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:15,010
accelerator that circled the Milky Way
to get to the energies where you would

3118
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:15,020
to get to the energies where you would
 

3119
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,549
to get to the energies where you would
see strings if they exist so there's a

3120
00:57:18,549 --> 00:57:18,559
see strings if they exist so there's a
 

3121
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:19,270
see strings if they exist so there's a
fundamental

3122
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:19,280
fundamental
 

3123
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,850
fundamental
or problem which is that most of the

3124
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:21,860

00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,380
you never never say never but it seems
very unlikely yeah I can just see the

the exciting possibilities you mentioned
 

3169
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,030
the exciting possibilities you mentioned
supersymmetry yeah so well there are

3170
00:58:16,030 --> 00:58:16,040
supersymmetry yeah so well there are
 

3171
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,070
supersymmetry yeah so well there are
lots of new ideas well there's lots of

3172
00:58:18,070 --> 00:58:18,080
lots of new ideas well there's lots of
 

3173
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,240
lots of new ideas well there's lots of
problems that we're facing so there's a

3174
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:19,250
problems that we're facing so there's a
 

3175
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,320
problems that we're facing so there's a
problem with the Higgs field which

3176
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,330
problem with the Higgs field which
 

3177
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,500
problem with the Higgs field which
supersymmetry was supposed to solve

3178
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:22,510
supersymmetry was supposed to solve
 

3179
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:25,210
supersymmetry was supposed to solve
there's the fact that 95% of the

3180
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:25,220
there's the fact that 95% of the
 

3181
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:27,220
there's the fact that 95% of the
universe we know from cosmology

3182
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:27,230
universe we know from cosmology
 

3183
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:29,830
universe we know from cosmology
astrophysics is invisible that it's made

3184
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:29,840
astrophysics is invisible that it's made
 

3185
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,140
astrophysics is invisible that it's made
of dark matter and dark energy which are

3186
00:58:32,140 --> 00:58:32,150
of dark matter and dark energy which are
 

3187
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,300
of dark matter and dark energy which are
really just words for things that we

3188
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:34,310
really just words for things that we
 

3189
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:35,650
really just words for things that we
don't know what they are it's what

3190
00:58:35,650 --> 00:58:35,660
don't know what they are it's what
 

3191
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:37,290
don't know what they are it's what
Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown

3192
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:37,300
Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown
 

3193
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,000
Donald Rumsfeld called a known unknown
we know we don't know what they are well

3194
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:40,010
we know we don't know what they are well
 

3195
00:58:40,010 --> 00:58:42,040
we know we don't know what they are well
that's it's better than an unknown

3196
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,050
that's it's better than an unknown
 

3197
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,000
that's it's better than an unknown
unknown yeah well there may be some

3198
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,010
unknown yeah well there may be some
 

3199
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:44,980
unknown yeah well there may be some
unknown unknown but I don't know what

3200
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:44,990
unknown unknown but I don't know what
 

3201
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:49,440
unknown unknown but I don't know what
those yeah but but the the hope is the

3202
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:49,450
those yeah but but the the hope is the
 

3203
00:58:49,450 --> 00:58:53,830
those yeah but but the the hope is the
particle accelerator could help us make

3204
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:53,840
particle accelerator could help us make
 

3205
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,810
particle accelerator could help us make
sense of dark energy dark matter there's

3206
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:55,820
sense of dark energy dark matter there's
 

3207
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:57,400
sense of dark energy dark matter there's
still there's just some hope for that

3208
00:58:57,400 --> 00:58:57,410
still there's just some hope for that
 

3209
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,440
still there's just some hope for that
there's hope for that yes so one of the

3210
00:58:59,440 --> 00:58:59,450
there's hope for that yes so one of the
 

3211
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,720
there's hope for that yes so one of the
hopes is the LHC could produce a Dark

3212
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:01,730
hopes is the LHC could produce a Dark
 

3213
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:03,550
hopes is the LHC could produce a Dark
Matter particle in its collisions and

3214
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:03,560
Matter particle in its collisions and
 

3215
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:08,530
Matter particle in its collisions and
you know it may be that the LHC will

3216
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:08,540
you know it may be that the LHC will
 

3217
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,180
you know it may be that the LHC will
still discover new particles that it

3218
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,190
still discover new particles that it
 

3219
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,710
still discover new particles that it
might still supersymmetry could still be

3220
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:11,720
might still supersymmetry could still be
 

3221
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,120
might still supersymmetry could still be
there we just it's just maybe more

3222
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:13,130
there we just it's just maybe more
 

3223
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:14,830
there we just it's just maybe more
difficult to find than we thought

3224
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:14,840
difficult to find than we thought
 

3225
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,050
difficult to find than we thought
originally and and you know dark matter

3226
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:17,060
originally and and you know dark matter
 

3227
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:18,640
originally and and you know dark matter
particles might be being produced but

3228
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:18,650
particles might be being produced but
 

3229
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,020
particles might be being produced but
we're just not looking in the right part

3230
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,030
we're just not looking in the right part
 

3231
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:21,340
we're just not looking in the right part
of the data for them that that's

3232
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:21,350
of the data for them that that's
 

3233
00:59:21,350 --> 00:59:22,990
of the data for them that that's
possible it might be that we need more

3234
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:23,000
possible it might be that we need more
 

3235
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,610
possible it might be that we need more
data that these processes are very rare

3236
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:24,620
data that these processes are very rare
 

3237
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:26,410
data that these processes are very rare
and we need to collect lots and lots of

3238
00:59:26,410 --> 00:59:26,420
and we need to collect lots and lots of
 

3239
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:28,300
and we need to collect lots and lots of
data before we see them but I think a

3240
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:28,310
data before we see them but I think a
 

3241
00:59:28,310 --> 00:59:31,630
data before we see them but I think a
lot of people would say now that the

3242
00:59:31,630 --> 00:59:31,640
lot of people would say now that the
 

3243
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,240
lot of people would say now that the
chances of the LHC

3244
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,250
chances of the LHC
 

3245
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:36,099
chances of the LHC
directly discovering new particles in

3246
00:59:36,099 --> 00:59:36,109
directly discovering new particles in
 

3247
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:38,260
directly discovering new particles in
the near future is quite slim it may be

3248
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:38,270
the near future is quite slim it may be
 

3249
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,990
the near future is quite slim it may be
that we need a decade more data before

3250
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:41,000
that we need a decade more data before
 

3251
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,210
that we need a decade more data before
we can see something or we may not see

3252
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:43,220
we can see something or we may not see
 

3253
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:45,460
we can see something or we may not see
anything that's the that's what we are

3254
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:45,470
anything that's the that's what we are
 

3255
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:47,440
anything that's the that's what we are
so I mean the the physics the

3256
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:47,450
so I mean the the physics the
 

3257
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:49,570
so I mean the the physics the
experiments that I work on so I work on

00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:49,580
experiments that I work on so I work on
 

3259
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,430
experiments that I work on so I work on
a detector called LHC B which is one of

3260
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
a detector called LHC B which is one of
 

3261
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,260
a detector called LHC B which is one of

these four big detectors that are spaced
 

3263
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:55,120
these four big detectors that are spaced
around the ring and we do slightly

3264
00:59:55,120 --> 00:59:55,130
around the ring and we do slightly
 

3265
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:57,730
around the ring and we do slightly
different stuff to the big guys there's

3266
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:57,740
different stuff to the big guys there's
 

3267
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,230
different stuff to the big guys there's
two big experiments called outlets and

01:00:10,670 --> 01:00:13,270
what we look at our standard model
particles called B quarks which

3282
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:13,280
particles called B quarks which
 

3283
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,010
particles called B quarks which
depending on your preference is either

3284
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:15,020
depending on your preference is either
 

3285
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:17,560
depending on your preference is either
bottom or beauty we tend to say beauty

3286
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:17,570
bottom or beauty we tend to say beauty
 

3287
01:00:17,570 --> 01:00:20,800
bottom or beauty we tend to say beauty
because it sounds sexier yeah but these

3288
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:20,810
because it sounds sexier yeah but these
 

3289
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,859
because it sounds sexier yeah but these
particles are interesting because they

3290
01:00:23,859 --> 01:00:23,869
particles are interesting because they
 

3291
01:00:23,869 --> 01:00:26,170
particles are interesting because they
of you can make lots of them we make

3292
01:00:26,170 --> 01:00:26,180
of you can make lots of them we make
 

3293
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,910
of you can make lots of them we make
billions or Billy a hundreds of billions

3294
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:27,920
billions or Billy a hundreds of billions
 

3295
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,380
billions or Billy a hundreds of billions
of these things you can therefore

3296
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:29,390
of these things you can therefore
 

3297
01:00:29,390 --> 01:00:31,359
of these things you can therefore
measure their properties very precisely

3298
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,369
measure their properties very precisely
 

3299
01:00:31,369 --> 01:00:32,710
measure their properties very precisely
so you can make these really lovely

3300
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:32,720
so you can make these really lovely
 

3301
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,099
so you can make these really lovely
precision measurements and what we are

3302
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:36,109
precision measurements and what we are
 

3303
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:39,160
precision measurements and what we are
doing really is a sort of complementary

3304
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:39,170
doing really is a sort of complementary
 

3305
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:40,990
doing really is a sort of complementary
thing to the other big experiments which

is they if you think the self analogy

3308
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:43,160
is they if you think the self analogy
 

3309
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,380
is they if you think the self analogy
that I often use is if you imagine

you're looking in you're in a jungle and
 

3313
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,870
you're looking in you're in a jungle and
you're looking for an elephant same and

01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:48,880
you're looking for an elephant same and
 

3315
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,060
you're looking for an elephant same and
you are a hunter and you're kind of like

the jungles big so there's two ways you

3322
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:56,180
the jungles big so there's two ways you
 

3323
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:57,490
the jungles big so there's two ways you
go about this either you can go out

01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:57,500
go about this either you can go out
 

3325
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,170
go about this either you can go out
wandering around the jungle and try and

01:00:59,170 --> 01:00:59,180
wandering around the jungle and try and
 

3327
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,910
wandering around the jungle and try and
find the elephant the problem is if the

jungles big the chances of running into
 

3333
01:01:03,680 --> 01:01:06,370

01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:06,380
it very small or you could look on the
 

3335
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,230

ground and see if you see footprints

3336
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:08,240
ground and see if you see footprints
 

3337

left by the elephant and if the
 

3339
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,080
left by the elephant and if the
elephant's moving around you've got a

of seeing the elephant's footprints if
 

3345
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,160

there's an elephant maybe don't know
 

3349
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,910
there's an elephant maybe don't know
what kind of elephant it is but I got a

direction so in a sphere effectively
they can flying out and it can record

3438
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:50,300
they can flying out and it can record
 

3439
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,260
they can flying out and it can record
all of those particles and what's the

3440
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:53,270
all of those particles and what's the
 

3441
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,630
all of those particles and what's the
site of interrupting but what's what's

3442
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:55,640
site of interrupting but what's what's
 

3443
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:58,000
site of interrupting but what's what's
the mechanism of the recording oh these

3444
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:58,010
the mechanism of the recording oh these
 

3445
01:02:58,010 --> 01:02:59,410
the mechanism of the recording oh these
detectors if you've seen pictures of

3446
01:02:59,410 --> 01:02:59,420
detectors if you've seen pictures of
 

3447
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:02,860
detectors if you've seen pictures of
them the huge like Atlas is 25 meters

3448
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:02,870
them the huge like Atlas is 25 meters
 

3449
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:07,260
them the huge like Atlas is 25 meters
high in 45 meters long and vast machines

3450
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:07,270
high in 45 meters long and vast machines
 

3451
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:08,920
high in 45 meters long and vast machines
instruments I guess you to call them

3452
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:08,930
instruments I guess you to call them
 

3453
01:03:08,930 --> 01:03:10,960
instruments I guess you to call them
really they are they're kind of like

3454
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:10,970
really they are they're kind of like
 

3455
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:11,380
really they are they're kind of like
onions

3456
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:11,390
onions
 

3457
01:03:11,390 --> 01:03:14,080
onions
so they have layers concentric layers of

3458
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:14,090
so they have layers concentric layers of
 

3459
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:16,000
so they have layers concentric layers of
detective detectors different sorts of

3460
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:16,010
detective detectors different sorts of
 

3461
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:17,980
detective detectors different sorts of
detectors so close into the beam pipe

3462
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:17,990
detectors so close into the beam pipe
 

3463
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:20,080
detectors so close into the beam pipe
you have what a record usually made of

3464
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,090
you have what a record usually made of
 

3465
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:21,850
you have what a record usually made of
silicon their tracking detectors so

3466
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:21,860
silicon their tracking detectors so
 

3467
01:03:21,860 --> 01:03:23,620
silicon their tracking detectors so
they're little made of strips of silicon

3468
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:23,630
they're little made of strips of silicon
 

3469
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,960
they're little made of strips of silicon
or pixels of silicon and when a particle

3470
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:25,970
or pixels of silicon and when a particle
 

3471
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,130
or pixels of silicon and when a particle
goes through the silicon it gives a

3472
01:03:27,130 --> 01:03:27,140
goes through the silicon it gives a
 

3473
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,840
goes through the silicon it gives a
little electrical signal and you get

3474
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:28,850
little electrical signal and you get
 

3475
01:03:28,850 --> 01:03:30,100
little electrical signal and you get
these dots you know electrical dots

3476
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:30,110
these dots you know electrical dots
 

3477
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:31,420
these dots you know electrical dots
through your detector which allows you

3478
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:31,430
through your detector which allows you
 

3479
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:33,010
through your detector which allows you
to reconstruct the trajectory of the

3480
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:33,020
to reconstruct the trajectory of the
 

3481
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:34,930
to reconstruct the trajectory of the
particle so that's the middle and then

3482
01:03:34,930 --> 01:03:34,940
particle so that's the middle and then
 

3483
01:03:34,940 --> 01:03:36,490
particle so that's the middle and then
the outside of these detectors you have

3484
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:36,500
the outside of these detectors you have
 

3485
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,080
the outside of these detectors you have
things called calorimeters which measure

3486
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:38,090
things called calorimeters which measure
 

3487
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:39,850
things called calorimeters which measure
the energies of the particles and in

3488
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:39,860
the energies of the particles and in
 

3489
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:42,100
the energies of the particles and in
very edge you have things called muon

3490
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:42,110
very edge you have things called muon
 

3491
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:44,230
very edge you have things called muon
chambers which basically met these muon

3492
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:44,240
chambers which basically met these muon
 

3493
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:46,240
chambers which basically met these muon
particles which are the heavy version of

3494
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:46,250
particles which are the heavy version of
 

3495
01:03:46,250 --> 01:03:47,380
particles which are the heavy version of
the electron they are there like

3496
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:47,390
the electron they are there like
 

3497
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:48,850
the electron they are there like
high-velocity bullets and they can get

3498
01:03:48,850 --> 01:03:48,860
high-velocity bullets and they can get
 

3499
01:03:48,860 --> 01:03:50,230
high-velocity bullets and they can get
right to the edge of the detectors if

3500
01:03:50,230 --> 01:03:50,240
right to the edge of the detectors if
 

3501
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:52,060
right to the edge of the detectors if
you see something at the edge that's a

3502
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:52,070
you see something at the edge that's a
 

3503
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,890
you see something at the edge that's a
muon so that's broadly how they work and

3504
01:03:53,890 --> 01:03:53,900
muon so that's broadly how they work and
 

3505
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,020
muon so that's broadly how they work and
all there's being recorded that's all

3506
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:56,030
all there's being recorded that's all
 

3507
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:58,660
all there's being recorded that's all
being fed out to you know computers

3508
01:03:58,660 --> 01:03:58,670
being fed out to you know computers
 

3509
01:03:58,670 --> 01:04:01,510
being fed out to you know computers
must be awesome okay so LHCb is

3510
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
must be awesome okay so LHCb is
 

3511
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,040
must be awesome okay so LHCb is
different so we because we're looking

3512
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:03,050
different so we because we're looking
 

3513
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,560
different so we because we're looking
for these B quarks yes B quarks tend to

3514
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:05,570
for these B quarks yes B quarks tend to
 

3515
01:04:05,570 --> 01:04:08,290
for these B quarks yes B quarks tend to
be produced along the beam lines so in a

3516
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:08,300
be produced along the beam lines so in a
 

3517
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:10,870
be produced along the beam lines so in a
collision the B quark tend to fly sort

3518
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:10,880
collision the B quark tend to fly sort
 

3519
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:13,300
collision the B quark tend to fly sort
of close to the beam pipe so we built

3520
01:04:13,300 --> 01:04:13,310
of close to the beam pipe so we built
 

3521
01:04:13,310 --> 01:04:14,500
of close to the beam pipe so we built
the detector that sort of pyramid

3522
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:14,510
the detector that sort of pyramid
 

3523
01:04:14,510 --> 01:04:17,320
the detector that sort of pyramid
cone-shaped basically that just looks in

3524
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:17,330
cone-shaped basically that just looks in
 

3525
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:19,390
cone-shaped basically that just looks in
one directions we ignore if you have

3526
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:19,400
one directions we ignore if you have
 

3527
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,130
one directions we ignore if you have
your collision stuff goes everywhere we

3528
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:21,140
your collision stuff goes everywhere we
 

3529
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:22,840
your collision stuff goes everywhere we
ignore all the stuff over here and going

3530
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:22,850
ignore all the stuff over here and going
 

3531
01:04:22,850 --> 01:04:24,580
ignore all the stuff over here and going
off sideways we're just looking in this

3532
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:24,590
off sideways we're just looking in this
 

3533
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,010
off sideways we're just looking in this
little region close to the beam pipe

3534
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:27,020
little region close to the beam pipe
 

3535
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,900
little region close to the beam pipe
where most of these B quarks are made so

3536
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:28,910
where most of these B quarks are made so
 

3537
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:32,770
where most of these B quarks are made so
is there a different aspect of the

3538
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:32,780
is there a different aspect of the
 

3539
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:35,440
is there a different aspect of the
sensors involved in the collection of

3540
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:35,450
sensors involved in the collection of
 

3541
01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:37,900
sensors involved in the collection of
the B quark yes Jack thérèse there are

3542
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:37,910
the B quark yes Jack thérèse there are
 

3543
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,370
the B quark yes Jack thérèse there are
some differences so one of the

3544
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:39,380
some differences so one of the
 

3545
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:41,530
some differences so one of the
differences is that one of the ways you

3546
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:41,540
differences is that one of the ways you
 

3547
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:43,030
differences is that one of the ways you
know you've seen a B quark is that B

3548
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:43,040
know you've seen a B quark is that B
 

3549
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,980
know you've seen a B quark is that B
quarks are actually quite long-lived by

3550
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:44,990
quarks are actually quite long-lived by
 

3551
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:47,470
quarks are actually quite long-lived by
particle standards so they live for 1.5

3552
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:47,480
particle standards so they live for 1.5
 

3553
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,540
particle standards so they live for 1.5
trillions of a second which is if you're

3554
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:49,550
trillions of a second which is if you're
 

3555
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:50,740
trillions of a second which is if you're
if you're a fundamental particle is a

3556
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:50,750
if you're a fundamental particle is a
 

3557
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:52,930
if you're a fundamental particle is a
very long time because you know the

3558
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:52,940
very long time because you know the
 

3559
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:54,760
very long time because you know the
Higgs boson I think lives for about a

3560
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:54,770
Higgs boson I think lives for about a
 

3561
01:04:54,770 --> 01:04:57,310
Higgs boson I think lives for about a
trillionth of a trillionth of a second

3562
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:57,320
trillionth of a trillionth of a second
 

3563
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:58,870
trillionth of a trillionth of a second
or maybe even less than that so these

3564
01:04:58,870 --> 01:04:58,880
or maybe even less than that so these
 

3565
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,150
or maybe even less than that so these
are quite long-lived things and they

3566
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:01,160
are quite long-lived things and they
 

3567
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,650
are quite long-lived things and they
will actually fly a little distance

3568
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:02,660
will actually fly a little distance
 

3569
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:04,030
will actually fly a little distance
before they decay so they will fly you

3570
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:04,040
before they decay so they will fly you
 

3571
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,710
before they decay so they will fly you
know a few centimeters maybe if you're

3572
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:05,720
know a few centimeters maybe if you're
 

3573
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:06,010
know a few centimeters maybe if you're
lucky

3574
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:06,020
lucky
 

3575
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,140
lucky
then they'll decay into other stuff so

3576
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:08,150
then they'll decay into other stuff so
 

3577
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,910
then they'll decay into other stuff so
what we need to do in the middle of the

3578
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:09,920
what we need to do in the middle of the
 

3579
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,400
what we need to do in the middle of the
detector you want to be able to see you

3580
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:12,410
detector you want to be able to see you
 

3581
01:05:12,410 --> 01:05:13,720
detector you want to be able to see you
have your place where the protons crash

3582
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:13,730
have your place where the protons crash
 

3583
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:15,520
have your place where the protons crash
into each other and that produces loads

3584
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:15,530
into each other and that produces loads
 

3585
01:05:15,530 --> 01:05:17,050
into each other and that produces loads
of particles that come flying out so you

3586
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:17,060
of particles that come flying out so you
 

3587
01:05:17,060 --> 01:05:19,150
of particles that come flying out so you
have loads of lines loads of tracks that

3588
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:19,160
have loads of lines loads of tracks that
 

3589
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:21,460
have loads of lines loads of tracks that
point back to that proton collision and

3590
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:21,470
point back to that proton collision and
 

3591
01:05:21,470 --> 01:05:22,870
point back to that proton collision and
then you're looking for a couple of

3592
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:22,880
then you're looking for a couple of
 

3593
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:24,610
then you're looking for a couple of
other tracks maybe two or three that

3594
01:05:24,610 --> 01:05:24,620
other tracks maybe two or three that
 

3595
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,290
other tracks maybe two or three that
point back to a different place this may

3596
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:26,300
point back to a different place this may
 

3597
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:27,700
point back to a different place this may
be a few centimeters away from the

3598
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:27,710
be a few centimeters away from the
 

3599
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,140
be a few centimeters away from the
proton collision and that's the sign

3600
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:29,150
proton collision and that's the sign
 

3601
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:31,780
proton collision and that's the sign
that little B particle has flown a few

3602
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:31,790
that little B particle has flown a few
 

3603
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:33,430
that little B particle has flown a few
centimeters in decayed somewhere else so

3604
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:33,440
centimeters in decayed somewhere else so
 

3605
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,990
centimeters in decayed somewhere else so
we need to be able to very accurately

3606
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:35,000
we need to be able to very accurately
 

3607
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,020
we need to be able to very accurately
resolve the proton collision from the B

3608
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:38,030
resolve the proton collision from the B
 

3609
01:05:38,030 --> 01:05:40,810
resolve the proton collision from the B
particle decay so we are the middle of

3610
01:05:40,810 --> 01:05:40,820
particle decay so we are the middle of
 

3611
01:05:40,820 --> 01:05:42,550
particle decay so we are the middle of
our detector is very sensitive and it

3612
01:05:42,550 --> 01:05:42,560
our detector is very sensitive and it
 

3613
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,890
our detector is very sensitive and it
gets very close to the collisions so you

3614
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:44,900
gets very close to the collisions so you
 

3615
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,120
gets very close to the collisions so you
have this really beautiful delicate

3616
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:46,130
have this really beautiful delicate
 

3617
01:05:46,130 --> 01:05:48,880
have this really beautiful delicate
silicon detector that sits I think it's

3618
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:48,890
silicon detector that sits I think it's
 

3619
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:51,910
silicon detector that sits I think it's
seven mil millimeters from the beam and

3620
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
seven mil millimeters from the beam and
 

3621
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,070
seven mil millimeters from the beam and
the LHC beam has as much energy as a

01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:54,080
the LHC beam has as much energy as a
 

3623
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:56,110
the LHC beam has as much energy as a
jumbo jet takeoff so it's enough to melt

3624
01:05:56,110 --> 01:05:56,120
jumbo jet takeoff so it's enough to melt
 

3625
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,850

yeah what's the connection there yes
 

3653
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:29,870
yeah what's the connection there yes
there is a connection which is that when

01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:29,880
there is a connection which is that when
 

3655
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,700
there is a connection which is that when
you produce these B particles

3656
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:31,710
you produce these B particles
 

3657
01:06:31,710 --> 01:06:33,290
you produce these B particles
it'll be these particles consider to the

it'll be these particles consider to the
 

3659
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,910
it'll be these particles consider to the
B quark you see the thing that B quark

3660
01:06:34,910 --> 01:06:34,920
B quark you see the thing that B quark
 

3661
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,290
B quark you see the thing that B quark
is inside so they're bound up inside

01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:38,310
what we call beauty particles where the
 

3665
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,160
what we call beauty particles where the

depending on what it is there a

3670
01:06:43,609 --> 01:06:43,619
depending on what it is there a
 

3671
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:46,340
depending on what it is there a
particular set of these B particles that

exhibit this property called oscillation
so if you make her for the sake of

3676
01:06:51,859 --> 01:06:51,869
so if you make her for the sake of
 

3677
01:06:51,869 --> 01:06:54,020
so if you make her for the sake of
argument a matter version of one of

01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:54,030
argument a matter version of one of

01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,810
argument a matter version of one of
these B particles as it travels because

01:06:56,820 --> 01:06:59,050
these B particles as it travels because
of the magic of quantum mechanics it

3682
01:06:59,050 --> 01:06:59,060
of the magic of quantum mechanics it
 

3683
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,070
of the magic of quantum mechanics it
oscillates backwards and forwards

3684
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:01,080
oscillates backwards and forwards
 

3685
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,500
oscillates backwards and forwards
between its matter and antimatter

3686
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:02,510
between its matter and antimatter
 

3687
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:05,180
between its matter and antimatter
versions so just this weird flipping

3688
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:05,190
versions so just this weird flipping
 

3689
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:07,640
versions so just this weird flipping
about backwards and forwards and what we

3690
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:07,650
about backwards and forwards and what we
 

3691
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:09,349
about backwards and forwards and what we
can use this for is a laboratory for

3692
01:07:09,349 --> 01:07:09,359
can use this for is a laboratory for
 

3693
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,630
can use this for is a laboratory for
testing the symmetry between matter and

3694
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:11,640
testing the symmetry between matter and
 

3695
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:14,420
testing the symmetry between matter and
antimatter so if the if the symmetry but

3696
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:14,430
antimatter so if the if the symmetry but
 

3697
01:07:14,430 --> 01:07:17,000
antimatter so if the if the symmetry but
transparency is precise its exact then

3698
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:17,010
transparency is precise its exact then
 

3699
01:07:17,010 --> 01:07:19,370
transparency is precise its exact then
we should see these B particles decaying

3700
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:19,380
we should see these B particles decaying
 

3701
01:07:19,380 --> 01:07:21,380
we should see these B particles decaying
as often as matter as they do as

3702
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:21,390
as often as matter as they do as
 

3703
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:22,790
as often as matter as they do as
antimatter because this oscillation

3704
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:22,800
antimatter because this oscillation
 

3705
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,530
antimatter because this oscillation
should be even it should spend much time

3706
01:07:24,530 --> 01:07:24,540
should be even it should spend much time
 

3707
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:27,080
should be even it should spend much time
in each state but what we actually see

3708
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:27,090
in each state but what we actually see
 

3709
01:07:27,090 --> 01:07:29,750
in each state but what we actually see
is that one of the states it spends more

3710
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:29,760
is that one of the states it spends more
 

3711
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,640
is that one of the states it spends more
time and it's more likely to decay in

3712
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:31,650
time and it's more likely to decay in
 

3713
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:33,770
time and it's more likely to decay in
one state than the other so this gives

3714
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:33,780
one state than the other so this gives
 

3715
01:07:33,780 --> 01:07:35,960
one state than the other so this gives
us a way of testing this fundamental

3716
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:35,970
us a way of testing this fundamental
 

3717
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:38,380
us a way of testing this fundamental
symmetry between matter and antimatter

3718
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:38,390
symmetry between matter and antimatter
 

3719
01:07:38,390 --> 01:07:41,810
symmetry between matter and antimatter
so what can you sort of return the the

3720
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:41,820
so what can you sort of return the the
 

3721
01:07:41,820 --> 01:07:43,460
so what can you sort of return the the
question or before about this

3722
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:43,470
question or before about this
 

3723
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:45,320
question or before about this
fundamental symmetry it seems like if

3724
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:45,330
fundamental symmetry it seems like if
 

3725
01:07:45,330 --> 01:07:49,250
fundamental symmetry it seems like if
this perfect symmetry between matter and

3726
01:07:49,250 --> 01:07:49,260
this perfect symmetry between matter and
 

3727
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:53,570
this perfect symmetry between matter and
antimatter if the equal amount of each

3728
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:53,580
antimatter if the equal amount of each
 

3729
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:55,550
antimatter if the equal amount of each
in our universe it would just destroy

3730
01:07:55,550 --> 01:07:55,560
in our universe it would just destroy
 

3731
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:56,450
in our universe it would just destroy
itself

3732
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:56,460
itself
 

3733
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:58,910
itself
mm-hm and just like you mentioned we

3734
01:07:58,910 --> 01:07:58,920
mm-hm and just like you mentioned we
 

3735
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,800
mm-hm and just like you mentioned we
seem to live in a very unlikely universe

3736
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:00,810
seem to live in a very unlikely universe
 

3737
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,990
seem to live in a very unlikely universe
where it it doesn't destroy itself

3738
01:08:02,990 --> 01:08:03,000
where it it doesn't destroy itself
 

3739
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,300
where it it doesn't destroy itself
yeah so do you have some intuition about

3740
01:08:05,300 --> 01:08:05,310
yeah so do you have some intuition about
 

3741
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:09,830
yeah so do you have some intuition about
about why that is I mean well I I'm not

3742
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:09,840
about why that is I mean well I I'm not
 

3743
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:10,880
about why that is I mean well I I'm not
a theory I don't have any particular

3744
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:10,890
a theory I don't have any particular
 

3745
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:12,560
a theory I don't have any particular
ideas myself I mean I sort of do

3746
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:12,570
ideas myself I mean I sort of do
 

3747
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:13,820
ideas myself I mean I sort of do
measurements to try and test these

3748
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:13,830
measurements to try and test these
 

3749
01:08:13,830 --> 01:08:15,440
measurements to try and test these
things but I mean it's in terms of the

3750
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:15,450
things but I mean it's in terms of the
 

3751
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:17,900
things but I mean it's in terms of the
basic problem is that in the Big Bang if

3752
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:17,910
basic problem is that in the Big Bang if
 

3753
01:08:17,910 --> 01:08:19,280
basic problem is that in the Big Bang if
you use the standard model to figure out

3754
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:19,290
you use the standard model to figure out
 

3755
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:20,300
you use the standard model to figure out
what ought to have happened you should

3756
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:20,310
what ought to have happened you should
 

3757
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:21,590
what ought to have happened you should
have got equal amounts of matter

3758
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:21,600
have got equal amounts of matter
 

3759
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:22,880
have got equal amounts of matter
antimatter made because whenever you

3760
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:22,890
antimatter made because whenever you
 

3761
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:24,559
antimatter made because whenever you
make a particle in our collide

3762
01:08:24,559 --> 01:08:24,569
make a particle in our collide
 

3763
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:25,370
make a particle in our collide
collisions for exam

3764
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:25,380
collisions for exam
 

3765
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,930
collisions for exam
but when we collide stuff together you

3766
01:08:26,930 --> 01:08:26,940
but when we collide stuff together you
 

3767
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,220
but when we collide stuff together you
make a particle you make an antiparticle

3768
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:28,230
make a particle you make an antiparticle
 

3769
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:29,810
make a particle you make an antiparticle
they always come together they always

3770
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:29,820
they always come together they always
 

3771
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:31,940
they always come together they always
annihilate together so there's no way of

3772
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:31,950
annihilate together so there's no way of
 

3773
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:33,650
annihilate together so there's no way of
making more matter than antimatter that

3774
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:33,660
making more matter than antimatter that
 

3775
01:08:33,660 --> 01:08:35,660
making more matter than antimatter that
we've discovered so far so that means in

3776
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:35,670
we've discovered so far so that means in
 

3777
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:36,890
we've discovered so far so that means in
the Big Bang you get equal amounts of

3778
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:36,900
the Big Bang you get equal amounts of
 

3779
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,810
the Big Bang you get equal amounts of
matter antimatter as the universe

3780
01:08:38,810 --> 01:08:38,820

you have this event called the great

3788
01:08:46,010 --> 01:08:46,020
you have this event called the great
 

3789
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:48,349
you have this event called the great
annihilation which is where all the

3790
01:08:48,349 --> 01:08:48,359
annihilation which is where all the
 

3791
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:50,480

01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:53,250
annihilate turn into light mostly and
 

3797
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:55,040
annihilate turn into light mostly and
you end up with a universe later right

3798
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:55,050
you end up with a universe later right
 

3799
01:08:55,050 --> 01:08:56,150
you end up with a universe later right
if that was what happened then the

3800
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:56,160
if that was what happened then the
 

3801
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:57,920
if that was what happened then the
universe we live in today would be black

3802
01:08:57,920 --> 01:08:57,930
universe we live in today would be black
 

3803
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,680
universe we live in today would be black
and empty apart from some photons that

3804
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:00,690
and empty apart from some photons that
 

3805
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:02,510
and empty apart from some photons that
would be it so there's stuff in this

3806
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:02,520
would be it so there's stuff in this
 

3807
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:03,650
would be it so there's stuff in this
there is stuff in the universe it

3808
01:09:03,650 --> 01:09:03,660
there is stuff in the universe it
 

3809
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:04,970
there is stuff in the universe it
appears to be just made of matter so

3810
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:04,980
appears to be just made of matter so
 

3811
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,500
appears to be just made of matter so
there's this big mystery as to where the

3812
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:06,510
there's this big mystery as to where the
 

3813
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:08,570
there's this big mystery as to where the
how did this happen and there are

3814
01:09:08,570 --> 01:09:08,580
how did this happen and there are
 

3815
01:09:08,580 --> 01:09:12,590
how did this happen and there are
various ideas which all involve sort of

3816
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:12,600
various ideas which all involve sort of
 

3817
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:14,960
various ideas which all involve sort of
physics going on in the first trillionth

3818
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:14,970
physics going on in the first trillionth
 

3819
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:17,450
physics going on in the first trillionth
of a second or so of the Big Bang so it

3820
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:17,460
of a second or so of the Big Bang so it
 

3821
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:20,240
of a second or so of the Big Bang so it
could be that one possibility is that

3822
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:20,250
could be that one possibility is that
 

3823
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,280
could be that one possibility is that
the Higgs field is somehow implicated in

3824
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:22,290
the Higgs field is somehow implicated in
 

3825
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,680
the Higgs field is somehow implicated in
this that there was this event that took

3826
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:24,690
this that there was this event that took
 

3827
01:09:24,690 --> 01:09:27,050
this that there was this event that took
place in the early universe where the

3828
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:27,060
place in the early universe where the
 

3829
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,730
place in the early universe where the
higgs field basically switched on it

3830
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:28,740
higgs field basically switched on it
 

3831
01:09:28,740 --> 01:09:32,000
higgs field basically switched on it
acquired its modern value and when that

3832
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,010
acquired its modern value and when that
 

3833
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:34,700
acquired its modern value and when that
happened this caused all the particles

3834
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:34,710
happened this caused all the particles
 

3835
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:36,349
happened this caused all the particles
to acquire mass and the universe

3836
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:36,359
to acquire mass and the universe
 

3837
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:37,160
to acquire mass and the universe
basically went through a phase

3838
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:37,170
basically went through a phase
 

3839
01:09:37,170 --> 01:09:39,560
basically went through a phase
transition where you had a hot plasma of

3840
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:39,570
transition where you had a hot plasma of
 

3841
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:41,599
transition where you had a hot plasma of
massless particles and then in that

3842
01:09:41,599 --> 01:09:41,609
massless particles and then in that
 

3843
01:09:41,609 --> 01:09:43,670
massless particles and then in that
plasma it's almost like a gas turning

3844
01:09:43,670 --> 01:09:43,680
plasma it's almost like a gas turning
 

3845
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,380
plasma it's almost like a gas turning
into droplets of water you get kind of

3846
01:09:45,380 --> 01:09:45,390
into droplets of water you get kind of
 

3847
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:47,060
into droplets of water you get kind of
these little bubbles forming in the

3848
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:47,070
these little bubbles forming in the
 

3849
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:48,980
these little bubbles forming in the
universe where the Higgs field has

3850
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:48,990
universe where the Higgs field has
 

3851
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:51,260
universe where the Higgs field has
acquired its modern value the particles

3852
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:51,270
acquired its modern value the particles
 

3853
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,690
acquired its modern value the particles
have got mass and this phase transition

3854
01:09:53,690 --> 01:09:53,700
have got mass and this phase transition
 

3855
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:56,690
have got mass and this phase transition
in some models can cause more matter

3856
01:09:56,690 --> 01:09:56,700
in some models can cause more matter
 

3857
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:58,310
in some models can cause more matter
than antimatter to be produced depending

3858
01:09:58,310 --> 01:09:58,320
than antimatter to be produced depending
 

3859
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,560
than antimatter to be produced depending
on how matter bounces off these bubbles

3860
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:00,570
on how matter bounces off these bubbles
 

3861
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,330
on how matter bounces off these bubbles
in the early universe so that's one idea

3862
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:02,340
in the early universe so that's one idea
 

3863
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:04,490
in the early universe so that's one idea
there's other ideas to do with neutrinos

3864
01:10:04,490 --> 01:10:04,500
there's other ideas to do with neutrinos
 

3865
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:06,140
there's other ideas to do with neutrinos
that there are exotic types of neutrinos

3866
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:06,150
that there are exotic types of neutrinos
 

3867
01:10:06,150 --> 01:10:08,990
that there are exotic types of neutrinos
that can decay in a biased way to just

3868
01:10:08,990 --> 01:10:09,000
that can decay in a biased way to just
 

3869
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,270
that can decay in a biased way to just
matter and not to antimatter so and

3870
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
matter and not to antimatter so and
 

3871
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,620
matter and not to antimatter so and
people are trying to test these ideas

3872
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:12,630
people are trying to test these ideas
 

3873
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,000
people are trying to test these ideas
that's what we're trying to do at LHC B

3874
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:14,010
that's what we're trying to do at LHC B
 

3875
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:15,620
that's what we're trying to do at LHC B
is there's neutrino experiments planned

3876
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:15,630
is there's neutrino experiments planned
 

3877
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:16,910
is there's neutrino experiments planned
they're trying to do these sorts of

3878
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:16,920
they're trying to do these sorts of
 

3879
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,950
they're trying to do these sorts of
things as well so yeah there are ideas

3880
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:18,960
things as well so yeah there are ideas
 

3881
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,080
things as well so yeah there are ideas
but at the moment no clear evidence for

3882
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:21,090
but at the moment no clear evidence for
 

3883
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:23,090
but at the moment no clear evidence for
which of these ideas might be right so

3884
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:23,100
which of these ideas might be right so
 

3885
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:24,950
which of these ideas might be right so
we're talking about some incredible

3886
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
we're talking about some incredible
 

3887
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,680
we're talking about some incredible
ideas by the way never hurt anyone be so

3888
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:27,690
ideas by the way never hurt anyone be so
 

3889
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,010
ideas by the way never hurt anyone be so
eloquent about describing even just a

01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:31,020
eloquent about describing even just a
 

3891
01:10:31,020 --> 01:10:34,130
eloquent about describing even just a
standard model so I'm in awe just

3892
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:34,140
standard model so I'm in awe just
 

3893
01:10:34,140 --> 01:10:36,200
standard model so I'm in awe just

Large Hadron Collider is the human side
 

3905
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,960
Large Hadron Collider is the human side
of it that a bunch of sort of brilliant

3906
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:50,970
of it that a bunch of sort of brilliant
 

3907
01:10:50,970 --> 01:10:53,630
of it that a bunch of sort of brilliant
people that probably have egos got

3908
01:10:53,630 --> 01:10:53,640
people that probably have egos got
 

3909
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:56,620
people that probably have egos got
together and we collaborate together and

3910
01:10:56,620 --> 01:10:56,630
together and we collaborate together and
 

3911
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,700
together and we collaborate together and
countries I guess collaborate together

3912
01:10:58,700 --> 01:10:58,710
countries I guess collaborate together
 

3913
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:00,260
countries I guess collaborate together
you know for the funds and that

3914
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:00,270
you know for the funds and that
 

3915
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:02,180
you know for the funds and that
everything's just collaboration

3916
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:02,190
everything's just collaboration
 

3917
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:06,110
everything's just collaboration
everywhere because you maybe I don't

3918
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:06,120
everywhere because you maybe I don't
 

3919
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:07,730
everywhere because you maybe I don't
know what the right question here to ask

3920
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:07,740
know what the right question here to ask
 

3921
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:09,710
know what the right question here to ask
but almost what's your intuition about

3922
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:09,720
but almost what's your intuition about
 

3923
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:11,960
but almost what's your intuition about
how was possible to make this happen and

3924
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:11,970
how was possible to make this happen and
 

3925
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,510
how was possible to make this happen and
what are the lessons we should learn for

3926
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:14,520
what are the lessons we should learn for
 

3927
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,130
what are the lessons we should learn for
the future of human civilization in

3928
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:16,140
the future of human civilization in
 

3929
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:17,990
the future of human civilization in
terms of our scientific progress because

3930
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,000
terms of our scientific progress because
 

3931
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,720
terms of our scientific progress because
it seems like this is a great great

3932
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:20,730
it seems like this is a great great
 

3933
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:23,360
it seems like this is a great great
illustration of us working together to

3934
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:23,370
illustration of us working together to
 

3935
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,490
illustration of us working together to
do something big yeah I think it's

3936
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:25,500
do something big yeah I think it's
 

3937
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,550
do something big yeah I think it's
possibly the best example maybe I can

3938
01:11:28,550 --> 01:11:28,560
possibly the best example maybe I can
 

3939
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:29,810
possibly the best example maybe I can
think of of international collaboration

3940
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:29,820
think of of international collaboration
 

3941
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:32,630
think of of international collaboration
it isn't for some unpleasant purpose

3942
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:32,640
it isn't for some unpleasant purpose
 

3943
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,060
it isn't for some unpleasant purpose
basically you know it's I mean so I I

3944
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:35,070
basically you know it's I mean so I I
 

3945
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:38,090
basically you know it's I mean so I I
when I started out in the field in 2008

3946
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:38,100
when I started out in the field in 2008
 

3947
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,160
when I started out in the field in 2008
I as a new PhD student the LHC was

3948
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:40,170
I as a new PhD student the LHC was
 

3949
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,620
I as a new PhD student the LHC was
basically finished so I didn't have to

3950
01:11:42,620 --> 01:11:42,630
basically finished so I didn't have to
 

3951
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,660
basically finished so I didn't have to
go around asking for money for it or

3952
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:44,670
go around asking for money for it or
 

3953
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,130
go around asking for money for it or
trying to make the case so I have huge

3954
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,140
trying to make the case so I have huge
 

3955
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,780
trying to make the case so I have huge
admiration admiration for the people who

3956
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:47,790
admiration admiration for the people who
 

3957
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:49,910
admiration admiration for the people who
managed that because this was a project

3958
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:49,920
managed that because this was a project
 

3959
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,640
managed that because this was a project
that was first imagined in the 1970s and

3960
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:52,650
that was first imagined in the 1970s and
 

3961
01:11:52,650 --> 01:11:53,810
that was first imagined in the 1970s and
the late 70s was when the first

3962
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:53,820
the late 70s was when the first
 

3963
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:55,940
the late 70s was when the first
conversations about the LHC were were

3964
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:55,950
conversations about the LHC were were
 

3965
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:58,610
conversations about the LHC were were
mooted and it took two and a half

3966
01:11:58,610 --> 01:11:58,620
mooted and it took two and a half
 

3967
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:01,310
mooted and it took two and a half
decades of campaigning and fundraising

3968
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:01,320
decades of campaigning and fundraising
 

3969
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,520
decades of campaigning and fundraising
and persuasion until they started

3970
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:04,530
and persuasion until they started
 

3971
01:12:04,530 --> 01:12:05,930
and persuasion until they started
breaking ground and building the thing

3972
01:12:05,930 --> 01:12:05,940
breaking ground and building the thing
 

3973
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,530
breaking ground and building the thing
in the early noughties in 2000 so I mean

3974
01:12:09,530 --> 01:12:09,540
in the early noughties in 2000 so I mean
 

3975
01:12:09,540 --> 01:12:11,210
in the early noughties in 2000 so I mean
I think the reason just from uh sort of

3976
01:12:11,210 --> 01:12:11,220
I think the reason just from uh sort of
 

3977
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:12,410
I think the reason just from uh sort of
from the point of view of this sort of

3978
01:12:12,410 --> 01:12:12,420
from the point of view of this sort of
 

3979
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:14,360
from the point of view of this sort of
science the scientists there I think the

3980
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:14,370
science the scientists there I think the
 

3981
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,060
science the scientists there I think the
reason it works ultimately is that

3982
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:17,070
reason it works ultimately is that
 

3983
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:19,460
reason it works ultimately is that
everywhere everyone there is there for

3984
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:19,470
everywhere everyone there is there for
 

3985
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:22,370
everywhere everyone there is there for
the same reason which is well in

3986
01:12:22,370 --> 01:12:22,380
the same reason which is well in
 

3987
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,080
the same reason which is well in
principle at least they're there because

3988
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:24,090
principle at least they're there because
 

3989
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:25,610
principle at least they're there because
they're interested in the world they

3990
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:25,620
they're interested in the world they
 

3991
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:27,800
they're interested in the world they
want to find out you know what are the

3992
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:27,810
want to find out you know what are the
 

3993
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:29,510
want to find out you know what are the
basic ingredients of our universe what

3994
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:29,520
basic ingredients of our universe what
 

3995
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,640
basic ingredients of our universe what
are the laws of nature and so everyone

3996
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:31,650
are the laws of nature and so everyone
 

3997
01:12:31,650 --> 01:12:33,050
are the laws of nature and so everyone
is pulling in the same direction of

3998
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:33,060
is pulling in the same direction of
 

3999
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,000
is pulling in the same direction of
course everyone has their own things

4000
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,010
course everyone has their own things
 

4001
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:36,200
course everyone has their own things
they're interested in everyone has their

4002
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:36,210
they're interested in everyone has their
 

4003
01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:38,090
they're interested in everyone has their
own careers to consider and you know and

4004
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:38,100
own careers to consider and you know and
 

4005
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,890
own careers to consider and you know and
pretend that there isn't also a lot of

4006
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:39,900
pretend that there isn't also a lot of
 

4007
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:41,780
pretend that there isn't also a lot of
competitions this is funny thing in

4008
01:12:41,780 --> 01:12:41,790
competitions this is funny thing in
 

4009
01:12:41,790 --> 01:12:43,190
competitions this is funny thing in
these experiments where your

4010
01:12:43,190 --> 01:12:43,200
these experiments where your
 

4011
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,630
these experiments where your
collaborators your eight-hundred

4012
01:12:44,630 --> 01:12:44,640
collaborators your eight-hundred
 

4013
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,490
collaborators your eight-hundred
collaborators in LHC be but you're also

4014
01:12:46,490 --> 01:12:46,500
collaborators in LHC be but you're also
 

4015
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,710
collaborators in LHC be but you're also
competitors because you're academics in

4016
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:48,720
competitors because you're academics in
 

4017
01:12:48,720 --> 01:12:50,240
competitors because you're academics in
your various universities and you want

4018
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:50,250
your various universities and you want
 

4019
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:51,620
your various universities and you want
to be the one that gets the paper out on

4020
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:51,630
to be the one that gets the paper out on
 

4021
01:12:51,630 --> 01:12:52,140
to be the one that gets the paper out on
the most

4022
01:12:52,140 --> 01:12:52,150
the most
 

4023
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:53,580
the most
citing you know new measurements so

4024
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:53,590
citing you know new measurements so
 

4025
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:54,780
citing you know new measurements so
there's this funny thing where you're

4026
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:54,790
there's this funny thing where you're
 

4027
01:12:54,790 --> 01:12:56,340
there's this funny thing where you're
kind of trying to stake out your

4028
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:56,350
kind of trying to stake out your
 

4029
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,590
kind of trying to stake out your
territory while also collaborating and

4030
01:12:58,590 --> 01:12:58,600
territory while also collaborating and
 

4031
01:12:58,600 --> 01:12:59,790
territory while also collaborating and
having to work together to make the

4032
01:12:59,790 --> 01:12:59,800
having to work together to make the
 

4033
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,530
having to work together to make the
experiments work and it does work

4034
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:01,540
experiments work and it does work
 

4035
01:13:01,540 --> 01:13:04,800
experiments work and it does work
amazingly well actually considering all

4036
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:04,810
amazingly well actually considering all
 

4037
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:06,510
amazingly well actually considering all
of that and I think there was actually I

4038
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:06,520
of that and I think there was actually I
 

4039
01:13:06,520 --> 01:13:08,130
of that and I think there was actually I
think McKinsey or one of these big

4040
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:08,140
think McKinsey or one of these big
 

4041
01:13:08,140 --> 01:13:09,899
think McKinsey or one of these big
management consultancy firms went into

4042
01:13:09,899 --> 01:13:09,909
management consultancy firms went into
 

4043
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:12,240
management consultancy firms went into
CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to

4044
01:13:12,240 --> 01:13:12,250
CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to
 

4045
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:14,160
CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to
understand how these organizations

4046
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:14,170
understand how these organizations
 

4047
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:16,350
understand how these organizations
functions they figure it out I don't

4048
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:16,360
functions they figure it out I don't
 

4049
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:18,060
functions they figure it out I don't
think they could I mean I think one of

4050
01:13:18,060 --> 01:13:18,070
think they could I mean I think one of
 

4051
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:19,050
think they could I mean I think one of
the things that interests one of the

4052
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:19,060
the things that interests one of the
 

4053
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,100
the things that interests one of the
other interesting things about these

4054
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:20,110
other interesting things about these
 

4055
01:13:20,110 --> 01:13:22,470
other interesting things about these
experiments is that their big operations

4056
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:22,480
experiments is that their big operations
 

4057
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,169
experiments is that their big operations
like say outlets there's 3,000 people

4058
01:13:24,169 --> 01:13:24,179
like say outlets there's 3,000 people
 

4059
01:13:24,179 --> 01:13:26,610
like say outlets there's 3,000 people
now there is a person nominally who is

4060
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:26,620
now there is a person nominally who is
 

4061
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:27,750
now there is a person nominally who is

4106
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:23,949
do you think there's I would pick up one
 

4107
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:25,110
do you think there's I would pick up one
thing you said just that just the

4108
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:25,120
thing you said just that just the
 

4109
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:26,370
thing you said just that just the
brilliant people thing cuz I'm not I'm

01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:26,380
brilliant people thing cuz I'm not I'm
 

4111
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,020

not saying that people aren't great yeah

4112
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:28,030
not saying that people aren't great yeah
 

4113
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:30,000
not saying that people aren't great yeah
but I think there is this sort of

4114
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:30,010
but I think there is this sort of
 

4115
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:31,709
but I think there is this sort of
impression that physicists will have to

4116

impression that physicists will have to
 

4117

impression that physicists will have to
be brilliant or geniuses which is not

be brilliant or geniuses which is not
 

4119
01:14:33,370 --> 01:14:35,399
be brilliant or geniuses which is not
true actually and you know you have to

true actually and you know you have to
 

4121
01:14:35,409 --> 01:14:38,280
true actually and you know you have to
be relatively bright for sure but you

4122
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:38,290
be relatively bright for sure but you
 

4123
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:39,990
be relatively bright for sure but you
know a lot of people a lot of the most

not necessarily the people with the

physics is the ability to work with
others and to collaborate and exchange

01:16:30,610 --> 01:16:32,070
in temperament between say a physicist
and engineer whether it's just what you

4218
01:16:32,070 --> 01:16:32,080
and engineer whether it's just what you
 

4219
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,470
and engineer whether it's just what you
got interested in I don't know I mean

4220
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:34,480
got interested in I don't know I mean
 

4221
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:35,690
got interested in I don't know I mean
because you know a lot of what

4222
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:35,700
because you know a lot of what
 

4223
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:38,850
because you know a lot of what
experimental physicists do is to some

4224
01:16:38,850 --> 01:16:38,860
experimental physicists do is to some
 

4225
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,590
experimental physicists do is to some
extent engineering and it's not what I

4226
01:16:40,590 --> 01:16:40,600
extent engineering and it's not what I
 

4227
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,840
extent engineering and it's not what I
do I mostly do data stuff but you know a

4228
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:42,850
do I mostly do data stuff but you know a
 

4229
01:16:42,850 --> 01:16:45,000
do I mostly do data stuff but you know a
lot of people would be called electrical

4230
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:45,010
lot of people would be called electrical
 

4231
01:16:45,010 --> 01:16:46,920
lot of people would be called electrical
engineers but they trained as physicists

4232
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:46,930
engineers but they trained as physicists
 

4233
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:48,150
engineers but they trained as physicists
but they learn electrical engineering

4234
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:48,160
but they learn electrical engineering
 

4235
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:49,770
but they learn electrical engineering
for example because they were building

4236
01:16:49,770 --> 01:16:49,780
for example because they were building
 

4237
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,900
for example because they were building
detectors so there's not such a clear

4238
01:16:51,900 --> 01:16:51,910
detectors so there's not such a clear
 

4239
01:16:51,910 --> 01:16:53,760
detectors so there's not such a clear
divide I think yeah it's interesting I

4240
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:53,770
divide I think yeah it's interesting I
 

4241
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,500
divide I think yeah it's interesting I
mean there but there does seem to be

4242
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:55,510
mean there but there does seem to be
 

4243
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:57,870
mean there but there does seem to be
like you work with data there does seem

4244
01:16:57,870 --> 01:16:57,880
like you work with data there does seem
 

4245
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,810
like you work with data there does seem
to be a certain like I love data

4246
01:17:00,810 --> 01:17:00,820
to be a certain like I love data
 

4247
01:17:00,820 --> 01:17:01,710
to be a certain like I love data
collection

4248
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:01,720
collection
 

4249
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:03,300
collection
there might be an OCD element or

4250
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:03,310
there might be an OCD element or
 

4251
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:05,310
there might be an OCD element or
something that you're more naturally

4252
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:05,320
something that you're more naturally
 

4253
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,770
something that you're more naturally
predisposed to as opposed to theory like

4254
01:17:07,770 --> 01:17:07,780
predisposed to as opposed to theory like
 

4255
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:10,140
predisposed to as opposed to theory like
I'm not afraid of data I love data and

4256
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:10,150
I'm not afraid of data I love data and
 

4257
01:17:10,150 --> 01:17:11,670
I'm not afraid of data I love data and
there's a lot of people machine learning

4258
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:11,680
there's a lot of people machine learning
 

4259
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,210
there's a lot of people machine learning
core more like they're they're basically

01:17:15,210 --> 01:17:15,220
core more like they're they're basically
 

4261
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:17,340

afraid of data collection afraid of

4262
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:17,350
afraid of data collection afraid of
 

4263
01:17:17,350 --> 01:17:19,080
afraid of data collection afraid of
datasets afraid of all that they just

4264
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:19,090
datasets afraid of all that they just
 

4265
01:17:19,090 --> 01:17:19,640
datasets afraid of all that they just
want to

4266
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:19,650
want to
 

4267
01:17:19,650 --> 01:17:20,930
want to
stay more than theoretical and they're

4268
01:17:20,930 --> 01:17:20,940
stay more than theoretical and they're
 

4269
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:23,270
stay more than theoretical and they're
really good at it space I don't know if

4270
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:23,280
really good at it space I don't know if
 

4271
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:24,590
really good at it space I don't know if
that's a genetic that's your upbringing

4272
01:17:24,590 --> 01:17:24,600
that's a genetic that's your upbringing
 

4273
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:27,979
that's a genetic that's your upbringing
the way you with it the way you go to

4274
01:17:27,979 --> 01:17:27,989
the way you with it the way you go to
 

4275
01:17:27,989 --> 01:17:29,600
the way you with it the way you go to
school but looking into the future of

4276
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:29,610
school but looking into the future of
 

4277
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:34,070
school but looking into the future of
LHC and other colliders so there's in

4278
01:17:34,070 --> 01:17:34,080
LHC and other colliders so there's in
 

4279
01:17:34,080 --> 01:17:36,380
LHC and other colliders so there's in
the in America there's the whatever was

4280
01:17:36,380 --> 01:17:36,390
the in America there's the whatever was
 

4281
01:17:36,390 --> 01:17:38,330
the in America there's the whatever was
called the super there's a lot of super

4282
01:17:38,330 --> 01:17:38,340
called the super there's a lot of super
 

4283
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:40,340
called the super there's a lot of super
superconducting supercollider is super

4284
01:17:40,340 --> 01:17:40,350
superconducting supercollider is super
 

4285
01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:43,160
superconducting supercollider is super
gonna desert roll desert Ron yeah so

4286
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:43,170
gonna desert roll desert Ron yeah so
 

4287
01:17:43,170 --> 01:17:45,439
gonna desert roll desert Ron yeah so
that was cancelled the construction of

4288
01:17:45,439 --> 01:17:45,449
that was cancelled the construction of
 

4289
01:17:45,449 --> 01:17:51,740
that was cancelled the construction of
that yeah which is a sad thing but what

4290
01:17:51,740 --> 01:17:51,750
that yeah which is a sad thing but what
 

4291
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,570
that yeah which is a sad thing but what
do you think is the future of these

4292
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:53,580
do you think is the future of these
 

4293
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,720
do you think is the future of these
efforts will a bigger Collider be built

4294
01:17:55,720 --> 01:17:55,730
efforts will a bigger Collider be built
 

4295
01:17:55,730 --> 01:17:59,360
efforts will a bigger Collider be built
will LHC be expanded what do you think

4296
01:17:59,360 --> 01:17:59,370
will LHC be expanded what do you think
 

4297
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:02,689
will LHC be expanded what do you think
well in the near future the LHC is gonna

4298
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:02,699
well in the near future the LHC is gonna
 

4299
01:18:02,699 --> 01:18:04,070
well in the near future the LHC is gonna
get an upgrade so that's pretty much

4300
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:04,080
get an upgrade so that's pretty much
 

4301
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:06,470
get an upgrade so that's pretty much
confirmed I think it is confirmed which

4302
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:06,480
confirmed I think it is confirmed which
 

4303
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,300
confirmed I think it is confirmed which
is the it's not an energy upgrade it's

4304
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:08,310
is the it's not an energy upgrade it's
 

4305
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,100
is the it's not an energy upgrade it's
and what we call the luminosity upgrade

4306
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:10,110
and what we call the luminosity upgrade
 

4307
01:18:10,110 --> 01:18:12,110
and what we call the luminosity upgrade
so basically means increasing their data

4308
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:12,120
so basically means increasing their data
 

4309
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:14,360
so basically means increasing their data
collection rates so more collisions per

4310
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:14,370
collection rates so more collisions per
 

4311
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:17,390
collection rates so more collisions per
second basically because after a few

4312
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:17,400
second basically because after a few
 

4313
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,590
second basically because after a few
years of data taking you get this law of

4314
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:18,600
years of data taking you get this law of
 

4315
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,090
years of data taking you get this law of
diminishing returns where each year's

4316
01:18:20,090 --> 01:18:20,100
diminishing returns where each year's
 

4317
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:21,500
diminishing returns where each year's
worth of data is a smaller and smaller

4318
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:21,510
worth of data is a smaller and smaller
 

4319
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:23,209
worth of data is a smaller and smaller
fraction of the lot you've already got

4320
01:18:23,209 --> 01:18:23,219
fraction of the lot you've already got
 

4321
01:18:23,219 --> 01:18:24,800
fraction of the lot you've already got
so to get a real improvement in

4322
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:24,810
so to get a real improvement in
 

4323
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,660
so to get a real improvement in
sensitivity you need to increase the

4324
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:26,670
sensitivity you need to increase the
 

4325
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:28,430
sensitivity you need to increase the
data rate by an order of magnitude so

4326
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:28,440
data rate by an order of magnitude so
 

4327
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:30,020
data rate by an order of magnitude so
that's what this upgrade is gonna do an

4328
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:30,030
that's what this upgrade is gonna do an
 

4329
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:32,630
that's what this upgrade is gonna do an
LHC be at the moment the whole detector

4330
01:18:32,630 --> 01:18:32,640
LHC be at the moment the whole detector
 

4331
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,330
LHC be at the moment the whole detector
is basically being rebuilt to allow it

4332
01:18:35,330 --> 01:18:35,340
is basically being rebuilt to allow it
 

4333
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:37,310
is basically being rebuilt to allow it
to record data at a much larger rate

4334
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:37,320
to record data at a much larger rate
 

4335
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,540
to record data at a much larger rate
than we could before so that will make

4336
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:38,550
than we could before so that will make
 

4337
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:39,950
than we could before so that will make
her sensitive to whole loads of new

4338
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:39,960
her sensitive to whole loads of new
 

4339
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:41,720
her sensitive to whole loads of new
processes that we weren't able to study

4340
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:41,730
processes that we weren't able to study
 

4341
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:43,520
processes that we weren't able to study
before and you know I mentioned briefly

4342
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:43,530
before and you know I mentioned briefly
 

4343
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:45,260
before and you know I mentioned briefly
these anomalies anomalies that we've

4344
01:18:45,260 --> 01:18:45,270
these anomalies anomalies that we've
 

4345
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:47,090
these anomalies anomalies that we've
seen so we've seen a bunch of very

4346
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:47,100
seen so we've seen a bunch of very
 

4347
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:50,479
seen so we've seen a bunch of very
intriguing anomalies in these B quark

4348
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:50,489
intriguing anomalies in these B quark
 

4349
01:18:50,489 --> 01:18:54,979
intriguing anomalies in these B quark
decays which may be hinting at the first

4350
01:18:54,979 --> 01:18:54,989
decays which may be hinting at the first
 

4351
01:18:54,989 --> 01:18:56,720
decays which may be hinting at the first
signs of this kind of the elephant you

4352
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:56,730
signs of this kind of the elephant you
 

4353
01:18:56,730 --> 01:18:58,760
signs of this kind of the elephant you
know that the the size of some new

4354
01:18:58,760 --> 01:18:58,770
know that the the size of some new
 

4355
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,560
know that the the size of some new
quantum field or fields may be beyond

4356
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:00,570
quantum field or fields may be beyond
 

4357
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:01,939
quantum field or fields may be beyond
the standard model it's not yet at the

4358
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:01,949
the standard model it's not yet at the
 

4359
01:19:01,949 --> 01:19:03,560
the standard model it's not yet at the
statistical threshold where you can say

4360
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:03,570
statistical threshold where you can say
 

4361
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:06,380
statistical threshold where you can say
that you've observed something but

4362
01:19:06,380 --> 01:19:06,390
that you've observed something but
 

4363
01:19:06,390 --> 01:19:08,149
that you've observed something but
there's lots of anomalies in many

4364
01:19:08,149 --> 01:19:08,159
there's lots of anomalies in many
 

4365
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:09,530
there's lots of anomalies in many
measurements that all seem to be

4366
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:09,540
measurements that all seem to be
 

4367
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,419
measurements that all seem to be
consistent with each other so it's quite

4368
01:19:11,419 --> 01:19:11,429
consistent with each other so it's quite
 

4369
01:19:11,429 --> 01:19:13,040
consistent with each other so it's quite
interesting so you know the upgrade will

4370
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:13,050
interesting so you know the upgrade will
 

4371
01:19:13,050 --> 01:19:15,439
interesting so you know the upgrade will
allow us to really homed in on these

4372
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:15,449
allow us to really homed in on these
 

4373
01:19:15,449 --> 01:19:16,939
allow us to really homed in on these
things and see whether these alumni's

4374
01:19:16,939 --> 01:19:16,949
things and see whether these alumni's
 

4375
01:19:16,949 --> 01:19:19,880
things and see whether these alumni's
are real because if they are real and it

4376
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:19,890
are real because if they are real and it
 

4377
01:19:19,890 --> 01:19:21,410
are real because if they are real and it
kind of connects to your point about the

4378
01:19:21,410 --> 01:19:21,420
kind of connects to your point about the
 

4379
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,990
kind of connects to your point about the
next generation of machines what we

4380
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:24,000
next generation of machines what we
 

4381
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,570
next generation of machines what we
would have seen then is you know we will

4382
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:26,580
would have seen then is you know we will
 

4383
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:28,790
would have seen then is you know we will
have seen the tail end of some quantum

4384
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:28,800
have seen the tail end of some quantum
 

4385
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,490
have seen the tail end of some quantum
field in influencing these big quarks

4386
01:19:31,490 --> 01:19:31,500
field in influencing these big quarks
 

4387
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,189
field in influencing these big quarks
what we then need to do

4388
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
what we then need to do
 

4389
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:35,169
what we then need to do
build a bigger Collider to actually make

4390
01:19:35,169 --> 01:19:35,179
build a bigger Collider to actually make
 

4391
01:19:35,179 --> 01:19:38,049
build a bigger Collider to actually make
the the particle of that field so if

4392
01:19:38,049 --> 01:19:38,059
the the particle of that field so if
 

4393
01:19:38,059 --> 01:19:39,549
the the particle of that field so if
these are if these things really do

4394
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:39,559
these are if these things really do
 

4395
01:19:39,559 --> 01:19:40,120
these are if these things really do
exist

4396
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:40,130
exist
 

4397
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:41,589
exist
so that would be one argument I mean I

4398
01:19:41,589 --> 01:19:41,599
so that would be one argument I mean I
 

4399
01:19:41,599 --> 01:19:43,089
so that would be one argument I mean I
mean so at the moment Europe has going

4400
01:19:43,089 --> 01:19:43,099
mean so at the moment Europe has going
 

4401
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:46,239
mean so at the moment Europe has going
through this process of thinking about

4402
01:19:46,239 --> 01:19:46,249
through this process of thinking about
 

4403
01:19:46,249 --> 01:19:48,069
through this process of thinking about
the strategy for the future so there are

4404
01:19:48,069 --> 01:19:48,079
the strategy for the future so there are
 

4405
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:49,239
the strategy for the future so there are
a number of different proposals on the

4406
01:19:49,239 --> 01:19:49,249
a number of different proposals on the
 

4407
01:19:49,249 --> 01:19:52,479
a number of different proposals on the
table one is for sort of higher energy

4408
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:52,489
table one is for sort of higher energy
 

4409
01:19:52,489 --> 01:19:54,279
table one is for sort of higher energy
upgrade at the LHC where you just build

4410
01:19:54,279 --> 01:19:54,289
upgrade at the LHC where you just build
 

4411
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:55,629
upgrade at the LHC where you just build
more powerful magnets and put them in

4412
01:19:55,629 --> 01:19:55,639
more powerful magnets and put them in
 

4413
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:56,890
more powerful magnets and put them in
the same tunnel that's a sort of cheap

4414
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:56,900
the same tunnel that's a sort of cheap
 

4415
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:59,859
the same tunnel that's a sort of cheap
cheaper less ambitious possibility most

4416
01:19:59,859 --> 01:19:59,869
cheaper less ambitious possibility most
 

4417
01:19:59,869 --> 01:20:01,209
cheaper less ambitious possibility most
people don't really like it because it's

4418
01:20:01,209 --> 01:20:01,219
people don't really like it because it's
 

4419
01:20:01,219 --> 01:20:02,949
people don't really like it because it's
sort of a bit of a dead end because once

4420
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:02,959
sort of a bit of a dead end because once
 

4421
01:20:02,959 --> 01:20:04,029
sort of a bit of a dead end because once
you've done that there's nowhere to go

4422
01:20:04,029 --> 01:20:04,039
you've done that there's nowhere to go
 

4423
01:20:04,039 --> 01:20:06,729
you've done that there's nowhere to go
well there's a machine called clique

4424
01:20:06,729 --> 01:20:06,739
well there's a machine called clique
 

4425
01:20:06,739 --> 01:20:09,100
well there's a machine called clique
which is a compact linear collider which

4426
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:09,110
which is a compact linear collider which
 

4427
01:20:09,110 --> 01:20:10,930
which is a compact linear collider which
is a electron positron Collider that's

4428
01:20:10,930 --> 01:20:10,940
is a electron positron Collider that's
 

4429
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:12,640
is a electron positron Collider that's
uses a novel type of acceleration

4430
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:12,650
uses a novel type of acceleration
 

4431
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:14,560
uses a novel type of acceleration
technology to accelerate at shorter

4432
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:14,570
technology to accelerate at shorter
 

4433
01:20:14,570 --> 01:20:16,600
technology to accelerate at shorter
distances we're still talking kilometers

4434
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:16,610
distances we're still talking kilometers
 

4435
01:20:16,610 --> 01:20:18,899
distances we're still talking kilometers
long but not like 100 kilometers long

4436
01:20:18,899 --> 01:20:18,909
long but not like 100 kilometers long
 

4437
01:20:18,909 --> 01:20:21,939
long but not like 100 kilometers long
and then the probably the project that

4438
01:20:21,939 --> 01:20:21,949
and then the probably the project that
 

4439
01:20:21,949 --> 01:20:23,859
and then the probably the project that
is I think getting the most support

4440
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:23,869
is I think getting the most support
 

4441
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:24,759
is I think getting the most support
it'll be interested to see what happens

4442
01:20:24,759 --> 01:20:24,769
it'll be interested to see what happens
 

4443
01:20:24,769 --> 01:20:26,770
it'll be interested to see what happens
something called the future circular

4444
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:26,780
something called the future circular
 

4445
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,839
something called the future circular
Collider which is a really ambitious

4446
01:20:28,839 --> 01:20:28,849
Collider which is a really ambitious
 

4447
01:20:28,849 --> 01:20:32,350
Collider which is a really ambitious
long-term multi-decade project to build

4448
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:32,360
long-term multi-decade project to build
 

4449
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,410
long-term multi-decade project to build
a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel

4450
01:20:35,410 --> 01:20:35,420
a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel
 

4451
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:38,890
a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel
under the Geneva region the LHC would

4452
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:38,900
under the Geneva region the LHC would
 

4453
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,810
under the Geneva region the LHC would
become a kind of feeding machine it

4454
01:20:40,810 --> 01:20:40,820
become a kind of feeding machine it
 

4455
01:20:40,820 --> 01:20:42,609
become a kind of feeding machine it
would just feed for the same area so

4456
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:42,619
would just feed for the same area so
 

4457
01:20:42,619 --> 01:20:44,290
would just feed for the same area so
there would be a theater for there yeah

4458
01:20:44,290 --> 01:20:44,300
there would be a theater for there yeah
 

4459
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,629
there would be a theater for there yeah
so it kind of the edge machine would be

4460
01:20:46,629 --> 01:20:46,639
so it kind of the edge machine would be
 

4461
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:48,310
so it kind of the edge machine would be
where the LHC is but it would sort of go

4462
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:48,320
where the LHC is but it would sort of go
 

4463
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,049
where the LHC is but it would sort of go
under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps

4464
01:20:50,049 --> 01:20:50,059
under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps
 

4465
01:20:50,059 --> 01:20:52,029
under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps
basically since you know up to the edge

4466
01:20:52,029 --> 01:20:52,039
basically since you know up to the edge
 

4467
01:20:52,039 --> 01:20:53,350
basically since you know up to the edge
of the Geneva base and so basically

4468
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:53,360
of the Geneva base and so basically
 

4469
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:54,879
of the Geneva base and so basically
biggest it's the biggest tunnel you can

4470
01:20:54,879 --> 01:20:54,889
biggest it's the biggest tunnel you can
 

4471
01:20:54,889 --> 01:20:56,979
biggest it's the biggest tunnel you can
fit in the region based on the geology

4472
01:20:56,979 --> 01:20:56,989
fit in the region based on the geology
 

4473
01:20:56,989 --> 01:20:59,500
fit in the region based on the geology
alarm yes it's big it'd be a long drive

4474
01:20:59,500 --> 01:20:59,510
alarm yes it's big it'd be a long drive
 

4475
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:01,810
alarm yes it's big it'd be a long drive
if your animal experiments on one side

4476
01:21:01,810 --> 01:21:01,820
if your animal experiments on one side
 

4477
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,160
if your animal experiments on one side
you got to go back to CERN for lunch so

4478
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:03,170
you got to go back to CERN for lunch so
 

4479
01:21:03,170 --> 01:21:05,890
you got to go back to CERN for lunch so
that would be a pain but you know so

4480
01:21:05,890 --> 01:21:05,900
that would be a pain but you know so
 

4481
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,290
that would be a pain but you know so
this project is in principle is actually

4482
01:21:08,290 --> 01:21:08,300
this project is in principle is actually
 

4483
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:09,640
this project is in principle is actually
to accelerators the first thing you

4484
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:09,650
to accelerators the first thing you
 

4485
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:10,839
to accelerators the first thing you
would do is put an electron-positron

4486
01:21:10,839 --> 01:21:10,849
would do is put an electron-positron
 

4487
01:21:10,849 --> 01:21:13,600
would do is put an electron-positron
machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to

4488
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:13,610
machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to
 

4489
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:15,009
machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to
study the Higgs so you'd make lots of

4490
01:21:15,009 --> 01:21:15,019
study the Higgs so you'd make lots of
 

4491
01:21:15,019 --> 01:21:16,839
study the Higgs so you'd make lots of
Higgs boson study it really precisely in

4492
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:16,849
Higgs boson study it really precisely in
 

4493
01:21:16,849 --> 01:21:18,729
Higgs boson study it really precisely in
the hope that you see it misbehaving and

4494
01:21:18,729 --> 01:21:18,739
the hope that you see it misbehaving and
 

4495
01:21:18,739 --> 01:21:20,890
the hope that you see it misbehaving and
doing something it's not supposed to and

4496
01:21:20,890 --> 01:21:20,900
doing something it's not supposed to and
 

4497
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,259
doing something it's not supposed to and
then in the much longer term a hundred

4498
01:21:23,259 --> 01:21:23,269
then in the much longer term a hundred
 

4499
01:21:23,269 --> 01:21:25,060
then in the much longer term a hundred
with that machine gets taken out you put

4500
01:21:25,060 --> 01:21:25,070
with that machine gets taken out you put
 

4501
01:21:25,070 --> 01:21:26,919
with that machine gets taken out you put
in a proton proton machine so it's like

4502
01:21:26,919 --> 01:21:26,929
in a proton proton machine so it's like
 

4503
01:21:26,929 --> 01:21:29,560
in a proton proton machine so it's like
the LHC but much bigger and that's the

4504
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:29,570
the LHC but much bigger and that's the
 

4505
01:21:29,570 --> 01:21:31,899
the LHC but much bigger and that's the
way you start going and looking for dark

4506
01:21:31,899 --> 01:21:31,909
way you start going and looking for dark
 

4507
01:21:31,909 --> 01:21:33,850
way you start going and looking for dark
matter or you're trying to recreate this

4508
01:21:33,850 --> 01:21:33,860
matter or you're trying to recreate this
 

4509
01:21:33,860 --> 01:21:36,310
matter or you're trying to recreate this
a phase transition that I talked about

4510
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:36,320
a phase transition that I talked about
 

4511
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,689
a phase transition that I talked about
in the early universe but you can see

4512
01:21:37,689 --> 01:21:37,699
in the early universe but you can see
 

4513
01:21:37,699 --> 01:21:39,399
in the early universe but you can see
matter antimatter being made for

4514
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:39,409
matter antimatter being made for
 

4515
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:40,390
matter antimatter being made for
examples there's lots of things you can

4516
01:21:40,390 --> 01:21:40,400
examples there's lots of things you can
 

4517
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,560
examples there's lots of things you can
do with these machines the problem is

4518
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:41,570
do with these machines the problem is
 

4519
01:21:41,570 --> 01:21:44,770
do with these machines the problem is
that they will take you know the most

4520
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:44,780
that they will take you know the most
 

4521
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,239
that they will take you know the most
optimistic you're not going to have any

4522
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:46,249
optimistic you're not going to have any
 

4523
01:21:46,249 --> 01:21:47,170
optimistic you're not going to have any
data from any of

4524
01:21:47,170 --> 01:21:47,180
data from any of
 

4525
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:49,870
data from any of
machines until 2040 or you know because

4526
01:21:49,870 --> 01:21:49,880
machines until 2040 or you know because
 

4527
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:51,940
machines until 2040 or you know because
they take such a long time to build and

4528
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:51,950
they take such a long time to build and
 

4529
01:21:51,950 --> 01:21:53,740
they take such a long time to build and
they're so expensive so you have W a

4530
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:53,750
they're so expensive so you have W a
 

4531
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,440
they're so expensive so you have W a
process of R&D design and also the

4532
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:56,450
process of R&D design and also the
 

4533
01:21:56,450 --> 01:21:58,780
process of R&D design and also the
political case being made so la seal

4534
01:21:58,780 --> 01:21:58,790
political case being made so la seal
 

4535
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:01,930
political case being made so la seal
cost a few billion depends how you count

4536
01:22:01,930 --> 01:22:01,940
cost a few billion depends how you count
 

4537
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:04,510
cost a few billion depends how you count
it I think most of the sort of more

4538
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:04,520
it I think most of the sort of more
 

4539
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:05,710
it I think most of the sort of more
reasonable estimates that take

4540
01:22:05,710 --> 01:22:05,720
reasonable estimates that take
 

4541
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:07,120
reasonable estimates that take
everything into account properly it's

4542
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:07,130
everything into account properly it's
 

4543
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,370
everything into account properly it's
around the sort of 10 11 12 billion euro

4544
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:09,380
around the sort of 10 11 12 billion euro
 

4545
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,370
around the sort of 10 11 12 billion euro
mark what would be the future sir I

4546
01:22:12,370 --> 01:22:12,380
mark what would be the future sir I
 

4547
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:13,900
mark what would be the future sir I
forgot the numerator future circular

4548
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:13,910
forgot the numerator future circular
 

4549
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:15,670
forgot the numerator future circular
Collider future circular because you

4550
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:15,680
Collider future circular because you
 

4551
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,660
Collider future circular because you
mean I would call it that when it's

4552
01:22:16,660 --> 01:22:16,670
mean I would call it that when it's
 

4553
01:22:16,670 --> 01:22:17,800
mean I would call it that when it's
built because it won't be the future

4554
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:17,810
built because it won't be the future
 

4555
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:24,760
built because it won't be the future
anymore but a very big Hadron Collider I

4556
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:24,770
anymore but a very big Hadron Collider I
 

4557
01:22:24,770 --> 01:22:28,030
anymore but a very big Hadron Collider I
don't know but yeah that will I know I

4558
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:28,040
don't know but yeah that will I know I
 

4559
01:22:28,040 --> 01:22:29,380
don't know but yeah that will I know I
should know the numbers but I think the

4560
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:29,390
should know the numbers but I think the
 

4561
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:31,720
should know the numbers but I think the
whole project is estimated at about 30

4562
01:22:31,720 --> 01:22:31,730
whole project is estimated at about 30
 

4563
01:22:31,730 --> 01:22:33,910
whole project is estimated at about 30
billion euros but that's money spent

4564
01:22:33,910 --> 01:22:33,920
billion euros but that's money spent
 

4565
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:37,960
billion euros but that's money spent
over between now and 2017 probably which

4566
01:22:37,960 --> 01:22:37,970
over between now and 2017 probably which
 

4567
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:40,780
over between now and 2017 probably which
is when the last bit of it would be sort

4568
01:22:40,780 --> 01:22:40,790
is when the last bit of it would be sort
 

4569
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:42,850
is when the last bit of it would be sort
of finishing up I guess so you're

4570
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:42,860
of finishing up I guess so you're
 

4571
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:46,300
of finishing up I guess so you're
talking a half a century of science

4572
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:46,310
talking a half a century of science
 

4573
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:47,560
talking a half a century of science
coming out of this thing

4574
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:47,570
coming out of this thing
 

4575
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:49,150
coming out of this thing
shared by many countries so the actual

4576
01:22:49,150 --> 01:22:49,160
shared by many countries so the actual
 

4577
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,400
shared by many countries so the actual
cost the arguments that are made is that

4578
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:51,410
cost the arguments that are made is that
 

4579
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:53,230
cost the arguments that are made is that
you could make this project fit within

4580
01:22:53,230 --> 01:22:53,240
you could make this project fit within
 

4581
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:56,440
you could make this project fit within
the existing budget of certain if you

4582
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:56,450
the existing budget of certain if you
 

4583
01:22:56,450 --> 01:22:58,000
the existing budget of certain if you
didn't do anything else it's earned by

4584
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:58,010
didn't do anything else it's earned by
 

4585
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:00,100
didn't do anything else it's earned by
the way we didn't mention what is CERN

4586
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:00,110
the way we didn't mention what is CERN
 

4587
01:23:00,110 --> 01:23:02,020
the way we didn't mention what is CERN
CERN is the European Organization for

4588
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:02,030
CERN is the European Organization for
 

4589
01:23:02,030 --> 01:23:04,200
CERN is the European Organization for
Nuclear Research as an international

4590
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:04,210
Nuclear Research as an international
 

4591
01:23:04,210 --> 01:23:06,100
Nuclear Research as an international
organization that was established in the

4592
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:06,110
organization that was established in the
 

4593
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:08,200
organization that was established in the
1950s in the wake of the Second World

4594
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:08,210
1950s in the wake of the Second World
 

4595
01:23:08,210 --> 01:23:10,780
1950s in the wake of the Second World
War as a kind of it was sort of like a

4596
01:23:10,780 --> 01:23:10,790
War as a kind of it was sort of like a
 

4597
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:12,580
War as a kind of it was sort of like a
scientific martial plan for Europe the

4598
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:12,590
scientific martial plan for Europe the
 

4599
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,500
scientific martial plan for Europe the
idea was that you bring european science

4600
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:14,510
idea was that you bring european science
 

4601
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:17,200
idea was that you bring european science
back together for peaceful purposes

4602
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:17,210
back together for peaceful purposes
 

4603
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:19,870
back together for peaceful purposes
because what happened in the 40s was you

4604
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:19,880
because what happened in the 40s was you
 

4605
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,310
because what happened in the 40s was you
know a lot of particular scientists but

4606
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:21,320
know a lot of particular scientists but
 

4607
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,450
know a lot of particular scientists but
a lot of scientists from Central Europe

4608
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:22,460
a lot of scientists from Central Europe
 

4609
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:26,080
a lot of scientists from Central Europe
had fled to the United States and Europe

4610
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,090
had fled to the United States and Europe
 

4611
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:27,520
had fled to the United States and Europe
and sort of seen his brain drain so it's

4612
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:27,530
and sort of seen his brain drain so it's
 

4613
01:23:27,530 --> 01:23:29,020
and sort of seen his brain drain so it's
a desire to bring the community back

4614
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:29,030
a desire to bring the community back
 

4615
01:23:29,030 --> 01:23:30,940
a desire to bring the community back
together for a project that wasn't

4616
01:23:30,940 --> 01:23:30,950
together for a project that wasn't
 

4617
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:32,830
together for a project that wasn't
building nasty bombs but was doing

4618
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:32,840
building nasty bombs but was doing
 

4619
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:34,450
building nasty bombs but was doing
something that was curiosity driven so

4620
01:23:34,450 --> 01:23:34,460
something that was curiosity driven so
 

4621
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:37,450
something that was curiosity driven so
and that has continued since then so

4622
01:23:37,450 --> 01:23:37,460
and that has continued since then so
 

4623
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:38,950
and that has continued since then so
it's kind of a unique organization it's

4624
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:38,960
it's kind of a unique organization it's
 

4625
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:41,890
it's kind of a unique organization it's
you to be a member as a country you sort

4626
01:23:41,890 --> 01:23:41,900
you to be a member as a country you sort
 

4627
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:43,420
you to be a member as a country you sort
of sign up as a member and then you have

4628
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:43,430
of sign up as a member and then you have
 

4629
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:46,510
of sign up as a member and then you have
to pay a fraction of your GDP each year

4630
01:23:46,510 --> 01:23:46,520
to pay a fraction of your GDP each year
 

4631
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,680
to pay a fraction of your GDP each year
is a subscription I mean it's a very

4632
01:23:47,680 --> 01:23:47,690
is a subscription I mean it's a very
 

4633
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,570
is a subscription I mean it's a very
small fraction relatively speaking I

4634
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:49,580
small fraction relatively speaking I
 

4635
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:50,890
small fraction relatively speaking I
think it's like I think the UK's

4636
01:23:50,890 --> 01:23:50,900
think it's like I think the UK's
 

4637
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:54,040
think it's like I think the UK's
contribution is 100 or 200 million quid

4638
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:54,050
contribution is 100 or 200 million quid
 

4639
01:23:54,050 --> 01:23:55,180
contribution is 100 or 200 million quid
or something like that yeah which is

4640
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:55,190
or something like that yeah which is
 

4641
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:58,180
or something like that yeah which is
quite a lot but no not that's fastest

4642
01:23:58,180 --> 01:23:58,190
quite a lot but no not that's fastest
 

4643
01:23:58,190 --> 01:23:59,380
quite a lot but no not that's fastest
man I mean just the whole thing that is

4644
01:23:59,380 --> 01:23:59,390
man I mean just the whole thing that is
 

4645
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:01,160
man I mean just the whole thing that is
possible it's beautiful

4646
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:01,170
possible it's beautiful
 

4647
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:03,230
possible it's beautiful
it's a beautiful idea especially with

4648
01:24:03,230 --> 01:24:03,240
it's a beautiful idea especially with
 

4649
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:05,420
it's a beautiful idea especially with
when there's no wars on the line it's

4650
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:05,430
when there's no wars on the line it's
 

4651
01:24:05,430 --> 01:24:06,830
when there's no wars on the line it's
not like we're freaking out as we're

4652
01:24:06,830 --> 01:24:06,840
not like we're freaking out as we're
 

4653
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:08,810
not like we're freaking out as we're
actually legitimately collaborating mmm

4654
01:24:08,810 --> 01:24:08,820
actually legitimately collaborating mmm
 

4655
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:10,610
actually legitimately collaborating mmm
to do good sighs one of the things I

4656
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:10,620
to do good sighs one of the things I
 

4657
01:24:10,620 --> 01:24:12,080
to do good sighs one of the things I
don't think we really mentioned is that

4658
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:12,090
don't think we really mentioned is that
 

4659
01:24:12,090 --> 01:24:13,880
don't think we really mentioned is that
in the final side that sort of the data

4660
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:13,890
in the final side that sort of the data
 

4661
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,220
in the final side that sort of the data
analysis side is there a break there was

4662
01:24:16,220 --> 01:24:16,230
analysis side is there a break there was
 

4663
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:17,720
analysis side is there a break there was
possible there and the machine learning

4664
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:17,730
possible there and the machine learning
 

4665
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:20,680
possible there and the machine learning
side like is there is there a lot more

4666
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:20,690
side like is there is there a lot more
 

4667
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:23,450
side like is there is there a lot more
signal to be mined in more effective

4668
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:23,460
signal to be mined in more effective
 

4669
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:26,060
signal to be mined in more effective
ways from the actual raw data yeah a lot

4670
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:26,070
ways from the actual raw data yeah a lot
 

4671
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:27,710
ways from the actual raw data yeah a lot
of people are looking into that I mean

4672
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:27,720
of people are looking into that I mean
 

4673
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,810
of people are looking into that I mean
so what we know I use machine learning

4674
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:29,820
so what we know I use machine learning
 

4675
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:32,210
so what we know I use machine learning
in my data analysis but pretty knotty

4676
01:24:32,210 --> 01:24:32,220
in my data analysis but pretty knotty
 

4677
01:24:32,220 --> 01:24:34,250
in my data analysis but pretty knotty
you know basic stuff because I'm not a

4678
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:34,260
you know basic stuff because I'm not a
 

4679
01:24:34,260 --> 01:24:35,720
you know basic stuff because I'm not a
machine learning expert and just a

4680
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:35,730
machine learning expert and just a
 

4681
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:37,070
machine learning expert and just a
physicist who had to learn to do this

4682
01:24:37,070 --> 01:24:37,080
physicist who had to learn to do this
 

4683
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:39,710
physicist who had to learn to do this
stuff for my day job so what a lot of

4684
01:24:39,710 --> 01:24:39,720
stuff for my day job so what a lot of
 

4685
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:40,760
stuff for my day job so what a lot of
people do is they use kind of

4686
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:40,770
people do is they use kind of
 

4687
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:43,070
people do is they use kind of
off-the-shelf packages that you can

4688
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:43,080
off-the-shelf packages that you can
 

4689
01:24:43,080 --> 01:24:46,370
off-the-shelf packages that you can
train to do signal noise you know just

4690
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:46,380
train to do signal noise you know just
 

4691
01:24:46,380 --> 01:24:48,950
train to do signal noise you know just
like a cleanup yeah but one of the big

4692
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:48,960
like a cleanup yeah but one of the big
 

4693
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:50,630
like a cleanup yeah but one of the big
challenges you know the big challenge of

4694
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:50,640
challenges you know the big challenge of
 

4695
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:53,090
challenges you know the big challenge of
the data is a it's volume there's huge

4696
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:53,100
the data is a it's volume there's huge
 

4697
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,090
the data is a it's volume there's huge
amounts of data so the LHC generates now

4698
01:24:56,090 --> 01:24:56,100
amounts of data so the LHC generates now
 

4699
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,040
amounts of data so the LHC generates now
okay I bought the actual numbers are but

4700
01:24:58,040 --> 01:24:58,050
okay I bought the actual numbers are but
 

4701
01:24:58,050 --> 01:24:59,540
okay I bought the actual numbers are but
if you we don't record all our data we

4702
01:24:59,540 --> 01:24:59,550
if you we don't record all our data we
 

4703
01:24:59,550 --> 01:25:02,330
if you we don't record all our data we
record a tiny fraction of the data it's

4704
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:02,340
record a tiny fraction of the data it's
 

4705
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,100
record a tiny fraction of the data it's
like of order one ten thousandth or

4706
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:04,110
like of order one ten thousandth or
 

4707
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:07,160
like of order one ten thousandth or
something I think right around that so

4708
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:07,170
something I think right around that so
 

4709
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:08,450
something I think right around that so
it's it votes mostly gets thrown away

4710
01:25:08,450 --> 01:25:08,460
it's it votes mostly gets thrown away
 

4711
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:09,980
it's it votes mostly gets thrown away
you couldn't record all the LHC data

4712
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:09,990
you couldn't record all the LHC data
 

4713
01:25:09,990 --> 01:25:11,090
you couldn't record all the LHC data
because it would fill up every computer

4714
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:11,100
because it would fill up every computer
 

4715
01:25:11,100 --> 01:25:12,410
because it would fill up every computer
in the world in the matter of days

4716
01:25:12,410 --> 01:25:12,420
in the world in the matter of days
 

4717
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:15,530
in the world in the matter of days
basically so there's this process that

4718
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:15,540
basically so there's this process that
 

4719
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:17,600
basically so there's this process that
happens on live on the detector

4720
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:17,610
happens on live on the detector
 

4721
01:25:17,610 --> 01:25:19,400
happens on live on the detector
something called a trigger which in real

4722
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:19,410
something called a trigger which in real
 

4723
01:25:19,410 --> 01:25:21,500
something called a trigger which in real
time 40 million times every second has

4725
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:23,240

to make a decision about whether this

4726
01:25:23,240 --> 01:25:23,250
to make a decision about whether this
 

4727
01:25:23,250 --> 01:25:25,070
to make a decision about whether this
collision is likely to contain an

01:25:25,070 --> 01:25:25,080
collision is likely to contain an
 

4729
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:27,530
collision is likely to contain an
interesting object like a Higgs boson or

4730
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:27,540
interesting object like a Higgs boson or
 

4731
01:25:27,540 --> 01:25:28,940
interesting object like a Higgs boson or
a Dark Matter particle and it has to do

4732
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:28,950
a Dark Matter particle and it has to do
 

4733
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:31,520
a Dark Matter particle and it has to do
that very fast and the software

4734
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:31,530
that very fast and the software
 

4735
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:34,360
that very fast and the software
algorithms in the past were quite

4736
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:34,370
algorithms in the past were quite
 

4737
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,320
algorithms in the past were quite
relatively basic you know they did

4738
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:36,330
relatively basic you know they did
 

4739
01:25:36,330 --> 01:25:37,760
relatively basic you know they did
things like measure mementos and

4740
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:37,770
things like measure mementos and
 

4741
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,410
things like measure mementos and
energies of particles and put some

4742
01:25:39,410 --> 01:25:39,420
energies of particles and put some
 

4743
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,570
energies of particles and put some
requirements so you would say if there's

4744
01:25:41,570 --> 01:25:41,580
requirements so you would say if there's
 

4745
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,190
requirements so you would say if there's
a particle with an energy above some

a particle with an energy above some
 

4747
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:44,960
a particle with an energy above some
threshold then record this collision but

4748
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:44,970
threshold then record this collision but
 

4749
01:25:44,970 --> 01:25:46,790
threshold then record this collision but
if there isn't don't wear as now the

generally how the data is reconstructed
 

4767
01:26:02,820 --> 01:26:05,600
generally how the data is reconstructed
is you start off with a digital a set of

4768
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:05,610
is you start off with a digital a set of
 

4769
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:07,010
is you start off with a digital a set of
digital hits in your detector so

then turned into tracks particles going

4776
01:26:13,310 --> 01:26:13,320
then turned into tracks particles going
 

4777
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,420
then turned into tracks particles going
in different directions and that's done

because our triggers tend to be quite

4806
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:38,010
because our triggers tend to be quite
 

4807
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,580
because our triggers tend to be quite

01:26:45,890 --> 01:26:45,900
would like because you have to do the
 

4815
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:47,479
would like because you have to do the
decision very quickly so if you can come

01:26:47,479 --> 01:26:47,489
decision very quickly so if you can come
 

4817
01:26:47,489 --> 01:26:49,310
decision very quickly so if you can come
up with some clever machine learning

4818
01:26:49,310 --> 01:26:49,320
up with some clever machine learning
 

4819
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,930
up with some clever machine learning
technique then potentially you can

4820
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:50,940
technique then potentially you can
 

4821
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:53,089
technique then potentially you can
massively increase the amount of useful

4825
01:26:56,550 --> 01:26:59,000

more of the background earlier in the
 

4827
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:00,830
more of the background earlier in the
process yeah to me that's an exciting

4828
01:27:00,830 --> 01:27:00,840
process yeah to me that's an exciting
 

4829
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,029
process yeah to me that's an exciting
possibility because then you don't have

4830
01:27:02,029 --> 01:27:02,039
possibility because then you don't have
 

4831
01:27:02,039 --> 01:27:05,750
possibility because then you don't have
to build a sort of you can get again

4832
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:05,760
to build a sort of you can get again
 

4833
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:09,589
to build a sort of you can get again
without having to have to put an ephod

01:27:09,589 --> 01:27:09,599
without having to have to put an ephod
 

4835
01:27:09,599 --> 01:27:11,629
without having to have to put an ephod
whereas per hardware yeah but I do you

4836
01:27:11,629 --> 01:27:11,639
whereas per hardware yeah but I do you
 

4837
01:27:11,639 --> 01:27:13,759
whereas per hardware yeah but I do you
need you need lots of new GPU farms I

4838
01:27:13,759 --> 01:27:13,769
need you need lots of new GPU farms I
 

4839
01:27:13,769 --> 01:27:15,410
need you need lots of new GPU farms I
guess so hardware it still helps but

4840
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:15,420
guess so hardware it still helps but
 

4841
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:20,719
guess so hardware it still helps but
yeah the you know I got a talk to you so

4842
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:20,729
yeah the you know I got a talk to you so
 

4843
01:27:20,729 --> 01:27:23,149
yeah the you know I got a talk to you so
if I'm not sure how to ask but you're

4844
01:27:23,149 --> 01:27:23,159
if I'm not sure how to ask but you're
 

4845
01:27:23,159 --> 01:27:26,810
if I'm not sure how to ask but you're
clearly an incredible science

4846
01:27:26,810 --> 01:27:26,820
clearly an incredible science
 

4847
01:27:26,820 --> 01:27:28,160
clearly an incredible science
communicator I don't know if that's the

4848
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:28,170
communicator I don't know if that's the
 

4849
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:30,680
communicator I don't know if that's the
right term but you're basically a

4850
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:30,690
right term but you're basically a
 

4851
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:32,689
right term but you're basically a
younger Neil deGrasse Tyson with a

British accent
 

4855
01:27:33,570 --> 01:27:37,009
British accent
huh so and you but I mean can you save

4856
01:27:37,009 --> 01:27:37,019
huh so and you but I mean can you save
 

4857
01:27:37,019 --> 01:27:39,830
huh so and you but I mean can you save
where we are today actually yeah so

4858
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:39,840
where we are today actually yeah so
 

4859
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,989
where we are today actually yeah so
today we're in the Royal Institution in

4860
01:27:41,989 --> 01:27:41,999
today we're in the Royal Institution in
 

4861
01:27:41,999 --> 01:27:45,169
today we're in the Royal Institution in
London which is an old very old

4862
01:27:45,169 --> 01:27:45,179
London which is an old very old
 

4863
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:46,459
London which is an old very old
organization has been around for about

4864
01:27:46,459 --> 01:27:46,469
organization has been around for about
 

4865
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:48,229
organization has been around for about
two hundred years now I think maybe even

4866
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:48,239
two hundred years now I think maybe even
 

4867
01:27:48,239 --> 01:27:50,029
two hundred years now I think maybe even
I should know when it was founded so the

4868
01:27:50,029 --> 01:27:50,039
I should know when it was founded so the
 

4869
01:27:50,039 --> 01:27:53,169
I should know when it was founded so the
early 19th century it was set up to

4870
01:27:53,169 --> 01:27:53,179
early 19th century it was set up to
 

4871
01:27:53,179 --> 01:27:55,850
early 19th century it was set up to
basically communicate science the public

4872
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:55,860
basically communicate science the public
 

4873
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:57,259
basically communicate science the public
so it was one of the first places in the

4874
01:27:57,259 --> 01:27:57,269
so it was one of the first places in the
 

4875
01:27:57,269 --> 01:27:59,120
so it was one of the first places in the
world where scientists famous scientists

4876
01:27:59,120 --> 01:27:59,130
world where scientists famous scientists
 

4877
01:27:59,130 --> 01:28:02,629
world where scientists famous scientists
would come and give talks so very

know of who was the person who

4882
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:06,420
know of who was the person who
 

4883
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:07,939
know of who was the person who
discovered nitrous oxide is a very

4884
01:28:07,939 --> 01:28:07,949
discovered nitrous oxide is a very
 

4885
01:28:07,949 --> 01:28:11,479

famous chemist and scientists also
 

4887
01:28:11,489 --> 01:28:13,189
famous chemist and scientists also
discovered electronic sis so he used to

4888
01:28:13,189 --> 01:28:13,199
discovered electronic sis so he used to
 

4889
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:14,479
discovered electronic sis so he used to
do these fantastic was very charismatic

folk of London back in the early 19th

4900
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:23,280
folk of London back in the early 19th
 

4901
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,950
folk of London back in the early 19th
century and Michael Faraday who I talked

4902
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:24,960
century and Michael Faraday who I talked
 

4903
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:26,390
century and Michael Faraday who I talked
about who is the person who did so much

4904
01:28:26,390 --> 01:28:26,400
about who is the person who did so much
 

4905
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,709
about who is the person who did so much
work connection Magnussen he used he

4906
01:28:27,709 --> 01:28:27,719
work connection Magnussen he used he
 

4907
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:28,609
work connection Magnussen he used he
lectured here he

4908
01:28:28,609 --> 01:28:28,619
lectured here he
 

4909
01:28:28,619 --> 01:28:30,139
lectured here he
did experiments in the basement so this

4910
01:28:30,139 --> 01:28:30,149
did experiments in the basement so this
 

4911
01:28:30,149 --> 01:28:32,089
did experiments in the basement so this
place has got a long history of both

4912
01:28:32,089 --> 01:28:32,099
place has got a long history of both
 

4913
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:34,189
place has got a long history of both
scientific research but also in the

4914
01:28:34,189 --> 01:28:34,199
scientific research but also in the
 

4915
01:28:34,199 --> 01:28:35,899
scientific research but also in the
communication of scientific research so

4916
01:28:35,899 --> 01:28:35,909
communication of scientific research so
 

4917
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:38,750
communication of scientific research so
you gave a few lectures here how many -

4918
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:38,760
you gave a few lectures here how many -
 

4919
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,699
you gave a few lectures here how many -
I've give I given you I given a couple

4920
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:40,709
I've give I given you I given a couple
 

4921
01:28:40,709 --> 01:28:42,290
I've give I given you I given a couple
of lectures in this theater before so I

4922
01:28:42,290 --> 01:28:42,300
of lectures in this theater before so I
 

4923
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:43,520
of lectures in this theater before so I
mean that's think so people should

4924
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:43,530
mean that's think so people should
 

4925
01:28:43,530 --> 01:28:47,149
mean that's think so people should
definitely go watch online it's there's

4926
01:28:47,149 --> 01:28:47,159
definitely go watch online it's there's
 

4927
01:28:47,159 --> 01:28:48,350
definitely go watch online it's there's
just the explanation of particle physics

4928
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:48,360
just the explanation of particle physics
 

4929
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:50,419
just the explanation of particle physics
that all the good thing it's incredible

4930
01:28:50,419 --> 01:28:50,429
that all the good thing it's incredible
 

4931
01:28:50,429 --> 01:28:52,359
that all the good thing it's incredible
like your your lectures are just

4932

like to lecture here to talk about that
and maybe from a different perspective

4942
01:29:05,770 --> 01:29:05,780
and maybe from a different perspective
 

4943

of thing how do you think about
 

4949
01:29:12,959 --> 01:29:15,020
of thing how do you think about
communication the process of

4950
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:15,030
communication the process of
 

4951
01:29:15,030 --> 01:29:16,819
communication the process of
communicating these ideas in a way

4952
01:29:16,819 --> 01:29:16,829
communicating these ideas in a way
 

4953
01:29:16,829 --> 01:29:19,580
communicating these ideas in a way
that's inspiring to what I would say

4954
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:19,590
that's inspiring to what I would say
 

4955
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:21,619
that's inspiring to what I would say
your talks are inspiring to like the

01:29:23,389 --> 01:29:23,399
general audience you don't actually have
 

4959
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:25,729
general audience you don't actually have
to be a scientist you can still be

4960
01:29:25,729 --> 01:29:25,739
to be a scientist you can still be
 

4961
01:29:25,739 --> 01:29:27,500
to be a scientist you can still be
inspired without really knowing much of

4962
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:27,510
inspired without really knowing much of
 

4963
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:29,859
inspired without really knowing much of
the you you start from the very basics

4964

mean that one I sort of given a version
of it many times so part of it is just

4990
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:56,340
of it many times so part of it is just
 

4991
01:29:56,340 --> 01:29:57,949
of it many times so part of it is just
practice right I and actually I don't

4992
01:29:57,949 --> 01:29:57,959
practice right I and actually I don't
 

4993
01:29:57,959 --> 01:29:59,270
practice right I and actually I don't
have some great theory of how to

4994
01:29:59,270 --> 01:29:59,280
have some great theory of how to
 

4995
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:01,009
have some great theory of how to
communicate with people it's more just

4996
01:30:01,009 --> 01:30:01,019
communicate with people it's more just
 

4997
01:30:01,019 --> 01:30:02,839
communicate with people it's more just
that I'm really interested and excited

4998
01:30:02,839 --> 01:30:02,849
that I'm really interested and excited
 

4999
01:30:02,849 --> 01:30:04,459
that I'm really interested and excited
by those idiot and I like talking about

5000
01:30:04,459 --> 01:30:04,469
by those idiot and I like talking about
 

5001
01:30:04,469 --> 01:30:07,040
by those idiot and I like talking about
them and through the process of doing

5002
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:07,050
them and through the process of doing
 

5003
01:30:07,050 --> 01:30:09,049
them and through the process of doing
that I guess I figured out stories that

5004
01:30:09,049 --> 01:30:09,059
that I guess I figured out stories that
 

5005
01:30:09,059 --> 01:30:11,119
that I guess I figured out stories that
work and explanations that well you see

5006
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:11,129
work and explanations that well you see
 

5007
01:30:11,129 --> 01:30:12,949
work and explanations that well you see
a practice you mean legitimately just

5008
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:12,959
a practice you mean legitimately just
 

5009

started off you know when I was a PhD

5012
01:30:16,699 --> 01:30:16,709
started off you know when I was a PhD
 

5013
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:19,129
started off you know when I was a PhD
student doing talks in schools and and I

5014
01:30:19,129 --> 01:30:19,139
student doing talks in schools and and I
 

5015
01:30:19,139 --> 01:30:20,540
student doing talks in schools and and I
still do that as well some of the time

5016
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:20,550
still do that as well some of the time
 

5017
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:22,580
still do that as well some of the time
and doing things I haven't done a bit of

5018
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:22,590
and doing things I haven't done a bit of
 

5019
01:30:22,590 --> 01:30:24,649
and doing things I haven't done a bit of
stand-up comedy which was sort of went

5020
01:30:24,649 --> 01:30:24,659
stand-up comedy which was sort of went
 

5021
01:30:24,659 --> 01:30:25,729
stand-up comedy which was sort of went
reasonably well even if it was

01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:25,739
reasonably well even if it was
 

5023
01:30:25,739 --> 01:30:27,379
reasonably well even if it was
terrifying and that's unusual as well

5024
01:30:27,379 --> 01:30:27,389
terrifying and that's unusual as well
 

5025

5041
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,990
usually have some images
to support what I'm saying and I get up

5042
01:30:43,990 --> 01:30:44,000
to support what I'm saying and I get up
 

5043
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,700
to support what I'm saying and I get up
and do it and it's not really I wish

5044
01:30:45,700 --> 01:30:45,710
and do it and it's not really I wish
 

5045

and do it and it's not really I wish
there was some kind of I probably should

01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:47,690
there was some kind of I probably should

sounds like I'm just making up as I go
 

5051
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:52,720
sounds like I'm just making up as I go
along and I sort of am I think the

5052
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:52,730
along and I sort of am I think the
 

5053
01:30:52,730 --> 01:30:56,980
along and I sort of am I think the
fundamental thing they said I think it's

5054
01:30:56,980 --> 01:30:56,990
fundamental thing they said I think it's
 

5055
01:30:56,990 --> 01:30:59,980
fundamental thing they said I think it's
like I don't know if you know who a guy

5056
01:30:59,980 --> 01:30:59,990
like I don't know if you know who a guy
 

5057
01:30:59,990 --> 01:31:03,280
like I don't know if you know who a guy
named Joe Rogan is yes okay so he he's

5058
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:03,290
named Joe Rogan is yes okay so he he's
 

5059
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,960
named Joe Rogan is yes okay so he he's
also kind of sounds like you in a sense

5060
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:04,970
also kind of sounds like you in a sense
 

5061
01:31:04,970 --> 01:31:07,630
also kind of sounds like you in a sense
that he's not very introspective about

5062
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:07,640
that he's not very introspective about
 

5063
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,640
that he's not very introspective about
his process but he's an incredibly

5064
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:09,650
his process but he's an incredibly
 

5065
01:31:09,650 --> 01:31:13,540
his process but he's an incredibly
engaging conversationalist and I think

5066
01:31:13,540 --> 01:31:13,550
engaging conversationalist and I think
 

5067
01:31:13,550 --> 01:31:15,640
engaging conversationalist and I think
one of the things that you and him share

5068
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:15,650
one of the things that you and him share
 

5069
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:17,890
one of the things that you and him share
that I could see is like a genuine

01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:17,900
that I could see is like a genuine
 

5071
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:22,090
that I could see is like a genuine
curiosity and passion for the topic I

5072
01:31:22,090 --> 01:31:22,100
curiosity and passion for the topic I
 

5073
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,760
curiosity and passion for the topic I
think that could be systematically

5074
01:31:24,760 --> 01:31:24,770
think that could be systematically
 

5075
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,130
think that could be systematically

there's a process to it but you come to

there's a process to it but you come to
 

5079
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:30,850
there's a process to it but you come to
it naturally somehow I think maybe

01:31:30,850 --> 01:31:30,860
it naturally somehow I think maybe

tell people about that that helps me
 

5101
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,490
tell people about that that helps me
understand it as well so I've actually

understand it as well so I've actually

5126
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:15,560
subject and I had to go and hide to sort
 

5127
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,750
subject and I had to go and hide to sort
of spend a couple of days reading

5128
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:16,760
of spend a couple of days reading
 

5129
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,210
of spend a couple of days reading
textbooks and thinking about it in order

5130
01:32:19,210 --> 01:32:19,220
textbooks and thinking about it in order
 

5131
01:32:19,220 --> 01:32:21,270
textbooks and thinking about it in order
to make sure that the explanation I gave

5132
01:32:21,270 --> 01:32:21,280
to make sure that the explanation I gave
 

5133
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:24,130
to make sure that the explanation I gave
captured the got as close to what is

5134
01:32:24,130 --> 01:32:24,140
captured the got as close to what is
 

5135
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:26,470
captured the got as close to what is
actually happening in the theory and to

5136
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:26,480
actually happening in the theory and to
 

5137
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:28,030
actually happening in the theory and to
do that you have to really understand it

5138
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:28,040
do that you have to really understand it
 

5139
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,070
do that you have to really understand it
properly and yeah and there's layers to

5140
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:30,080
properly and yeah and there's layers to
 

5141
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,290
properly and yeah and there's layers to
understanding yeah it seems like the

5142
01:32:32,290 --> 01:32:32,300
understanding yeah it seems like the
 

5143
01:32:32,300 --> 01:32:35,470
understanding yeah it seems like the
more there must be some kind of Fineman

5144
01:32:35,470 --> 01:32:35,480
more there must be some kind of Fineman
 

5145
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:38,050
more there must be some kind of Fineman
law I mean the the more you the more you

5146
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:38,060
law I mean the the more you the more you
 

5147
01:32:38,060 --> 01:32:40,150
law I mean the the more you the more you
understand services simply you're able

5148
01:32:40,150 --> 01:32:40,160
understand services simply you're able
 

5149
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:44,080
understand services simply you're able
to really convey the you know the the

5150
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:44,090
to really convey the you know the the
 

5151
01:32:44,090 --> 01:32:47,470
to really convey the you know the the
essence of the idea right so it's just

5152
01:32:47,470 --> 01:32:47,480
essence of the idea right so it's just
 

5153
01:32:47,480 --> 01:32:50,320
essence of the idea right so it's just
like this reverse the reverse effect

5154
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:50,330
like this reverse the reverse effect
 

5155
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:53,560
like this reverse the reverse effect
there's like the more you understand the

5156
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:53,570
there's like the more you understand the
 

5157
01:32:53,570 --> 01:32:55,060
there's like the more you understand the
simpler the final thing that you

5158
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:55,070
simpler the final thing that you
 

5159
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,290
simpler the final thing that you
actually convey

5160
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:56,300
actually convey
 

5161
01:32:56,300 --> 01:32:57,939
actually convey
and so the more accessible somehow it

5162
01:32:57,939 --> 01:32:57,949
and so the more accessible somehow it
 

5163
01:32:57,949 --> 01:32:59,979
and so the more accessible somehow it
becomes that's why faint fineman's

5164
01:32:59,979 --> 01:32:59,989
becomes that's why faint fineman's
 

5165
01:32:59,989 --> 01:33:03,399
becomes that's why faint fineman's
lectures are really accessible it was

5166
01:33:03,399 --> 01:33:03,409
lectures are really accessible it was
 

5167
01:33:03,409 --> 01:33:05,740
lectures are really accessible it was
just counterintuitive yeah although

5168
01:33:05,740 --> 01:33:05,750
just counterintuitive yeah although
 

5169
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:08,500
just counterintuitive yeah although
there are some ideas that are very

5170
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:08,510
there are some ideas that are very
 

5171
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:09,399
there are some ideas that are very
difficult to explain

5172
01:33:09,399 --> 01:33:09,409
difficult to explain
 

5173
01:33:09,409 --> 01:33:11,500
difficult to explain
no matter how well or badly you

5174
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:11,510
no matter how well or badly you
 

5175
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:13,720
no matter how well or badly you
understand like I still can't really

5176
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:13,730
understand like I still can't really
 

5177
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:15,720
understand like I still can't really
properly explain the Higgs mechanism

5178
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:15,730
properly explain the Higgs mechanism
 

5179
01:33:15,730 --> 01:33:18,250
properly explain the Higgs mechanism
yeah with because some of these ideas

5180
01:33:18,250 --> 01:33:18,260
yeah with because some of these ideas
 

5181
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:22,359
yeah with because some of these ideas
only exist in mathematics really and the

5182
01:33:22,359 --> 01:33:22,369
only exist in mathematics really and the
 

5183
01:33:22,369 --> 01:33:23,560
only exist in mathematics really and the
only way to really develop an

5184
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:23,570
only way to really develop an
 

5185
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:26,080
only way to really develop an
understanding is to go unfortunately to

5186
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:26,090
understanding is to go unfortunately to
 

5187
01:33:26,090 --> 01:33:29,500
understanding is to go unfortunately to
a graduate degree in physics but you can

5188
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:29,510
a graduate degree in physics but you can
 

5189
01:33:29,510 --> 01:33:31,839
a graduate degree in physics but you can
get kind of a flavor of what's happening

5190
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:31,849
get kind of a flavor of what's happening
 

5191
01:33:31,849 --> 01:33:33,399
get kind of a flavor of what's happening
I think and is trying to do that in a

5192
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:33,409
I think and is trying to do that in a
 

5193
01:33:33,409 --> 01:33:35,169
I think and is trying to do that in a
way that isn't misleading but always

5194
01:33:35,169 --> 01:33:35,179
way that isn't misleading but always
 

5195
01:33:35,179 --> 01:33:38,080
way that isn't misleading but always
also intelligible so let me ask them the

5196
01:33:38,080 --> 01:33:38,090
also intelligible so let me ask them the
 

5197
01:33:38,090 --> 01:33:41,350
also intelligible so let me ask them the
romantic question of what to you is the

5198
01:33:41,350 --> 01:33:41,360
romantic question of what to you is the
 

5199
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:44,830
romantic question of what to you is the
most perhaps an unfair question what is

5200
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:44,840
most perhaps an unfair question what is
 

5201
01:33:44,840 --> 01:33:49,240
most perhaps an unfair question what is
the most beautiful idea in physics one

5202
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:49,250
the most beautiful idea in physics one
 

5203
01:33:49,250 --> 01:33:51,760
the most beautiful idea in physics one
that fills you with are is the most

5204
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:51,770
that fills you with are is the most
 

5205
01:33:51,770 --> 01:33:54,069
that fills you with are is the most
surprising the strangest the weirdest

5206
01:33:54,069 --> 01:33:54,079
surprising the strangest the weirdest
 

5207
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:55,990
surprising the strangest the weirdest
there's some a lot of different

5208
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:56,000
there's some a lot of different
 

5209
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,760
there's some a lot of different
definitions of beauty mmm-hmm and I'm

5210
01:33:57,760 --> 01:33:57,770
definitions of beauty mmm-hmm and I'm
 

5211
01:33:57,770 --> 01:33:59,589
definitions of beauty mmm-hmm and I'm
sure there's several for you but is

5212
01:33:59,589 --> 01:33:59,599
sure there's several for you but is
 

5213
01:33:59,599 --> 01:34:01,319
sure there's several for you but is
there something just jumps to mind that

5214
01:34:01,319 --> 01:34:01,329
there something just jumps to mind that
 

5215
01:34:01,329 --> 01:34:05,109
there something just jumps to mind that
you think is just especially I mean I

5216
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:05,119
you think is just especially I mean I
 

5217
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:07,780
you think is just especially I mean I
well beautiful there's a specific thing

5218
01:34:07,780 --> 01:34:07,790
well beautiful there's a specific thing
 

5219
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:09,160
well beautiful there's a specific thing
in a more general thing so maybe the

5220
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:09,170
in a more general thing so maybe the
 

5221
01:34:09,170 --> 01:34:10,720
in a more general thing so maybe the
specific thing a first widget is a cone

5222
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:10,730
specific thing a first widget is a cone
 

5223
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:11,680
specific thing a first widget is a cone
i first came across this as an

5224
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:11,690
i first came across this as an
 

5225
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:13,660
i first came across this as an
undergraduate i found this amazing so

5226
01:34:13,660 --> 01:34:13,670
undergraduate i found this amazing so
 

5227
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:16,709
undergraduate i found this amazing so
this idea that the forces of nature

5228
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
this idea that the forces of nature
 

5229
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:18,970
this idea that the forces of nature
electromagnetism strong force the weak

5230
01:34:18,970 --> 01:34:18,980
electromagnetism strong force the weak
 

5231
01:34:18,980 --> 01:34:22,390
electromagnetism strong force the weak
force they arise in our theories has

5232
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
force they arise in our theories has
 

5233
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:25,060
force they arise in our theories has
there a consequence of symmetries so

5234
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:25,070
there a consequence of symmetries so
 

5235
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:27,729
there a consequence of symmetries so
symmetry is in the laws of nature in the

5236
01:34:27,729 --> 01:34:27,739
symmetry is in the laws of nature in the
 

5237
01:34:27,739 --> 01:34:29,500
symmetry is in the laws of nature in the
equations essentially that used to

5238
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:29,510
equations essentially that used to
 

5239
01:34:29,510 --> 01:34:33,430
equations essentially that used to
describe these ideas the process whereby

5240
01:34:33,430 --> 01:34:33,440
describe these ideas the process whereby
 

5241
01:34:33,440 --> 01:34:34,990
describe these ideas the process whereby
theories come up with these sorts of

5242
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:35,000
theories come up with these sorts of
 

5243
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,310
theories come up with these sorts of
models as they say

5244
01:34:36,310 --> 01:34:36,320
models as they say
 

5245
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,439
models as they say
imagine the universe obeys this

5246
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:38,449
imagine the universe obeys this
 

5247
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:40,060
imagine the universe obeys this
particular type of symmetry is a

5248
01:34:40,060 --> 01:34:40,070
particular type of symmetry is a
 

5249
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:42,250
particular type of symmetry is a
symmetry that isn't so far removed from

5250
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:42,260
symmetry that isn't so far removed from
 

5251
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:43,870
symmetry that isn't so far removed from
a geometrical symmetry like the

5252
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:43,880
a geometrical symmetry like the
 

5253
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:45,459
a geometrical symmetry like the
rotations of a cube it's not you can't

5254
01:34:45,459 --> 01:34:45,469
rotations of a cube it's not you can't
 

5255
01:34:45,469 --> 01:34:47,049
rotations of a cube it's not you can't
think of it quite that way but it's sort

5256
01:34:47,049 --> 01:34:47,059
think of it quite that way but it's sort
 

5257
01:34:47,059 --> 01:34:49,390
think of it quite that way but it's sort
of a similar sort of idea and you say

5258
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:49,400
of a similar sort of idea and you say
 

5259
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:50,620
of a similar sort of idea and you say
okay if the universe respects the

5260
01:34:50,620 --> 01:34:50,630
okay if the universe respects the
 

5261
01:34:50,630 --> 01:34:52,899
okay if the universe respects the
symmetry you find that you have to

5262
01:34:52,899 --> 01:34:52,909
symmetry you find that you have to
 

5263
01:34:52,909 --> 01:34:55,240
symmetry you find that you have to
introduce a force which has the

5264
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:55,250
introduce a force which has the
 

5265
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:58,000
introduce a force which has the
properties of electromagnetism or

5266
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:58,010
properties of electromagnetism or
 

5267
01:34:58,010 --> 01:34:59,589
properties of electromagnetism or
different symmetry you get the strong

5268
01:34:59,589 --> 01:34:59,599
different symmetry you get the strong
 

5269
01:34:59,599 --> 01:35:00,939
different symmetry you get the strong
force or a different symmetry you get

5270
01:35:00,939 --> 01:35:00,949
force or a different symmetry you get
 

5271
01:35:00,949 --> 01:35:02,740
force or a different symmetry you get
the weak force so these interactions

5272
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:02,750
the weak force so these interactions
 

5273
01:35:02,750 --> 01:35:05,200
the weak force so these interactions
seem to come from some deeper it

5274
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:05,210
seem to come from some deeper it
 

5275
01:35:05,210 --> 01:35:06,790
seem to come from some deeper it
suggests that they come from some deeper

5276
01:35:06,790 --> 01:35:06,800
suggests that they come from some deeper
 

5277
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:09,069
suggests that they come from some deeper
symmetry principle I mean depends a bit

5278
01:35:09,069 --> 01:35:09,079
symmetry principle I mean depends a bit
 

5279
01:35:09,079 --> 01:35:09,650
symmetry principle I mean depends a bit
how you look at it

5280
01:35:09,650 --> 01:35:09,660
how you look at it
 

5281
01:35:09,660 --> 01:35:10,520
how you look at it
cuz it could be that we were actually

5282
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:10,530
cuz it could be that we were actually
 

5283
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:12,440
cuz it could be that we were actually
just recognizing symmetries in fact as

5284
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:12,450
just recognizing symmetries in fact as
 

5285
01:35:12,450 --> 01:35:13,610
just recognizing symmetries in fact as
you see but there's something rather

5286
01:35:13,610 --> 01:35:13,620
you see but there's something rather
 

5287
01:35:13,620 --> 01:35:15,800
you see but there's something rather
lovely about that but I mean I suppose a

5288
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:15,810
lovely about that but I mean I suppose a
 

5289
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:17,150
lovely about that but I mean I suppose a
bigger thing that makes me wonder is

5290
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:17,160
bigger thing that makes me wonder is
 

5291
01:35:17,160 --> 01:35:19,520
bigger thing that makes me wonder is
actually if you look at the laws of

5292
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:19,530
actually if you look at the laws of
 

5293
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:21,560
actually if you look at the laws of
nature how particles interacts when you

5294
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:21,570
nature how particles interacts when you
 

5295
01:35:21,570 --> 01:35:23,240
nature how particles interacts when you
get really close down they're basically

5296
01:35:23,240 --> 01:35:23,250
get really close down they're basically
 

5297
01:35:23,250 --> 01:35:24,890
get really close down they're basically
pretty simple things they bounce off

5298
01:35:24,890 --> 01:35:24,900
pretty simple things they bounce off
 

5299
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:26,330
pretty simple things they bounce off
each other by exchanging you know

5300
01:35:26,330 --> 01:35:26,340
each other by exchanging you know
 

5301
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:27,440
each other by exchanging you know
through force fields and they move

5302
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:27,450
through force fields and they move
 

5303
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:29,830
through force fields and they move
around in very simple ways and somehow

5304
01:35:29,830 --> 01:35:29,840
around in very simple ways and somehow
 

5305
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:32,270
around in very simple ways and somehow
these basic ingredients these few

5306
01:35:32,270 --> 01:35:32,280
these basic ingredients these few
 

5307
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:33,380
these basic ingredients these few
particles that we know about and the

5308
01:35:33,380 --> 01:35:33,390
particles that we know about and the
 

5309
01:35:33,390 --> 01:35:35,900
particles that we know about and the
forces creates this universe which is

01:35:35,900 --> 01:35:35,910
forces creates this universe which is
 

5311
01:35:35,910 --> 01:35:38,540
forces creates this universe which is
unbelievably complicated and has things

5312
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:38,550
unbelievably complicated and has things
 

5313
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,520
unbelievably complicated and has things
like you and me in it and you know the

01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:40,530
like you and me in it and you know the
 

5315
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:42,710
like you and me in it and you know the
earth and stars that make matter in

5316
01:35:42,710 --> 01:35:42,720
earth and stars that make matter in
 

5317

that forms other things I mean the fact
 

5325
01:35:49,500 --> 01:35:52,220
that forms other things I mean the fact
that there's this incredibly long story

5326
01:35:52,220 --> 01:35:52,230
that there's this incredibly long story
 

5327
01:35:52,230 --> 01:35:55,430
that there's this incredibly long story
that goes right back to you know the big

01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:55,440
that goes right back to you know the big
 

5329
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,020
that goes right back to you know the big
it we can we can take the story right

01:35:57,020 --> 01:35:57,030
it we can we can take the story right
 

5331
01:35:57,030 --> 01:35:58,340
it we can we can take the story right
back to you know a trillionth of a

second after the Big Bang we can trace

5334
01:35:59,930 --> 01:35:59,940
second after the Big Bang we can trace
 

5335
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:01,640
second after the Big Bang we can trace
the origins of the stuff that we're made

5336
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:01,650
the origins of the stuff that we're made
 

5337
01:36:01,650 --> 01:36:03,860
the origins of the stuff that we're made
from and it altum Utley comes from these

5338
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:03,870
from and it altum Utley comes from these
 

5339
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:05,630

simple ingredients with these simple

01:36:05,630 --> 01:36:05,640
simple ingredients with these simple
 

5341
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,730
simple ingredients with these simple
rules and the fact you can generate such

5342
01:36:07,730 --> 01:36:07,740
rules and the fact you can generate such
 

5343
01:36:07,740 --> 01:36:09,200
rules and the fact you can generate such
complexity from that is really

5344
01:36:09,200 --> 01:36:09,210
complexity from that is really
 

5345
01:36:09,210 --> 01:36:11,720
complexity from that is really
mysterious I think and strange and it's

5346
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:11,730
mysterious I think and strange and it's
 

5347
01:36:11,730 --> 01:36:13,010
mysterious I think and strange and it's
not even a question that physicists can

5348
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:13,020
not even a question that physicists can
 

5349
01:36:13,020 --> 01:36:15,500
not even a question that physicists can
really tackle because we are sort of

5350
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:15,510
really tackle because we are sort of
 

5351
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,450
really tackle because we are sort of
trying to find these really elementary

5352
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:17,460
trying to find these really elementary
 

5353
01:36:17,460 --> 01:36:20,600
trying to find these really elementary
laws but it turns out that going from

5354
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:20,610
laws but it turns out that going from
 

5355
01:36:20,610 --> 01:36:22,820
laws but it turns out that going from
elementary laws and a few particles to

5356
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:22,830
elementary laws and a few particles to
 

5357
01:36:22,830 --> 01:36:24,110
elementary laws and a few particles to
something even as complicated as a

5358
01:36:24,110 --> 01:36:24,120
something even as complicated as a
 

5359
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:26,750
something even as complicated as a
molecule becomes very difficult and so

5360
01:36:26,750 --> 01:36:26,760
molecule becomes very difficult and so
 

5361
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:28,070
molecule becomes very difficult and so
going from a molecule to a human being

5362
01:36:28,070 --> 01:36:28,080
going from a molecule to a human being
 

5363
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:30,830
going from a molecule to a human being
is a problem that just you know can't be

5364
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:30,840
is a problem that just you know can't be
 

5365
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:32,510
is a problem that just you know can't be
can't be tackled at least not at the

5366
01:36:32,510 --> 01:36:32,520
can't be tackled at least not at the
 

5367
01:36:32,520 --> 01:36:32,960
can't be tackled at least not at the
moment

5368
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:32,970
moment
 

5369
01:36:32,970 --> 01:36:36,110
moment
so yeah the emergence of complexity from

5370
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:36,120
so yeah the emergence of complexity from
 

5371
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:39,710
so yeah the emergence of complexity from
simple rules is so beautiful and so

5372
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:39,720
simple rules is so beautiful and so
 

5373
01:36:39,720 --> 01:36:42,320
simple rules is so beautiful and so
mysterious and there's not either we

5374
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:42,330
mysterious and there's not either we
 

5375
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:44,060
mysterious and there's not either we
don't have good mathematics to even try

5376
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:44,070
don't have good mathematics to even try
 

5377
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:46,820
don't have good mathematics to even try
to approach that emergent phenomena

5378
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:46,830
to approach that emergent phenomena
 

5379
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:48,470
to approach that emergent phenomena
that's why we have chemistry and biology

5380
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:48,480
that's why we have chemistry and biology
 

5381
01:36:48,480 --> 01:36:52,190
that's why we have chemistry and biology
and other subjects as well yeah I don't

5382
01:36:52,190 --> 01:36:52,200
and other subjects as well yeah I don't
 

5383
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:54,320
and other subjects as well yeah I don't
think I don't think there's a better way

5384
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:54,330
think I don't think there's a better way
 

5385
01:36:54,330 --> 01:36:57,770
think I don't think there's a better way
to end it Harry I can't I mean I think I

5386
01:36:57,770 --> 01:36:57,780
to end it Harry I can't I mean I think I
 

5387
01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:00,800
to end it Harry I can't I mean I think I
speak for a lot of people that can't

5388
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:00,810
speak for a lot of people that can't
 

5389
01:37:00,810 --> 01:37:02,570
speak for a lot of people that can't
wait to see what happens in the next 5

5390
01:37:02,570 --> 01:37:02,580
wait to see what happens in the next 5
 

5391
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:04,430
wait to see what happens in the next 5
10 20 years with you I think you're one

5392
01:37:04,430 --> 01:37:04,440
10 20 years with you I think you're one
 

5393
01:37:04,440 --> 01:37:06,020
10 20 years with you I think you're one
of the great communicators of our time

5394
01:37:06,020 --> 01:37:06,030
of the great communicators of our time
 

5395
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:08,870
of the great communicators of our time
so I hope you continue that and I hope

5396
01:37:08,870 --> 01:37:08,880
so I hope you continue that and I hope
 

5397
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:10,750
so I hope you continue that and I hope
that grows and um

5398
01:37:10,750 --> 01:37:10,760
that grows and um
 

5399
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:12,980
that grows and um
definitely a huge fan so it was an honor
