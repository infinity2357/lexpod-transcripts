there i thought the flying was really

there i thought the flying was really

accurate i thought the the type of
 

83
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,030
accurate i thought the the type of
flying they did and how they approached

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:29,040
flying they did and how they approached
 

85

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,270
the actual mission
um of course had a lot of liberties

88
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:33,280
um of course had a lot of liberties
 

89
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,950
um of course had a lot of liberties
but one thing that seems to be hard to

90
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:34,960
but one thing that seems to be hard to
 

91
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,710
but one thing that seems to be hard to
capture on these types of things are the

92
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:36,720
capture on these types of things are the
 

93
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,469
capture on these types of things are the
the chess game that's going on while

the chess game that's going on while
 

95
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,390
the chess game that's going on while
that type of flying is happening the

96
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:40,400
that type of flying is happening the
 

97
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,749
that type of flying is happening the
chess game between

98
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:41,759
chess game between
 

99
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,389
chess game between
like in a dogfight between the the the

100
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:44,399
like in a dogfight between the the the
 

101
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,230
like in a dogfight between the the the
pilots and the enemy or between the

102
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,240
pilots and the enemy or between the
 

103
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,469
pilots and the enemy or between the
different pilots i'll even speak to just

104
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:48,479
different pilots i'll even speak to just
 

105
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,149
different pilots i'll even speak to just
that particular mission they flew there

106
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:50,159
that particular mission they flew there
 

107
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:50,789
that particular mission they flew there
and

108
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:50,799
and
 

109
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,630
and
for that particular mission it's kind of

110
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:52,640
for that particular mission it's kind of
 

111
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,510
for that particular mission it's kind of
a chess game with yourself to to get

112
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:55,520
a chess game with yourself to to get
 

113
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,429
a chess game with yourself to to get
everything in place so

114
00:01:57,429 --> 00:01:57,439
everything in place so
 

115
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,350
everything in place so
what kind of flight they flew is called

116
00:01:59,350 --> 00:01:59,360
what kind of flight they flew is called
 

117
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,429
what kind of flight they flew is called
a high threat scenario which means they

118
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:01,439
a high threat scenario which means they
 

119
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,910
a high threat scenario which means they
uh have to ingress low due to uh the

120
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:03,920
uh have to ingress low due to uh the
 

121
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,429
uh have to ingress low due to uh the
surface-to-air threats that integrate

122
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
surface-to-air threats that integrate
 

123
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,990
surface-to-air threats that integrate
air defense systems that are nearby and

124
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:08,000
air defense systems that are nearby and
 

125
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,669
air defense systems that are nearby and
they have to ingress low and pop up like

126
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:09,679
they have to ingress low and pop up like
 

127
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,190
they have to ingress low and pop up like
we see in the movie

128
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:11,200
we see in the movie
 

129
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,630
we see in the movie
and in that particular movie that was a

130
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:12,640
and in that particular movie that was a
 

131
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,309
and in that particular movie that was a
pre-planned strike they knew exactly

132
00:02:14,309 --> 00:02:14,319
pre-planned strike they knew exactly
 

133
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,830
pre-planned strike they knew exactly
where they're going but there's a

134
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:15,840
where they're going but there's a
 

135
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,589
where they're going but there's a
scenario where we have to operate in

136
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:17,599
scenario where we have to operate in
 

137
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,949
scenario where we have to operate in
that type of environment and we don't

138
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:18,959
that type of environment and we don't
 

139
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,550
that type of environment and we don't
know exactly where we're going to strike

140
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:20,560
know exactly where we're going to strike
 

141
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,830
know exactly where we're going to strike
or we're going to be adapting to

142
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:21,840
or we're going to be adapting to
 

143
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,070
or we're going to be adapting to
real-time targets and so in that

144
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
real-time targets and so in that
 

145
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,430
real-time targets and so in that
scenario you would have one of those

146
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,440
scenario you would have one of those
 

147
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,430
scenario you would have one of those
fighters down low like that operating as

148
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:27,440
fighters down low like that operating as
 

149
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,350
fighters down low like that operating as
a mission commander as a forward air

150
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:29,360
a mission commander as a forward air
 

151
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,270
a mission commander as a forward air
controller and he's out there calling

152
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:31,280
controller and he's out there calling
 

153
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,509
controller and he's out there calling
shots joining on those other players in

154
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:33,519
shots joining on those other players in
 

155
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,949
shots joining on those other players in
order to ensure they're pointed at the

156
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:34,959
order to ensure they're pointed at the
 

157
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,790
order to ensure they're pointed at the
right target so so that's a bit of the

158
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:36,800
right target so so that's a bit of the
 

159
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,630
right target so so that's a bit of the
chess game that he'll be playing

160
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:38,640
chess game that he'll be playing
 

161
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,070
chess game that he'll be playing
can you actually describe for people who

162
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:40,080
can you actually describe for people who
 

163
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,750
can you actually describe for people who
haven't seen the movie uh what the

164
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:41,760
haven't seen the movie uh what the
 

165
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,390
haven't seen the movie uh what the
mission actually is yeah what's involved

166
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:44,400
mission actually is yeah what's involved
 

167
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,830
mission actually is yeah what's involved
in the mission so

168
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
in the mission so
 

169
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,670
in the mission so
in this particular mission it's kind of

170
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:47,680
in this particular mission it's kind of
 

171
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,350
in this particular mission it's kind of
what we would call a pre-planned strike

172
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,360
what we would call a pre-planned strike
 

173
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,509
what we would call a pre-planned strike
so there's a known location that's in a

174
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:51,519
so there's a known location that's in a
 

175
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,509
so there's a known location that's in a
heavily defended area

176
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:53,519
heavily defended area
 

177
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,750
heavily defended area
and the air crew in this case i believe

178
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
and the air crew in this case i believe
 

179
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,350
and the air crew in this case i believe
it was four f-18s on the initial package

180
00:02:59,350 --> 00:02:59,360
it was four f-18s on the initial package
 

181
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,750
it was four f-18s on the initial package
their job was to ingress very low down a

182
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:01,760
their job was to ingress very low down a
 

183
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,229
their job was to ingress very low down a
canyon to stay out of the radar window

184
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:04,239
canyon to stay out of the radar window
 

185
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,470
canyon to stay out of the radar window
of the surfs to air threats what does

186
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:06,480
of the surfs to air threats what does
 

187
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,710
of the surfs to air threats what does
ingress mean ingress means that they're

188
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:08,720
ingress mean ingress means that they're
 

189
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,149
ingress mean ingress means that they're
going to be pushing from a start

190
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:10,159
going to be pushing from a start
 

191
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,149
going to be pushing from a start
location towards the target or the

192
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:12,159
location towards the target or the
 

193
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,390
location towards the target or the
objective so there's an ingress portion

194
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
objective so there's an ingress portion
 

195
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,910
objective so there's an ingress portion
of the mission and an egress portion of

196
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:15,920
of the mission and an egress portion of
 

197
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,589
of the mission and an egress portion of
the mission oh

198
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
the mission oh
 

199
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,149
the mission oh
okay uh like the entrance and the exit

200
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
okay uh like the entrance and the exit
 

201
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,070
okay uh like the entrance and the exit
correct type of thing got it but it

202
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:22,080
correct type of thing got it but it
 

203
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,670
correct type of thing got it but it
changes our mindset tactically quite a

204
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:23,680
changes our mindset tactically quite a
 

205
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,430
changes our mindset tactically quite a
bit right because when we're entering

206
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:25,440
bit right because when we're entering
 

207
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,750
bit right because when we're entering
some place we have the option to enter

208
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
some place we have the option to enter
 

209
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,830
some place we have the option to enter
but when we go drop a bomb on location

210
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:29,840
but when we go drop a bomb on location
 

211
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,190
but when we go drop a bomb on location
we're exiting

212
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,200
we're exiting
 

213
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,030
we're exiting
we don't have that luxury we don't have

214
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,040
we don't have that luxury we don't have
 

215
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,789
we don't have that luxury we don't have
that option so it actually changes our

216
00:03:34,789 --> 00:03:34,799
that option so it actually changes our
 

217
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,350
that option so it actually changes our
tactics and our aggression level

218
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,360
tactics and our aggression level
 

219
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,509
tactics and our aggression level
got it and so they were flying low to

220
00:03:39,509 --> 00:03:39,519
got it and so they were flying low to
 

221
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,750
got it and so they were flying low to
the ground and then there's a

222
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:41,760
the ground and then there's a
 

223
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,830
the ground and then there's a
surface-to-air missiles

224
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:43,840
surface-to-air missiles
 

225
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,270
surface-to-air missiles
that

226
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:45,280
that
 

227
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,509
that
forced them to have to fly low is that a

228
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:47,519
forced them to have to fly low is that a
 

229
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,830
forced them to have to fly low is that a
realistic thing it is realistic so

230
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:49,840
realistic thing it is realistic so
 

231
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,149
realistic thing it is realistic so
driving those aircraft in the clutter uh

232
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:52,159
driving those aircraft in the clutter uh
 

233
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:52,949
driving those aircraft in the clutter uh
you know

234
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:52,959
you know
 

235
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,789
you know
all radar systems or most i should say

236
00:03:54,789 --> 00:03:54,799
all radar systems or most i should say
 

237
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,429
all radar systems or most i should say
are essentially line of sight and so

238
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:57,439
are essentially line of sight and so
 

239
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,190
are essentially line of sight and so
they can be limited by the horizon or

240
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,200
they can be limited by the horizon or
 

241
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,750
they can be limited by the horizon or
any clutter out there and even a number

242
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
any clutter out there and even a number
 

243
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,750
any clutter out there and even a number
of radars if they are located up high

244
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
of radars if they are located up high
 

245
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,550
of radars if they are located up high
and looking down towards that aircraft

246
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:06,560
and looking down towards that aircraft
 

247
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,030
and looking down towards that aircraft
the clutter all the uh the objects such

248
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
the clutter all the uh the objects such
 

249
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,350
the clutter all the uh the objects such
as trees and canyons

250
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:11,360
as trees and canyons
 

251
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,589
as trees and canyons
can have effect on radar systems and so

252
00:04:13,589 --> 00:04:13,599
can have effect on radar systems and so
 

253
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,069
can have effect on radar systems and so
it can be a type of camouflage

254
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
it can be a type of camouflage
 

255
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,749
it can be a type of camouflage
so that's the camouflage for the radar

256
00:04:17,749 --> 00:04:17,759
so that's the camouflage for the radar
 

257
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:18,949
so that's the camouflage for the radar
but what about

258
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:18,959
but what about
 

259
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,030
but what about
the surface air missile

260
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
the surface air missile
 

261
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,430
the surface air missile
is that is that a legitimate way to

262
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:23,440
is that is that a legitimate way to
 

263
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,310
is that is that a legitimate way to
avoid missiles flies so low like fly i

264
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:26,320
avoid missiles flies so low like fly i
 

265
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,110
avoid missiles flies so low like fly i
guess below their uh

266
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
guess below their uh
 

267
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,870
guess below their uh
their level

268
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
their level
 

269
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,629
their level
as far as i know you know you can fly

270
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:32,639
as far as i know you know you can fly
 

271
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,310
as far as i know you know you can fly
under any radar right now

272
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
under any radar right now
 

273
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,310
under any radar right now
we don't have necessarily radars that

274
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:36,320
we don't have necessarily radars that
 

275
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,710
we don't have necessarily radars that
can look through anything so there is

276
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:38,720
can look through anything so there is
 

277
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,150
can look through anything so there is
always going to be the ability to mask

278
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,160
always going to be the ability to mask
 

279
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,510
always going to be the ability to mask
yourself

280
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:41,520
yourself
 

281
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,430
yourself
but with a larger number of assets and

282
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
but with a larger number of assets and
 

283
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,749
but with a larger number of assets and
distributed communication networks where

284
00:04:45,749 --> 00:04:45,759
distributed communication networks where
 

285
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,909
distributed communication networks where
those radars are looking makes all the

286
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
those radars are looking makes all the
 

287
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,430
those radars are looking makes all the
difference and i said they are

288
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
difference and i said they are
 

289
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,270
difference and i said they are
ingressing pass in is and that's an

290
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
ingressing pass in is and that's an
 

291
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,270
ingressing pass in is and that's an
integrated air defense system and that

292
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
integrated air defense system and that
 

293
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,550
integrated air defense system and that
linking of

294
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:54,560
linking of
 

295
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,350
linking of
air defense systems is what makes it um

296
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
air defense systems is what makes it um
 

297
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,189
air defense systems is what makes it um
so hard so complicated is that the

298
00:04:59,189 --> 00:04:59,199
so hard so complicated is that the
 

299
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,790
so hard so complicated is that the
sensors and the weapons are

300
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:00,800
sensors and the weapons are
 

301
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,110
sensors and the weapons are
disassociated from each other so that if

302
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:03,120
disassociated from each other so that if
 

303
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,870
disassociated from each other so that if
you took out the target that was

304
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:04,880
you took out the target that was
 

305
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,029
you took out the target that was
shooting at you it still has the ability

306
00:05:07,029 --> 00:05:07,039
shooting at you it still has the ability
 

307
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,670
shooting at you it still has the ability
to um to intercept you from another

308
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:09,680
to um to intercept you from another
 

309
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,350
to um to intercept you from another
radar location

310
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,360
radar location
 

311
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,590
radar location
so it's distributed and it's stronger

312
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:13,600
so it's distributed and it's stronger
 

313
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,790
so it's distributed and it's stronger
that way

314
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
that way
 

315
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,590
that way
you mean the the surface-to-air missiles

316
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:17,600
you mean the the surface-to-air missiles
 

317
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,590
you mean the the surface-to-air missiles
if you like it's a

318
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
if you like it's a
 

319
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,029
if you like it's a
it's a distributed system and that if

320
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,039
it's a distributed system and that if
 

321
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,550
it's a distributed system and that if
you take out one

322
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:22,560
you take out one
 

323
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,629
you take out one
they're still able to

324
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,639
they're still able to
 

325
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,310
they're still able to
sort of integrate information about your

326
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:26,320
sort of integrate information about your
 

327
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,790
sort of integrate information about your
location and strike at you correct and

328
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:28,800
location and strike at you correct and
 

329
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,310
location and strike at you correct and
there's a lot of complication that can

330
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,320
there's a lot of complication that can
 

331
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,990
there's a lot of complication that can
go you know once we start thinking about

332
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:32,000
go you know once we start thinking about
 

333
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,670
go you know once we start thinking about
distributed systems like that and the

334
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:33,680
distributed systems like that and the
 

335
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,749
distributed systems like that and the
ability to self-heal and repair and

336
00:05:35,749 --> 00:05:35,759
ability to self-heal and repair and
 

337
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,510
ability to self-heal and repair and
adapt to

338
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,520
adapt to
 

339
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,390
adapt to
losses

340
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:38,400
losses
 

341
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,230
losses
it's an interesting area are you

342
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
it's an interesting area are you
 

343
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,830
it's an interesting area are you
responsible for thinking about that when

344
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
responsible for thinking about that when
 

345
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,029
responsible for thinking about that when
you're flying an airplane to some degree

346
00:05:45,029 --> 00:05:45,039
you're flying an airplane to some degree
 

347
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,870
you're flying an airplane to some degree
when we ingress to an area like that

348
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:46,880
when we ingress to an area like that
 

349
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,390
when we ingress to an area like that
we're presented with

350
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:48,400
we're presented with
 

351
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,710
we're presented with
information about targets air to air or

352
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:50,720
information about targets air to air or
 

353
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,029
information about targets air to air or
air to surface or surface to air i

354
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:53,039
air to surface or surface to air i
 

355
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,070
air to surface or surface to air i
should say

356
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,080
should say
 

357
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,110
should say
and we can essentially see where

358
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:57,120
and we can essentially see where
 

359
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,110
and we can essentially see where
essentially the danger zone if you will

360
00:05:59,110 --> 00:05:59,120
essentially the danger zone if you will
 

361
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,550
essentially the danger zone if you will
is located

362
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:00,560
is located
 

363
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,990
is located
and so essentially we would stay out of

364
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:02,000
and so essentially we would stay out of
 

365
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,110
and so essentially we would stay out of
that and so having a full picture of

366
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,120
that and so having a full picture of
 

367
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,710
that and so having a full picture of
the environment is extremely important

368
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:06,720
the environment is extremely important
 

369
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,309
the environment is extremely important
because you know at the end of the day

370
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:08,319
because you know at the end of the day
 

371
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,749
because you know at the end of the day
if we go in that circle we can die

372
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:09,759
if we go in that circle we can die
 

373
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,270
if we go in that circle we can die
pretty quickly so

374
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:11,280
pretty quickly so
 

375
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,110
pretty quickly so
it's absolutely crucial so there's

376
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:13,120
it's absolutely crucial so there's
 

377
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,110
it's absolutely crucial so there's
regions that have higher and lower

378
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:15,120
regions that have higher and lower
 

379
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,150
regions that have higher and lower
danger

380
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:16,160
danger
 

381
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,430
danger
based on your understanding of the

382
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,440
based on your understanding of the
 

383
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,430
based on your understanding of the
actual whatever the the the the

384
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,440
actual whatever the the the the
 

385
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,990
actual whatever the the the the
surface-to-air missile systems are so

386
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:22,000
surface-to-air missile systems are so
 

387
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,990
surface-to-air missile systems are so
you can kind of know

388
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,000
you can kind of know
 

389
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,510
you can kind of know
that's interesting i wonder how

390
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:25,520
that's interesting i wonder how
 

391
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,270
that's interesting i wonder how
automated that could be too especially

392
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:27,280
automated that could be too especially
 

393
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,189
automated that could be too especially
when you don't know

394
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:29,199
when you don't know
 

395
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,790
when you don't know
it seems like in the movie they knew the

396
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
it seems like in the movie they knew the
 

397
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,469
it seems like in the movie they knew the
location of everything

398
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:32,479
location of everything
 

399
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,230
location of everything
um i imagine that's less known in most

400
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,240
um i imagine that's less known in most
 

401
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,350
um i imagine that's less known in most
cases

402
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
cases
 

403
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,629
cases
and also

404
00:06:38,629 --> 00:06:38,639
and also
 

405
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,230
and also
a lot of those systems might be a little

406
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,240
a lot of those systems might be a little
 

407
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,270
a lot of those systems might be a little
bit more

408
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,280
bit more
 

409
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,430
bit more
ghetto if i can use that technical term

410
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,440
ghetto if i can use that technical term
 

411
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,710
ghetto if i can use that technical term
like um i've gotten uh ad hoc maybe is

412
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:46,720
like um i've gotten uh ad hoc maybe is
 

413
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,390
like um i've gotten uh ad hoc maybe is
the uh

414
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:48,400
the uh
 

415
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,950
the uh
i don't know but you know having uh just

416
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
i don't know but you know having uh just
 

417
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,550
i don't know but you know having uh just
recently visited ukraine and seeing a

418
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:52,560
recently visited ukraine and seeing a
 

419
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,390
recently visited ukraine and seeing a
lot of aspects of the way that war is

420
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:54,400
lot of aspects of the way that war is
 

421
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,950
lot of aspects of the way that war is
fought there's a lot of improvised type

422
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:56,960
fought there's a lot of improvised type
 

423
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,350
fought there's a lot of improvised type
of systems so you take height

424
00:06:59,350 --> 00:06:59,360
of systems so you take height
 

425
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,670
of systems so you take height
uh high-tech like advanced technology

426
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:01,680
uh high-tech like advanced technology
 

427
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,270
uh high-tech like advanced technology
but the way you deploy it and the way

428
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:03,280
but the way you deploy it and the way
 

429
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,189
but the way you deploy it and the way
you organize it is very

430
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
you organize it is very
 

431
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,469
you organize it is very
improvised and ad hoc and is responding

432
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:08,479
improvised and ad hoc and is responding
 

433
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,230
improvised and ad hoc and is responding
to the uncertainty in the dynamic

434
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:10,240
to the uncertainty in the dynamic
 

435
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,230
to the uncertainty in the dynamic
environment and so

436
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,240
environment and so
 

437
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,469
environment and so
from an enemy perspective or whoever is

438
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:14,479
from an enemy perspective or whoever is
 

439
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,550
from an enemy perspective or whoever is
trying to deal with that kind of system

440
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:16,560
trying to deal with that kind of system
 

441
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,309
trying to deal with that kind of system
it's hard to figure it out because uh

442
00:07:18,309 --> 00:07:18,319
it's hard to figure it out because uh
 

443
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,830
it's hard to figure it out because uh
it's like me

444
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
it's like me
 

445
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,909
it's like me
i played tennis for a long time

446
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:21,919
i played tennis for a long time
 

447
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,150
i played tennis for a long time
and it's always easier to play this is

448
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,160
and it's always easier to play this is
 

449
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,230
and it's always easier to play this is
true for all sports uh play tennis

450
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:26,240
true for all sports uh play tennis
 

451
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,589
true for all sports uh play tennis
against a good tennis player versus a

452
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:27,599
against a good tennis player versus a
 

453
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,950
against a good tennis player versus a
crappy tennis

454
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:28,960
crappy tennis
 

455
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,629
crappy tennis
because the crappy tennis player is full

456
00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:30,639
because the crappy tennis player is full
 

457
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,909
because the crappy tennis player is full
of uncertainty

458
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:31,919
of uncertainty
 

459
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,909
of uncertainty
uh and that's really difficult to deal

460
00:07:33,909 --> 00:07:33,919
uh and that's really difficult to deal
 

461
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,510
uh and that's really difficult to deal
with it seemed like in the movie the

462
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:35,520
with it seemed like in the movie the
 

463
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,390
with it seemed like in the movie the
systems were really well organized

464
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
systems were really well organized
 

465
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,029
systems were really well organized
uh and so you could plan and there's a

466
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:41,039
uh and so you could plan and there's a
 

467
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,309
uh and so you could plan and there's a
very nice ravine that went right down

468
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
very nice ravine that went right down
 

469
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,990
very nice ravine that went right down
the middle of them that's how movies

470
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,000
the middle of them that's how movies
 

471
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,869
the middle of them that's how movies
work isn't it yeah but no i i absolutely

472
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:46,879
work isn't it yeah but no i i absolutely
 

473
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,589
work isn't it yeah but no i i absolutely
agree so you know um what you say is is

474
00:07:49,589 --> 00:07:49,599
agree so you know um what you say is is
 

475
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,670
agree so you know um what you say is is
a very good point and as you know if we

476
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:51,680
a very good point and as you know if we
 

477
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,430
a very good point and as you know if we
were to take a a

478
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:53,440
were to take a a
 

479
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,350
were to take a a
a chunk of airspace and break it up into

480
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,360
a chunk of airspace and break it up into
 

481
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,869
a chunk of airspace and break it up into
little bits you know there'd be places

482
00:07:56,869 --> 00:07:56,879
little bits you know there'd be places
 

483
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,110
little bits you know there'd be places
that are better to fly or less less good

484
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,120
that are better to fly or less less good
 

485
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,150
that are better to fly or less less good
to fly

486
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,160
to fly
 

487
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,270
to fly
um and

488
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:01,280
um and
 

489
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,629
um and
you know we are seeing that now with

490
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:02,639
you know we are seeing that now with
 

491
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,869
you know we are seeing that now with
what they call manned unmanned teaming

00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,040
own blue fighters won't be able to
 

657
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,550
own blue fighters won't be able to
engage in that fight because it would it

658
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:42,560
engage in that fight because it would it
 

659
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,790
engage in that fight because it would it
would be unsafe essentially for anything

660
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:44,800
would be unsafe essentially for anything
 

661
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,790
would be unsafe essentially for anything
else uh and i think that's where we have

662
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:46,800
else uh and i think that's where we have
 

663
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,230
else uh and i think that's where we have
to drive to because otherwise it's

664
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
to drive to because otherwise it's
 

665
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,670
to drive to because otherwise it's
always this chicken and mouse cat game

666
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:49,680
always this chicken and mouse cat game
 

667
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,750
always this chicken and mouse cat game
about whose tactics and who knows what

668
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:51,760
about whose tactics and who knows what
 

669
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,150
about whose tactics and who knows what
but if knowledge is no longer a factor

670
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,160
but if knowledge is no longer a factor
 

671
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,829
but if knowledge is no longer a factor
um it's gonna make things a lot

672
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
um it's gonna make things a lot
 

673
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,389
um it's gonna make things a lot
different that's really interesting so

674
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
different that's really interesting so
 

675
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,870
different that's really interesting so
out of the many things

676
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:00,880
out of the many things
 

677
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,829
out of the many things
uh that are part of your expertise your

678
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
uh that are part of your expertise your
 

679
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,069
uh that are part of your expertise your
your journey you're also working on

680
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:06,079
your journey you're also working on
 

681
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,069
your journey you're also working on
autonomous and semi-autonomous systems

682
00:11:08,069 --> 00:11:08,079
autonomous and semi-autonomous systems
 

683
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,069
autonomous and semi-autonomous systems
the use of ai and machine learning and

684
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
the use of ai and machine learning and
 

685
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,829
the use of ai and machine learning and
uh man-to-man teaming all that kind of

686
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:11,839
uh man-to-man teaming all that kind of
 

687
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,910
uh man-to-man teaming all that kind of
stuff we'll talk about it

688
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
stuff we'll talk about it
 

689
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,829
stuff we'll talk about it
but you're saying

690
00:11:15,829 --> 00:11:15,839
but you're saying
 

691
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,190
but you're saying
sort of when people think about the use

692
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,200
sort of when people think about the use
 

693
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,269
sort of when people think about the use
of ai in war

694
00:11:19,269 --> 00:11:19,279
of ai in war
 

695
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,110
of ai in war
in military systems they think about

696
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
in military systems they think about
 

697
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,990
in military systems they think about
like

698
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:22,000
like
 

699
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,710
like
computer vision for perception or

700
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:24,720
computer vision for perception or
 

701
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,710
computer vision for perception or
processing of sensor information in

702
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:26,720
processing of sensor information in
 

703
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,190
processing of sensor information in
order to extract from it actionable

704
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:29,200
order to extract from it actionable
 

705
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,630
order to extract from it actionable
knowledge kind of thing but you're

706
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:30,640
knowledge kind of thing but you're
 

707
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,910
knowledge kind of thing but you're
saying you could also use it to generate

708
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:33,920
saying you could also use it to generate
 

709
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,630
saying you could also use it to generate
randomness that's difficult

710
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:36,640
randomness that's difficult
 

711
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,269
randomness that's difficult
to work with in a like a game theoretic

712
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:39,279
to work with in a like a game theoretic
 

713
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,110
to work with in a like a game theoretic
way like it's difficult to respo for

714
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:41,120
way like it's difficult to respo for
 

715
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,230
way like it's difficult to respo for
human operators to respond to exactly

716
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
human operators to respond to exactly
 

717
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,870
human operators to respond to exactly
that's really interesting okay so

718
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:46,880
that's really interesting okay so
 

719
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,509
that's really interesting okay so
back back to tom cruise and top gun

720
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
back back to tom cruise and top gun
 

721
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,509
back back to tom cruise and top gun
what about the dog fighting uh what

722
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
what about the dog fighting uh what
 

723
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,910
what about the dog fighting uh what
aspects of that were accurate so dog

724
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:53,920
aspects of that were accurate so dog
 

725
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,350
aspects of that were accurate so dog
fighting is kind of uh an interesting

726
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:57,360
fighting is kind of uh an interesting
 

727
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,949
fighting is kind of uh an interesting
conversation because it's not the most

728
00:11:58,949 --> 00:11:58,959
conversation because it's not the most
 

729
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,910
conversation because it's not the most
tactically relevant skill set nowadays

730
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:01,920
tactically relevant skill set nowadays
 

731
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,150
tactically relevant skill set nowadays
uh by traditional standards because the

732
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
uh by traditional standards because the
 

733
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,069
uh by traditional standards because the
the ranges with which we engage and

734
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:06,079
the ranges with which we engage and
 

735
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,750
the ranges with which we engage and
employ weapons are very

736
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
employ weapons are very
 

737
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,310
employ weapons are very
uh significant uh and so if we're in a

738
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:10,320
uh significant uh and so if we're in a
 

739
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,710
uh significant uh and so if we're in a
scenario we're in a dog fight like that

740
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:12,720
scenario we're in a dog fight like that
 

741
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,829
scenario we're in a dog fight like that
um

742
00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:13,839
um
 

743
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,269
um
a lot of things have probably gone wrong

744
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:15,279
a lot of things have probably gone wrong
 

745
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,710
a lot of things have probably gone wrong
right and that's kind of how this

746
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:16,720
right and that's kind of how this
 

747
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,550
right and that's kind of how this
mission was set up right it was a you

748
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:18,560
mission was set up right it was a you
 

749
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,030
mission was set up right it was a you
know a no-win type scenario most likely

750
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,040
know a no-win type scenario most likely
 

751
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,590
know a no-win type scenario most likely
um and so for a dog fight the aircraft

752
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:23,600
um and so for a dog fight the aircraft
 

753
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,949
um and so for a dog fight the aircraft
size and the ranges and the turn

754
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
size and the ranges and the turn
 

755
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,710
size and the ranges and the turn
radiuses make it so it's not very

756
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:26,720
radiuses make it so it's not very
 

757
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,710
radiuses make it so it's not very
theatrical right the aircraft looks

758
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
theatrical right the aircraft looks
 

759
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,629
theatrical right the aircraft looks
small and while it's intense with the

760
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
small and while it's intense with the
 

761
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,790
small and while it's intense with the
systems i have and the sensors and what

762
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:32,800
systems i have and the sensors and what
 

763
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,389
systems i have and the sensors and what
i'm feeling and all that

764
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
i'm feeling and all that
 

765
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,910
i'm feeling and all that
if i you know we've done it and we've

766
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:35,920
if i you know we've done it and we've
 

767
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,590
if i you know we've done it and we've
done it right we take video of that and

768
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
done it right we take video of that and
 

769
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,870
done it right we take video of that and
it's just like a blue sky and you see a

770
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:38,880
it's just like a blue sky and you see a
 

771
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,150
it's just like a blue sky and you see a
little dot out there so not very

772
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,160
little dot out there so not very
 

773
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,509
little dot out there so not very
interesting and so

774
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:41,519
interesting and so
 

775
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,949
interesting and so
anytime it really looks interesting in

776
00:12:42,949 --> 00:12:42,959
anytime it really looks interesting in
 

777
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,069
anytime it really looks interesting in
dogfight arena um that's most likely uh

778
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
dogfight arena um that's most likely uh
 

779
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,829
dogfight arena um that's most likely uh
fiction because we really only get close

780
00:12:47,829 --> 00:12:47,839
fiction because we really only get close
 

781
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,269
fiction because we really only get close
for you know a millisecond as we're

782
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
for you know a millisecond as we're
 

783
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,790
for you know a millisecond as we're
zipping past each other at the merge

784
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:50,800
zipping past each other at the merge
 

785
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,310
zipping past each other at the merge
you're breaking my heart right i know

786
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:52,320
you're breaking my heart right i know
 

787
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,150
you're breaking my heart right i know
breaking my heart

788
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:54,160
breaking my heart
 

789
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,310
breaking my heart
no i understand you can go and have fun

790
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:56,320
no i understand you can go and have fun
 

791
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,230
no i understand you can go and have fun
but you know in a dog fight specifically

792
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:58,240
but you know in a dog fight specifically
 

793
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,750
but you know in a dog fight specifically
maybe that was more common in the

794
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
maybe that was more common in the
 

795
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,990
maybe that was more common in the
earlier wars of world war two and before

796
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,000
earlier wars of world war two and before
 

797
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,590
earlier wars of world war two and before
that where the is it due to the

798
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:05,600
that where the is it due to the
 

799
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,269
that where the is it due to the
sort of the range and the effectiveness

800
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
sort of the range and the effectiveness
 

801
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,670
sort of the range and the effectiveness
of the weapon systems involved exactly

802
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:09,680
of the weapon systems involved exactly
 

803
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,190
of the weapon systems involved exactly
and the accuracy of the targeting

804
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:11,200
and the accuracy of the targeting
 

805
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,509
and the accuracy of the targeting
systems at range but there's also a

806
00:13:13,509 --> 00:13:13,519
systems at range but there's also a
 

807
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,110
systems at range but there's also a
train of thought um

808
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:15,120
train of thought um
 

809
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,790
train of thought um
that hasn't actually been tested out yet

810
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
that hasn't actually been tested out yet
 

811
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,990
that hasn't actually been tested out yet
which is with the advent of

812
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,000
which is with the advent of
 

813
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,790
which is with the advent of
advanced electronic warfare ew

814
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:22,800
advanced electronic warfare ew
 

815
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,910
advanced electronic warfare ew
and or

816
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:23,920
and or
 

817
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,389
and or
unmanned assets the battle space may get

818
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:26,399
unmanned assets the battle space may get
 

819
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,389
unmanned assets the battle space may get
so complex and missiles

820
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:28,399
so complex and missiles
 

821
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,150
so complex and missiles
may essentially just get

822
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,160
may essentially just get
 

823
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,550
may essentially just get
dropped out of the sky or wasted such

824
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
dropped out of the sky or wasted such
 

825
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,389
dropped out of the sky or wasted such
that you're going to be in close with

826
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:34,399
that you're going to be in close with
 

827
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,790
that you're going to be in close with
either ir missiles or guns uh if it's a

828
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:36,800
either ir missiles or guns uh if it's a
 

829
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,069
either ir missiles or guns uh if it's a
no kidding

830
00:13:38,069 --> 00:13:38,079
no kidding
 

831
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:38,870
no kidding
um

832
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:38,880
um
 

833
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,949
um
you know must defend type scenario first

834
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
you know must defend type scenario first
 

835
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,790
you know must defend type scenario first
of all what's electronic warfare you

836
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
of all what's electronic warfare you
 

837
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,990
of all what's electronic warfare you
know it's basically trying to get

838
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,000
know it's basically trying to get
 

839
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,629
know it's basically trying to get
control of electromagnetic spectrum

840
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:46,639
control of electromagnetic spectrum
 

841
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,870
control of electromagnetic spectrum
for the interest of um whatever

842
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:48,880
for the interest of um whatever
 

843
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,870
for the interest of um whatever
operation is going on so in the tactical

844
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:50,880
operation is going on so in the tactical
 

845
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,470
operation is going on so in the tactical
environment a lot of that is trying to

846
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:52,480
environment a lot of that is trying to
 

847
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,550
environment a lot of that is trying to
deceive the radar or can we deceive the

848
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:54,560
deceive the radar or can we deceive the
 

849
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,230
deceive the radar or can we deceive the
missile or just you know stop their

850
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
missile or just you know stop their
 

851
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,710
missile or just you know stop their
guide and things of that nature

852
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:58,720
guide and things of that nature
 

853
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,710
guide and things of that nature
man it's a battle in the space of

854
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,720
man it's a battle in the space of
 

855
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,750
man it's a battle in the space of
information of digital information

856
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:03,760
information of digital information
 

857
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,230
information of digital information
yeah that well f-22 and f-35 right f-22

858
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:06,240
yeah that well f-22 and f-35 right f-22
 

859
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,750
yeah that well f-22 and f-35 right f-22
is a big expensive aircraft and it was

860
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
is a big expensive aircraft and it was
 

861
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,829
is a big expensive aircraft and it was
made to be a great fighter

862
00:14:09,829 --> 00:14:09,839
made to be a great fighter
 

863
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,829
made to be a great fighter
but the f-35 is not as great of a

864
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:11,839
but the f-35 is not as great of a
 

865
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,990
but the f-35 is not as great of a
fighter but it's it's an electronic

866
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:14,000
fighter but it's it's an electronic
 

867
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,189
fighter but it's it's an electronic
warfare and mission commander platform

868
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:17,199
warfare and mission commander platform
 

869
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,629
warfare and mission commander platform
of the future

870
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
of the future
 

871
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,230
of the future
where information is what's going to win

872
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:20,240
where information is what's going to win
 

873
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,990
where information is what's going to win
the war instead of the best dog fighter

874
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,000
the war instead of the best dog fighter
 

875
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,910
the war instead of the best dog fighter
and so it's interesting dichotomy there

876
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:23,920
and so it's interesting dichotomy there
 

877
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,069
and so it's interesting dichotomy there
what's the best airplane ever made

878
00:14:26,069 --> 00:14:26,079
what's the best airplane ever made

aviators in the in the audience are
gonna hate my answer because they're

gonna want that sexy you know muscly
 

887
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,350
gonna want that sexy you know muscly
f-14 tomcat type fighter or or maybe

888
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:37,360
f-14 tomcat type fighter or or maybe
 

889
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,670
f-14 tomcat type fighter or or maybe
p-51 type aircraft but

890
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:39,680
p-51 type aircraft but
 

891
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,470
p-51 type aircraft but
the

892
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:40,480
the
 

893
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,430
the
f-35 is maybe not the best dog fighter

894
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:43,440
f-35 is maybe not the best dog fighter
 

895
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,269
f-35 is maybe not the best dog fighter
but it doesn't have to get in a dog

896
00:14:45,269 --> 00:14:45,279
but it doesn't have to get in a dog
 

897
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,470
but it doesn't have to get in a dog
fight right it's like how you'd be the

898
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
fight right it's like how you'd be the
 

899
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,150
fight right it's like how you'd be the
best knife fighters not getting a knife

900
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:48,160
best knife fighters not getting a knife
 

901
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,790
best knife fighters not getting a knife
fight sometimes lockheed martin f-35

it looks pretty sexy there's two real
strengths you can have as a fighter you

908
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:55,760
strengths you can have as a fighter you
 

909
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,430
strengths you can have as a fighter you
can you can have the ability to kind of

910
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:57,440
can you can have the ability to kind of
 

911
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,990
can you can have the ability to kind of
out muscle your fighter uh your your

912
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,000
out muscle your fighter uh your your
 

913
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,310
out muscle your fighter uh your your
opponent and beat them on g's and power

914
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:02,320
opponent and beat them on g's and power
 

915
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,550
opponent and beat them on g's and power
and rate around on them and then there's

916
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:04,560
and rate around on them and then there's
 

917
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,790
and rate around on them and then there's
the other side of that which is uh you

918
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:06,800
the other side of that which is uh you
 

919
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,870
the other side of that which is uh you
can be overly maneuverable

920
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
can be overly maneuverable
 

921
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,030
can be overly maneuverable
uh you can bleed energy quickly and

922
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
uh you can bleed energy quickly and
 

923
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,030
uh you can bleed energy quickly and
that's what the f 3 f 18 was good at

924
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,040
that's what the f 3 f 18 was good at
 

925
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,949
that's what the f 3 f 18 was good at
because it had to be heavier to land on

926
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
because it had to be heavier to land on
 

927
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,230
because it had to be heavier to land on
the aircraft carrier we had to give it

928
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:16,240
the aircraft carrier we had to give it
 

929
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,670
the aircraft carrier we had to give it
extra bulk

930
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:17,680
extra bulk
 

931
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,590
extra bulk
but it also needed special mechanisms to

932
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
but it also needed special mechanisms to
 

933
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,110
but it also needed special mechanisms to
slow down enough to land on aircraft

934
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,120
slow down enough to land on aircraft
 

935
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,870
slow down enough to land on aircraft
carrier so it made it very maneuverable

936
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:22,880
carrier so it made it very maneuverable
 

937
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,470
carrier so it made it very maneuverable
and what that leads to a lot of times

938
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:24,480
and what that leads to a lot of times
 

939
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,870
and what that leads to a lot of times
the ability to get maybe the first shot

940
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:26,880
the ability to get maybe the first shot
 

941
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,310
the ability to get maybe the first shot
in a fight

942
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
in a fight
 

943
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,829
in a fight
which is very good but if you do make

944
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
which is very good but if you do make
 

945
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,949
which is very good but if you do make
that sharp turn you're going to bleed a

946
00:15:30,949 --> 00:15:30,959
that sharp turn you're going to bleed a
 

947
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,629
that sharp turn you're going to bleed a
lot of energy away and be more

948
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:32,639
lot of energy away and be more
 

949
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,230
lot of energy away and be more
susceptible for follow-on shots if that

950
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
susceptible for follow-on shots if that
 

951
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,990
susceptible for follow-on shots if that
one's less susceptible and so there's

952
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,000
one's less susceptible and so there's
 

953
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,829
one's less susceptible and so there's
this kind of aggression non-aggression

954
00:15:37,829 --> 00:15:37,839
this kind of aggression non-aggression
 

955
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,430
this kind of aggression non-aggression
game you can play depending on the type

956
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
game you can play depending on the type
 

957
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,110
game you can play depending on the type
of aircraft you're fighting where does

958
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,120
of aircraft you're fighting where does
 

959
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,470
of aircraft you're fighting where does
the f-35 land on that spectrum the f-35

960
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:44,480
the f-35 land on that spectrum the f-35
 

961
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,110
the f-35 land on that spectrum the f-35
lands somewhere behind the f-22s so

962
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,120
lands somewhere behind the f-22s so
 

963
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,870
lands somewhere behind the f-22s so
there'll probably be a row of f-22s or

964
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
there'll probably be a row of f-22s or
 

965
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,870
there'll probably be a row of f-22s or
f-18s and f-35 will be out back but

966
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:50,880
f-18s and f-35 will be out back but
 

967
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,470
f-18s and f-35 will be out back but
it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare

968
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:52,480
it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare
 

969
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,749
it'll be enabling a lot of the warfare
that's happening in front is it one of

970
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
that's happening in front is it one of
 

971
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,590
that's happening in front is it one of
the more expensive planes

972
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,600
the more expensive planes
 

973
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,350
the more expensive planes
because of all the stuff on it it

974
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
because of all the stuff on it it
 

975
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,990
because of all the stuff on it it
certainly is yeah

976
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:00,000
certainly is yeah
 

977
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,910
certainly is yeah
in the movie they have tom cruise flied

978
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,920
in the movie they have tom cruise flied
 

979
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,870
in the movie they have tom cruise flied
over mach 10. so maybe

980
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:04,880
over mach 10. so maybe
 

981
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,389
over mach 10. so maybe
can you say

982
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:06,399
can you say
 

983
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,910
can you say
what are the different speeds

984
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:07,920
what are the different speeds
 

985
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,350
what are the different speeds
accelerations feel like mach 1 2 3

986
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:11,360
accelerations feel like mach 1 2 3
 

987
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,430
accelerations feel like mach 1 2 3
or hypersonic have you ever flown

988
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:13,440
or hypersonic have you ever flown
 

989
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,430
or hypersonic have you ever flown
hypersonic no

990
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:15,440
hypersonic no
 

991
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,990
hypersonic no
um does it get how tough does it get

992
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,000
um does it get how tough does it get
 

993
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,670
um does it get how tough does it get
i'm just going to call out the the bs of

994
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:19,680
i'm just going to call out the the bs of
 

995
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,670
i'm just going to call out the the bs of
ejecting at mach 10 just for the record

996
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
ejecting at mach 10 just for the record
 

997
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,990
ejecting at mach 10 just for the record
because in the movie uh there's been i

998
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
because in the movie uh there's been i
 

999
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,829
because in the movie uh there's been i
think at least one ejection that was

1000
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
think at least one ejection that was
 

1001
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,069
think at least one ejection that was
super sonic uh and i'll just say you

1002
00:16:28,069 --> 00:16:28,079
super sonic uh and i'll just say you
 

1003
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,910
super sonic uh and i'll just say you
know it was not pretty but he survived

1004
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:29,920
know it was not pretty but he survived
 

1005
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,910
know it was not pretty but he survived
um so there have to be some interesting

1006
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
um so there have to be some interesting
 

1007
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,910
um so there have to be some interesting
mechanisms to eject successfully at mach

1008
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:33,920
mechanisms to eject successfully at mach
 

1009
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:49,590
mechanisms to eject successfully at mach
10 but i'll digress

1010
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:49,600

 

1011
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,389

yeah

1012
00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:50,399
yeah
 

1013
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,310
yeah
uh but anyway so what

1014
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
uh but anyway so what
 

1015
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,749
uh but anyway so what
um

1016
00:16:53,749 --> 00:16:53,759
um
 

1017
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,110
um
what's interesting to say about the

1018
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
what's interesting to say about the
 

1019
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,150
what's interesting to say about the
experience of ma of the as you go up

1020
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,160
experience of ma of the as you go up
 

1021
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,389
experience of ma of the as you go up
does it get more and more difficult

1022
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:00,399
does it get more and more difficult
 

1023
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,910
does it get more and more difficult
in the end of the day crossing the sound

1024
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
in the end of the day crossing the sound
 

1025
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,269
in the end of the day crossing the sound
bear is much like crossing the speed

1026
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:03,279
bear is much like crossing the speed
 

1027
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,710
bear is much like crossing the speed
limit on the highway you don't really

1028
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:04,720
limit on the highway you don't really
 

1029
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,069
limit on the highway you don't really
notice anything

1030
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:06,079
notice anything
 

1031
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:06,949
notice anything
um

1032
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
um
 

1033
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,949
um
to cross that at least an f-18 because

1034
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:08,959
to cross that at least an f-18 because
 

1035
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,230
to cross that at least an f-18 because
we have a lot more weight than most

1036
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:10,240
we have a lot more weight than most
 

1037
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,829
we have a lot more weight than most
fighters is typically we'll do that in a

1038
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:11,839
fighters is typically we'll do that in a
 

1039
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,110
fighters is typically we'll do that in a
descent

1040
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,120
descent
 

1041
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,189
descent
and we'll do that a full afterburner

1042
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
and we'll do that a full afterburner
 

1043
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,909
and we'll do that a full afterburner
just dumping gas into the engine

1044
00:17:17,909 --> 00:17:17,919
just dumping gas into the engine
 

1045
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,750
just dumping gas into the engine
and so that'll get us over the fastest i

1046
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:19,760
and so that'll get us over the fastest i
 

1047
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,990
and so that'll get us over the fastest i
think i've got about 1.28

1048
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,000
think i've got about 1.28
 

1049
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,510
think i've got about 1.28
but what's interesting people realize is

1050
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
but what's interesting people realize is
 

1051
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,750
but what's interesting people realize is
that if i take that throttle and i'm an

1052
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:25,760
that if i take that throttle and i'm an
 

1053
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,909
that if i take that throttle and i'm an
afterburner and i just bring it back and

1054
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:27,919
afterburner and i just bring it back and
 

1055
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,590
afterburner and i just bring it back and
just bring it back to mill which is full

1056
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:29,600
just bring it back to mill which is full
 

1057
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,669
just bring it back to mill which is full
power just not afterburner the

1058
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:31,679
power just not afterburner the
 

1059
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,990
power just not afterburner the
deacceleration is so strong due to the

1060
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,000
deacceleration is so strong due to the
 

1061
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,590
deacceleration is so strong due to the
air friction that it throw you forward

1062
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,600
air friction that it throw you forward
 

1063
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,830
air friction that it throw you forward
in your straps almost you know i would

1064
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:37,840
in your straps almost you know i would
 

1065
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,070
in your straps almost you know i would
say you know maybe like 70 of strong

1066
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:40,080
say you know maybe like 70 of strong
 

1067
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,990
say you know maybe like 70 of strong
almost as has trapping on the boat it's

1068
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:42,000
almost as has trapping on the boat it's
 

1069
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,350
almost as has trapping on the boat it's
pretty strong

1070
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
pretty strong
 

1071
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,789
pretty strong
so it's almost like a reverse car crash

1072
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:44,799
so it's almost like a reverse car crash
 

1073
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,070
so it's almost like a reverse car crash
just for the acceleration so the

1074
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:46,080
just for the acceleration so the
 

1075
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,909
just for the acceleration so the
acceleration you know is usually kind of

1076
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:47,919
acceleration you know is usually kind of
 

1077
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:49,110
acceleration you know is usually kind of
slow and you don't feel anything of

1078
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
slow and you don't feel anything of
 

1079
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,710
slow and you don't feel anything of
course when you're crossing through it

1080
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:50,720
course when you're crossing through it
 

1081
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,750
course when you're crossing through it
but the acceleration is pretty violent

1082
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:53,760
but the acceleration is pretty violent
 

1083
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,549
but the acceleration is pretty violent
the deceleration is violent huh okay

1084
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:56,559
the deceleration is violent huh okay
 

1085
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,909
the deceleration is violent huh okay
uh but is there

1086
00:17:57,909 --> 00:17:57,919
uh but is there
 

1087
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,270
uh but is there
is there a fundamental difference

1088
00:17:59,270 --> 00:17:59,280
is there a fundamental difference
 

1089
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,390
is there a fundamental difference
between like mach 1 and hypersonic mach

1090
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:02,400
between like mach 1 and hypersonic mach
 

1091
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,390
between like mach 1 and hypersonic mach
5 and so on does it require like super

1092
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,400
5 and so on does it require like super
 

1093
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,830
5 and so on does it require like super
special training

1094
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:05,840
special training
 

1095
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,310
special training
and is that something that's

1096
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:08,320
and is that something that's
 

1097
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,310
and is that something that's
used often in warfare is that not really

1098
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
used often in warfare is that not really
 

1099
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,270
used often in warfare is that not really
that no so hypersonic human flight in if

1100
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
that no so hypersonic human flight in if
 

1101
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,630
that no so hypersonic human flight in if
it exists it's not something that's

1102
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:14,640
it exists it's not something that's
 

1103
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,230
it exists it's not something that's
employed tactically

1104
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:16,240
employed tactically
 

1105
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,470
employed tactically
in um in any sense right now that i'm

1106
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
in um in any sense right now that i'm
 

1107
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,669
in um in any sense right now that i'm
aware of so

1108
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:19,679
aware of so
 

1109
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,549
aware of so
um you know i think of hypersonic um

1110
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
um you know i think of hypersonic um
 

1111
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,029
um you know i think of hypersonic um
technology i think of uh missiles and

1112
00:18:25,029 --> 00:18:25,039
technology i think of uh missiles and
 

1113
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,789
technology i think of uh missiles and
weapon systems and delivery platform i

1114
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
weapon systems and delivery platform i
 

1115
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,789
weapon systems and delivery platform i
don't think of fighter aircraft

1116
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
don't think of fighter aircraft
 

1117
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,190
don't think of fighter aircraft
necessarily i can think of bomber or

1118
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:31,200
necessarily i can think of bomber or
 

1119
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,430
necessarily i can think of bomber or
reconnaissance aircraft perhaps

1120
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:33,440
reconnaissance aircraft perhaps
 

1121
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,430
reconnaissance aircraft perhaps
but those would be more efficient very

1122
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:35,440
but those would be more efficient very
 

1123
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,830
but those would be more efficient very
long long range i imagine acceleration

1124
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:37,840
long long range i imagine acceleration
 

1125
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,390
long long range i imagine acceleration
would be kind of gentle honestly

1126
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:40,400
would be kind of gentle honestly
 

1127
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,510
would be kind of gentle honestly
the thing you experience is the

1128
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:41,520
the thing you experience is the
 

1129
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,990
the thing you experience is the
acceleration not the actual speed

1130
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:44,000
acceleration not the actual speed
 

1131
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,470
acceleration not the actual speed
um there's been just a small tangent a

1132

um there's been just a small tangent a
 

1133
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,070
um there's been just a small tangent a
lot of discussion about hypersonic

1134
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:48,080
lot of discussion about hypersonic

nuclear weapons like missiles from you

1136
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
nuclear weapons like missiles from you
 

1137
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,870
nuclear weapons like missiles from you
know russia

1138
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:52,880
know russia
 

1139
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,870

uh bragging about that is this something

1140
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:54,880
uh bragging about that is this something
 

1141
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,870
uh bragging about that is this something
that's a significant concern or is it

1142
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:56,880
that's a significant concern or is it
 

1143
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,549
that's a significant concern or is it
just a way to flex about different kinds

1144
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:58,559
just a way to flex about different kinds
 

1145
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,549
just a way to flex about different kinds
of weapon systems

1146
00:19:00,549 --> 00:19:00,559
of weapon systems

challenge for our detection systems
 

1151
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,029
challenge for our detection systems
because there are

1154
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:08,080
um
 

1155
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,070
um
you know there are design considerations

1156
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
you know there are design considerations
 

1157
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,990
you know there are design considerations
in these sensor systems as always right

we have um

1174
00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:25,039
we have um
 

1175
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,350
we have um
it's less of you know

1176
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:27,360
it's less of you know
 

1177
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,190
it's less of you know
it's a more of an integrated picture

it's a more of an integrated picture
 

1179
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,190
it's a more of an integrated picture
i'll say um and so the hypersonics

1180
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:33,200
i'll say um and so the hypersonics
 

1181
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,150
i'll say um and so the hypersonics
are really

what it is is uh how fast can we detect

1184
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
what it is is uh how fast can we detect
 

1185
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,110
what it is is uh how fast can we detect

does it need another re-attack something
of that nature and so

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,510
there's an old dog fighting framework
you could call it it's called the ooda

00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:11,679
to get inside that kill chain of your
 

1225
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,190
to get inside that kill chain of your
opponent and break it up so that he

1226
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:13,200
opponent and break it up so that he
 

1227

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,270
can't
uh process his kill chain on you and so

1230
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
uh process his kill chain on you and so
 

1231
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,950
uh process his kill chain on you and so
hypersonic's a way of shortening those

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,029
react to that
i wonder what do like how much do you

1238
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:25,039
i wonder what do like how much do you
 

1239
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,190
i wonder what do like how much do you
have to shorten it in order for

1240
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:27,200
have to shorten it in order for
 

1241
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,110
have to shorten it in order for
the defense systems not to work anymore

1242
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
the defense systems not to work anymore
 

1243
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,630
the defense systems not to work anymore
it seems like uh

1244
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:30,640
it seems like uh
 

1245
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,190
it seems like uh
it's very you know i

1246
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:33,200
it's very you know i
 

1247
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,350
it's very you know i
i'm both often horrified by the thought

1248
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
i'm both often horrified by the thought
 

1249
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,029
i'm both often horrified by the thought
of nuclear war

1250
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:37,039
of nuclear war
 

1251
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,710
of nuclear war
but at the same time

1252
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:38,720
but at the same time
 

1253
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,230
but at the same time
wonder

1254
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:40,240
wonder
 

1255
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,549
wonder
what that looks like

1256
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
what that looks like
 

1257
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,950
what that looks like
when i i dream of extreme competence in

1258
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:44,960
when i i dream of extreme competence in
 

1259
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,270
when i i dream of extreme competence in
defense systems i imagine that not a

1260
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:47,280
defense systems i imagine that not a
 

1261
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,510
defense systems i imagine that not a
single nuclear weapon can reach the

1262
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
single nuclear weapon can reach the
 

1263
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,590
single nuclear weapon can reach the
united states by missile

1264
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:51,600
united states by missile
 

1265
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,430
united states by missile
with the defense system

1266
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:53,440
with the defense system
 

1267
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,669
with the defense system
defense systems but then again i also

1268
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
defense systems but then again i also
 

1269
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,830
defense systems but then again i also
understand that these are extremely

1270
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:57,840
understand that these are extremely
 

1271
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,270
understand that these are extremely
complicated systems the amount of

1272
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
complicated systems the amount of
 

1273
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,669
complicated systems the amount of
integration required and because you're

1274
00:21:01,669 --> 00:21:01,679
integration required and because you're
 

1275
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,590
integration required and because you're
not using them

1276
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
not using them
 

1277
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,590
not using them
i mean this is exactly

1278
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:05,600
i mean this is exactly
 

1279
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,430
i mean this is exactly
there could be you know there's like an

1280
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:07,440
there could be you know there's like an
 

1281
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,669
there could be you know there's like an
intern somewhere

1282
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
intern somewhere
 

1283
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,990
intern somewhere
that like forgot to update the code the

1284
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:12,000
that like forgot to update the code the
 

1285
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,990
that like forgot to update the code the
fortran code that like is going to be

1286
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,000
fortran code that like is going to be
 

1287
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,830
fortran code that like is going to be
make the difference because you don't

1288
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:15,840
make the difference because you don't
 

1289
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,350
make the difference because you don't
have the opportunity to really

1290
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:17,360
have the opportunity to really
 

1291
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,190
have the opportunity to really
thoroughly test

1292
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:19,200
thoroughly test
 

1293
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,990
thoroughly test
um which is really scary of course the

1294
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:22,000
um which is really scary of course the
 

1295
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,390
um which is really scary of course the
systems are probably incredible if they

1296
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,400
systems are probably incredible if they
 

1297
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,990
systems are probably incredible if they
could be tested but because they can't

1298
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:26,000
could be tested but because they can't
 

1299
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,950
could be tested but because they can't
be really thoroughly tested in actual

1300
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:28,960
be really thoroughly tested in actual
 

1301
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,750
be really thoroughly tested in actual
um

1302
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:29,760
um
 

1303
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,230
um
in an actual attack i wonder

1304
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:32,240
in an actual attack i wonder
 

1305
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,630
in an actual attack i wonder
i mean i guess one assumption there

1306
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
i mean i guess one assumption there
 

1307
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,710
i mean i guess one assumption there
would be that these hypersonic missiles

1308
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:36,720
would be that these hypersonic missiles
 

1309
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,990
would be that these hypersonic missiles
would only be launched and the case

1310
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:38,000
would only be launched and the case
 

1311
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,270
would only be launched and the case
would attack

1312
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:39,280
would attack
 

1313
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,710
would attack
um it'd be interesting if there were

1314
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:40,720
um it'd be interesting if there were
 

1315
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,310
um it'd be interesting if there were
other hypersonic objects that we could

1316
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
other hypersonic objects that we could
 

1317
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,710
other hypersonic objects that we could
use to flex those systems

1318
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
use to flex those systems
 

1319
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,230
use to flex those systems
another thing that actually happened i

1320
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:46,240
another thing that actually happened i
 

1321
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,669
another thing that actually happened i
just have a million questions i want to

1322
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
just have a million questions i want to
 

1323
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,310
just have a million questions i want to
ask you it's fascinating to me uh is

1324
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:50,320
ask you it's fascinating to me uh is
 

1325
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,549
ask you it's fascinating to me uh is
there's a bird strike on the plane does

1326
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
there's a bird strike on the plane does
 

1327
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,230
there's a bird strike on the plane does
that happen often yeah it's a series

1328
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:54,240
that happen often yeah it's a series
 

1329
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,070
that happen often yeah it's a series
they damaged the the engine and they

1330
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:56,080
they damaged the the engine and they
 

1331
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,310
they damaged the the engine and they
made it seem like it's a serious exactly

1332
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:58,320
made it seem like it's a serious exactly
 

1333
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,029
made it seem like it's a serious exactly
a serious issue i've hit birds um i've i

1334
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:01,039
a serious issue i've hit birds um i've i
 

1335
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,110
a serious issue i've hit birds um i've i
know someone that took a turkey vulture

1336
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:03,120
know someone that took a turkey vulture
 

1337
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,470
know someone that took a turkey vulture
to the face

1338
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,480
to the face
 

1339
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,310
to the face
through the cockpit right shattered the

1340
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:06,320
through the cockpit right shattered the
 

1341
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,830
through the cockpit right shattered the
cockpit knocked him out

1342
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:07,840
cockpit knocked him out
 

1343
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,430
cockpit knocked him out
um i think the

1344
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:09,440
um i think the
 

1345
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,549
um i think the
it actually i don't know personally

1346
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:10,559
it actually i don't know personally
 

1347
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:11,990
it actually i don't know personally
about the story i know from uh the

1348
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:12,000
about the story i know from uh the
 

1349
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,669
about the story i know from uh the
command i was at and uh i believe the

1350
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
command i was at and uh i believe the
 

1351
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,430
command i was at and uh i believe the
backseater had to punch out

1352
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:15,440
backseater had to punch out
 

1353
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,710
backseater had to punch out
uh and punch them both out because he

1354
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:16,720
uh and punch them both out because he
 

1355
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,909
uh and punch them both out because he
was unconscious you know in the front

1356
00:22:17,909 --> 00:22:17,919
was unconscious you know in the front
 

1357
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,190
was unconscious you know in the front
seat from the bird

1358
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:19,200
seat from the bird
 

1359
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,510
seat from the bird
um it can kill you from hitting you it's

1360
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
um it can kill you from hitting you it's
 

1361
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,710
um it can kill you from hitting you it's
you know it's like a bowling ball going

1362
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
you know it's like a bowling ball going
 

1363
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,590
you know it's like a bowling ball going
250 miles an hour

1364
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:25,600
250 miles an hour
 

1365
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,470
250 miles an hour
it can take out an engine uh

1366
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
it can take out an engine uh
 

1367
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,310
it can take out an engine uh
very easily uh

1368
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
very easily uh
 

1369
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,710
very easily uh
every airport i've flown at in the navy

1370
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:32,720
every airport i've flown at in the navy
 

1371
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,430
every airport i've flown at in the navy
i've had to check the the bird condition

1372
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:35,440
i've had to check the the bird condition
 

1373
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:37,190
i've had to check the the bird condition
if you will to see how many birds i've

1374
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
if you will to see how many birds i've
 

1375
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,950
if you will to see how many birds i've
we've had to cancel flights because of

1376
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:38,960
we've had to cancel flights because of
 

1377
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,149
we've had to cancel flights because of
because there's too many of them around

1378
00:22:40,149 --> 00:22:40,159
because there's too many of them around
 

1379
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,750
because there's too many of them around
the airport some airports even have bird

1380
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:41,760
the airport some airports even have bird
 

1381
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,350
the airport some airports even have bird
radars with no tear ports there are

1382
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:43,360
radars with no tear ports there are
 

1383
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,750
radars with no tear ports there are
systems that monitor the bird condition

1384
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:45,760
systems that monitor the bird condition
 

1385
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,510
systems that monitor the bird condition
there is yeah there's actual radar

1386
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:47,520
there is yeah there's actual radar
 

1387
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,230
there is yeah there's actual radar
systems and you can go in the

1388
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
systems and you can go in the
 

1389
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,510
systems and you can go in the
certain bases you have to call up and

1390
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:51,520
certain bases you have to call up and
 

1391
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,710
certain bases you have to call up and
they'll tell you what it is for the day

1392
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:52,720
they'll tell you what it is for the day
 

1393
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,549
they'll tell you what it is for the day
or for that hour and other ones having

1394
00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:54,559
or for that hour and other ones having
 

1395
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,470
or for that hour and other ones having
like their their weather report that

1396
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:56,480
like their their weather report that
 

1397
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,710
like their their weather report that
goes out with the radio

1398
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:58,720
goes out with the radio
 

1399
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,470
goes out with the radio
what are some technological solutions to

1400
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
what are some technological solutions to
 

1401
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,310
what are some technological solutions to
this or is this just

1402
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:02,320
this or is this just
 

1403
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,190
this or is this just
uh

1404
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:03,200
uh
 

1405
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,830
uh
because it's a low probability event

1406
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
because it's a low probability event
 

1407
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,070
because it's a low probability event
there's no real solution for it i would

1408
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:08,080
there's no real solution for it i would
 

1409
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,510
there's no real solution for it i would
say it's not a little probably develop

1410
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:09,520
say it's not a little probably develop
 

1411
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,270
say it's not a little probably develop
event i mean this is happening a lot i

1412
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:11,280
event i mean this is happening a lot i
 

1413
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,270
event i mean this is happening a lot i
mean although the hits themselves aren't

1414
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:13,280
mean although the hits themselves aren't
 

1415
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,270
mean although the hits themselves aren't
necessarily that common or i'll say a

1416
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:15,280
necessarily that common or i'll say a
 

1417
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,990
necessarily that common or i'll say a
catastrophic hit either a near miss or a

1418
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
catastrophic hit either a near miss or a
 

1419
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,070
catastrophic hit either a near miss or a
hit or the pilot having to actively

1420
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:20,080
hit or the pilot having to actively
 

1421
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,870
hit or the pilot having to actively
maneuver to avoid it is pretty common

1422
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:22,880
maneuver to avoid it is pretty common
 

1423
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,710
maneuver to avoid it is pretty common
and in fact it seems stressful it is

1424
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
and in fact it seems stressful it is
 

1425
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,549
and in fact it seems stressful it is
it's so common in fact that we know that

1426
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:26,559
it's so common in fact that we know that
 

1427
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,390
it's so common in fact that we know that
you never want to try to go over or you

1428
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:28,400
you never want to try to go over or you
 

1429
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,909
you never want to try to go over or you
never want to go under a bird if you see

1430
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:29,919
never want to go under a bird if you see
 

1431
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,430
never want to go under a bird if you see
it in front of you you always want to

1432
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:31,440
it in front of you you always want to
 

1433
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,789
it in front of you you always want to
try to go over it because what they'll

1434
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:32,799
try to go over it because what they'll
 

1435
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,390
try to go over it because what they'll
do immediately if they see you is and

1436
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:34,400
do immediately if they see you is and
 

1437
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,990
do immediately if they see you is and
you startle vegetables they'll bring

1438
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,000
you startle vegetables they'll bring
 

1439
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,510
you startle vegetables they'll bring
their wings in and just drop straight

1440
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:37,520
their wings in and just drop straight
 

1441
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,110
their wings in and just drop straight
down to try to get out of the path it's

1442
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:39,120
down to try to get out of the path it's
 

1443
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,470
down to try to get out of the path it's
interesting i didn't know they did that

1444
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:40,480
interesting i didn't know they did that
 

1445
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,310
interesting i didn't know they did that
but so if you immediately if you try to

1446
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:42,320
but so if you immediately if you try to
 

1447
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,430
but so if you immediately if you try to
go under them they're going to be

1448
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:43,440
go under them they're going to be
 

1449
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,710
go under them they're going to be
dropping into you so you typically want

dropping into you so you typically want
to try to go above them is this

1452
00:23:45,909 --> 00:23:45,919
to try to go above them is this
 

1453
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,870
to try to go above them is this
something you can train for or no um

1454
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:48,880
something you can train for or no um
 

1455

um
 

1461
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,029
um
you somewhat trained for

1462
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
you somewhat trained for
 

1463
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,710
you somewhat trained for
in the duties of being a fighter pilot

1464

in the duties of being a fighter pilot
 

1465

in a sense right being able to react to
 

1467
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,669
in a sense right being able to react to
your environment very quickly and make

1468
00:23:59,669 --> 00:23:59,679
your environment very quickly and make
 

1469
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,909
your environment very quickly and make
make decisions quickly so is that one of

something that we maybe don't often
 

1483
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,590

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:15,600
think about in terms of
 

1485
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,390
think about in terms of
the challenges of flying birds in a way

1486

the challenges of flying birds in a way
 

1487
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,630

something that we really have to be
 

1497
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:27,909
something that we really have to be
careful about whether we're flying

uh i was lucky enough that there was one

1678
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:24,240
uh i was lucky enough that there was one
 

1679
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,310
uh i was lucky enough that there was one
jet slot in my class and i was uh lucky

1680
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
jet slot in my class and i was uh lucky
 

1681
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,310
jet slot in my class and i was uh lucky
enough fortunate enough to get it so it

1682
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
enough fortunate enough to get it so it
 

1683
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,389
enough fortunate enough to get it so it
was a jet slot so well yeah what that

1684
00:27:30,389 --> 00:27:30,399
was a jet slot so well yeah what that
 

1685
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,630
was a jet slot so well yeah what that
means is that i was assigned actually a

1686
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
means is that i was assigned actually a
 

1687
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,310
means is that i was assigned actually a
tail hook at that point which meant i

1688
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
tail hook at that point which meant i
 

1689
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,549
tail hook at that point which meant i
would go train to fly aircraft and land

1690

um and there's essentially three
 

1695
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,149
um and there's essentially three
aircraft that do that at the time is f18

1696
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:44,159
aircraft that do that at the time is f18
 

1697
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,510
aircraft that do that at the time is f18
and the um

1698
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
and the um
 

1699
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,029
and the um
e2

1700
00:27:47,029 --> 00:27:47,039
e2
 

1701
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,630
e2
and the c2

1702
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
and the c2
 

1703
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,990
and the c2
c2 is kind of like the male truck for

1704
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:50,000
c2 is kind of like the male truck for
 

1705
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,070
c2 is kind of like the male truck for
the boat e2 is the one with the big

1706
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:52,080
the boat e2 is the one with the big
 

1707
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,990
the boat e2 is the one with the big
radar dish on top

1708
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:54,000
radar dish on top
 

1709
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,870
radar dish on top
and then there's all the f-18s so e2 is

1710
00:27:56,870 --> 00:27:56,880
and then there's all the f-18s so e2 is
 

1711
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,909
and then there's all the f-18s so e2 is
calms

they're the ones that bring supplies to
the ship via air and people sorry if i

1720
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:07,840
the ship via air and people sorry if i
 

1721
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,110
the ship via air and people sorry if i
missed it is it a plane is it a

1722
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:09,120
missed it is it a plane is it a

helicopter it's a plane okay
 

1725
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,669
helicopter it's a plane okay
all right and the f-18 is a fighter jet

1726
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:13,679
all right and the f-18 is a fighter jet
 

1727
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,070
all right and the f-18 is a fighter jet
correct okay so i selected tail hook

1728
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,080
correct okay so i selected tail hook
 

1729
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,830
correct okay so i selected tail hook
which meant i could get one of those

1730
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
which meant i could get one of those
 

1731
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,190
which meant i could get one of those
other ones but eighty percent of them

1732
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
other ones but eighty percent of them
 

1733
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,110

that's the jet aircraft you get in
 

1749
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,430
that's the jet aircraft you get in
before you actually go to the f-18

yeah yeah and it looks like a cone so

1768
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:53,520
yeah yeah and it looks like a cone so
 

1769
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,310
yeah yeah and it looks like a cone so
that no one hits it

1770
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
that no one hits it
 

1771
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,909
that no one hits it
okay so it's usually not used for

1772
00:28:57,909 --> 00:28:57,919
okay so it's usually not used for
 

1773
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,510
okay so it's usually not used for
fighting it's just for training it's

1774
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
fighting it's just for training it's
 

1775
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,909
fighting it's just for training it's
used for training how to fight got it so

1776
00:29:01,909 --> 00:29:01,919
used for training how to fight got it so
 

1777
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,590
used for training how to fight got it so
what was that like was that the first

1778
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:03,600
what was that like was that the first
 

1779
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,350
what was that like was that the first
time you were sort of really getting

1780
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
time you were sort of really getting
 

1781
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,110
time you were sort of really getting
into it yeah that was really interesting

1782
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:07,120
into it yeah that was really interesting
 

1783
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,389
into it yeah that was really interesting
because before that it was a 600

1784
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
because before that it was a 600
 

1785
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,630
because before that it was a 600
horsepower prop plane and going from

1786
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:10,640
horsepower prop plane and going from
 

1787
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,870
horsepower prop plane and going from
that to the t45 is one of like the

1788
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
that to the t45 is one of like the
 

1789
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,950
that to the t45 is one of like the
biggest jumps in power and like

1790
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:14,960
biggest jumps in power and like
 

1791
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,830
biggest jumps in power and like
navy you know machine operation how much

1792
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
navy you know machine operation how much
 

1793
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,430
navy you know machine operation how much
horsepower does the 245 have

1794
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:19,440
horsepower does the 245 have
 

1795
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,110
horsepower does the 245 have
approximately

1796
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
approximately
 

1797
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,830
approximately
like 15 000 or so so it's a huge jump

1798
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:23,840
like 15 000 or so so it's a huge jump
 

1799
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,470
like 15 000 or so so it's a huge jump
from 600 you said horsepower about yeah

1800
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
from 600 you said horsepower about yeah
 

1801
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,310
from 600 you said horsepower about yeah
so it's a big big leap

1802
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:28,320
so it's a big big leap
 

1803
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,710
so it's a big big leap
but it's a jet you know so it performs

1804
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,720
but it's a jet you know so it performs
 

1805
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,230
but it's a jet you know so it performs
differently it's faster and right and

1806
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,240
differently it's faster and right and
 

1807
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,590
differently it's faster and right and
what that means not just because it's

1808
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:33,600
what that means not just because it's
 

1809
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,950
what that means not just because it's
faster your whole mind needs to be

1810
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
faster your whole mind needs to be
 

1811
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,310
faster your whole mind needs to be
faster everything happens faster in the

1812
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
faster everything happens faster in the
 

1813
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,110
faster everything happens faster in the
air now right those calms happen faster

1814
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:39,120
air now right those calms happen faster
 

1815
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,950
air now right those calms happen faster
um your landing gear has to come up

1816
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:40,960
um your landing gear has to come up
 

1817
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,389
um your landing gear has to come up
faster everything just happens faster in

1818
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:42,399
faster everything just happens faster in
 

1819
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,549
faster everything just happens faster in
a jet and so it's a big jump uh and i

1820
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:44,559
a jet and so it's a big jump uh and i
 

1821
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,350
a jet and so it's a big jump uh and i
never forget going on my first flight

1822
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:47,360
never forget going on my first flight
 

1823
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,669
never forget going on my first flight
in that aircraft

1824
00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:49,679
in that aircraft
 

1825
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:51,990
in that aircraft
it was a formation flight for someone

1826
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:52,000
it was a formation flight for someone
 

1827
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,830
it was a formation flight for someone
else and i was just in the back watching

1828
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:53,840
else and i was just in the back watching
 

1829
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,950
else and i was just in the back watching
and there was an instructor in the

1830
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:54,960
and there was an instructor in the
 

1831
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,269
and there was an instructor in the
flight and so what that means is

1832
00:29:57,269 --> 00:29:57,279
flight and so what that means is
 

1833
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,870
flight and so what that means is
instructors in a single aircraft and

1834
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
instructors in a single aircraft and
 

1835
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,070
instructors in a single aircraft and
then there's three or four other

1836
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,080
then there's three or four other
 

1837
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,510
then there's three or four other
aircraft and they're learning how to do

1838
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
aircraft and they're learning how to do
 

1839
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,269
aircraft and they're learning how to do
joins and they're learning how to fly in

1840
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
joins and they're learning how to fly in
 

1841
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,350
joins and they're learning how to fly in
formation and as a new student in the

1842
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
formation and as a new student in the
 

1843
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,110
formation and as a new student in the
back it's amazing right because you know

1844
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,120
back it's amazing right because you know
 

1845
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,789
back it's amazing right because you know
photo op time and all this like i'm

1846
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:08,799
photo op time and all this like i'm
 

1847
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,230
photo op time and all this like i'm
seeing aircraft up close for the first

1848
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:10,240
seeing aircraft up close for the first
 

1849
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,750
seeing aircraft up close for the first
time it's awesome

1850
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:11,760
time it's awesome
 

1851
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,269
time it's awesome
um

1852
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:13,279
um
 

1853
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,510
um
and on the way back um

1854
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:15,520
and on the way back um
 

1855
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,750
and on the way back um
we couldn't get our landing gear down uh

1856
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
we couldn't get our landing gear down uh
 

1857
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,110
we couldn't get our landing gear down uh
ironically

1858
00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:19,120
ironically
 

1859
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,149
ironically
so

1860
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
so
 

1861
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,990
so
it you know to make a long story short

1862
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:22,000
it you know to make a long story short
 

1863
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,590
it you know to make a long story short
because it's overall not that exciting

1864
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:23,600
because it's overall not that exciting
 

1865
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,029
because it's overall not that exciting
uh we couldn't get the gear down we

1866
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:25,039
uh we couldn't get the gear down we
 

1867
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,470
uh we couldn't get the gear down we
actually went to go do a controlled

1868
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
actually went to go do a controlled
 

1869
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,269
actually went to go do a controlled
ejection uh to the target area that

1870
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:29,279
ejection uh to the target area that
 

1871
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,029
ejection uh to the target area that
where that is about 15 20 miles to the

1872
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
where that is about 15 20 miles to the
 

1873
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,190
where that is about 15 20 miles to the
north of the base did you wait did you

1874
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:33,200
north of the base did you wait did you
 

1875
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,430
north of the base did you wait did you
just say that's not that exciting

1876
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:35,440
just say that's not that exciting
 

1877
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,310
just say that's not that exciting
well

1878
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:36,320
well
 

1879
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,549
well
because that to me is pretty exciting so

1880
00:30:38,549 --> 00:30:38,559
because that to me is pretty exciting so
 

1881
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,870
because that to me is pretty exciting so
that i mean how first of all

1882
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:40,880
that i mean how first of all
 

1883
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,269
that i mean how first of all
i mean uh i mean that must be terrifying

1884
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:43,279
i mean uh i mean that must be terrifying
 

1885
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,269
i mean uh i mean that must be terrifying
like uh early on in your careers i

1886
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
like uh early on in your careers i
 

1887
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,590
like uh early on in your careers i
haven't haven't seen those things

1888
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:47,600
haven't haven't seen those things
 

1889
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,950
haven't haven't seen those things
um

1890
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
um
 

1891
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,630
um
that yeah like how often does that kind

1892
00:30:50,630 --> 00:30:50,640
that yeah like how often does that kind
 

1893
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,789
that yeah like how often does that kind
of thing happen

1894
00:30:52,789 --> 00:30:52,799
of thing happen
 

1895
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:54,470
of thing happen
decent more than you would think more

1896
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:54,480
decent more than you would think more
 

1897
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,990
decent more than you would think more
than you would think there was no

1898
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:56,000
than you would think there was no
 

1899
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,509
than you would think there was no
significant panic this is like

1900
00:30:57,509 --> 00:30:57,519
significant panic this is like
 

1901
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,430
significant panic this is like
misunderstood this is what has to be

1902
00:30:59,430 --> 00:30:59,440
misunderstood this is what has to be
 

1903
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,430
misunderstood this is what has to be
done in this case i think i was probably

1904
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:01,440
done in this case i think i was probably
 

1905
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,950
done in this case i think i was probably
just too dumb to realize the

1906
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:02,960
just too dumb to realize the
 

1907
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,470
just too dumb to realize the
significance of it because as a new

1908
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
significance of it because as a new
 

1909
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,630
significance of it because as a new
student you know not really appreciating

1910
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,640
student you know not really appreciating
 

1911
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,149
student you know not really appreciating
you know just what is ahead of me if we

1912
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:08,159
you know just what is ahead of me if we
 

1913
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,830
you know just what is ahead of me if we
are rejecting um

1914
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:09,840
are rejecting um
 

1915
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,190
are rejecting um
but at the time it was more it was just

1916
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
but at the time it was more it was just
 

1917
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,549
but at the time it was more it was just
like wrote right because i was back

1918

like wrote right because i was back
 

1919
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,149
like wrote right because i was back
there and then i went from a observer

1920
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:14,159
there and then i went from a observer
 

1921
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,350
there and then i went from a observer
mode to a

1922

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,710
i'm going to provide you the help that i
can provide you as a member of this crew

1926
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:18,720
can provide you as a member of this crew
 

1927
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,110
can provide you as a member of this crew
you know mode and so it was less about

1928
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:21,120
you know mode and so it was less about
 

1929
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,430
you know mode and so it was less about
i'm you know on this 20-mile trip and

1930
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:23,440
i'm you know on this 20-mile trip and
 

1931
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,389
i'm you know on this 20-mile trip and
thinking about my um how vulnerable i am

1932
00:31:26,389 --> 00:31:26,399
thinking about my um how vulnerable i am
 

1933
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:27,669
thinking about my um how vulnerable i am
you know we're going through checklists

1934
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
you know we're going through checklists
 

1935
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,029
you know we're going through checklists
we're talking to people we're getting

1936
00:31:29,029 --> 00:31:29,039
we're talking to people we're getting
 

1937
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,230
we're talking to people we're getting
ready so

1938
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:30,240
ready so
 

1939
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,149
ready so
no it wasn't it wasn't fearful and the

1940
00:31:32,149 --> 00:31:32,159
no it wasn't it wasn't fearful and the
 

1941
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:33,669
no it wasn't it wasn't fearful and the
whole time we were doing one of these to

1942
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:33,679
whole time we were doing one of these to
 

1943
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,470
whole time we were doing one of these to
try to get the uh the gear down so we're

1944
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:36,480
try to get the uh the gear down so we're
 

1945
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,909
try to get the uh the gear down so we're
unloading the jet and then loading it

1946
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
unloading the jet and then loading it
 

1947
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,149
unloading the jet and then loading it
back to try to get the gear out

1948
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:40,159
back to try to get the gear out
 

1949
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,549
back to try to get the gear out
with the stick and um

1950
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:42,559
with the stick and um
 

1951
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,430
with the stick and um
and it came down it came down halfway um

1952
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
and it came down it came down halfway um
 

1953
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,230
and it came down it came down halfway um
there just on its own so we came back

1954
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:48,240
there just on its own so we came back
 

1955
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,149
there just on its own so we came back
around and we did like a safety trap in

1956
00:31:50,149 --> 00:31:50,159
around and we did like a safety trap in
 

1957
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,909
around and we did like a safety trap in
case there was a problem with the gear

1958
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:51,919
case there was a problem with the gear
 

1959
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,710
case there was a problem with the gear
and that was my first flight you know uh

1960
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:54,720
and that was my first flight you know uh
 

1961
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,470
and that was my first flight you know uh
a little bit of serendipity but i'm

1962
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
a little bit of serendipity but i'm
 

1963
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,230
a little bit of serendipity but i'm
gonna fast forward a bit and i went back

1964
00:31:58,230 --> 00:31:58,240
gonna fast forward a bit and i went back
 

1965
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,269
gonna fast forward a bit and i went back
to the squadron's instructor about five

1966
00:32:01,269 --> 00:32:01,279
to the squadron's instructor about five
 

1967
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,350
to the squadron's instructor about five
or six years later and i was an aviation

1968
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:03,360
or six years later and i was an aviation
 

1969
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,870
or six years later and i was an aviation
safety officer at this point which meant

1970
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
safety officer at this point which meant
 

1971
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,029
safety officer at this point which meant
i was responsible for investigating

1972
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:07,039
i was responsible for investigating
 

1973
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,230
i was responsible for investigating
mishaps

1974
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
mishaps
 

1975
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,669
mishaps
and

1976
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:09,679
and
 

1977
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,389
and
a a student went in and he he went in

1978
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:12,399
a a student went in and he he went in
 

1979
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,789
a a student went in and he he went in
the back seat of a form flight

1980
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:14,799
the back seat of a form flight
 

1981
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,789
the back seat of a form flight
just like the one i went on

1982
00:32:16,789 --> 00:32:16,799
just like the one i went on
 

1983
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,549
just like the one i went on
and he went out and he ended up

1984
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:18,559
and he went out and he ended up
 

1985
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,549
and he went out and he ended up
projecting on that flight exact same

1986
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
projecting on that flight exact same
 

1987
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,470
projecting on that flight exact same
type of flight they went out and they

1988
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
type of flight they went out and they
 

1989
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,110
type of flight they went out and they
had a runaway trim scenario and it

1990
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:25,120
had a runaway trim scenario and it
 

1991
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,310
had a runaway trim scenario and it
caused the aircraft essentially just

1992
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
caused the aircraft essentially just
 

1993
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,870
caused the aircraft essentially just
inverted itself almost 180 degrees

1994
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:28,880
inverted itself almost 180 degrees
 

1995
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,430
inverted itself almost 180 degrees
uh at about 600 feet over the ground and

1996
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
uh at about 600 feet over the ground and
 

1997
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,509
uh at about 600 feet over the ground and
they punched out just slightly outside

1998
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:33,519
they punched out just slightly outside
 

1999
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,590
they punched out just slightly outside
the ejection window at about 300 400

2000
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:35,600
the ejection window at about 300 400
 

2001
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,990
the ejection window at about 300 400
feet or so but they were completely fine

2002
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,000
feet or so but they were completely fine
 

2003
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:38,870
feet or so but they were completely fine
um

2004
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:38,880
um
 

2005
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,590
um
so you know and then about

2006
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
so you know and then about
 

2007
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,190
so you know and then about
two months later we had another ejection

2008
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
two months later we had another ejection
 

2009
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,470
two months later we had another ejection
about three months after that we had

2010
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:44,480
about three months after that we had
 

2011
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,990
about three months after that we had
another rejection so

2012
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:46,000
another rejection so
 

2013
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,549
another rejection so
um unfortunately you know it can it can

2014
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:48,559
um unfortunately you know it can it can
 

2015
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:50,070
um unfortunately you know it can it can
be more common that people think what

2016
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:50,080
be more common that people think what
 

2017
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,310
be more common that people think what
does it feel like to get ejected

2018
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
does it feel like to get ejected
 

2019
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,389
does it feel like to get ejected
thankfully i don't know i could describe

2020
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
thankfully i don't know i could describe
 

2021
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,110
thankfully i don't know i could describe
it to you i can tell you what it's like

2022
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,120
it to you i can tell you what it's like
 

2023
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,710
it to you i can tell you what it's like
from what i've heard but i truly think

2024
00:32:58,710 --> 00:32:58,720
from what i've heard but i truly think
 

2025
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,830
from what i've heard but i truly think
it's one of those things that you just

2026
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
it's one of those things that you just
 

2027
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,830
it's one of those things that you just
don't understand until it happens

2028
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:01,840
don't understand until it happens
 

2029
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,950
don't understand until it happens
uh it's like instantaneous about 250 g's

2030
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:04,960
uh it's like instantaneous about 250 g's
 

2031
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,149
uh it's like instantaneous about 250 g's
which is only possible because of

2032
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,159
which is only possible because of
 

2033
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,590
which is only possible because of
inertia in our blood

2034
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
inertia in our blood
 

2035
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,350
inertia in our blood
right so you can actually get like 250

2036
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:09,360
right so you can actually get like 250
 

2037
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,430
right so you can actually get like 250
300 g's for like a few milliseconds and

2038
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:11,440
300 g's for like a few milliseconds and
 

2039
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,990
300 g's for like a few milliseconds and
then it backs off to like 40 or 50 g's

2040
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
then it backs off to like 40 or 50 g's
 

2041
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,310
then it backs off to like 40 or 50 g's
to get you away from the vehicle itself

2042
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:16,320
to get you away from the vehicle itself
 

2043
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,269
to get you away from the vehicle itself
and so

2044
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:17,279
and so
 

2045
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:19,669
and so
um you know you may lose consciousness

2046
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:19,679
um you know you may lose consciousness
 

2047
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,269
um you know you may lose consciousness
um if you

2048
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:21,279
um if you
 

2049
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,430
um if you
do you know who knows where you wake up

2050
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:23,440
do you know who knows where you wake up
 

2051
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,950
do you know who knows where you wake up
um you know you could be in a tree you

2052
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:24,960
um you know you could be in a tree you
 

2053
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,789
um you know you could be in a tree you
could still be falling uh you could be

2054
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:26,799
could still be falling uh you could be
 

2055
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,870
could still be falling uh you could be
in the water so the physics of that is

2056
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:28,880
in the water so the physics of that is
 

2057
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,669
in the water so the physics of that is
fascinating how do you eject safely

2058
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:31,679
fascinating how do you eject safely
 

2059
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,350
fascinating how do you eject safely
do you know the story about how that was

2060
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
do you know the story about how that was
 

2061
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,509
do you know the story about how that was
tested at all i don't know the full

2062
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:35,519
tested at all i don't know the full
 

2063
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,029
tested at all i don't know the full
story but uh there was i'm guessing

2064
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:37,039
story but uh there was i'm guessing
 

2065
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,950
story but uh there was i'm guessing
nobody knows the full story there's

2066
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:38,960
nobody knows the full story there's
 

2067
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,269
nobody knows the full story there's
probably a lot of shady stuff going on

2068
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:41,279
probably a lot of shady stuff going on
 

2069
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,190
probably a lot of shady stuff going on
but anyway uh you mean like in the early

2070
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:43,200
but anyway uh you mean like in the early
 

2071
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,350
but anyway uh you mean like in the early
early days or they suck a flight dock up

2072
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:45,360
early days or they suck a flight dock up
 

2073
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,350
early days or they suck a flight dock up
to a rocket sled and just see how much

2074
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,360
to a rocket sled and just see how much
 

2075
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,029
to a rocket sled and just see how much
their body could take it

2076
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:49,039
their body could take it
 

2077
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,950
their body could take it
and he turned a lot of his body into in

2078
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:50,960
and he turned a lot of his body into in
 

2079
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,470
and he turned a lot of his body into in
the mush in the in the process of

2080
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:52,480
the mush in the in the process of
 

2081
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,909
the mush in the in the process of
getting that science done but he saved a

2082
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:53,919
getting that science done but he saved a
 

2083
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,590
getting that science done but he saved a
lot of life

2084
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
lot of life
 

2085
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,310
lot of life
people use it used to be tougher back in

2086
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:58,320
people use it used to be tougher back in
 

2087
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,789
people use it used to be tougher back in
the day

2088
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:00,799

 

2089
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:03,110

that's how science used to be done

2090
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:03,120
that's how science used to be done
 

2091
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,909
that's how science used to be done
um so how did your training continue so

2092
00:34:05,909 --> 00:34:05,919
um so how did your training continue so
 

2093
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,669
um so how did your training continue so
how did take me and take me farther

2094
00:34:07,669 --> 00:34:07,679
how did take me and take me farther
 

2095
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,669
how did take me and take me farther
through your career

2096
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:09,679
through your career
 

2097
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,909
through your career
uh as you work towards graduating

2098
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:11,919
uh as you work towards graduating
 

2099
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,790
uh as you work towards graduating
towards the f-18s so in vt9 where i was

2100
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:14,800
towards the f-18s so in vt9 where i was
 

2101
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,829
towards the f-18s so in vt9 where i was
a student

2102
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:15,839
a student
 

2103
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,030
a student
there's two phases there's an

2104
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:17,040
there's two phases there's an
 

2105
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,430
there's two phases there's an
intermediate and advanced

2106
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:19,440
intermediate and advanced
 

2107
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,270
intermediate and advanced
intermediate is getting very comfortable

2108
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:21,280
intermediate is getting very comfortable
 

2109
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,030
intermediate is getting very comfortable
with the aircraft and at that point you

2110
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,040
with the aircraft and at that point you
 

2111
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,790
with the aircraft and at that point you
truly hear all right you're going jets

2112
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:24,800
truly hear all right you're going jets
 

2113
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,430
truly hear all right you're going jets
now or you're gonna go one of the other

2114
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
now or you're gonna go one of the other
 

2115
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,950
now or you're gonna go one of the other
aircraft that land on the aircraft

2116
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:28,960
aircraft that land on the aircraft
 

2117
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,310
aircraft that land on the aircraft
carrier

2118
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:30,320
carrier
 

2119
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,990
carrier
i was told i was going to you know jets

2120
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:32,000
i was told i was going to you know jets
 

2121
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,629
i was told i was going to you know jets
at that point and then we go into

2122
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:34,639
at that point and then we go into
 

2123
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,230
at that point and then we go into
same squadron same aircraft same

2124
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
same squadron same aircraft same
 

2125
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,829
same squadron same aircraft same
instructors but it's called advanced now

2126
00:34:37,829 --> 00:34:37,839
instructors but it's called advanced now
 

2127
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,190
instructors but it's called advanced now
and now we're

2128
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,200
and now we're
 

2129
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,790
and now we're
learning how to dog fight for the first

2130
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:40,800
learning how to dog fight for the first
 

2131
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,149
learning how to dog fight for the first
time we're

2132
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:42,159
time we're
 

2133
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,230
time we're
doing what we call tactical formation

2134
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:44,240
doing what we call tactical formation
 

2135
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,750
doing what we call tactical formation
which is uh just like aggressive

2136
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:45,760
which is uh just like aggressive
 

2137
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,190
which is uh just like aggressive
position keeping

2138
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200
position keeping
 

2139
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,470
position keeping
um we are doing um

2140
00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:50,480
um we are doing um
 

2141
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,389
um we are doing um
dog fighting and low levels and all

2142
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:52,399
dog fighting and low levels and all
 

2143
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,069
dog fighting and low levels and all
sorts of great stuff so it's really that

2144
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,079
sorts of great stuff so it's really that
 

2145
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,589
sorts of great stuff so it's really that
first introduction to that tactical

2146
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
first introduction to that tactical
 

2147
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,510
first introduction to that tactical
environment and putting really putting

2148
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:57,520
environment and putting really putting
 

2149
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,109
environment and putting really putting
g's on the jet on your body and

2150
00:34:59,109 --> 00:34:59,119
g's on the jet on your body and
 

2151
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,349
g's on the jet on your body and
maneuvering is there like tactical

2152
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:01,359
maneuvering is there like tactical
 

2153
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:03,510
maneuvering is there like tactical
formation is collaborating with other

2154
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:03,520
formation is collaborating with other
 

2155
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,510
formation is collaborating with other
fighter jets a part of that it is so

2156
00:35:05,510 --> 00:35:05,520
fighter jets a part of that it is so
 

2157
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,270
fighter jets a part of that it is so
flying in a that's what you mean by

2158
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:07,280
flying in a that's what you mean by
 

2159
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,910
flying in a that's what you mean by
formation so literally having an

2160
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:09,920
formation so literally having an
 

2161
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,150
formation so literally having an
awareness all right is this done for you

2162
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:12,160
awareness all right is this done for you
 

2163
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,390
awareness all right is this done for you
or are you as a human supposed to

2164
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:14,400
or are you as a human supposed to
 

2165
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,470
or are you as a human supposed to
understand

2166
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:16,480
understand
 

2167
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,230
understand
like where you are in the formation how

2168
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:18,240
like where you are in the formation how
 

2169
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,670
like where you are in the formation how
to maintain formation all that kind of

2170
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:19,680
to maintain formation all that kind of
 

2171
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,150
to maintain formation all that kind of
stuff yeah is it done autonomously or

2172
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:22,160
stuff yeah is it done autonomously or
 

2173
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,310
stuff yeah is it done autonomously or
manually there's a great autonomy point

2174
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:24,320
manually there's a great autonomy point
 

2175
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,829
manually there's a great autonomy point
on the end of this i've thought about so

2176
00:35:25,829 --> 00:35:25,839
on the end of this i've thought about so
 

2177
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,589
on the end of this i've thought about so
but what we do it's all manual so i'm

2178
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
but what we do it's all manual so i'm
 

2179
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,109
but what we do it's all manual so i'm
looking at his wing

2180
00:35:29,109 --> 00:35:29,119
looking at his wing
 

2181
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,069
looking at his wing
and i'm looking at um different visual

2182
00:35:32,069 --> 00:35:32,079
and i'm looking at um different visual
 

2183
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,230
and i'm looking at um different visual
checkpoints that form like a triangle

2184
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
checkpoints that form like a triangle
 

2185
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,670
checkpoints that form like a triangle
right like an equal out triangle

2186
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:35,680
right like an equal out triangle
 

2187
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,990
right like an equal out triangle
essentially and then as that triangle

2188
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,000
essentially and then as that triangle
 

2189
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,990
essentially and then as that triangle
you know is no longer equal i can tell

2190
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:40,000
you know is no longer equal i can tell
 

2191
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,510
you know is no longer equal i can tell
my relative position against that

2192
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
my relative position against that
 

2193
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,430
my relative position against that
aircraft right that's really cool uh and

2194
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:43,440
aircraft right that's really cool uh and
 

2195
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,790
aircraft right that's really cool uh and
so that's what i'm staring at first

2196
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:44,800
so that's what i'm staring at first
 

2197
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,790
so that's what i'm staring at first
sometimes hours on end you know several

2198
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:46,800
sometimes hours on end you know several
 

2199
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,710
sometimes hours on end you know several
feet away doing with these if i'm in the

2200
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:48,720
feet away doing with these if i'm in the
 

2201
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,390
feet away doing with these if i'm in the
weather that's all it is

2202
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:50,400
weather that's all it is
 

2203
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,990
weather that's all it is
so you get it's almost like is it

2204
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
so you get it's almost like is it
 

2205
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,430
so you get it's almost like is it
peripheral vision or is it no we're

2206
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:53,440
peripheral vision or is it no we're
 

2207
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,430
peripheral vision or is it no we're
staring directly at it the peripheral is

2208
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
staring directly at it the peripheral is
 

2209
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,550
staring directly at it the peripheral is
coming on my on my um that's interesting

2210
00:35:58,550 --> 00:35:58,560
coming on my on my um that's interesting
 

2211
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,230
coming on my on my um that's interesting
stuff right my sensors and my

2212
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
stuff right my sensors and my
 

2213
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,870
stuff right my sensors and my
instruments and so here's my gyroscope

2214
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:02,880
instruments and so here's my gyroscope
 

2215
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,270
instruments and so here's my gyroscope
at that point right while you're flying

2216
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:05,280
at that point right while you're flying
 

2217
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,270
at that point right while you're flying
not looking straight correct i'm fly

2218
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:07,280
not looking straight correct i'm fly
 

2219
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,950
not looking straight correct i'm fly
like this for hours it can hurt your

2220
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:08,960
like this for hours it can hurt your
 

2221
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,270
like this for hours it can hurt your
neck we don't like doing this as much

2222
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
neck we don't like doing this as much
 

2223
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,870
neck we don't like doing this as much
and i don't think it's just me right

2224
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
and i don't think it's just me right
 

2225
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,150
and i don't think it's just me right
it's a weird thing where when you're

2226
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
it's a weird thing where when you're
 

2227
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,310
it's a weird thing where when you're
like this it's actually harder to fly

2228
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:16,320
like this it's actually harder to fly
 

2229
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,670
like this it's actually harder to fly
formation slightly than here because

2230
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:19,680
formation slightly than here because
 

2231
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,750
formation slightly than here because
being in line of your hand movements and

2232
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:21,760
being in line of your hand movements and
 

2233
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,349
being in line of your hand movements and
of the aircraft

2234
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:23,359
of the aircraft
 

2235
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,430
of the aircraft
somehow has an effect on our ability to

2236
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:25,440
somehow has an effect on our ability to
 

2237
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,030
somehow has an effect on our ability to
be more precise and comfortable it's

2238
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:27,040
be more precise and comfortable it's
 

2239
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,069
be more precise and comfortable it's
strange

2240
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:28,079
strange
 

2241
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,710
strange
uh yeah so but so the there's a symmetry

2242
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720
uh yeah so but so the there's a symmetry
 

2243
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,270
uh yeah so but so the there's a symmetry
to the formation usually so one of the

2244
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
to the formation usually so one of the
 

2245
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,950
to the formation usually so one of the
people on the other side really don't

2246
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:34,960
people on the other side really don't
 

2247
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,870
people on the other side really don't
like being on that side

2248
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:36,880
like being on that side
 

2249
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,270
like being on that side
is it is it does it who gets like the

2250
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:39,280
is it is it does it who gets like the
 

2251
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,510
is it is it does it who gets like the
short straw how do you decide which side

2252
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:41,520
short straw how do you decide which side
 

2253
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,270
short straw how do you decide which side
of the formation you are it's a good

2254
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
of the formation you are it's a good
 

2255
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,710
of the formation you are it's a good
question too because there's there's

2256
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720
question too because there's there's
 

2257
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,270
question too because there's there's
kind of rank in some sense so if it's a

2258
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,280
kind of rank in some sense so if it's a
 

2259
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,670
kind of rank in some sense so if it's a
four-person formation right you have the

2260
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:49,680
four-person formation right you have the
 

2261
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,349
four-person formation right you have the
division lead who's qualified to lead a

2262
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:51,359
division lead who's qualified to lead a
 

2263
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,870
division lead who's qualified to lead a
whole division but maybe the other ones

2264
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
whole division but maybe the other ones
 

2265
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,710
whole division but maybe the other ones
aren't and he has a dash too

2266
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:54,720
aren't and he has a dash too
 

2267
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,470
aren't and he has a dash too
and that's his wingman essentially and

2268
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:56,480
and that's his wingman essentially and
 

2269
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,670
and that's his wingman essentially and
then in a division there's two other

2270
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
then in a division there's two other
 

2271
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,190
then in a division there's two other
aircraft and then you have another

2272
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,200
aircraft and then you have another
 

2273
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,109
aircraft and then you have another
senior flight leader that's the dash

2274
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
senior flight leader that's the dash
 

2275
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,230
senior flight leader that's the dash
three position

2276
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:02,240
three position
 

2277
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,950
three position
and then you have dash four the last one

2278
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:04,960
and then you have dash four the last one
 

2279
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,710
and then you have dash four the last one
and if you are all lined up on one side

2280
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:06,720
and if you are all lined up on one side
 

2281
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,950
and if you are all lined up on one side
like fingertip one two three four that

2282
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:08,960
like fingertip one two three four that
 

2283
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,150
like fingertip one two three four that
dash four guy is going to be at the end

2284
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:10,160
dash four guy is going to be at the end
 

2285
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,829
dash four guy is going to be at the end
of that whip so if you're flying

2286
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:11,839
of that whip so if you're flying
 

2287
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,510
of that whip so if you're flying
formation each one's making you know

2288
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:13,520
formation each one's making you know
 

2289
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,910
formation each one's making you know
movements relative to the lead dash four

2290
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
movements relative to the lead dash four
 

2291
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,990
movements relative to the lead dash four
is kind of you know at the end of that

2292
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,000
is kind of you know at the end of that
 

2293
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,230
is kind of you know at the end of that
error you know and so his movements are

2294
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:20,240
error you know and so his movements are
 

2295
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,589
error you know and so his movements are
kind of like a whip it's very difficult

2296
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:21,599
kind of like a whip it's very difficult
 

2297
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,270
kind of like a whip it's very difficult
to fly in that position and close can

2298
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,280
to fly in that position and close can
 

2299
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,870
to fly in that position and close can
you elaborate is it because of the air

2300
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
you elaborate is it because of the air
 

2301
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,950
you elaborate is it because of the air
the aerodynamics what's the whip if this

2302
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:26,960
the aerodynamics what's the whip if this
 

2303
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,550
the aerodynamics what's the whip if this
is the flight lead and this is dash two

2304
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:28,560
is the flight lead and this is dash two
 

2305
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,910
is the flight lead and this is dash two
you know flightly is rock steady and

2306
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:29,920
you know flightly is rock steady and
 

2307
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,510
you know flightly is rock steady and
just doing his thing yeah flight two is

2308
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:31,520
just doing his thing yeah flight two is
 

2309
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,950
just doing his thing yeah flight two is
going to be working that triangle moving

2310
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:32,960
going to be working that triangle moving
 

2311
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,790
going to be working that triangle moving
a little bit right and he has this small

2312
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:34,800
a little bit right and he has this small
 

2313
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,550
a little bit right and he has this small
air bubble that he's doing his best to

2314
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:36,560
air bubble that he's doing his best to
 

2315
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,470
air bubble that he's doing his best to
stay and then but dash three is flying

2316
00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:38,480
stay and then but dash three is flying
 

2317
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,550
stay and then but dash three is flying
off dash too and so his air bubble is

2318
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:40,560
off dash too and so his air bubble is
 

2319
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,630
off dash too and so his air bubble is
dash two's plus his own

2320
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
dash two's plus his own
 

2321
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,510
dash two's plus his own
and that's

2322
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
and that's
 

2323
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,109
and that's
more and more stressful as you get

2324
00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:45,119
more and more stressful as you get
 

2325
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,710
more and more stressful as you get
further yeah

2326
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:46,720
further yeah
 

2327
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:49,430
further yeah
okay um what's the experience of that

2328
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:49,440
okay um what's the experience of that
 

2329
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,150
okay um what's the experience of that
staring for long periods of time

2330
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:52,160
staring for long periods of time
 

2331
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,630
staring for long periods of time
and trying to maintain formation

2332
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:54,640
and trying to maintain formation
 

2333
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,670
and trying to maintain formation
how stressful is that because like

2334
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:57,680
how stressful is that because like
 

2335
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,670
how stressful is that because like
you know we're doing that when we drive

2336
00:37:59,670 --> 00:37:59,680
you know we're doing that when we drive
 

2337
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,510
you know we're doing that when we drive
staying in lane

2338
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:01,520
staying in lane
 

2339
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,349
staying in lane
and that becomes

2340
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
and that becomes
 

2341
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,109
and that becomes
after you get pretty good at it it

2342
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:05,119
after you get pretty good at it it
 

2343
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,230
after you get pretty good at it it
becomes somewhat it's still stressful

2344
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:08,240
becomes somewhat it's still stressful
 

2345
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,109
becomes somewhat it's still stressful
um

2346
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:09,119
um
 

2347
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:10,550
um
which actually surprisingly stressful

2348
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:10,560
which actually surprisingly stressful
 

2349
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,390
which actually surprisingly stressful
when you look at like lane keeping

2350
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
when you look at like lane keeping
 

2351
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,310
when you look at like lane keeping
systems they actually relieve that

2352
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,320
systems they actually relieve that
 

2353
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,069
systems they actually relieve that
stress somehow and it actually creates a

2354
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
stress somehow and it actually creates a
 

2355
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:17,430
stress somehow and it actually creates a
much more

2356
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,440
much more
 

2357
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,870
much more
pleasant experience while you're still

2358
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:18,880
pleasant experience while you're still
 

2359
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,790
pleasant experience while you're still
able to maintain situational awareness

2360
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
able to maintain situational awareness
 

2361
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,750
able to maintain situational awareness
and like

2362
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
and like
 

2363
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,750
and like
stay awake which is really interesting

2364
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:23,760
stay awake which is really interesting
 

2365
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,349
stay awake which is really interesting
like i don't think people realize how

2366
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:25,359
like i don't think people realize how
 

2367
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,750
like i don't think people realize how
stressful it is to lane keep

2368
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:27,760
stressful it is to lane keep
 

2369
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,910
stressful it is to lane keep
when they drive so this is even more

2370
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:29,920
when they drive so this is even more
 

2371
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,390
when they drive so this is even more
stressful so are you

2372
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
stressful so are you
 

2373
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,950
stressful so are you
do you do you think about that or is

2374
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:34,960
do you do you think about that or is
 

2375
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,190
do you do you think about that or is
this um yeah i guess how stressful is it

2376
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:37,200
this um yeah i guess how stressful is it
 

2377
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,510
this um yeah i guess how stressful is it
from a psychology perspective it's very

2378
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,520
from a psychology perspective it's very
 

2379
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,589
from a psychology perspective it's very
stressful uh when

2380
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:41,599
stressful uh when
 

2381
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,109
stressful uh when
so i taught students how to do this as

2382
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:43,119
so i taught students how to do this as
 

2383
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:44,829
so i taught students how to do this as
well and so at our feet we have two

2384
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:44,839
well and so at our feet we have two
 

2385
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:47,510
well and so at our feet we have two
writers and if i'm flying off a flight

2386
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:47,520
writers and if i'm flying off a flight
 

2387
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,589
writers and if i'm flying off a flight
lead over here what you'll find a lot of

2388
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:49,599
lead over here what you'll find a lot of
 

2389
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,670
lead over here what you'll find a lot of
times is you'll be flying or you like if

2390
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:51,680
times is you'll be flying or you like if
 

2391
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,710
times is you'll be flying or you like if
i'm the structure and the students

2392
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
i'm the structure and the students
 

2393
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,470
i'm the structure and the students
flying i'll start to notice that he's

2394
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:54,480
flying i'll start to notice that he's
 

2395
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,910
flying i'll start to notice that he's
having a harder and harder time keeping

2396
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:55,920
having a harder and harder time keeping
 

2397
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,430
having a harder and harder time keeping
position yeah and what i'll notice

2398
00:38:57,430 --> 00:38:57,440
position yeah and what i'll notice
 

2399
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,670
position yeah and what i'll notice
typically is he's locked out his leg

2400
00:38:59,670 --> 00:38:59,680
typically is he's locked out his leg
 

2401
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,589
typically is he's locked out his leg
they'll lock out the leg that's closest

2402
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:01,599
they'll lock out the leg that's closest
 

2403
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,589
they'll lock out the leg that's closest
to the aircraft they're flying against

2404
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:03,599
to the aircraft they're flying against
 

2405
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,829
to the aircraft they're flying against
and push on the rudder subconsciously

2406
00:39:05,829 --> 00:39:05,839
and push on the rudder subconsciously
 

2407
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:06,870
and push on the rudder subconsciously
because their whole body's trying to get

2408
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:06,880
because their whole body's trying to get
 

2409
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,910
because their whole body's trying to get
away from the aircraft because they're

2410
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:07,920
away from the aircraft because they're
 

2411
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,829
away from the aircraft because they're
so uncomfortable getting close to it

2412
00:39:09,829 --> 00:39:09,839
so uncomfortable getting close to it
 

2413
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,670
so uncomfortable getting close to it
and so i'll tell them i can i can fix

2414
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:11,680
and so i'll tell them i can i can fix
 

2415
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,950
and so i'll tell them i can i can fix
their form with just a couple words

2416
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960
their form with just a couple words
 

2417
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,710
their form with just a couple words
they'll say wiggle your toes

2418
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:14,720
they'll say wiggle your toes
 

2419
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,829
they'll say wiggle your toes
and they'll wiggle their toes and

2420
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:15,839
and they'll wiggle their toes and
 

2421
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:17,030
and they'll wiggle their toes and
they'll reel out and they'll loosen all

2422
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:17,040
they'll reel out and they'll loosen all
 

2423
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,550
they'll reel out and they'll loosen all
the muscles in their legs

2424
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
the muscles in their legs
 

2425
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,990
the muscles in their legs
they've been locked up and their

2426
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:20,000
they've been locked up and their
 

2427
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,670
they've been locked up and their
formation flying will get a lot better

2428
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:21,680
formation flying will get a lot better
 

2429
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,069
formation flying will get a lot better
uh and so you know there's a lot of

2430
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:24,079
uh and so you know there's a lot of
 

2431
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,230
uh and so you know there's a lot of
stress associated with that there's some

2432
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:26,240
stress associated with that there's some
 

2433
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,910
stress associated with that there's some
interesting

2434
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:27,920
interesting
 

2435
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,589
interesting
psychological or

2436
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:29,599
psychological or
 

2437
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,750
psychological or
visual

2438
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:31,760
visual
 

2439
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,670
visual
issues such as um

2440
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:33,680
issues such as um
 

2441
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,670
issues such as um
vertigo as you're flying so if you're

2442
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:35,680
vertigo as you're flying so if you're
 

2443
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,430
vertigo as you're flying so if you're
flying with him and then you fly right

2444
00:39:37,430 --> 00:39:37,440
flying with him and then you fly right
 

2445
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,190
flying with him and then you fly right
into a cloud right that's when it's very

2446
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
into a cloud right that's when it's very
 

2447
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,390
into a cloud right that's when it's very
stressful because you have to be very

2448
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:40,400
stressful because you have to be very
 

2449
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,069
stressful because you have to be very
close in order to maintain visual you

2450
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:42,079
close in order to maintain visual you
 

2451
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:44,230
close in order to maintain visual you
might be on thunderstorm right

2452
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:44,240
might be on thunderstorm right
 

2453
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,589
might be on thunderstorm right
and so you have to be very tight you

2454
00:39:45,589 --> 00:39:45,599
and so you have to be very tight you
 

2455
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,109
and so you have to be very tight you
might start raining

2456
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
might start raining
 

2457
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:49,030
might start raining
and then he's turning but you might not

2458
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,040
and then he's turning but you might not
 

2459
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,230
and then he's turning but you might not
even know that

2460
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,240
even know that
 

2461
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,510
even know that
you might not even be able to see that

2462
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:51,520
you might not even be able to see that
 

2463
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,750
you might not even be able to see that
turn and so all of a sudden you might

2464
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:53,760
turn and so all of a sudden you might
 

2465
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,190
turn and so all of a sudden you might
look while you're in a turn thinking you

2466
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
look while you're in a turn thinking you
 

2467
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,030
look while you're in a turn thinking you
were straight level and you look

2468
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,040
were straight level and you look
 

2469
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,390
were straight level and you look
just maybe back at your instruments very

2470
00:39:58,390 --> 00:39:58,400
just maybe back at your instruments very
 

2471
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,510
just maybe back at your instruments very
quick and you realize you're like in a

2472
00:39:59,510 --> 00:39:59,520
quick and you realize you're like in a
 

2473
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,870
quick and you realize you're like in a
30 degree turn

2474
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
30 degree turn
 

2475
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,790
30 degree turn
and your whole concept of where you are

2476
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:02,800
and your whole concept of where you are
 

2477
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,829
and your whole concept of where you are
in the world

2478
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
in the world
 

2479
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,069
in the world
starts getting very confused and you

2480
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:06,079
starts getting very confused and you
 

2481
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,630
starts getting very confused and you
immediately get this this sense of

2482
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:08,640
immediately get this this sense of
 

2483
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,710
immediately get this this sense of
it it's weird like i look at the hud and

2484
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:10,720
it it's weird like i look at the hud and
 

2485
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,710
it it's weird like i look at the hud and
it it feels all my sensor telling me

2486
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:12,720
it it feels all my sensor telling me
 

2487
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,069
it it feels all my sensor telling me
it's spinning but it's not you know and

2488
00:40:14,069 --> 00:40:14,079
it's spinning but it's not you know and
 

2489
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,829
it's spinning but it's not you know and
so i have to trust my instruments even

2490
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:15,839
so i have to trust my instruments even
 

2491
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,950
so i have to trust my instruments even
though it feels like it's spinning and

2492
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:16,960
though it feels like it's spinning and
 

2493
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,470
though it feels like it's spinning and
the same thing can happen

2494
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:18,480
the same thing can happen
 

2495
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,750
the same thing can happen
when you're flying formation off of

2496
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:19,760
when you're flying formation off of
 

2497
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,470
when you're flying formation off of
someone and it it can be very um

2498
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:22,480
someone and it it can be very um
 

2499
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,030
someone and it it can be very um
very dangerous and um disorientating but

2500
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:25,040
very dangerous and um disorientating but
 

2501
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,550
very dangerous and um disorientating but
the point is to

2502
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:26,560
the point is to
 

2503
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,309
the point is to
try to regain

2504
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:28,319
try to regain
 

2505
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:30,069
try to regain
awareness by trusting the instruments

2506
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
awareness by trusting the instruments
 

2507
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,270
awareness by trusting the instruments
like

2508
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:31,280
like
 

2509
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,910
like
like distrust all your human senses and

2510
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:33,920
like distrust all your human senses and
 

2511
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,829
like distrust all your human senses and
just use the instruments to rebuild

2512
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
just use the instruments to rebuild
 

2513
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,829
just use the instruments to rebuild
situational awareness not in this

2514
00:40:37,829 --> 00:40:37,839
situational awareness not in this
 

2515
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,470
situational awareness not in this
particular case because our situational

2516
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:40,480
particular case because our situational
 

2517
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,309
particular case because our situational
awareness is based it's predicated off

2518
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:42,319
awareness is based it's predicated off
 

2519
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:43,750
awareness is based it's predicated off
of our flight lead so in a sense i'm

2520
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:43,760
of our flight lead so in a sense i'm
 

2521
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,829
of our flight lead so in a sense i'm
just trusting his movements and so he's

2522
00:40:45,829 --> 00:40:45,839
just trusting his movements and so he's
 

2523
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,430
just trusting his movements and so he's
my gyroscope but you're absolutely right

2524
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:47,440
my gyroscope but you're absolutely right
 

2525
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,870
my gyroscope but you're absolutely right
if i was by myself i would trust my

2526
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:48,880
if i was by myself i would trust my
 

2527
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,790
if i was by myself i would trust my
instruments but i can't just stop flying

2528
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:50,800
instruments but i can't just stop flying
 

2529
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,150
instruments but i can't just stop flying
form and trust my instruments because

2530
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:52,160
form and trust my instruments because
 

2531
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,270
form and trust my instruments because
now i'm going to hit him oh yeah you

2532
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
now i'm going to hit him oh yeah you
 

2533
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,950
now i'm going to hit him oh yeah you
have to pay attention so he's my

2534
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:54,960
have to pay attention so he's my
 

2535
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,109
have to pay attention so he's my
reference so the instruments are not

2536
00:40:57,109 --> 00:40:57,119
reference so the instruments are not
 

2537
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:59,109
reference so the instruments are not
helping you significantly with his

2538
00:40:59,109 --> 00:40:59,119
helping you significantly with his
 

2539
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,109
helping you significantly with his
positioning not it's all completely

2540
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:01,119
positioning not it's all completely
 

2541
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,390

manual
 

2543
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,030
manual
so i is there a future where some of

2544
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,040
so i is there a future where some of
 

2545
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,550
so i is there a future where some of
that is autonomous yeah and i've thought

2546
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:06,560
that is autonomous yeah and i've thought
 

2547
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,069
that is autonomous yeah and i've thought
about automating that flight um regime

2548
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:10,079
about automating that flight um regime
 

2549
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,069
about automating that flight um regime
but when i started thinking about it

2550
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:12,079
but when i started thinking about it
 

2551
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:13,670
but when i started thinking about it
i you know realized that all the

2552
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:13,680
i you know realized that all the
 

2553
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,910
i you know realized that all the
formation keeping that we do

2554
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:15,920
formation keeping that we do
 

2555
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,589
formation keeping that we do
uh is designed to enhance the

2556
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
uh is designed to enhance the
 

2557
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,990
uh is designed to enhance the
aviator's

2558
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:22,000
aviator's
 

2559
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,829
aviator's
ability to maintain sight right so we

2560
00:41:23,829 --> 00:41:23,839
ability to maintain sight right so we
 

2561
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:25,510
ability to maintain sight right so we
fly very tight formation so that we can

2562
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:25,520
fly very tight formation so that we can
 

2563
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,309
fly very tight formation so that we can
go in weather and to reduce

2564
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:28,319
go in weather and to reduce
 

2565
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,309
go in weather and to reduce
groups of traffic coming into the boat

2566
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:30,319
groups of traffic coming into the boat
 

2567
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:31,670
groups of traffic coming into the boat
we fly

2568
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:31,680
we fly
 

2569
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,910
we fly
in one particular position so that all

2570
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
in one particular position so that all
 

2571
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,309
in one particular position so that all
of all of the flight crew can look down

2572
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:36,319
of all of the flight crew can look down
 

2573
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,150
of all of the flight crew can look down
the line and see the flight lead so

2574
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
the line and see the flight lead so
 

2575
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,589
the line and see the flight lead so
everything is based

2576
00:41:39,589 --> 00:41:39,599
everything is based
 

2577
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,430
everything is based
everything has to do with

00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:41,440
everything has to do with
 

2579
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,230
everything has to do with
the two air crew visually maintaining

00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:56,800
as i'm looking into automating this
 

2595
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,150
as i'm looking into automating this
process i thought

00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,160
process i thought
 

2597
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,430
process i thought
well you know

2598
00:41:59,430 --> 00:41:59,440
well you know
 

2599
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,270
well you know
sure it's easy to get a bunch of

2605
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,710
other right it's it's trivial but why
you know what is the best formation why

2606
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:06,720
you know what is the best formation why
 

2607
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,390
you know what is the best formation why
are they doing that and that opened up a

2608
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:08,400
are they doing that and that opened up a
 

2609
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,710
are they doing that and that opened up a
much more interesting regime of

2610
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:10,720
much more interesting regime of
 

2611
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,390
much more interesting regime of
operations and flight mechanics and

2612
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:12,400
operations and flight mechanics and
 

2613
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,829
operations and flight mechanics and
that's when we get back to that kind of

2614
00:42:13,829 --> 00:42:13,839
that's when we get back to that kind of
 

2615
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:15,990
that's when we get back to that kind of
stochastic mindset where we can bring in

2616
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:16,000
stochastic mindset where we can bring in

00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:20,480
flying or reduce congestion around
 

2621
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,150
flying or reduce congestion around
airports but when we consider flying in

2622
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
airports but when we consider flying in
 

2623
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,550
airports but when we consider flying in
a formation and tactical environment we

2624
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:24,560
a formation and tactical environment we
 

2625
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,990
a formation and tactical environment we
can be much more effective with

2626
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:26,000
can be much more effective with
 

2627
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,990
can be much more effective with
non-traditional formation keeping or

2628
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,000
non-traditional formation keeping or
 

2629
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,230
non-traditional formation keeping or
perhaps no formation keeping perhaps so

2630
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:30,240
perhaps no formation keeping perhaps so
 

2631
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,790
perhaps no formation keeping perhaps so
autonomy used for formation keeping not

2632
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:32,800
autonomy used for formation keeping not
 

2633
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,950
autonomy used for formation keeping not
for convenience but for the introduction

2634
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:34,960
for convenience but for the introduction
 

2635
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,430
for convenience but for the introduction
of randomness that's hard too real-time

mission planner yeah

2638
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:38,880
mission planner yeah
 

2639
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,390
mission planner yeah
and then that's where you also have some

2640
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
and then that's where you also have some
 

2641
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,589
and then that's where you also have some
human

00:42:41,589 --> 00:42:41,599
human
 

2643
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:43,829
human
modifications so it's like

2644
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:43,839
modifications so it's like
 

2645
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,109
modifications so it's like
man unmanned teaming enters that picture

man unmanned teaming enters that picture
 

2647
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,470
man unmanned teaming enters that picture
so you use some of the

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,230
the most
fascinating

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:12,230
that semi-autonomous dance that you see
in these semi-autonomous vehicle systems

of a fighter jet especially when you're
 

2677
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,870
of a fighter jet especially when you're
flying fast it's

2678
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
flying fast it's
 

2679
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:23,910
flying fast it's
i mean

2680
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:23,920
i mean
 

2681
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,430
i mean
in a split second you have to make all

2682
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
in a split second you have to make all
 

2683
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,109
in a split second you have to make all
these kinds of decisions and

2684
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:27,119
these kinds of decisions and
 

2685
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,670
these kinds of decisions and
it feels like an ai system can do

2686
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
it feels like an ai system can do
 

2687
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,829
it feels like an ai system can do
as much harm as it can help and so to

2688
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
as much harm as it can help and so to
 

2689
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,430
as much harm as it can help and so to
get that right

2690
00:43:33,430 --> 00:43:33,440
get that right
 

2691
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,670
get that right
is a really fascinating challenge one of

2692
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:35,680
is a really fascinating challenge one of
 

2693
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,270
is a really fascinating challenge one of
the challenges too isn't just the the

2694
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:37,280
the challenges too isn't just the the
 

2695
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,030
the challenges too isn't just the the
algorithms of the autonomy itself but

2696
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:39,040
algorithms of the autonomy itself but
 

2697
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,510
algorithms of the autonomy itself but
how it senses the environment

2698
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:41,520
how it senses the environment
 

2699
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:43,510
how it senses the environment
that of course is going to what be what

2700
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
that of course is going to what be what
 

2701
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,109
that of course is going to what be what
all these decisions are based off of and

2702
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:45,119
all these decisions are based off of and
 

2703
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:46,950
all these decisions are based off of and
that's a challenge in this type of

2704
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:46,960
that's a challenge in this type of
 

2705
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,630
that's a challenge in this type of
environment well i gotta ask so uh f18

2706
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:50,640
environment well i gotta ask so uh f18
 

2707
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,950
environment well i gotta ask so uh f18
what's it like to fly a fighter jet as

2708
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:52,960
what's it like to fly a fighter jet as
 

2709
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,390
what's it like to fly a fighter jet as
best i mean what to you is

00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
best i mean what to you is
 

2711
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,550
best i mean what to you is
beautiful powerful

2712
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,560
beautiful powerful
 

2713
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,550
beautiful powerful
what do you love about the experience of

2714
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:00,560
what do you love about the experience of
 

2715
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:02,069
what do you love about the experience of
flying

2716
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
flying
 

2717
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,829
flying
for me you know and i think i'm an

2718
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:03,839
for me you know and i think i'm an
 

2719
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:07,190
for me you know and i think i'm an
outlier a bit it wasn't necessarily the

2720
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
outlier a bit it wasn't necessarily the
 

2721
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,710
outlier a bit it wasn't necessarily the
flying itself right it wasn't

2722
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:08,720
flying itself right it wasn't
 

2723
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,870
flying itself right it wasn't
necessarily the the soaring over the

2724
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
necessarily the the soaring over the
 

2725
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,150
necessarily the the soaring over the
clouds

2726
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
clouds
 

2727
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,470
clouds
and you know looking down at the earth

2728
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:14,480
and you know looking down at the earth
 

2729
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,030
and you know looking down at the earth
from upside down you know i i came to

2730
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
from upside down you know i i came to
 

2731
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,790
from upside down you know i i came to
love that and but it wasn't necessarily

2732
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
love that and but it wasn't necessarily
 

2733
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,069
love that and but it wasn't necessarily
the passion that drove me there i just

2734
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:20,079
the passion that drove me there i just
 

2735
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,390
the passion that drove me there i just
had no exposure to that the only exp the

2736
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
had no exposure to that the only exp the
 

2737
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,990
had no exposure to that the only exp the
exposure i had was

2738
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,000
exposure i had was
 

2739
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,230
exposure i had was
was reading and going in the woods and

2740
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:26,240
was reading and going in the woods and
 

2741
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,630
was reading and going in the woods and
and science fiction and and all that and

2742
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:28,640
and science fiction and and all that and
 

2743
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,470
and science fiction and and all that and
so you know what seemed to kind of drive

2744
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
so you know what seemed to kind of drive
 

2745
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,870
so you know what seemed to kind of drive
me towards that was just

2746
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:32,880
me towards that was just
 

2747
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,030
me towards that was just
a desire to really be operating as close

2748
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
a desire to really be operating as close
 

2749
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,349
a desire to really be operating as close
to what i thought was the edge of

2750
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:37,359
to what i thought was the edge of
 

2751
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:39,349
to what i thought was the edge of
technology or science and that's the

2752
00:44:39,349 --> 00:44:39,359
technology or science and that's the
 

2753
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:41,030
technology or science and that's the
path that i chose to try to get close to

2754
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,040
path that i chose to try to get close to
 

2755
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:43,109
path that i chose to try to get close to
that i thought that being in a in a

2756
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:43,119
that i thought that being in a in a
 

2757
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,230
that i thought that being in a in a
fighter jet

2758
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:44,240
fighter jet
 

2759
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,349
fighter jet
uh and you know all the tools and the

2760
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
uh and you know all the tools and the
 

2761
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,270
uh and you know all the tools and the
technology and the

2762
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:49,280
technology and the
 

2763
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,069
technology and the
knowledge and the challenges and the you

2764
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
knowledge and the challenges and the you
 

2765
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:53,589
knowledge and the challenges and the you
know failures and victories that would

2766
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:53,599
know failures and victories that would
 

2767
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,349
know failures and victories that would
come with that just seemed like

2768
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
come with that just seemed like
 

2769
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,790
come with that just seemed like
something that

2770
00:44:56,790 --> 00:44:56,800
something that
 

2771
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,190
something that
i wanted to be a part of uh and it

2772
00:44:59,190 --> 00:44:59,200
i wanted to be a part of uh and it
 

2773
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,630
i wanted to be a part of uh and it
wasn't necessarily about the flying but

2774
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:00,640
wasn't necessarily about the flying but
 

2775
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,630
wasn't necessarily about the flying but
it was about the challenge and

2776
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:02,640
it was about the challenge and
 

2777
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,270
it was about the challenge and
like i said as a person from a small

2778
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:05,280
like i said as a person from a small
 

2779
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,430
like i said as a person from a small
town you know small high school

2780
00:45:07,430 --> 00:45:07,440
town you know small high school
 

2781
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,270
town you know small high school
being able to get my hands you know or

2782
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:09,280
being able to get my hands you know or
 

2783
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,270
being able to get my hands you know or
even just near something of such

2784
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:11,280
even just near something of such
 

2785
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,150
even just near something of such
technological significance was kind of

2786
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
technological significance was kind of
 

2787
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,910
technological significance was kind of
empowering for me and that's kind of

2788
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:15,920
empowering for me and that's kind of
 

2789
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,990
empowering for me and that's kind of
what bore the love of flight from there

2790
00:45:17,990 --> 00:45:18,000
what bore the love of flight from there
 

2791
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,910
what bore the love of flight from there
you know becoming you know having some

2792
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:19,920
you know becoming you know having some
 

2793
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,910
you know becoming you know having some
level of mastery in that aircraft it

2794
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:21,920
level of mastery in that aircraft it
 

2795
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,510
level of mastery in that aircraft it
really feels like an extension of your

2796
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
really feels like an extension of your
 

2797
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,069
really feels like an extension of your
body and once i got there then then the

2798
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:26,079
body and once i got there then then the
 

2799
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,589
body and once i got there then then the
kind of the level flying kind of

2800
00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:27,599
kind of the level flying kind of
 

2801
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,710
kind of the level flying kind of
followed

2802
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:28,720
followed
 

2803
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:31,829
followed
so you sort of one is the man mastery

2804
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:31,839
so you sort of one is the man mastery
 

2805
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:33,829
so you sort of one is the man mastery
over the machine and second is the

2806
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:33,839
over the machine and second is the
 

2807
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,430
over the machine and second is the
machine is like the greatest thing that

2808
00:45:35,430 --> 00:45:35,440
machine is like the greatest thing that
 

2809
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,309
machine is like the greatest thing that
humans have ever created arguably the

2810
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:38,319
humans have ever created arguably the
 

2811
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,470
humans have ever created arguably the
the like things that lockheed martin and

2812
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:40,480
the like things that lockheed martin and
 

2813
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,750
the like things that lockheed martin and
others have built

2814
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:41,760
others have built
 

2815
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,349
others have built
i mean the engineering in that yeah it's

2816
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:45,359
i mean the engineering in that yeah it's
 

2817
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:46,390
i mean the engineering in that yeah it's
um

2818
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:46,400
um
 

2819
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,630
um
however you feel about war

2820
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
however you feel about war
 

2821
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,069
however you feel about war
which is one of the sad things about

2822
00:45:50,069 --> 00:45:50,079
which is one of the sad things about
 

2823
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,710
which is one of the sad things about
human civilization is

2824
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:52,720
human civilization is
 

2825
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,750
human civilization is
um

2826
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:53,760
um
 

2827
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,790
um
war inspires the engineering of tools

2828
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:56,800
war inspires the engineering of tools
 

2829
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,750
war inspires the engineering of tools
that are

2830
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
that are
 

2831
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,270
that are
incredible

2832
00:45:59,270 --> 00:45:59,280
incredible
 

2833
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:00,790
incredible
and it's like

2834
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:00,800
and it's like
 

2835
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,030
and it's like
maybe without war if we look at human

2836
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:03,040
maybe without war if we look at human
 

2837
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,790
maybe without war if we look at human
history we would not build some of the

2838
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:04,800
history we would not build some of the
 

2839
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,109
history we would not build some of the
incredible things we built so in order

2840
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:07,119
incredible things we built so in order
 

2841
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:07,829
incredible things we built so in order
to

2842
00:46:07,829 --> 00:46:07,839
to
 

2843
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:10,390
to
win wars to stop wars we build these

2844
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
win wars to stop wars we build these
 

2845
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,150
win wars to stop wars we build these
incredible systems

2846
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:12,160
incredible systems
 

2847
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,790
incredible systems
that perhaps propagate war

2848
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:14,800
that perhaps propagate war
 

2849
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,390
that perhaps propagate war
and that's a that's another discussion

2850
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:16,400
and that's a that's another discussion
 

2851
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,230
and that's a that's another discussion
i'll ask you about but this

2852
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:18,240
i'll ask you about but this
 

2853
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,870
i'll ask you about but this
do you this is like um

2854
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:20,880
do you this is like um
 

2855
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,870
do you this is like um
this is a chance to experience the

2856
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
this is a chance to experience the
 

2857
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,430
this is a chance to experience the
greatest engineering humans have ever

2858
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:25,440
greatest engineering humans have ever
 

2859
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,990
greatest engineering humans have ever
been able to do

2860
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:28,000
been able to do
 

2861
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,150
been able to do
like similar i suppose that astronauts

2862
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:30,160
like similar i suppose that astronauts
 

2863
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,069
like similar i suppose that astronauts
feel like when they're flying i wanted

2864
00:46:32,069 --> 00:46:32,079
feel like when they're flying i wanted
 

2865
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:33,589
feel like when they're flying i wanted
to be an astronaut i wanted to take that

2866
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
to be an astronaut i wanted to take that
 

2867
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,390
to be an astronaut i wanted to take that
route

2868
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,400
route
 

2869
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,309
route
uh i was gonna apply to test pilot

2870
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:36,319
uh i was gonna apply to test pilot
 

2871
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:37,270

about uap
 

2915
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:18,550
about uap
while i was you know i that led me to

2916
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:18,560
while i was you know i that led me to
 

2917
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,990
while i was you know i that led me to
the decision to get out once i went

the decision to get out once i went
 

2919
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,349
the decision to get out once i went
there and

there and
 

2921
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,750
there and
it it kind of enabled me to talk about

2922
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
it it kind of enabled me to talk about
 

2923
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,390
it it kind of enabled me to talk about
uap more publicly

2924
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:26,400
uap more publicly
 

2925
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,390

and if i stayed in the navy then i don't

2926
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:28,400
and if i stayed in the navy then i don't
 

2927
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:29,430
and if i stayed in the navy then i don't
think that would have happened i

2928
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:29,440
think that would have happened i
 

2929

think that would have happened i
wouldn't have been able to

2930

wouldn't have been able to
 

2931

wouldn't have been able to
if i went that route

2932

now today now i have some hesitations
 

2953
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,030
now today now i have some hesitations
and i have some hesitations because

2954
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,040
and i have some hesitations because
 

2955
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,349
and i have some hesitations because
i'm hopeful and optimistic and i think

2956

i'm hopeful and optimistic and i think
 

2957
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:57,829
i'm hopeful and optimistic and i think
that you know i think that we are truly

information and data
in in this last century we're going to

2968
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:09,440
in in this last century we're going to
 

2969
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,270
in in this last century we're going to
be manipulating and managing matter in

2970
00:48:11,270 --> 00:48:11,280
be manipulating and managing matter in
 

2971
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:13,670
be manipulating and managing matter in
that next century and so i think that i

2972
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:13,680
that next century and so i think that i
 

2973
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,670
that next century and so i think that i
think our reach as human as humans are

think our reach as human as humans are
 

2975
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,349
think our reach as human as humans are
going to get a lot wider a lot faster

2976
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
going to get a lot wider a lot faster
 

2977
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,670
going to get a lot wider a lot faster
than people may realize or at least

2978
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:19,680
than people may realize or at least
 

2979

you're saying well i mean
 

2985
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,470
you're saying well i mean
like mars seems kind of boring i want to

like mars seems kind of boring i want to
 

2987
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,309
like mars seems kind of boring i want to
go beyond that is that we

2988
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:28,319
go beyond that is that we
 

2989
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,270
go beyond that is that we
do do you mean the reach of humanity

2990
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:31,280
do do you mean the reach of humanity
 

2991
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,870
do do you mean the reach of humanity
across all kinds of technologies or do

2992
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:32,880
across all kinds of technologies or do
 

2993
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,630
across all kinds of technologies or do
you mean literally across space across

you mean literally across space across
 

2995
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,790
you mean literally across space across
space you know so you know we're going

2996
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,800
space you know so you know we're going
 

2997
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:38,790
space you know so you know we're going
to be i think that as artificial

2998
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
to be i think that as artificial

00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,750
start working through new physics we
start working through or i should say

3008
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:47,760
start working through or i should say
 

3009
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,150
start working through or i should say
pass the einsteinian frameworks

3010
00:48:50,150 --> 00:48:50,160
pass the einsteinian frameworks
 

3011
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,150
pass the einsteinian frameworks
as we kind of get a better idea of what

that we didn't know that we were looking
 

3019
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,470
that we didn't know that we were looking
for and we may have more opportunity and

3020
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:00,480
for and we may have more opportunity and
 

3021
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,549

know betting the farm on of course but

3024
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:04,640
know betting the farm on of course but
 

3025
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,790
know betting the farm on of course but
um maybe maybe that's a road i want to

3026
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:06,800
um maybe maybe that's a road i want to
 

3027
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,510
um maybe maybe that's a road i want to
explore on earth instead of uh on mars

3028
00:49:09,510 --> 00:49:09,520
explore on earth instead of uh on mars
 

3029
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,589
explore on earth instead of uh on mars
maybe there's technology that can be

3030
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:11,599
maybe there's technology that can be
 

3031
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:13,510
maybe there's technology that can be
brought to bear with new science and

3032
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:13,520
brought to bear with new science and
 

3033
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,430
brought to bear with new science and
harder engineering that is a road that

3034
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:15,440
harder engineering that is a road that
 

3035
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,270
harder engineering that is a road that
doesn't go past mars to get outside the

3036
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
doesn't go past mars to get outside the
 

3037
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,190
doesn't go past mars to get outside the
solar system

3038
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:19,200
solar system
 

3039
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:20,870
solar system
so there are different ways to explore

3040
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:20,880
so there are different ways to explore
 

3041
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,230
so there are different ways to explore
the universe

3042
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:22,240
the universe
 

3043
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,430
the universe
than the the traditional rocket systems

3044
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:25,440
than the the traditional rocket systems
 

3045
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,470
than the the traditional rocket systems
uh if we can continue sort of

3046
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:28,480
uh if we can continue sort of
 

3047
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,950
uh if we can continue sort of
your journey um

3048
00:49:30,950 --> 00:49:30,960
your journey um
 

3049
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,030
your journey um
you said that that you were

3050
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:33,040
you said that that you were
 

3051
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,630
you said that that you were
attracted to the

3052
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:34,640
attracted to the
 

3053
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,309
attracted to the
the incredibly advanced technologies of

3054
00:49:36,309 --> 00:49:36,319
the incredibly advanced technologies of
 

3055
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:39,190
the incredibly advanced technologies of
the f-20 uh of the f-18s and just the

3056
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
the f-20 uh of the f-18s and just the
 

3057
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,950
the f-20 uh of the f-18s and just the
the fighter jets in general

3058
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:40,960
the fighter jets in general
 

3059
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,390
the fighter jets in general
um

3060
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
um
 

3061
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,190
um
let me ask another question which seems

3062
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:45,200
let me ask another question which seems
 

3063
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,349
let me ask another question which seems
incredibly difficult to do

3064
00:49:47,349 --> 00:49:47,359
incredibly difficult to do
 

3065
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:50,309
incredibly difficult to do
which is landing on a carrier or taking

3066
00:49:50,309 --> 00:49:50,319
which is landing on a carrier or taking
 

3067
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:51,750
which is landing on a carrier or taking
off from a carrier and landing on a

3068
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:51,760
off from a carrier and landing on a
 

3069
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,270
off from a carrier and landing on a
carrier so

3070
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:53,280
carrier so
 

3071
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,270
carrier so
what's that like what are the challenges

3072
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:55,280
what's that like what are the challenges
 

3073
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,990
what's that like what are the challenges
of that taking off is pretty easy it's

3074
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:58,000
of that taking off is pretty easy it's
 

3075
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,349
of that taking off is pretty easy it's
procedurally

3076
00:49:59,349 --> 00:49:59,359
procedurally
 

3077
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,870
procedurally
somewhat complex where there's a lot of

3078
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:00,880
somewhat complex where there's a lot of
 

3079
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,710
somewhat complex where there's a lot of
moving parts almost like a clock you

3080
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720
moving parts almost like a clock you
 

3081
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,470
moving parts almost like a clock you
know you're almost in a pocket watch

3082
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:04,480
know you're almost in a pocket watch
 

3083
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,750
know you're almost in a pocket watch
some sense and you're a part of the

3084
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:05,760
some sense and you're a part of the
 

3085
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,910
some sense and you're a part of the
machinery and so long as you press the

3086
00:50:07,910 --> 00:50:07,920
machinery and so long as you press the
 

3087
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,270
machinery and so long as you press the
right buttons and do the right things

3088
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:09,280
right buttons and do the right things
 

3089
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,030
right buttons and do the right things
and you're shooting off the front so

3090
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:11,040
and you're shooting off the front so
 

3091
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,309
and you're shooting off the front so
there's like a checklist to fall and

3092
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
there's like a checklist to fall and
 

3093
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,750
there's like a checklist to fall and
there's several people involved in that

3094
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:13,760
there's several people involved in that
 

3095
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,589
there's several people involved in that
checklist and you just got to follow the

3096
00:50:15,589 --> 00:50:15,599
checklist and you just got to follow the
 

3097
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,750
checklist and you just got to follow the
checklist correctly essentially yep lots

3098
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:17,760
checklist correctly essentially yep lots
 

3099
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,270
checklist correctly essentially yep lots
of ways to screw it up but you'll know

3100
00:50:19,270 --> 00:50:19,280
of ways to screw it up but you'll know
 

3101
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,710
of ways to screw it up but you'll know
how to screw it up

3102
00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:20,720
how to screw it up
 

3103
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,950
how to screw it up
but landing on the back of the boat is a

3104
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:22,960
but landing on the back of the boat is a
 

3105
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:24,710
but landing on the back of the boat is a
whole different animal

3106
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
whole different animal
 

3107
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,870
whole different animal
there's a lot more variables um there's

3108
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:26,880
there's a lot more variables um there's
 

3109
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,630
there's a lot more variables um there's
essentially one or two people

3110
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:28,640
essentially one or two people
 

3111
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:31,589
essentially one or two people
responsible for the success of that

3112
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
responsible for the success of that
 

3113
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,150
responsible for the success of that
the landing signal officer who actually

3114
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:34,160
the landing signal officer who actually
 

3115
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,630
the landing signal officer who actually
represents a team of specially trained

3116
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:36,640
represents a team of specially trained
 

3117
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:38,790
represents a team of specially trained
aviators who are responsible for helping

3118
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:38,800
aviators who are responsible for helping
 

3119
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,750
aviators who are responsible for helping
that aviator land on the boat

3120
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:41,760
that aviator land on the boat
 

3121
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,150
that aviator land on the boat
and uh the pilot himself

3122
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:44,160
and uh the pilot himself
 

3123
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:44,950
and uh the pilot himself
and

3124
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:44,960
and
 

3125
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,230
and
it it is a hard task to actually fly

3126
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:48,240
it it is a hard task to actually fly
 

3127
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,950
it it is a hard task to actually fly
precisely enough to be good at it so to

3128
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:50,960
precisely enough to be good at it so to
 

3129
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,510
precisely enough to be good at it so to
fly quote unquote the perfect pass you

3130
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,520
fly quote unquote the perfect pass you
 

3131
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,630
fly quote unquote the perfect pass you
essentially have to fly your head

3132
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,640
essentially have to fly your head
 

3133
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,790
essentially have to fly your head
through a one foot by one foot box

3134
00:50:56,790 --> 00:50:56,800
through a one foot by one foot box
 

3135
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,150
through a one foot by one foot box
that's essentially the target you're

3136
00:50:58,150 --> 00:50:58,160
that's essentially the target you're
 

3137
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,270
that's essentially the target you're
shooting for

3138
00:50:59,270 --> 00:50:59,280
shooting for
 

3139
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,270
shooting for
um plus or minus probably about five

3140
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:01,280
um plus or minus probably about five
 

3141
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,030
um plus or minus probably about five
knots on air speed although we don't

3142
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:03,040
knots on air speed although we don't
 

3143
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,549
knots on air speed although we don't
really judge it by air speed it's

3144
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:04,559
really judge it by air speed it's
 

3145
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,470
really judge it by air speed it's
something called angle of attack

3146
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,480
something called angle of attack
 

3147
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,990
something called angle of attack
but generally you know pretty tight

3148
00:51:07,990 --> 00:51:08,000
but generally you know pretty tight
 

3149
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,349
but generally you know pretty tight
parameters there

3150
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
parameters there
 

3151
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,870
parameters there
um and you can do everything perfect and

3152
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:10,880
um and you can do everything perfect and
 

3153
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:12,710
um and you can do everything perfect and
still fail right so when we go to

3154
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:12,720
still fail right so when we go to
 

3155
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,150
still fail right so when we go to
touchdown we immediately bring the power

3156
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
touchdown we immediately bring the power
 

3157
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,829
touchdown we immediately bring the power
up and we rotate as if we were doing uh

3158
00:51:17,829 --> 00:51:17,839
up and we rotate as if we were doing uh
 

3159
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,910
up and we rotate as if we were doing uh
as if we were bouncing off the deck and

3160
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:19,920
as if we were bouncing off the deck and
 

3161
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,349
as if we were bouncing off the deck and
if we catch it then we slow down

3162
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:23,359
if we catch it then we slow down
 

3163
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:24,549
if we catch it then we slow down
and then someone tells us to bring the

3164
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:24,559
and then someone tells us to bring the
 

3165
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:25,990
and then someone tells us to bring the
power back which we do we don't do it on

3166
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:26,000
power back which we do we don't do it on
 

3167
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,190
power back which we do we don't do it on
our own

3168
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:27,200
our own
 

3169
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,670
our own
because it's such a violent experience

3170
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:29,680
because it's such a violent experience
 

3171
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:31,829
because it's such a violent experience
you can think you're trapped or not or

3172
00:51:31,829 --> 00:51:31,839
you can think you're trapped or not or
 

3173
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,589
you can think you're trapped or not or
something breaks and you you bring your

3174
00:51:33,589 --> 00:51:33,599
something breaks and you you bring your
 

3175
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:35,030
something breaks and you you bring your
throttle back that's a very serious

3176
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:35,040
throttle back that's a very serious
 

3177
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,549
throttle back that's a very serious
thing it happened the best of us you

3178
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
thing it happened the best of us you
 

3179
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,390
thing it happened the best of us you
know i'll admit i've done it once when i

3180
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:38,400
know i'll admit i've done it once when i
 

3181
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,549
know i'll admit i've done it once when i
first got to the squadron um

3182
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:40,559
first got to the squadron um
 

3183
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,549
first got to the squadron um
it's called ease guns land

3184
00:51:42,549 --> 00:51:42,559
it's called ease guns land
 

3185
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,390
it's called ease guns land
uh and so you know i came in the boat

3186
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
uh and so you know i came in the boat
 

3187
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,990
uh and so you know i came in the boat
and i brought the power i cracked the

3188
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:46,000
and i brought the power i cracked the
 

3189
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,069
and i brought the power i cracked the
power back a little bit before i've been

3190
00:51:48,069 --> 00:51:48,079
power back a little bit before i've been
 

3191
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,390
power back a little bit before i've been
told to or that my aircraft had finished

3192
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:50,400
told to or that my aircraft had finished
 

3193
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,390
told to or that my aircraft had finished
settling in and that was a big faux pas

3194
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:52,400
settling in and that was a big faux pas
 

3195
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,710
settling in and that was a big faux pas
right so especially as a new guy so

3196
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:54,720
right so especially as a new guy so
 

3197
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:57,270
right so especially as a new guy so
um it's it's a very serious business

3198
00:51:57,270 --> 00:51:57,280
um it's it's a very serious business
 

3199
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,470
um it's it's a very serious business
there's a lot of eyes on you and there's

3200
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
there's a lot of eyes on you and there's
 

3201
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,309
there's a lot of eyes on you and there's
a lot of ways to screw it up but the

3202
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:00,319
a lot of ways to screw it up but the
 

3203
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,630
a lot of ways to screw it up but the
physical you know rush of like having a

3204
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:02,640
physical you know rush of like having a
 

3205
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,069
physical you know rush of like having a
great pass and then like there's just

3206
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
great pass and then like there's just
 

3207
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:04,870
great pass and then like there's just
the

3208
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:04,880
the
 

3209
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,950
the
like the crash of into the boat and all

3210
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:06,960
like the crash of into the boat and all
 

3211
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,870
like the crash of into the boat and all
that the physical sensation from it you

3212
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:08,880
that the physical sensation from it you
 

3213
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,230
that the physical sensation from it you
know when everything's going great you

3214
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:10,240
know when everything's going great you
 

3215
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,510
know when everything's going great you
know it's top of the world it's a great

3216
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:11,520
know it's top of the world it's a great
 

3217
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,470
know it's top of the world it's a great
feeling

3218
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,480
feeling
 

3219
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,270
feeling
how much of it is feel how much of it is

3220
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:15,280
how much of it is feel how much of it is
 

3221
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,589
how much of it is feel how much of it is
um instruments how much is other people

3222
00:52:17,589 --> 00:52:17,599
um instruments how much is other people
 

3223
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,270
um instruments how much is other people
just doing the work for you catching you

3224
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,280
just doing the work for you catching you
 

3225
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,549
just doing the work for you catching you
as long as you do everything right

3226
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:20,559
as long as you do everything right
 

3227
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,150
as long as you do everything right
there's a few systems we use one is

3228
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
there's a few systems we use one is
 

3229
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,230
there's a few systems we use one is
called the ball and that ball is

3230
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
called the ball and that ball is
 

3231
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,309
called the ball and that ball is
external to our aircraft and it's

3232
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:26,319
external to our aircraft and it's
 

3233
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:28,630
external to our aircraft and it's
b-a-l-l correct well

3234
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,640
b-a-l-l correct well
 

3235
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,270
b-a-l-l correct well
it's a it's a i floss landing system

3236
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
it's a it's a i floss landing system
 

3237
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:32,790
it's a it's a i floss landing system
which stands for something very long

3238
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:32,800
which stands for something very long
 

3239
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,309
which stands for something very long
convoluted but essentially it's a mirror

3240
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:34,319
convoluted but essentially it's a mirror
 

3241
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:36,710
convoluted but essentially it's a mirror
with lights on it and

3242
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:36,720
with lights on it and
 

3243
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:38,390
with lights on it and
you see the light

3244
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:38,400
you see the light
 

3245
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,390
you see the light
at a different cell

3246
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:40,400
at a different cell
 

3247
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:43,109
at a different cell
based on your position relative to an

3248
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
based on your position relative to an
 

3249
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,790
based on your position relative to an
ideal glide slope yeah so if you're

3250
00:52:44,790 --> 00:52:44,800
ideal glide slope yeah so if you're
 

3251
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,069
ideal glide slope yeah so if you're
right on it you're right in the middle

3252
00:52:46,069 --> 00:52:46,079
right on it you're right in the middle
 

3253
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,910
right on it you're right in the middle
and if you're below you're low

3254
00:52:47,910 --> 00:52:47,920
and if you're below you're low
 

3255
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,990
and if you're below you're low
and as i add power

3256
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:50,000
and as i add power
 

3257
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,950
and as i add power
and maneuver the aircraft that ball

3258
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:52,960
and maneuver the aircraft that ball
 

3259
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,549
and maneuver the aircraft that ball
you know i see that ball rise you see

3260
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
you know i see that ball rise you see
 

3261
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,069
you know i see that ball rise you see
the ball low it's a lagging indicator

3262
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:56,079
the ball low it's a lagging indicator
 

3263
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,270
the ball low it's a lagging indicator
though right and your jet is a a lagging

3264
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
though right and your jet is a a lagging
 

3265
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:00,790
though right and your jet is a a lagging
engine too right it takes time to pull

3266
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:00,800
engine too right it takes time to pull
 

3267
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,470
engine too right it takes time to pull
up the engine so that adds to the

3268
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:02,480
up the engine so that adds to the
 

3269
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,430
up the engine so that adds to the
complexity you have to think ahead a bit

3270
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:05,440
complexity you have to think ahead a bit
 

3271
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,829
complexity you have to think ahead a bit
you know so you don't want to um

3272
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:07,839
you know so you don't want to um
 

3273
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,270
you know so you don't want to um
you can't just bring the

3274
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:09,280
you can't just bring the
 

3275
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,710
you can't just bring the
power up and leave it there you have to

3276
00:53:10,710 --> 00:53:10,720
power up and leave it there you have to
 

3277
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,990
power up and leave it there you have to
bring the power up touch it bring it

3278
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:12,000
bring the power up touch it bring it
 

3279
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:12,870
bring the power up touch it bring it
back

3280
00:53:12,870 --> 00:53:12,880
back
 

3281
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:14,710
back
and oh by the way your landing area is

3282
00:53:14,710 --> 00:53:14,720
and oh by the way your landing area is
 

3283
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,790
and oh by the way your landing area is
moving not just away from you but also

3284
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:16,800
moving not just away from you but also
 

3285
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,230
moving not just away from you but also
on an angle right because we have an

3286
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,240
on an angle right because we have an
 

3287
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,230
on an angle right because we have an
angled deck and so you're constantly

3288
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:20,240
angled deck and so you're constantly
 

3289
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:22,630
angled deck and so you're constantly
doing one of these to correct yourself

3290
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:22,640
doing one of these to correct yourself
 

3291
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,230
doing one of these to correct yourself
as you go

3292
00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:24,240
as you go
 

3293
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,829
as you go
and even every time you do one of those

3294
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:25,839
and even every time you do one of those
 

3295
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,150
and even every time you do one of those
yeah maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank

3296
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:28,160
yeah maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank
 

3297
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,549
yeah maybe it's a 30 degree angle bank
right i'm losing lift right yeah and so

3298
00:53:30,549 --> 00:53:30,559
right i'm losing lift right yeah and so
 

3299
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,069
right i'm losing lift right yeah and so
i have to compensate with power each

3300
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:32,079
i have to compensate with power each
 

3301
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:33,670
i have to compensate with power each
time i do that so i'm doing another one

3302
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:33,680
time i do that so i'm doing another one
 

3303
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:36,549
time i do that so i'm doing another one
because you have to maintain um the same

3304
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:36,559
because you have to maintain um the same
 

3305
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,470
because you have to maintain um the same
level you're always lowering like it's a

3306
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:38,480
level you're always lowering like it's a
 

3307
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,670
level you're always lowering like it's a
constant rate of descent that's

3308
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:39,680
constant rate of descent that's
 

3309
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,510
constant rate of descent that's
increasing from about 200 feet per

3310
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:41,520
increasing from about 200 feet per
 

3311
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,510
increasing from about 200 feet per
minute to about 650 and every time you

3312
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:43,520
minute to about 650 and every time you
 

3313
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,670
minute to about 650 and every time you
do this that's messing with that

3314
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:45,680
do this that's messing with that
 

3315
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,430
do this that's messing with that
okay so you have to compensate doing

3316
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:47,440
okay so you have to compensate doing
 

3317
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,990
okay so you have to compensate doing
that manually do it manually all right

3318
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:50,000
that manually do it manually all right
 

3319
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,589
that manually do it manually all right
and then of course as you come down that

3320
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
and then of course as you come down that
 

3321
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,750
and then of course as you come down that
glide slope uh it becomes more and more

3322
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:53,760
glide slope uh it becomes more and more
 

3323
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:57,910
glide slope uh it becomes more and more
narrow and you have to of course um

3324
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:57,920
narrow and you have to of course um
 

3325
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,990
narrow and you have to of course um
modulate your inputs such that they're

3326
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:00,000
modulate your inputs such that they're
 

3327
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:00,950
modulate your inputs such that they're
smaller and smaller because they have a

3328
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:00,960
smaller and smaller because they have a
 

3329
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,150
smaller and smaller because they have a
bigger and bigger effect as you get

3330
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,160
bigger and bigger effect as you get
 

3331
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,230
bigger and bigger effect as you get
closer in

3332
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:04,240
closer in
 

3333
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,510
closer in
and what happens too when you're getting

3334
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,520
and what happens too when you're getting
 

3335
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,829
and what happens too when you're getting
close is that right before you cross

3336
00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:07,839
close is that right before you cross
 

3337
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,430
close is that right before you cross
over if this is the boat right here your

3338
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:09,440
over if this is the boat right here your
 

3339
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,589
over if this is the boat right here your
table right before you kind of get your

3340
00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:11,599
table right before you kind of get your
 

3341
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,589
table right before you kind of get your
wings over the boat itself

3342
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:13,599
wings over the boat itself
 

3343
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,950
wings over the boat itself
this big wind from the the main tower of

3344
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:16,960
this big wind from the the main tower of
 

3345
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,390
this big wind from the the main tower of
the boat is where it dips down so the

3346
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:18,400
the boat is where it dips down so the
 

3347
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,829
the boat is where it dips down so the
wind actually goes down it's called the

3348
00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:19,839
wind actually goes down it's called the
 

3349
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,430
wind actually goes down it's called the
burble it'll actually pull the aircraft

3350
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:21,440
burble it'll actually pull the aircraft
 

3351
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,270
burble it'll actually pull the aircraft
down increase your rate of descent so at

3352
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:23,280
down increase your rate of descent so at
 

3353
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,109
down increase your rate of descent so at
that particular point you need to

3354
00:54:25,109 --> 00:54:25,119
that particular point you need to
 

3355
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,549
that particular point you need to
you know increase your power and try to

3356
00:54:26,549 --> 00:54:26,559
you know increase your power and try to
 

3357
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,750
you know increase your power and try to
compensate against that and so that's

3358
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:27,760
compensate against that and so that's
 

3359
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,190
compensate against that and so that's
kind of a third variable that's trying

3360
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
kind of a third variable that's trying
 

3361
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,829
kind of a third variable that's trying
to screw you up on your way down

3362
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:31,839
to screw you up on your way down
 

3363
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:33,910
to screw you up on your way down
what's the most difficult conditions in

3364
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:33,920
what's the most difficult conditions in
 

3365
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,430
what's the most difficult conditions in
which you have to land or you've seen

3366
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:35,440
which you have to land or you've seen
 

3367
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,190
which you have to land or you've seen
somebody have to land because i think

3368
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:37,200
somebody have to land because i think
 

3369
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,270
somebody have to land because i think
you were also

3370
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,280
you were also
 

3371
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,270
you were also
a signal officer as well i was yeah that

3372
00:54:41,270 --> 00:54:41,280
a signal officer as well i was yeah that
 

3373
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,109
a signal officer as well i was yeah that
was the headlining signal officer for

3374
00:54:43,109 --> 00:54:43,119
was the headlining signal officer for
 

3375
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:45,109
was the headlining signal officer for
for my squadron so you you've probably

3376
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:45,119
for my squadron so you you've probably
 

3377
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:47,910
for my squadron so you you've probably
seen some tough landings i have i've

3378
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:47,920
seen some tough landings i have i've
 

3379
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,470
seen some tough landings i have i've
seen a a ramp strike which is when a

3380
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:50,480
seen a a ramp strike which is when a
 

3381
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,750
seen a a ramp strike which is when a
part of the aircraft hits before um the

3382
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:53,760
part of the aircraft hits before um the
 

3383
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,910
part of the aircraft hits before um the
landing area which is

3384
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
landing area which is
 

3385
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,430
landing area which is
basically the round out of the boat that

3386
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:57,440
basically the round out of the boat that
 

3387
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,789
basically the round out of the boat that
is before the landing area so they

3388
00:54:58,789 --> 00:54:58,799
is before the landing area so they
 

3389
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,069
is before the landing area so they
basically struck the back of the boat

3390
00:55:00,069 --> 00:55:00,079
basically struck the back of the boat
 

3391
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,390
basically struck the back of the boat
coming in yeah it was just their hook so

3392
00:55:02,390 --> 00:55:02,400
coming in yeah it was just their hook so
 

3393
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,630
coming in yeah it was just their hook so
it wasn't the aircraft

3394
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,640
it wasn't the aircraft
 

3395
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,990
it wasn't the aircraft
and they were fine that one was kind of

3396
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
and they were fine that one was kind of
 

3397
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,470
and they were fine that one was kind of
ugly um but it like rips that part of

3398
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,480
ugly um but it like rips that part of
 

3399
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,230
ugly um but it like rips that part of
the aircraft absolutely and then you

3400
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
the aircraft absolutely and then you
 

3401
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,309
the aircraft absolutely and then you
land on your bellies that kind of thing

3402
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:12,319
land on your bellies that kind of thing
 

3403
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:14,630
land on your bellies that kind of thing
in this particular case it hit and then

3404
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:14,640
in this particular case it hit and then
 

3405
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,470
in this particular case it hit and then
it it gave and essentially dragged the

3406
00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:16,480
it it gave and essentially dragged the
 

3407
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,549
it it gave and essentially dragged the
hook on the on the surface after that

3408
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:18,559
hook on the on the surface after that
 

3409
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,390
hook on the on the surface after that
and so he was able to grab a wire at

3410
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:20,400
and so he was able to grab a wire at
 

3411
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,750
and so he was able to grab a wire at
that point when does that kind of thing

3412
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:21,760
that point when does that kind of thing
 

3413
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,349
that point when does that kind of thing
happen just a miscalculation by the

3414
00:55:23,349 --> 00:55:23,359
happen just a miscalculation by the
 

3415
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:24,950
happen just a miscalculation by the
pilot or

3416
00:55:24,950 --> 00:55:24,960
pilot or
 

3417
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,109
pilot or
is it uh weather conditions i wouldn't

3418
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:27,119
is it uh weather conditions i wouldn't
 

3419
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,950
is it uh weather conditions i wouldn't
even call it miscalculation i mean i'm

3420
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:28,960
even call it miscalculation i mean i'm
 

3421
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,390
even call it miscalculation i mean i'm
gonna put the blame on the pilot because

3422
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
gonna put the blame on the pilot because
 

3423
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,990
gonna put the blame on the pilot because
he's the only one in the cockpit but

3424
00:55:31,990 --> 00:55:32,000
he's the only one in the cockpit but
 

3425
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,510
he's the only one in the cockpit but
then the day he's reacting to the

3426
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:33,520
then the day he's reacting to the
 

3427
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,750
then the day he's reacting to the
situations he's dealing with and so it

3428
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
situations he's dealing with and so it
 

3429
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,349
situations he's dealing with and so it
may be errors or he may be doing the

3430
00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:37,359
may be errors or he may be doing the
 

3431
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:39,190
may be errors or he may be doing the
best with you know the conditions that

3432
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:39,200
best with you know the conditions that
 

3433
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,910
best with you know the conditions that
he's been given on that particular one

3434
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:41,920
he's been given on that particular one
 

3435
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,589
he's been given on that particular one
you just got two high rated signs very

3436
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:43,599
you just got two high rated signs very
 

3437
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:44,950
you just got two high rated signs very
common and that's when you see it with

3438
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:44,960
common and that's when you see it with
 

3439
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,789
common and that's when you see it with
new pilots you see it with older pilots

3440
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:46,799
new pilots you see it with older pilots
 

3441
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:49,270
new pilots you see it with older pilots
right new ones and complacent ones what

3442
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:49,280
right new ones and complacent ones what
 

3443
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,109
right new ones and complacent ones what
you see is they'll um

3444
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:51,119
you see is they'll um
 

3445
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,789
you see is they'll um
try to make the ball go right where they

3446
00:55:52,789 --> 00:55:52,799
try to make the ball go right where they
 

3447
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,789
try to make the ball go right where they
want it in close they think they can

3448
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799
want it in close they think they can
 

3449
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:56,549
want it in close they think they can
beat the game a little bit and they try

3450
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
beat the game a little bit and they try
 

3451
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:59,030
beat the game a little bit and they try
to and so we have sayings we teach we

3452
00:55:59,030 --> 00:55:59,040
to and so we have sayings we teach we
 

3453
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:00,789
to and so we have sayings we teach we
teach pilots you know as a landing

3454
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
teach pilots you know as a landing
 

3455
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:02,069
teach pilots you know as a landing
signal officer we tell them like don't

3456
00:56:02,069 --> 00:56:02,079
signal officer we tell them like don't
 

3457
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,990
signal officer we tell them like don't
re-center the high ball in close it's

3458
00:56:03,990 --> 00:56:04,000
re-center the high ball in close it's
 

3459
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,150
re-center the high ball in close it's
one of the rules to live by and so when

3460
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:06,160
one of the rules to live by and so when
 

3461
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:07,990
one of the rules to live by and so when
the ball is up high don't try to bring

3462
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,000
the ball is up high don't try to bring
 

3463
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,990
the ball is up high don't try to bring
it back in close to like the center

3464
00:56:09,990 --> 00:56:10,000
it back in close to like the center
 

3465
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,589
it back in close to like the center
point when you're when you're in close

3466
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
point when you're when you're in close
 

3467
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:12,470
point when you're when you're in close
because what you're doing you bring the

3468
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:12,480
because what you're doing you bring the
 

3469
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,750
because what you're doing you bring the
power off and you're gonna crash right

3470
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:13,760
power off and you're gonna crash right
 

3471
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,430
power off and you're gonna crash right
down and that's what happens right

3472
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:15,440
down and that's what happens right
 

3473
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,109
down and that's what happens right
because you got the burble pulling you

3474
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:17,119
because you got the burble pulling you
 

3475
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,349
because you got the burble pulling you
down you might be correcting which is

3476
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:19,359
down you might be correcting which is
 

3477
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:20,950
down you might be correcting which is
decreasing your lift

3478
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:20,960
decreasing your lift
 

3479
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,470
decreasing your lift
uh and then you have that type of

3480
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:22,480
uh and then you have that type of
 

3481
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,230
uh and then you have that type of
maneuver so how are you supposed to do

3482
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:24,240
maneuver so how are you supposed to do
 

3483
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,789
maneuver so how are you supposed to do
all this in harsh weather conditions

3484
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
all this in harsh weather conditions
 

3485
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,069
all this in harsh weather conditions
and so that's the one i wanted to tell

3486
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
and so that's the one i wanted to tell
 

3487
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,430
and so that's the one i wanted to tell
you about that's the hardest one and

3488
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:29,440
you about that's the hardest one and
 

3489
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,750
you about that's the hardest one and
what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi

3490
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:31,760
what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi
 

3491
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,109
what you hear is if you hear 99 taxi
lights on

3492
00:56:33,109 --> 00:56:33,119
lights on
 

3493
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,069
lights on
that's a really shitty day 99 taxi

3494
00:56:36,069 --> 00:56:36,079
that's a really shitty day 99 taxi
 

3495
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,230
that's a really shitty day 99 taxi
lights on what's that mean so everyone

3496
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:38,240
lights on what's that mean so everyone
 

3497
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,950
lights on what's that mean so everyone
put your taxi lights on because

3498
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
put your taxi lights on because
 

3499
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,190
put your taxi lights on because
you're about to land on the boat and you

3500
00:56:43,190 --> 00:56:43,200
you're about to land on the boat and you
 

3501
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,870
you're about to land on the boat and you
don't see the boat weather is so bad

3502
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:44,880
don't see the boat weather is so bad
 

3503
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,870
don't see the boat weather is so bad
that the landing still officer on the

3504
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:46,880
that the landing still officer on the
 

3505
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,030
that the landing still officer on the
boat can't see you either and you can't

3506
00:56:49,030 --> 00:56:49,040
boat can't see you either and you can't
 

3507
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,230
boat can't see you either and you can't
see the boat and you won't be able to

3508
00:56:50,230 --> 00:56:50,240
see the boat and you won't be able to
 

3509
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,309
see the boat and you won't be able to
see it when you touch down

3510
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:52,319
see it when you touch down
 

3511
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,870
see it when you touch down
so we call that a zero zero landing

3512
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:54,880
so we call that a zero zero landing
 

3513
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,950
so we call that a zero zero landing
and you turn on the taxi light so that

3514
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:56,960
and you turn on the taxi light so that
 

3515
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,109
and you turn on the taxi light so that
the lso who has a radio in his hand that

3516
00:56:59,109 --> 00:56:59,119
the lso who has a radio in his hand that
 

3517
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:02,470
the lso who has a radio in his hand that
looks like a phone from 1980

3518
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:02,480
looks like a phone from 1980
 

3519
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:04,710
looks like a phone from 1980
is talking directly to the pilot and

3520
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:04,720
is talking directly to the pilot and
 

3521
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,230
is talking directly to the pilot and
he's looking at that little light in the

3522
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:06,240
he's looking at that little light in the
 

3523
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:08,150
he's looking at that little light in the
rain and he's telling him you're high

3524
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:08,160
rain and he's telling him you're high
 

3525
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,470
rain and he's telling him you're high
you're low power

3526
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:10,480
you're low power
 

3527
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,109
you're low power
things like that come right back to left

3528
00:57:13,109 --> 00:57:13,119
things like that come right back to left
 

3529
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,030
things like that come right back to left
and literally talking him down to land

3530
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:15,040
and literally talking him down to land
 

3531
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,710
and literally talking him down to land
on the boat right there and the pilot

3532
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
on the boat right there and the pilot
 

3533
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,910
on the boat right there and the pilot
usually it comes as a surprise to the

3534
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:17,920
usually it comes as a surprise to the
 

3535
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,030
usually it comes as a surprise to the
pilot delaney because he's just

3536
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
pilot delaney because he's just
 

3537
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,390
pilot delaney because he's just
listening to the voice you can't see the

3538
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:20,400
listening to the voice you can't see the
 

3539
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,829
listening to the voice you can't see the
ball can't see the boat and all of a

3540
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
ball can't see the boat and all of a
 

3541
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:24,230
ball can't see the boat and all of a
sudden you just hit the boat you crash

3542
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:24,240
sudden you just hit the boat you crash
 

3543
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,069
sudden you just hit the boat you crash
crash we're going about 1600 feet per

3544
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:26,079
crash we're going about 1600 feet per
 

3545
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:27,750
crash we're going about 1600 feet per
minute descent

3546
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:27,760
minute descent
 

3547
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,190
minute descent
at that point so you're still you're

3548
00:57:29,190 --> 00:57:29,200
at that point so you're still you're
 

3549
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:30,789
at that point so you're still you're
going super fast

3550
00:57:30,789 --> 00:57:30,799
going super fast
 

3551
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,630
going super fast
it's all this is happening fast you

3552
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
it's all this is happening fast you
 

3553
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,910
it's all this is happening fast you
don't know

3554
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:33,920
don't know
 

3555
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,589
don't know
you don't know what at

3556
00:57:35,589 --> 00:57:35,599
you don't know what at
 

3557
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,910
you don't know what at
the moment it's gonna hit so you're just

3558
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:37,920
the moment it's gonna hit so you're just
 

3559
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,549
the moment it's gonna hit so you're just
going into the darkness and just waiting

3560
00:57:40,549 --> 00:57:40,559
going into the darkness and just waiting
 

3561
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,630
going into the darkness and just waiting
for it to hit it's not dark though a lot

3562
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,640
for it to hit it's not dark though a lot
 

3563
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,309
for it to hit it's not dark though a lot
of times it's white into the light

3564
00:57:44,309 --> 00:57:44,319
of times it's white into the light
 

3565
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:46,710
of times it's white into the light
you're going into into the light

3566
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:46,720
you're going into into the light
 

3567
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,109
you're going into into the light
and then there's a voice from an 80s

3568
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:49,119
and then there's a voice from an 80s
 

3569
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:49,910
and then there's a voice from an 80s
phone

3570
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
phone
 

3571
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,829
phone
i got it this this is terrible

3572
00:57:52,829 --> 00:57:52,839
i got it this this is terrible
 

3573
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:55,589
i got it this this is terrible
um but so that you still

3574
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:55,599
um but so that you still
 

3575
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:57,430
um but so that you still
uh you still have to

3576
00:57:57,430 --> 00:57:57,440
uh you still have to
 

3577
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,190
uh you still have to
so this kind of thing happens you still

3578
00:57:59,190 --> 00:57:59,200
so this kind of thing happens you still
 

3579
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,030
so this kind of thing happens you still
have to land sometimes you just don't

3580
00:58:01,030 --> 00:58:01,040
have to land sometimes you just don't
 

3581
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,190
have to land sometimes you just don't
have a place to divert but you know in a

3582
00:58:03,190 --> 00:58:03,200
have a place to divert but you know in a
 

3583
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,390
have a place to divert but you know in a
sense we're trained for that because we

3584
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:04,400
sense we're trained for that because we
 

3585
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,549
sense we're trained for that because we
do the night landings as well and i

3586
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:06,559
do the night landings as well and i
 

3587
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,470
do the night landings as well and i
think you'll find this interesting but i

3588
00:58:08,470 --> 00:58:08,480
think you'll find this interesting but i
 

3589
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,150
think you'll find this interesting but i
always found that the night landings

3590
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:10,160
always found that the night landings
 

3591
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:12,549
always found that the night landings
where in these particular cases

3592
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:12,559
where in these particular cases
 

3593
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:14,630
where in these particular cases
you're usually lined up behind the boat

3594
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:14,640
you're usually lined up behind the boat
 

3595
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,870
you're usually lined up behind the boat
maybe 10 15 miles whereas the other ones

3596
00:58:16,870 --> 00:58:16,880
maybe 10 15 miles whereas the other ones
 

3597
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,390
maybe 10 15 miles whereas the other ones
it's like a tight circle the landing

3598
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:18,400
it's like a tight circle the landing
 

3599
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:20,150
it's like a tight circle the landing
pattern and so we can potentially see

3600
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
pattern and so we can potentially see
 

3601
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,270
pattern and so we can potentially see
the boat way out there um

3602
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:23,280
the boat way out there um
 

3603
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,950
the boat way out there um
if the lights were on which they're not

3604
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:24,960
if the lights were on which they're not
 

3605
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,390
if the lights were on which they're not
but we can maybe see like the string of

3606
00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:26,400
but we can maybe see like the string of
 

3607
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,390
but we can maybe see like the string of
aircraft in front of us but what's

3608
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:28,400
aircraft in front of us but what's
 

3609
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,470
aircraft in front of us but what's
what's interesting is that it can take a

3610
00:58:30,470 --> 00:58:30,480
what's interesting is that it can take a
 

3611
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,309
what's interesting is that it can take a
while i can t you might be 15 miles out

3612
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:32,319
while i can t you might be 15 miles out
 

3613
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,109
while i can t you might be 15 miles out
and

3614
00:58:33,109 --> 00:58:33,119
and
 

3615
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:34,829
and
your lights are turned down as dim as

3616
00:58:34,829 --> 00:58:34,839
your lights are turned down as dim as
 

3617
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,430
your lights are turned down as dim as
possible you have a cloud deck maybe at

3618
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:37,440
possible you have a cloud deck maybe at
 

3619
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,270
possible you have a cloud deck maybe at
six or seven thousand feet so that the

3620
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
six or seven thousand feet so that the
 

3621
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,270
six or seven thousand feet so that the
starlight there's no moon but let's say

3622
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:41,280
starlight there's no moon but let's say
 

3623
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,710
starlight there's no moon but let's say
the star light's blocked out right

3624
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:42,720
the star light's blocked out right
 

3625
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,150
the star light's blocked out right
because just the star light alone no

3626
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:44,160
because just the star light alone no
 

3627
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:45,030
because just the star light alone no
moon

3628
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:45,040
moon
 

3629
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:46,069
moon
you can see the boat you can see the

3630
00:58:46,069 --> 00:58:46,079
you can see the boat you can see the
 

3631
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:46,950
you can see the boat you can see the
water

3632
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:46,960
water
 

3633
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:49,030
water
but when that goes away it's like

3634
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:49,040
but when that goes away it's like
 

3635
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,030
but when that goes away it's like
closing your eyes right you can't tell

3636
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:51,040
closing your eyes right you can't tell
 

3637
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,510
closing your eyes right you can't tell
anything it could be upside down

3638
00:58:53,510 --> 00:58:53,520
anything it could be upside down
 

3639
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,430
anything it could be upside down
you could be in any position

3640
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:55,440
you could be in any position
 

3641
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,829
you could be in any position
and for me it was almost a meditative

3642
00:58:57,829 --> 00:58:57,839
and for me it was almost a meditative
 

3643
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,750
and for me it was almost a meditative
process that i had to snap myself back

3644
00:58:59,750 --> 00:58:59,760
process that i had to snap myself back
 

3645
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,829
process that i had to snap myself back
out of when i was on like a long

3646
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:01,839
out of when i was on like a long
 

3647
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:03,910
out of when i was on like a long
straightaway and then i would see the

3648
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:03,920
straightaway and then i would see the
 

3649
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:06,150

advantage of
the lack of light pollution in some

3760
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:44,000
the lack of light pollution in some
 

3761
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,670
the lack of light pollution in some
cases especially on deployment to go

3762
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
cases especially on deployment to go
 

3763
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,750

sightings
and uh to the smallest technical details

3844
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:10,559
and uh to the smallest technical details
 

3845
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,230
and uh to the smallest technical details
because i love those

3846
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:12,240
because i love those
 

3847
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:13,750
because i love those
i'll do my best

so
we returned from and when i say we i

3852
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:17,119
we returned from and when i say we i
 

3853
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,829
we returned from and when i say we i
mean my not my squadron but vfa11 the

01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:19,839
mean my not my squadron but vfa11 the
 

3855
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:22,789
mean my not my squadron but vfa11 the
red rippers uh i was a

3856
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:22,799
red rippers uh i was a
 

3857
01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:24,390
red rippers uh i was a
a somewhat junior pilot at the time i

3858
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:24,400
a somewhat junior pilot at the time i
 

3859
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:27,510
a somewhat junior pilot at the time i
joined them on deployment 2012

3860
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:27,520
joined them on deployment 2012
 

3861
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,270
joined them on deployment 2012
where they had been already out there

3862
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:29,280
where they had been already out there
 

3863
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:31,109
where they had been already out there
for about six months or so

3864
01:02:31,109 --> 01:02:31,119
for about six months or so
 

3865
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,470
for about six months or so
um

3866
01:02:32,470 --> 01:02:32,480
um
 

3867
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,029
um
operating in the vicinity of afghanistan

3868
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
operating in the vicinity of afghanistan
 

3869
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,950
operating in the vicinity of afghanistan
uh i joined them and then we we flew

3870
01:02:36,950 --> 01:02:36,960
uh i joined them and then we we flew
 

3871
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,950
uh i joined them and then we we flew
back and still as a relatively new guy

3872
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:38,960
back and still as a relatively new guy
 

3873
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,630
back and still as a relatively new guy
we came back and we entered uh what's

3874
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:40,640
we came back and we entered uh what's
 

3875
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,549
we came back and we entered uh what's
considered a maintenance phase where we

3876
01:02:42,549 --> 01:02:42,559
considered a maintenance phase where we
 

3877
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,270
considered a maintenance phase where we
slow down the tactical flying a bit uh

3878
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:45,280
slow down the tactical flying a bit uh
 

3879
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,630
slow down the tactical flying a bit uh
kind of recuperate

3880
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:46,640
kind of recuperate
 

3881
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:48,549
kind of recuperate
do some maintenance on the aircraft and

3882
01:02:48,549 --> 01:02:48,559
do some maintenance on the aircraft and
 

3883
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,670
do some maintenance on the aircraft and
our particular model of the f-18 the lot

3884
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:51,680
our particular model of the f-18 the lot
 

3885
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,109
our particular model of the f-18 the lot
the lot number

3886
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:53,119
the lot number
 

3887
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:55,029
the lot number
uh was plumbed

3888
01:02:55,029 --> 01:02:55,039
uh was plumbed
 

3889
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:56,230
uh was plumbed
for

3890
01:02:56,230 --> 01:02:56,240
for
 

3891
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,990
for
the particular things that were needed

3892
01:02:57,990 --> 01:02:58,000
the particular things that were needed
 

3893
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,390
the particular things that were needed
to upgrade the radar from what's known

3894
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
to upgrade the radar from what's known
 

3895
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,150
to upgrade the radar from what's known
as the abg-73 to the apg-79

3896
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:04,160
as the abg-73 to the apg-79
 

3897
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:07,270
as the abg-73 to the apg-79
and the abg-73 is a mechanically uh

3898
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:07,280
and the abg-73 is a mechanically uh
 

3899
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,470
and the abg-73 is a mechanically uh
scanned array radar uh

3900
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:10,480
scanned array radar uh
 

3901
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:12,789
scanned array radar uh
it's a you know perfectly fine radar but

3902
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:12,799
it's a you know perfectly fine radar but
 

3903
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:15,270
it's a you know perfectly fine radar but
the acer radar is kind of a you know

3904
01:03:15,270 --> 01:03:15,280
the acer radar is kind of a you know
 

3905
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:17,510
the acer radar is kind of a you know
magnitude jumping capability kind of a

3906
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:17,520
magnitude jumping capability kind of a
 

3907
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:20,390
magnitude jumping capability kind of a
an analog digital kind of mindset so got

3908
01:03:20,390 --> 01:03:20,400
an analog digital kind of mindset so got
 

3909
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,549
an analog digital kind of mindset so got
it so it's a leap to digital

3910
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:22,559
it so it's a leap to digital
 

3911
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:25,829
it so it's a leap to digital
uh avg 73 i mean are these things on a

3912
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:25,839
uh avg 73 i mean are these things on a
 

3913
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,670
uh avg 73 i mean are these things on a
carrier like what are we talking about

3914
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:27,680
carrier like what are we talking about
 

3915
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,910
carrier like what are we talking about
here this is how big is a radar yeah so

3916
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:29,920
here this is how big is a radar yeah so
 

3917
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,029
here this is how big is a radar yeah so
this is actually the radar it's in the

3918
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:31,039
this is actually the radar it's in the
 

3919
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:32,630
this is actually the radar it's in the
f-18 itself

3920
01:03:32,630 --> 01:03:32,640
f-18 itself
 

3921
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,789
f-18 itself
okay so when you say that we're chosen

3922
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:34,799
okay so when you say that we're chosen
 

3923
01:03:34,799 --> 01:03:36,710
okay so when you say that we're chosen
this is to test

3924
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:36,720
this is to test
 

3925
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,309
this is to test
uh the upgrade to the new the 79 abg 79.

3926
01:03:40,309 --> 01:03:40,319
uh the upgrade to the new the 79 abg 79.
 

3927
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:42,069
uh the upgrade to the new the 79 abg 79.
less of an uh test and more of just hey

3928
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:42,079
less of an uh test and more of just hey
 

3929
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,430
less of an uh test and more of just hey
it's your turn to get the upgrade like

3930
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:43,440
it's your turn to get the upgrade like
 

3931
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,910
it's your turn to get the upgrade like
we're all going to these better radars

3932
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:45,920
we're all going to these better radars
 

3933
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:47,750
we're all going to these better radars
they were building ones off the off the

3934
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:47,760
they were building ones off the off the
 

3935
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:50,069
they were building ones off the off the
line with the new radar but we were this

3936
01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:50,079
line with the new radar but we were this
 

3937
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:51,510
line with the new radar but we were this
weird transitionary squadron in the

3938
01:03:51,510 --> 01:03:51,520
weird transitionary squadron in the
 

3939
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,190
weird transitionary squadron in the
middle that transitioned from the older

3940
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,200
middle that transitioned from the older
 

3941
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,870
middle that transitioned from the older
ones to the new ones

3942
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:54,880
ones to the new ones
 

3943
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,549
ones to the new ones
but it's not particularly rare to fly

3944
01:03:56,549 --> 01:03:56,559
but it's not particularly rare to fly
 

3945
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:58,390
but it's not particularly rare to fly
with different types of radar because

3946
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:58,400
with different types of radar because
 

3947
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,549
with different types of radar because
in the and we call the fleet replacement

3948
01:04:00,549 --> 01:04:00,559
in the and we call the fleet replacement
 

3949
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:02,230
in the and we call the fleet replacement
squadron essentially the training ground

3950
01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
squadron essentially the training ground
 

3951
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,270
squadron essentially the training ground
for the f-18 you have all sorts of f-18s

3952
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:05,280
for the f-18 you have all sorts of f-18s
 

3953
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:07,430
for the f-18 you have all sorts of f-18s
with different radars so

3954
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:07,440
with different radars so
 

3955
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,510
with different radars so
you are used to having multiple ones but

3956
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:09,520
you are used to having multiple ones but
 

3957
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:11,510
you are used to having multiple ones but
in the actual deployable

3958
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:11,520
in the actual deployable
 

3959
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,029
in the actual deployable
combat squadron

3960
01:04:13,029 --> 01:04:13,039
combat squadron
 

3961
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,069
combat squadron
um

3962
01:04:14,069 --> 01:04:14,079
um
 

3963
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:16,069
um
we upgraded and when we upgraded we saw

3964
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
we upgraded and when we upgraded we saw
 

3965
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,230
we upgraded and when we upgraded we saw
that there were objects on the radar

3966
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:18,240
that there were objects on the radar
 

3967
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,150
that there were objects on the radar
that we were seeing the next day in in

3968
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:20,160
that we were seeing the next day in in
 

3969
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,990
that we were seeing the next day in in
this with this new radar that weren't

3970
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:22,000
this with this new radar that weren't
 

3971
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,069
this with this new radar that weren't
there with the old radar and these were

3972
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:24,079
there with the old radar and these were
 

3973
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:25,349
there with the old radar and these were
sometimes you know the same day you

3974
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:25,359
sometimes you know the same day you
 

3975
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,349
sometimes you know the same day you
might go on two flights the one in the

3976
01:04:27,349 --> 01:04:27,359
might go on two flights the one in the
 

3977
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,029
might go on two flights the one in the
morning might be with all the radar the

3978
01:04:29,029 --> 01:04:29,039
morning might be with all the radar the
 

3979
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,430
morning might be with all the radar the
one the evening with the new radar

3980
01:04:31,430 --> 01:04:31,440
one the evening with the new radar
 

3981
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,029
one the evening with the new radar
and you and you'd see the objects with

3982
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:33,039
and you and you'd see the objects with
 

3983
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:35,029
and you and you'd see the objects with
the with the new radar and that's not

3984
01:04:35,029 --> 01:04:35,039
the with the new radar and that's not
 

3985
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:37,349
the with the new radar and that's not
overly surprising in some sense uh they

3986
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:37,359
overly surprising in some sense uh they
 

3987
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:39,589
overly surprising in some sense uh they
are more sensitive uh perhaps they're

3988
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
are more sensitive uh perhaps they're
 

3989
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:41,430
are more sensitive uh perhaps they're
not filtering out everything they should

3990
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:41,440
not filtering out everything they should
 

3991
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:43,510
not filtering out everything they should
be yet or perhaps there's some other

3992
01:04:43,510 --> 01:04:43,520
be yet or perhaps there's some other
 

3993
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,349
be yet or perhaps there's some other
type of error

3994
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:45,359
type of error
 

3995
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,190
type of error
maybe it needs to be calibrated

3996
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:47,200
maybe it needs to be calibrated
 

3997
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,510
maybe it needs to be calibrated
whatever it was relatively new and we

3998
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
whatever it was relatively new and we
 

3999
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,029
whatever it was relatively new and we
were somewhat used to there being

4000
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
were somewhat used to there being
 

4001
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,870
were somewhat used to there being
software problems with these types of

4002
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:52,880
software problems with these types of
 

4003
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,230
software problems with these types of
things occasionally just like anything

4004
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:54,240
things occasionally just like anything
 

4005
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:55,190
things occasionally just like anything
else

4006
01:04:55,190 --> 01:04:55,200
else
 

4007
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,829
else
and so okay maybe this is a radar

4008
01:04:57,829 --> 01:04:57,839
and so okay maybe this is a radar
 

4009
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,349
and so okay maybe this is a radar
software malfunction we're getting some

4010
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,359
software malfunction we're getting some
 

4011
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:01,670
software malfunction we're getting some
false tracks as we call them

4012
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:01,680
false tracks as we call them
 

4013
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:02,710
false tracks as we call them
um

4014
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:02,720
um
 

4015
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,150
um
what were you seeing

4016
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160
what were you seeing
 

4017
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,029
what were you seeing
and so what we would see are

4018
01:05:07,029 --> 01:05:07,039
and so what we would see are
 

4019
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,789
and so what we would see are
representations of the object so this is

4020
01:05:08,789 --> 01:05:08,799
representations of the object so this is
 

4021
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:09,990
representations of the object so this is
off of our radar we're not seeing a

4022
01:05:09,990 --> 01:05:10,000
off of our radar we're not seeing a
 

4023
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,990
off of our radar we're not seeing a
visual image here this is kind of like a

4024
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:12,000
visual image here this is kind of like a
 

4025
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,750
visual image here this is kind of like a
what's being displayed to us almost like

4026
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:13,760
what's being displayed to us almost like
 

4027
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,510
what's being displayed to us almost like
in a gaming fashion right like our the

4028
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:15,520
in a gaming fashion right like our the
 

4029
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,150
in a gaming fashion right like our the
icon right so the icon is showing us hey

4030
01:05:18,150 --> 01:05:18,160
icon right so the icon is showing us hey
 

4031
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:19,990
icon right so the icon is showing us hey
something is there and here's the

4032
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,000
something is there and here's the
 

4033
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:21,589
something is there and here's the
parameters i can understand about it so

4034
01:05:21,589 --> 01:05:21,599
parameters i can understand about it so
 

4035
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:23,190
parameters i can understand about it so
this is in the cockpit there's a display

4036
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:23,200
this is in the cockpit there's a display
 

4037
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,109
this is in the cockpit there's a display
that's showing

4038
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
that's showing
 

4039
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:27,190
that's showing
um some visualization with the radar is

4040
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:27,200
um some visualization with the radar is
 

4041
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:29,029
um some visualization with the radar is
detecting correct

4042
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:29,039
detecting correct
 

4043
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:30,309
detecting correct
and there's two different ways to do

4044
01:05:30,309 --> 01:05:30,319
and there's two different ways to do
 

4045
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:32,069
and there's two different ways to do
that the first one is like the actual

4046
01:05:32,069 --> 01:05:32,079
that the first one is like the actual
 

4047
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,710
that the first one is like the actual
data like the radar where

4048
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,720
data like the radar where
 

4049
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,029
data like the radar where
um i am

4050
01:05:37,029 --> 01:05:37,039
um i am
 

4051
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:38,950
um i am
it's showing me the data kind of as if

4052
01:05:38,950 --> 01:05:38,960
it's showing me the data kind of as if
 

4053
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,710
it's showing me the data kind of as if
it's in front of me and i'm selecting

4054
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:40,720
it's in front of me and i'm selecting
 

4055
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,069
it's in front of me and i'm selecting
those contacts and there's another

4056
01:05:42,069 --> 01:05:42,079
those contacts and there's another
 

4057
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:43,510
those contacts and there's another
screen called the situational awareness

4058
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
screen called the situational awareness
 

4059
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,750
screen called the situational awareness
page and that's kind of a god's eye view

4060
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:45,760
page and that's kind of a god's eye view
 

4061
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,390
page and that's kind of a god's eye view
that brings all that data into one spot

4062
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:48,400
that brings all that data into one spot
 

4063
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,789
that brings all that data into one spot
and so i'm going to talk about this from

4064
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:50,799
and so i'm going to talk about this from
 

4065
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:52,309
and so i'm going to talk about this from
the essay page from the situational

4066
01:05:52,309 --> 01:05:52,319
the essay page from the situational
 

4067
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:53,589
the essay page from the situational
awareness page versus the individual

4068
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:53,599
awareness page versus the individual
 

4069
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,910
awareness page versus the individual
radar ones because it's easier but okay

4070
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:55,920
radar ones because it's easier but okay
 

4071
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,910
radar ones because it's easier but okay
so sorry to linger on that so the

4072
01:05:57,910 --> 01:05:57,920
so sorry to linger on that so the
 

4073
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:59,910
so sorry to linger on that so the
individual displays are like first

4074
01:05:59,910 --> 01:05:59,920
individual displays are like first
 

4075
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:00,870
individual displays are like first
person

4076
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:00,880
person
 

4077
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,630
person
and then the essay

4078
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:02,640
and then the essay
 

4079
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:04,150
and then the essay
is

4080
01:06:04,150 --> 01:06:04,160
is
 

4081
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,069
is
when you say god's eye view is like from

4082
01:06:06,069 --> 01:06:06,079
when you say god's eye view is like from
 

4083
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:07,750
when you say god's eye view is like from
the top integration of all that

4084
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:07,760
the top integration of all that
 

4085
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:08,789
the top integration of all that
information

4086
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
information
 

4087
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,589
information
as if it's looking down onto the earth

4088
01:06:11,589 --> 01:06:11,599
as if it's looking down onto the earth
 

4089
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:13,109
as if it's looking down onto the earth
yes is that a good way to summarize it

4090
01:06:13,109 --> 01:06:13,119
yes is that a good way to summarize it
 

4091
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,710
yes is that a good way to summarize it
it is but for the aviator it's slightly

4092
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
it is but for the aviator it's slightly
 

4093
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,230
it is but for the aviator it's slightly
different because those two radar

4094
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:16,240
different because those two radar
 

4095
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,390
different because those two radar
displays i talked about are at the

4096
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:18,400
displays i talked about are at the
 

4097
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,069
displays i talked about are at the
bottom of that display

4098
01:06:20,069 --> 01:06:20,079
bottom of that display
 

4099
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,230
bottom of that display
is kind of representative of where i am

4100
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:22,240
is kind of representative of where i am
 

4101
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:23,829
is kind of representative of where i am
and so i see what's in front of me got

4102
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:23,839
and so i see what's in front of me got
 

4103
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:25,589
and so i see what's in front of me got
it whereas the situational awareness

4104
01:06:25,589 --> 01:06:25,599
it whereas the situational awareness
 

4105
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:26,390
it whereas the situational awareness
page

4106
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:26,400
page
 

4107
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,069
page
uh the aircraft is located in the center

4108
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:28,079
uh the aircraft is located in the center
 

4109
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:29,190
uh the aircraft is located in the center
of that

4110
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:29,200
of that
 

4111
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,069
of that
and then i all around me you know based

4112
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:32,079
and then i all around me you know based
 

4113
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:33,750
and then i all around me you know based
off of the data link and wherever i'm

4114
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:33,760
off of the data link and wherever i'm
 

4115
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,670
off of the data link and wherever i'm
getting information from

4116
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:35,680
getting information from
 

4117
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:37,750
getting information from
i can see that whole where page i can

4118
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:37,760
i can see that whole where page i can
 

4119
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,069
i can see that whole where page i can
see all the situation so

4120
01:06:40,069 --> 01:06:40,079
see all the situation so
 

4121
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,349
see all the situation so
i'm going to kind of talk about this

4122
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:41,359
i'm going to kind of talk about this
 

4123
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:43,349
i'm going to kind of talk about this
from the situational awareness page

4124
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:43,359
from the situational awareness page
 

4125
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,349
from the situational awareness page
which is a top-down view just to kind of

4126
01:06:45,349 --> 01:06:45,359
which is a top-down view just to kind of
 

4127
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:46,870
which is a top-down view just to kind of
frame our minds instead of jumping

4128
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:46,880
frame our minds instead of jumping
 

4129
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:47,750
frame our minds instead of jumping
around

4130
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:47,760
around
 

4131
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,109
around
and so what we would see out there is

4132
01:06:49,109 --> 01:06:49,119
and so what we would see out there is
 

4133
01:06:49,119 --> 01:06:50,789
and so what we would see out there is
we'd see these indications that

4134
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:50,799
we'd see these indications that
 

4135
01:06:50,799 --> 01:06:51,910
we'd see these indications that
something would be there and they would

4136
01:06:51,910 --> 01:06:51,920
something would be there and they would
 

4137
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,430
something would be there and they would
have a track file

4138
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:53,440
have a track file
 

4139
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,870
have a track file
that track file that thing that

4140
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:54,880
that track file that thing that
 

4141
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,789
that track file that thing that
represents the object has a line coming

4142
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:56,799
represents the object has a line coming
 

4143
01:06:56,799 --> 01:06:58,390
represents the object has a line coming
out of it and that represents what's

4144
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:58,400
out of it and that represents what's
 

4145
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,950
out of it and that represents what's
called the target aspect indicator

4146
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:00,960
called the target aspect indicator
 

4147
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,870
called the target aspect indicator
um and there's some tracking from the

4148
01:07:02,870 --> 01:07:02,880
um and there's some tracking from the
 

4149
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,230
um and there's some tracking from the
radar correct so it's showing you where

4150
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:04,240
radar correct so it's showing you where
 

4151
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,829
radar correct so it's showing you where
the object's going this is all pretty

4152
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:05,839
the object's going this is all pretty
 

4153
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:07,670
the object's going this is all pretty
cool that the radar can do all this so

4154
01:07:07,670 --> 01:07:07,680
cool that the radar can do all this so
 

4155
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:10,309
cool that the radar can do all this so
radar locks in on the different objects

4156
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:10,319
radar locks in on the different objects
 

4157
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:12,150
radar locks in on the different objects
and it tracks them over time correct

4158
01:07:12,150 --> 01:07:12,160
and it tracks them over time correct
 

4159
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,910
and it tracks them over time correct
that's coming from the radar that's like

4160
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:13,920
that's coming from the radar that's like
 

4161
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,150
that's coming from the radar that's like
built-in feature mm-hmm okay cool out

4162
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:16,160
built-in feature mm-hmm okay cool out
 

4163
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:17,589
built-in feature mm-hmm okay cool out
there we're seeing it so we don't have

4164
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:17,599
there we're seeing it so we don't have
 

4165
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:20,470
there we're seeing it so we don't have
to necessarily like pull things into our

4166
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:20,480
to necessarily like pull things into our
 

4167
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:21,990
to necessarily like pull things into our
our tracker in some sense right like

4168
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:22,000
our tracker in some sense right like
 

4169
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,349
our tracker in some sense right like
it's all out there and then we can kind

4170
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:23,359
it's all out there and then we can kind
 

4171
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:25,109
it's all out there and then we can kind
of choose the highlight on stuff or to

4172
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:25,119
of choose the highlight on stuff or to
 

4173
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:27,510
of choose the highlight on stuff or to
kind of focus in on it more so

4174
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
kind of focus in on it more so
 

4175
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,029
kind of focus in on it more so
but the information should all be out

4176
01:07:29,029 --> 01:07:29,039
but the information should all be out
 

4177
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:29,829
but the information should all be out
there

4178
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:29,839
there
 

4179
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,510
there
and so we'd see that target aspect

4180
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:31,520
and so we'd see that target aspect
 

4181
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,829
and so we'd see that target aspect
indicator that that line on a typical

4182
01:07:33,829 --> 01:07:33,839
indicator that that line on a typical
 

4183
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:35,190
indicator that that line on a typical
aircraft you know it would kind of look

4184
01:07:35,190 --> 01:07:35,200
aircraft you know it would kind of look
 

4185
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,230
aircraft you know it would kind of look
like this it'd be coming out and it

4186
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:36,240
like this it'd be coming out and it
 

4187
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:38,230
like this it'd be coming out and it
would go steady and if they turn you you

4188
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:38,240
would go steady and if they turn you you
 

4189
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:39,670
would go steady and if they turn you you
know it'll be like

4190
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:39,680
know it'll be like
 

4191
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:41,190
know it'll be like
when you see them turn right like it's

4192
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:41,200
when you see them turn right like it's
 

4193
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,430
when you see them turn right like it's
not magic but this object they would the

4194
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:43,440
not magic but this object they would the
 

4195
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:45,270
not magic but this object they would the
target aspect would kind of

4196
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:45,280
target aspect would kind of
 

4197
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,190
target aspect would kind of
be like all over the place like kind of

4198
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:47,200
be like all over the place like kind of
 

4199
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,270
be like all over the place like kind of
randomly in the 360 degrees you know

4200
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:49,280
randomly in the 360 degrees you know
 

4201
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:51,349
randomly in the 360 degrees you know
from that top-down view that line would

4202
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
from that top-down view that line would
 

4203
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,069
from that top-down view that line would
be

4204
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:52,079
be
 

4205
01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:53,670
be
in a place so kind of you know is it

4206
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:53,680
in a place so kind of you know is it
 

4207
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,710
in a place so kind of you know is it
unable to determine the target aspect is

4208
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:56,720
unable to determine the target aspect is
 

4209
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:58,390
unable to determine the target aspect is
it stationary you know and that's just

4210
01:07:58,390 --> 01:07:58,400
it stationary you know and that's just
 

4211
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,589
it stationary you know and that's just
how it puts it out and it's not used to

4212
01:07:59,589 --> 01:07:59,599
how it puts it out and it's not used to
 

4213
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,270
how it puts it out and it's not used to
seeing it so i'm not saying that's

4214
01:08:01,270 --> 01:08:01,280
seeing it so i'm not saying that's
 

4215
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:02,789
seeing it so i'm not saying that's
necessarily super weird but it was

4216
01:08:02,789 --> 01:08:02,799
necessarily super weird but it was
 

4217
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,069
necessarily super weird but it was
different than what we were used to

4218
01:08:04,069 --> 01:08:04,079
different than what we were used to
 

4219
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,349
different than what we were used to
seeing because we weren't used to seeing

4220
01:08:05,349 --> 01:08:05,359
seeing because we weren't used to seeing
 

4221
01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:08,230
seeing because we weren't used to seeing
stationary objects out there very much

4222
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:08,240
stationary objects out there very much
 

4223
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,510
stationary objects out there very much
and what was also interesting is that

4224
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:09,520
and what was also interesting is that
 

4225
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:11,670
and what was also interesting is that
these weren't just stationary

4226
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:11,680
these weren't just stationary
 

4227
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,589
these weren't just stationary
on a zero wind day right these are

4228
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
on a zero wind day right these are
 

4229
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:15,190
on a zero wind day right these are
stationary at twenty thousand feet

4230
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:15,200
stationary at twenty thousand feet
 

4231
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,870
stationary at twenty thousand feet
fifteen thousand feet

4232
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:16,880
fifteen thousand feet
 

4233
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:18,309
fifteen thousand feet
five hundred feet

4234
01:08:18,309 --> 01:08:18,319
five hundred feet
 

4235
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,070
five hundred feet
you know with with the wind blowing you

4236
01:08:20,070 --> 01:08:20,080
you know with with the wind blowing you
 

4237
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:21,030
you know with with the wind blowing you
know

4238
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:21,040
know
 

4239
01:08:21,040 --> 01:08:22,709
know
and so much like the sea you know when

4240
01:08:22,709 --> 01:08:22,719
and so much like the sea you know when
 

4241
01:08:22,719 --> 01:08:24,070
and so much like the sea you know when
we're up there fighting it affects

4242
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080
we're up there fighting it affects
 

4243
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,990
we're up there fighting it affects
everything we consider the wind when

4244
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:26,000
everything we consider the wind when
 

4245
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:27,669
everything we consider the wind when
we're you know shooting missiles when

4246
01:08:27,669 --> 01:08:27,679
we're you know shooting missiles when
 

4247
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:29,590
we're you know shooting missiles when
we're flying or fuel considerations it's

4248
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:29,600
we're flying or fuel considerations it's
 

4249
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,110
we're flying or fuel considerations it's
like operating you know in that volume

4250
01:08:31,110 --> 01:08:31,120
like operating you know in that volume
 

4251
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,709
like operating you know in that volume
of air like the ocean everything's going

4252
01:08:32,709 --> 01:08:32,719
of air like the ocean everything's going
 

4253
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:33,829
of air like the ocean everything's going
with the current

4254
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:33,839
with the current
 

4255
01:08:33,839 --> 01:08:35,510
with the current
and so anything that doesn't go with the

4256
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
and so anything that doesn't go with the
 

4257
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:37,349
and so anything that doesn't go with the
current you know is immediately

4258
01:08:37,349 --> 01:08:37,359
current you know is immediately
 

4259
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,789
current you know is immediately
kind of identifiable and strange and

4260
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:38,799
kind of identifiable and strange and
 

4261
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:39,829
kind of identifiable and strange and
that's why these were initially

4262
01:08:39,829 --> 01:08:39,839
that's why these were initially
 

4263
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:40,870
that's why these were initially
strangers because they would be

4264
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:40,880
strangers because they would be
 

4265
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:42,630
strangers because they would be
stationary against the wind so if you

4266
01:08:42,630 --> 01:08:42,640
stationary against the wind so if you
 

4267
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,189
stationary against the wind so if you
had something like a good drone

4268
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:45,199
had something like a good drone
 

4269
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,030
had something like a good drone
in the windy conditions what would that

4270
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:47,040
in the windy conditions what would that
 

4271
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:49,110
in the windy conditions what would that
look like would it would it not come off

4272
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:49,120
look like would it would it not come off
 

4273
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:51,510
look like would it would it not come off
as stationary would it sort of float

4274
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:51,520
as stationary would it sort of float
 

4275
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,829
as stationary would it sort of float
about kind of thing no i think with the

4276
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:53,839
about kind of thing no i think with the
 

4277
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,110
about kind of thing no i think with the
drone technology we have today they

4278
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
drone technology we have today they
 

4279
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,470
drone technology we have today they
could stay within a pretty tight

4280
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:56,480
could stay within a pretty tight
 

4281
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:59,749
could stay within a pretty tight
location well i meant like dji drone not

4282
01:08:59,749 --> 01:08:59,759
location well i meant like dji drone not
 

4283
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:01,669
location well i meant like dji drone not
like cons i'm saying like generically

4284
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
like cons i'm saying like generically
 

4285
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,510
like cons i'm saying like generically
speaking i would not i'm not a military

4286
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
speaking i would not i'm not a military
 

4287
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:05,030
speaking i would not i'm not a military
drone no i just i have a dji drone

4288
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:05,040
drone no i just i have a dji drone
 

4289
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,510
drone no i just i have a dji drone
myself even and you know maybe not 100

4290
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
myself even and you know maybe not 100
 

4291
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,510
myself even and you know maybe not 100
knots but if that thing's in 30 or 40

4292
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:09,520
knots but if that thing's in 30 or 40
 

4293
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:11,030
knots but if that thing's in 30 or 40
not wins you know

4294
01:09:11,030 --> 01:09:11,040
not wins you know
 

4295
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,709
not wins you know
the amount of

4296
01:09:12,709 --> 01:09:12,719
the amount of
 

4297
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,430
the amount of
distance it's going to be kind of doing

4298
01:09:15,430 --> 01:09:15,440
distance it's going to be kind of doing
 

4299
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,030
distance it's going to be kind of doing
one of these like that change is not

4300
01:09:17,030 --> 01:09:17,040
one of these like that change is not
 

4301
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,470
one of these like that change is not
something i'm going to detect from maybe

4302
01:09:18,470 --> 01:09:18,480
something i'm going to detect from maybe
 

4303
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:20,709
something i'm going to detect from maybe
many miles away interesting so it could

4304
01:09:20,709 --> 01:09:20,719
many miles away interesting so it could
 

4305
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:22,309
many miles away interesting so it could
look very stationary

4306
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:22,319
look very stationary
 

4307
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,309
look very stationary
but that wasn't necessarily you know and

4308
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:24,319
but that wasn't necessarily you know and
 

4309
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,070
but that wasn't necessarily you know and
what's interesting about this story is

4310
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:26,080
what's interesting about this story is
 

4311
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:27,510
what's interesting about this story is
that there's not like the one smoking

4312
01:09:27,510 --> 01:09:27,520
that there's not like the one smoking
 

4313
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:28,950
that there's not like the one smoking
gun right you have to kind of look at

4314
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:28,960
gun right you have to kind of look at
 

4315
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:30,950
gun right you have to kind of look at
everything and that's what i know i

4316
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:30,960
everything and that's what i know i
 

4317
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,870
everything and that's what i know i
don't like about

4318
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
don't like about
 

4319
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,550
don't like about
the department of defense and just

4320
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:34,560
the department of defense and just
 

4321
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,349
the department of defense and just
generally people's take on this is that

4322
01:09:37,349 --> 01:09:37,359
generally people's take on this is that
 

4323
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:38,789
generally people's take on this is that
everything is kind of based around a

4324
01:09:38,789 --> 01:09:38,799
everything is kind of based around a
 

4325
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,030
everything is kind of based around a
single image you know or that that one

4326
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:41,040
single image you know or that that one
 

4327
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,430
single image you know or that that one
case but a lot of interestingness comes

4328
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:43,440
case but a lot of interestingness comes
 

4329
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:45,189
case but a lot of interestingness comes
from the duration or the time it's been

4330
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:45,199
from the duration or the time it's been
 

4331
01:09:45,199 --> 01:09:46,390
from the duration or the time it's been
out there how they're interacting

4332
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:46,400
out there how they're interacting
 

4333
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,070
out there how they're interacting
relative to other objects out there and

4334
01:09:48,070 --> 01:09:48,080
relative to other objects out there and
 

4335
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:49,669
relative to other objects out there and
you don't get that information when you

4336
01:09:49,669 --> 01:09:49,679
you don't get that information when you
 

4337
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:51,510
you don't get that information when you
just look at a frame for a second you

4338
01:09:51,510 --> 01:09:51,520
just look at a frame for a second you
 

4339
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,430
just look at a frame for a second you
know everyone kind of bites off on the

4340
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:53,440
know everyone kind of bites off on the
 

4341
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:56,070
know everyone kind of bites off on the
shiny object but so you yourself

4342
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,080
shiny object but so you yourself
 

4343
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:57,510
shiny object but so you yourself
from your particular slice of things

4344
01:09:57,510 --> 01:09:57,520
from your particular slice of things
 

4345
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,910
from your particular slice of things
you've experienced and seen directly or

4346
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
you've experienced and seen directly or
 

4347
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,750
you've experienced and seen directly or
indirectly you've kind of built up an

4348
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
indirectly you've kind of built up an
 

4349
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,070
indirectly you've kind of built up an
intuition about what are the things that

4350
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:04,080
intuition about what are the things that
 

4351
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,830
intuition about what are the things that
were being seen i want to go that far

4352
01:10:05,830 --> 01:10:05,840
were being seen i want to go that far
 

4353
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,910
were being seen i want to go that far
i've just been able to you know

4354
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:07,920
i've just been able to you know
 

4355
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,270
i've just been able to you know
eliminate some some variables because of

4356
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:11,280
eliminate some some variables because of
 

4357
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:13,270
eliminate some some variables because of
how long i've observed it so like you

4358
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:13,280
how long i've observed it so like you
 

4359
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,709
how long i've observed it so like you
said yes can a drone stay in a

4360
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:14,719
said yes can a drone stay in a
 

4361
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:15,750
said yes can a drone stay in a
particular position against the wind

4362
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:15,760
particular position against the wind
 

4363
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,910
particular position against the wind
like that certainly but i don't think it

4364
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:17,920
like that certainly but i don't think it
 

4365
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:19,669
like that certainly but i don't think it
can do that and then go point eight mach

4366
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:19,679
can do that and then go point eight mach
 

4367
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:21,510
can do that and then go point eight mach
for four hours after that you know and

4368
01:10:21,510 --> 01:10:21,520
for four hours after that you know and
 

4369
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:22,229
for four hours after that you know and
so

4370
01:10:22,229 --> 01:10:22,239
so
 

4371
01:10:22,239 --> 01:10:23,750
so
when you when you look at it outside of

4372
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:23,760
when you when you look at it outside of
 

4373
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:27,110
when you when you look at it outside of
that once that moment in time then it

4374
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,120
that once that moment in time then it
 

4375
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:28,790
that once that moment in time then it
eliminates a lot of the potential things

4376
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:28,800
eliminates a lot of the potential things
 

4377
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,550
eliminates a lot of the potential things
it could be at least from my perspective

4378
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:30,560
it could be at least from my perspective
 

4379
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,550
it could be at least from my perspective
so what kind of stuff did you see yeah

4380
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:32,560
so what kind of stuff did you see yeah
 

4381
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,390
so what kind of stuff did you see yeah
in the instruments we'd see them flying

4382
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:34,400
in the instruments we'd see them flying
 

4383
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:37,030
in the instruments we'd see them flying
um in patterns uh kind of racetrack

4384
01:10:37,030 --> 01:10:37,040
um in patterns uh kind of racetrack
 

4385
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:38,790
um in patterns uh kind of racetrack
patterns or circular patterns or just

4386
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:38,800
patterns or circular patterns or just
 

4387
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,430
patterns or circular patterns or just
going kind of straight east

01:10:41,430 --> 01:10:41,440
going kind of straight east
 

4389
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,630
going kind of straight east
i occasionally see them supersonic 1.1

01:10:44,630 --> 01:10:44,640
i occasionally see them supersonic 1.1
 

4391
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,910
i occasionally see them supersonic 1.1
1.2 mach but typically 0.6 to 0.8 mach

just for extremely extended periods of
 

4395
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:53,270
just for extremely extended periods of

10 miles off the coast goes like 300

4404
01:11:00,950 --> 01:11:00,960
10 miles off the coast goes like 300
 

4405
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,870
10 miles off the coast goes like 300
miles can you say the location that

4406
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:02,880
miles can you say the location that
 

4407
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:04,310
miles can you say the location that
we're talking about off the coast of

virginia beach
 

4411
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:08,229
virginia beach
got it and so nobody is supposed to be

4412
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:08,239
got it and so nobody is supposed to be
 

4413
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:09,189
got it and so nobody is supposed to be
out there

4414
01:11:09,189 --> 01:11:09,199
out there
 

4415
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:10,390
out there
it's possible for people to be there

4416
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:10,400
it's possible for people to be there
 

4417
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,630
it's possible for people to be there
it's not necessarily restricted but it's

4418
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:12,640
it's not necessarily restricted but it's
 

4419
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,630
it's not necessarily restricted but it's
well monitored and we're out there every

4420
01:11:14,630 --> 01:11:14,640
well monitored and we're out there every
 

4421
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:16,550
well monitored and we're out there every
day all day and so you know people know

4422
01:11:16,550 --> 01:11:16,560
day all day and so you know people know
 

4423
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,229
day all day and so you know people know
to stay clear if a cessna goes bumbling

4424
01:11:18,229 --> 01:11:18,239
to stay clear if a cessna goes bumbling
 

4425
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:19,430
to stay clear if a cessna goes bumbling
in there everyone's going to know about

4426
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
in there everyone's going to know about
 

4427
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,830
in there everyone's going to know about
it fa is going to you know call him out

4428
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:21,840
it fa is going to you know call him out
 

4429
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:25,350
it fa is going to you know call him out
he's going to tell us about it so

4430
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
he's going to tell us about it so
 

4431
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:27,669
he's going to tell us about it so
concursions happen not a big deal but um

4432
01:11:27,669 --> 01:11:27,679
concursions happen not a big deal but um
 

4433
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:29,030
concursions happen not a big deal but um
they're pretty rare honestly because

4434
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
they're pretty rare honestly because
 

4435
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,149
they're pretty rare honestly because
everyone knows area and we've been

4436
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:30,159
everyone knows area and we've been
 

4437
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:32,390
everyone knows area and we've been
operating there for decades and what are

4438
01:11:32,390 --> 01:11:32,400
operating there for decades and what are
 

4439
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,390
operating there for decades and what are
the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 mach that

4440
01:11:36,390 --> 01:11:36,400
the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 mach that
 

4441
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,550
the trajectories at 0.6 to 0.8 mach that
these objects were taking

4442
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:38,560
these objects were taking
 

4443
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,110
these objects were taking
typically they would be in some type of

4444
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:41,120
typically they would be in some type of
 

4445
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:42,950
typically they would be in some type of
circular pattern or kind of racetrack

4446
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:42,960
circular pattern or kind of racetrack
 

4447
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,550
circular pattern or kind of racetrack
pattern when they were at those speeds

4448
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:44,560
pattern when they were at those speeds
 

4449
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:46,709
pattern when they were at those speeds
or i just see them kind of it wasn't

4450
01:11:46,709 --> 01:11:46,719
or i just see them kind of it wasn't
 

4451
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,350
or i just see them kind of it wasn't
always like a mechanical flight

4452
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
always like a mechanical flight
 

4453
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:50,870
always like a mechanical flight

01:11:50,870 --> 01:11:50,880
description and when i say that i mean
 

4455
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,350

like an autopilot is going to be

4456
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:53,360
like an autopilot is going to be
 

4457
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,709
like an autopilot is going to be
just very precise right it's going to be

4458
01:11:54,709 --> 01:11:54,719
just very precise right it's going to be
 

4459
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:57,030
just very precise right it's going to be
locked on straight and whereas i could

4460
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:57,040
locked on straight and whereas i could
 

4461
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,149
locked on straight and whereas i could
see an airplane i could tell if the

4462
01:11:58,149 --> 01:11:58,159
see an airplane i could tell if the
 

4463
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,510
see an airplane i could tell if the
pilot's flying it right because it's not

4464
01:11:59,510 --> 01:11:59,520
pilot's flying it right because it's not
 

4465
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:01,270
pilot's flying it right because it's not
going to be perfect the computer's not

4466
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:01,280
going to be perfect the computer's not
 

4467
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,030
going to be perfect the computer's not
controlling it and these seemed more

4468
01:12:03,030 --> 01:12:03,040
controlling it and these seemed more
 

4469
01:12:03,040 --> 01:12:05,189
controlling it and these seemed more
like that not that they were imprecise

4470
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:05,199
like that not that they were imprecise
 

4471
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:06,709
like that not that they were imprecise
but that they were even much more

4472
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:06,719
but that they were even much more
 

4473
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,630
but that they were even much more
erratic than that so like it wasn't like

4474
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:08,640
erratic than that so like it wasn't like
 

4475
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:10,229
erratic than that so like it wasn't like
a straight line in a turn it was just

4476
01:12:10,229 --> 01:12:10,239
a straight line in a turn it was just
 

4477
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,510
a straight line in a turn it was just
kind of like a

4478
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:11,520
kind of like a
 

4479
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,510
kind of like a
you know weird drift like that in that

4480
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:13,520
you know weird drift like that in that
 

4481
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,950
you know weird drift like that in that
direction you know so it wasn't

4482
01:12:14,950 --> 01:12:14,960
direction you know so it wasn't
 

4483
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,149
direction you know so it wasn't
controlled by a down computer or uh no

4484
01:12:18,149 --> 01:12:18,159
controlled by a down computer or uh no
 

4485
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,630
controlled by a down computer or uh no
no disrespect to computers so it wasn't

4486
01:12:20,630 --> 01:12:20,640
no disrespect to computers so it wasn't
 

4487
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:22,070
no disrespect to computers so it wasn't
controlled by autopilot kind of

4488
01:12:22,070 --> 01:12:22,080
controlled by autopilot kind of
 

4489
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,070
controlled by autopilot kind of
technology that's not the sense that i

4490
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:24,080
technology that's not the sense that i
 

4491
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,430
technology that's not the sense that i
got

4492
01:12:25,430 --> 01:12:25,440
got
 

4493
01:12:25,440 --> 01:12:27,350
got
so how many people have seen them in the

4494
01:12:27,350 --> 01:12:27,360
so how many people have seen them in the
 

4495
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,630
so how many people have seen them in the
squadron uh sort of how many times were

4496
01:12:30,630 --> 01:12:30,640
squadron uh sort of how many times were
 

4497
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:32,790
squadron uh sort of how many times were
they seen how many

4498
01:12:32,790 --> 01:12:32,800
they seen how many
 

4499
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,830
they seen how many
um

4500
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:33,840
um
 

4501
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:35,430
um
were there times when there's multiple

4502
01:12:35,430 --> 01:12:35,440
were there times when there's multiple
 

4503
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,350
were there times when there's multiple
objects once we started seeing on the

4504
01:12:37,350 --> 01:12:37,360
objects once we started seeing on the
 

4505
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:38,870
objects once we started seeing on the
radar enough and we would get close

4506
01:12:38,870 --> 01:12:38,880
radar enough and we would get close
 

4507
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:39,910
radar enough and we would get close
enough we'd actually see them on our

4508
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:39,920
enough we'd actually see them on our
 

4509
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,830
enough we'd actually see them on our
fleer as well so our

4510
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:41,840
fleer as well so our
 

4511
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,430
fleer as well so our
advanced targeting

4512
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:43,440
advanced targeting
 

4513
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,709
advanced targeting
uh pod uh it's essentially a infrared

4514
01:12:46,709 --> 01:12:46,719
uh pod uh it's essentially a infrared
 

4515
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:48,709
uh pod uh it's essentially a infrared
camera that we use for targeting mostly

4516
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
camera that we use for targeting mostly
 

4517
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,790
camera that we use for targeting mostly
in the air to surface environment

4518
01:12:50,790 --> 01:12:50,800
in the air to surface environment
 

4519
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:52,870
in the air to surface environment
we don't use it in the air arena it's

4520
01:12:52,870 --> 01:12:52,880
we don't use it in the air arena it's
 

4521
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:54,870
we don't use it in the air arena it's
just not that good of a tool

4522
01:12:54,870 --> 01:12:54,880
just not that good of a tool
 

4523
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:55,990
just not that good of a tool
frankly

4524
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:56,000
frankly
 

4525
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,110
frankly
but

4526
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:57,120
but
 

4527
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:59,430
but
we would see ir energy emitting from

4528
01:12:59,430 --> 01:12:59,440
we would see ir energy emitting from
 

4529
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,950
we would see ir energy emitting from
that location where the radar was

4530
01:13:00,950 --> 01:13:00,960
that location where the radar was
 

4531
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,630
that location where the radar was
dropping us off so you know the radar

4532
01:13:02,630 --> 01:13:02,640
dropping us off so you know the radar
 

4533
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,149
dropping us off so you know the radar
we'd lock onto the object and our

4534
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,159
we'd lock onto the object and our
 

4535
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:05,750
we'd lock onto the object and our
sensors would all look there and so then

4536
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:05,760
sensors would all look there and so then
 

4537
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,030
sensors would all look there and so then
we could see that it's looking at that

4538
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
we could see that it's looking at that
 

4539
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,030
we could see that it's looking at that
right piece of sky but

4540
01:13:09,030 --> 01:13:09,040
right piece of sky but
 

4541
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:10,709
right piece of sky but
uh there's energy actually coming from

4542
01:13:10,709 --> 01:13:10,719
uh there's energy actually coming from
 

4543
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:12,310
uh there's energy actually coming from
there so now we start thinking that okay

4544
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:12,320
there so now we start thinking that okay
 

4545
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,470
there so now we start thinking that okay
maybe not radar malfunctions maybe more

4546
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:14,480
maybe not radar malfunctions maybe more
 

4547
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,149
maybe not radar malfunctions maybe more
maybe something is physically here of

4548
01:13:16,149 --> 01:13:16,159
maybe something is physically here of
 

4549
01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:17,669
maybe something is physically here of
course and then people started to try to

4550
01:13:17,669 --> 01:13:17,679
course and then people started to try to
 

4551
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,310
course and then people started to try to
fly by and see it and at this point

4552
01:13:20,310 --> 01:13:20,320
fly by and see it and at this point
 

4553
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:21,990
fly by and see it and at this point
you know i would say maybe 80 to 90

4554
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:22,000
you know i would say maybe 80 to 90
 

4555
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:23,110
you know i would say maybe 80 to 90
percent of our squadron have probably

4556
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:23,120
percent of our squadron have probably
 

4557
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,310
percent of our squadron have probably
seen one of these on the radar at this

4558
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:24,320
seen one of these on the radar at this
 

4559
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:26,149
seen one of these on the radar at this
point everyone was aware of it

4560
01:13:26,149 --> 01:13:26,159
point everyone was aware of it
 

4561
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:28,070
point everyone was aware of it
there was small communication i think

4562
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:28,080
there was small communication i think
 

4563
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,070
there was small communication i think
between squadrons of the same area that

4564
01:13:30,070 --> 01:13:30,080
between squadrons of the same area that
 

4565
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:32,149
between squadrons of the same area that
had the same radar so i knew it wasn't

4566
01:13:32,149 --> 01:13:32,159
had the same radar so i knew it wasn't
 

4567
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:33,830
had the same radar so i knew it wasn't
just our squadron for whatever strange

4568
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840
just our squadron for whatever strange
 

4569
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:35,669
just our squadron for whatever strange
reason um because they would be other

4570
01:13:35,669 --> 01:13:35,679
reason um because they would be other
 

4571
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:36,870
reason um because they would be other
squadrons would be out there and we

4572
01:13:36,870 --> 01:13:36,880
squadrons would be out there and we
 

4573
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:38,630
squadrons would be out there and we
would talk to them like hey like careful

4574
01:13:38,630 --> 01:13:38,640
would talk to them like hey like careful
 

4575
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:40,070
would talk to them like hey like careful
there's an object are you aware of that

4576
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:40,080
there's an object are you aware of that
 

4577
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,910
there's an object are you aware of that
you know so like they would be aware of

4578
01:13:41,910 --> 01:13:41,920
you know so like they would be aware of
 

4579
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:42,630
you know so like they would be aware of
it

4580
01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:42,640
it
 

4581
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:43,990
it
and then of course people would want to

4582
01:13:43,990 --> 01:13:44,000
and then of course people would want to
 

4583
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,430
and then of course people would want to
go see what they look like right so

4584
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:45,440
go see what they look like right so
 

4585
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,350
go see what they look like right so
people would try to fly by i try to fly

4586
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:47,360
people would try to fly by i try to fly
 

4587
01:13:47,360 --> 01:13:50,070
people would try to fly by i try to fly
by him i like how that's in of course

4588
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:50,080
by him i like how that's in of course
 

4589
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:51,110
by him i like how that's in of course
of course

4590
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:51,120
of course
 

4591
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,270
of course
of course you don't want to fly by it so

4592
01:13:53,270 --> 01:13:53,280
of course you don't want to fly by it so
 

4593
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:54,470
of course you don't want to fly by it so
you know

4594
01:13:54,470 --> 01:13:54,480
you know
 

4595
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:56,709
you know
there's an uh there's a argument against

4596
01:13:56,709 --> 01:13:56,719
there's an uh there's a argument against
 

4597
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:58,470
there's an uh there's a argument against
that kind of perspective that maybe the

4598
01:13:58,470 --> 01:13:58,480
that kind of perspective that maybe the
 

4599
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:00,630
that kind of perspective that maybe the
thing is dangerous so maybe we don't but

4600
01:14:00,630 --> 01:14:00,640
thing is dangerous so maybe we don't but
 

4601
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,310
thing is dangerous so maybe we don't but
perhaps that's part of the reason you

4602
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:02,320
perhaps that's part of the reason you
 

4603
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,070
perhaps that's part of the reason you
want to fly by is to understand better

4604
01:14:04,070 --> 01:14:04,080
want to fly by is to understand better
 

4605
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,830
want to fly by is to understand better
what it is if it's a threat we have a

4606
01:14:05,830 --> 01:14:05,840
what it is if it's a threat we have a
 

4607
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,350
what it is if it's a threat we have a
lot of contact now that we did it back

4608
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:07,360
lot of contact now that we did it back
 

4609
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,430
lot of contact now that we did it back
then you know and so it was still a hey

4610
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:09,440
then you know and so it was still a hey
 

4611
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,110
then you know and so it was still a hey
is this a balloon is this a drone you

4612
01:14:11,110 --> 01:14:11,120
is this a balloon is this a drone you
 

4613
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:12,790
is this a balloon is this a drone you
know at a certain point and we're also

4614
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:12,800
know at a certain point and we're also
 

4615
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,390
know at a certain point and we're also
aware of you know potential intelligence

4616
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
aware of you know potential intelligence

we're up there flying our tactics we're

4622
01:14:18,630 --> 01:14:18,640
we're up there flying our tactics we're
 

4623
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:22,229
we're up there flying our tactics we're
emitting uh we're practicing our ew you

4624
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:22,239
emitting uh we're practicing our ew you
 

4625
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:24,229
emitting uh we're practicing our ew you
know we're turning at particular times

4626
01:14:24,229 --> 01:14:24,239
know we're turning at particular times
 

4627
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:25,510
know we're turning at particular times
like there's stuff that can be learned

4628
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
like there's stuff that can be learned
 

4629
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,350
like there's stuff that can be learned
it's not a secret and you know countries

4630
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
it's not a secret and you know countries
 

4631
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,110
it's not a secret and you know countries
keep different fishing vessels and

4632
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
keep different fishing vessels and
 

4633
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,870
keep different fishing vessels and
whatnot in international waters off

whatnot in international waters off
 

4635
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:33,270

there so it's not exactly a secret that

4636
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:33,280
there so it's not exactly a secret that
 

4637
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,430
there so it's not exactly a secret that
uh we're being observed out there so to

4638
01:14:35,430 --> 01:14:35,440
uh we're being observed out there so to
 

4639
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,270
uh we're being observed out there so to
think that a foreign hospital or a

4640
01:14:37,270 --> 01:14:37,280
think that a foreign hospital or a
 

4641
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,830
think that a foreign hospital or a
foreign nation would want to

4642
01:14:39,830 --> 01:14:39,840
foreign nation would want to
 

4643
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,990
foreign nation would want to
you know somehow intercept information

4644
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
you know somehow intercept information
 

4645
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:44,550
you know somehow intercept information
whether that's

4646
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:44,560
whether that's
 

4647
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:45,910
whether that's
our radar signals or jamming

4648
01:14:45,910 --> 01:14:45,920
our radar signals or jamming
 

4649

break that down or understand it better

4652
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:49,760
break that down or understand it better
 

4653
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,910
break that down or understand it better
or be ready for that next fight

4654
01:14:51,910 --> 01:14:51,920
or be ready for that next fight
 

4655
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:53,110
or be ready for that next fight
i mean

4656
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:53,120
i mean
 

4657
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,950
i mean
that's what that's what scares me about

4658
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:54,960
that's what that's what scares me about
 

4659
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,709
that's what that's what scares me about
this scenario because

4660
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:56,719
this scenario because
 

4661
01:14:56,719 --> 01:14:58,870
this scenario because
we didn't jump right to aliens or ufos

4662
01:14:58,870 --> 01:14:58,880
we didn't jump right to aliens or ufos
 

4663
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,870
we didn't jump right to aliens or ufos
we thought you know this is a radar

4664
01:15:00,870 --> 01:15:00,880
we thought you know this is a radar
 

4665
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,149
we thought you know this is a radar
malfunction we need to be aware of it's

4666
01:15:02,149 --> 01:15:02,159
malfunction we need to be aware of it's
 

4667
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,750
malfunction we need to be aware of it's
a safety issue and then

4668
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
a safety issue and then
 

4669
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,510
a safety issue and then
you know this could be a tactical

4670
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:05,520
you know this could be a tactical
 

4671
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,189
you know this could be a tactical
problem right here because

4672
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
problem right here because
 

4673
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,830
problem right here because
everything we do is based off a crypto

4674
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:09,840
everything we do is based off a crypto
 

4675
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,830
everything we do is based off a crypto
and and locate you know locations

4676
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:11,840
and and locate you know locations
 

4677
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,189
and and locate you know locations
everything is classified we do out there

4678
01:15:13,189 --> 01:15:13,199
everything is classified we do out there
 

4679
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:14,870
everything is classified we do out there
right and so over time if you gather

4680
01:15:14,870 --> 01:15:14,880
right and so over time if you gather
 

4681
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,470
right and so over time if you gather
enough data about those fights and just

4682
01:15:16,470 --> 01:15:16,480
enough data about those fights and just
 

4683
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,870
enough data about those fights and just
monitor them forever just like uh some

4684
01:15:18,870 --> 01:15:18,880
monitor them forever just like uh some
 

4685
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:20,950
monitor them forever just like uh some
nations uh do with other

4686
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:20,960
nations uh do with other
 

4687
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,229
nations uh do with other
uh piece of technology or software um

4688
01:15:24,229 --> 01:15:24,239
uh piece of technology or software um
 

4689
01:15:24,239 --> 01:15:25,590
uh piece of technology or software um
they could probably learn a line so we

4690
01:15:25,590 --> 01:15:25,600
they could probably learn a line so we
 

4691
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:27,350
they could probably learn a line so we
have to be cognitive effect and defend

4692
01:15:27,350 --> 01:15:27,360
have to be cognitive effect and defend
 

4693
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,030
have to be cognitive effect and defend
against it

4694
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:29,040
against it
 

4695
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:31,430
against it
so what can you say about the

4696
01:15:31,430 --> 01:15:31,440
so what can you say about the
 

4697
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:33,270
so what can you say about the
other characteristics of these objects

4698
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
other characteristics of these objects
 

4699
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,189
other characteristics of these objects
like shape

4700
01:15:35,189 --> 01:15:35,199
like shape
 

4701
01:15:35,199 --> 01:15:38,310

how else do you describe object is there

4708
01:15:43,590 --> 01:15:43,600
how else do you describe object is there
 

4709
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,430
how else do you describe object is there
something that could be said so you said

4710
01:15:45,430 --> 01:15:45,440
something that could be said so you said
 

4711
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,070
something that could be said so you said
like this detect down radar step one now

4712
01:15:48,070 --> 01:15:48,080
like this detect down radar step one now
 

4713
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,390
like this detect down radar step one now
you have clear images that can give you

4714
01:15:50,390 --> 01:15:50,400
you have clear images that can give you
 

4715
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,149
you have clear images that can give you
a sense that it's actually a physical

4716
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:52,159
a sense that it's actually a physical
 

4717
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:54,310
a sense that it's actually a physical
object what else can be said about those

4718
01:15:54,310 --> 01:15:54,320
object what else can be said about those
 

4719
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,470
object what else can be said about those
physical objects so eventually someone

4720
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:56,480
physical objects so eventually someone
 

4721
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,270
physical objects so eventually someone
did see one with their own eyeballs

4722
01:15:59,270 --> 01:15:59,280
did see one with their own eyeballs
 

4723
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,070
did see one with their own eyeballs
multiple people and it and they saw it

4724
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
multiple people and it and they saw it
 

4725
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:04,630
multiple people and it and they saw it
in a somewhat interesting way

4726
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:04,640
in a somewhat interesting way
 

4727
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:07,189
in a somewhat interesting way
the object presented itself at

4728
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:07,199
the object presented itself at
 

4729
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:09,270
the object presented itself at
the exact altitude and geographic

4730
01:16:09,270 --> 01:16:09,280
the exact altitude and geographic
 

4731
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:11,669
the exact altitude and geographic
location of the entry points into our

4732
01:16:11,669 --> 01:16:11,679
location of the entry points into our
 

4733
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,030
location of the entry points into our
working areas

4734
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
working areas
 

4735
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:15,350
working areas
so we enter at a very specific point at

4736
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,360
so we enter at a very specific point at
 

4737
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:16,709
so we enter at a very specific point at
a certain altitude and people leave the

4738
01:16:16,709 --> 01:16:16,719
a certain altitude and people leave the
 

4739
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:18,390
a certain altitude and people leave the
areas at the same point at a lower

4740
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:18,400
areas at the same point at a lower

probably one of the busiest pieces of
 

4745
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:22,870
probably one of the busiest pieces of
sky on the eastern seaboard

sky on the eastern seaboard
 

4747
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:24,550
sky on the eastern seaboard
so two jets from my squadron went out

4748
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:24,560
so two jets from my squadron went out
 

4749
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:25,990
so two jets from my squadron went out
and they went flying and they entered

4750
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:26,000
and they went flying and they entered
 

4751
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,189
and they went flying and they entered
the area and when these objects went

4752
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:27,199
the area and when these objects went
 

4753
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:28,790
the area and when these objects went
right between the aircraft so they're

4754
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
right between the aircraft so they're
 

4755
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,270
right between the aircraft so they're
flying in formation and the object went

4756
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
flying in formation and the object went
 

4757
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:32,709
flying in formation and the object went
between the aircraft they went between

4758
01:16:32,709 --> 01:16:32,719
between the aircraft they went between
 

4759
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:34,229
between the aircraft they went between
the object i think i don't think that

4760
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:34,239
the object i think i don't think that
 

4761
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:36,070
the object i think i don't think that
the object was moving i don't think it

4762
01:16:36,070 --> 01:16:36,080
the object was moving i don't think it
 

4763
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,070
the object was moving i don't think it
aggressively went at them i think it was

4764
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:38,080
aggressively went at them i think it was
 

4765
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,229
aggressively went at them i think it was
located still there and then they flew

4766
01:16:40,229 --> 01:16:40,239
located still there and then they flew
 

4767
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:41,750
located still there and then they flew
through it

4768
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:41,760
through it
 

4769
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:44,229
through it
but they didn't have it on their radar

4770
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:44,239
but they didn't have it on their radar
 

4771
01:16:44,239 --> 01:16:45,350
but they didn't have it on their radar
um

4772
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:45,360
um
 

4773
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,390
um
and that would

4774
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
and that would
 

4775
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,430
and that would
i think the radar might have been

4776
01:16:47,430 --> 01:16:47,440
i think the radar might have been
 

4777
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:48,550
i think the radar might have been
malfunctioning i don't know that for

4778
01:16:48,550 --> 01:16:48,560
malfunctioning i don't know that for
 

4779
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:51,110
malfunctioning i don't know that for
sure i would like to look into it but my

4780
01:16:51,110 --> 01:16:51,120
sure i would like to look into it but my
 

4781
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:52,870
sure i would like to look into it but my
supposition is that if their radar was

4782
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:52,880
supposition is that if their radar was
 

4783
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,229
supposition is that if their radar was
malfunctioning it would make sense that

4784
01:16:54,229 --> 01:16:54,239
malfunctioning it would make sense that
 

4785
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:55,830
malfunctioning it would make sense that
they wouldn't avoid the object that was

4786
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:55,840
they wouldn't avoid the object that was
 

4787
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,950
they wouldn't avoid the object that was
there because they knew these were

4788
01:16:56,950 --> 01:16:56,960
there because they knew these were
 

4789
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,550
there because they knew these were
physical at that point

4790
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:58,560
physical at that point
 

4791
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,709
physical at that point
um and we we would go up to these

4792
01:17:00,709 --> 01:17:00,719
um and we we would go up to these
 

4793
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:02,390
um and we we would go up to these
objects all the time time and try to see

4794
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:02,400
objects all the time time and try to see
 

4795
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,070
objects all the time time and try to see
them we couldn't see them and we didn't

4796
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
them we couldn't see them and we didn't
 

4797
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,990
them we couldn't see them and we didn't
know what it was um was it that were

4798
01:17:05,990 --> 01:17:06,000
know what it was um was it that were
 

4799
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,750
know what it was um was it that were
they just not there or being fooled was

4800
01:17:07,750 --> 01:17:07,760
they just not there or being fooled was
 

4801
01:17:07,760 --> 01:17:09,189
they just not there or being fooled was
something happening were they were they

4802
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:09,199
something happening were they were they
 

4803
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,510
something happening were they were they
moving dropping out to the last minute

4804
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:11,520
moving dropping out to the last minute
 

4805
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,110
moving dropping out to the last minute
you know we're going by pretty quick so

4806
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:13,120
you know we're going by pretty quick so
 

4807
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,430
you know we're going by pretty quick so
it's difficult to tell

4808
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:15,440
it's difficult to tell
 

4809
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,870
it's difficult to tell
but perhaps if his radar wasn't working

4810
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:16,880
but perhaps if his radar wasn't working
 

4811
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,350
but perhaps if his radar wasn't working
he wasn't receiving energy from the jet

4812
01:17:19,350 --> 01:17:19,360
he wasn't receiving energy from the jet
 

4813
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:21,030
he wasn't receiving energy from the jet
and the jet of course didn't know that

4814
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:21,040
and the jet of course didn't know that
 

4815
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:22,390
and the jet of course didn't know that
it was there and so

4816
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:22,400
it was there and so
 

4817
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,070
it was there and so
whatever the case was they flew right by

4818
01:17:24,070 --> 01:17:24,080
whatever the case was they flew right by
 

4819
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:26,550
whatever the case was they flew right by
and they described it just as a dark

4820
01:17:26,550 --> 01:17:26,560
and they described it just as a dark
 

4821
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,189
and they described it just as a dark
gray or black cube

4822
01:17:29,189 --> 01:17:29,199
gray or black cube
 

4823
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:31,830
gray or black cube
inside a clear translucent sphere and

4824
01:17:31,830 --> 01:17:31,840
inside a clear translucent sphere and
 

4825
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:33,430
inside a clear translucent sphere and
the kind of the apex of the cube were

4826
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:33,440
the kind of the apex of the cube were
 

4827
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:37,590
the kind of the apex of the cube were
touching the inside of that sphere

4828
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600

 

4829
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,750

that's an image that's haunting so what

4830
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:39,760
that's an image that's haunting so what
 

4831
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:41,990
that's an image that's haunting so what
do they think it is what did they think

4832
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:42,000
do they think it is what did they think
 

4833
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,390
do they think it is what did they think
at that moment uh that they

4834
01:17:44,390 --> 01:17:44,400
at that moment uh that they
 

4835
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,310
at that moment uh that they
is it just this kind of cloud of

4836
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
is it just this kind of cloud of
 

4837
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,149
is it just this kind of cloud of
uncertainty that that they're just

4838
01:17:48,149 --> 01:17:48,159
uncertainty that that they're just
 

4839
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,350
uncertainty that that they're just
describing a geometric object

4840
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:51,360
describing a geometric object
 

4841
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,350
describing a geometric object
it's not on radar so it's unclear what

4842
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
it's not on radar so it's unclear what
 

4843
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:54,470
it's not on radar so it's unclear what
it is

4844
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:54,480
it is
 

4845
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,630
it is
um yeah what was

4846
01:17:56,630 --> 01:17:56,640
um yeah what was
 

4847
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,390
um yeah what was
uh the

4848
01:17:58,390 --> 01:17:58,400
uh the
 

4849
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,070
uh the
any kind of other description they've

4850
01:18:00,070 --> 01:18:00,080
any kind of other description they've
 

4851
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:01,669
any kind of other description they've
had of it in terms of

4852
01:18:01,669 --> 01:18:01,679
had of it in terms of
 

4853
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:03,750
had of it in terms of
the intuition from a pilot's perspective

4854
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:03,760
the intuition from a pilot's perspective
 

4855
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,270
the intuition from a pilot's perspective
you know you have to kind of identify

4856
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:05,280
you know you have to kind of identify
 

4857
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:07,430
you know you have to kind of identify
what a thing is

4858
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:07,440
what a thing is
 

4859
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,790
what a thing is
to answer the first part they they

4860
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:08,800
to answer the first part they they
 

4861
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:09,990
to answer the first part they they
actually canceled the flight and came

4862
01:18:09,990 --> 01:18:10,000
actually canceled the flight and came
 

4863
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,910
actually canceled the flight and came
back because they were you know it's

4864
01:18:11,910 --> 01:18:11,920
back because they were you know it's
 

4865
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:13,030
back because they were you know it's
like if there's one of these out here

4866
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:13,040
like if there's one of these out here
 

4867
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:14,390
like if there's one of these out here
we're almost hitting them and it's right

4868
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:14,400
we're almost hitting them and it's right
 

4869
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,550
we're almost hitting them and it's right
there then um you know perhaps we need

4870
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:16,560
there then um you know perhaps we need
 

4871
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,229
there then um you know perhaps we need
to get a different jet with better radar

4872
01:18:18,229 --> 01:18:18,239
to get a different jet with better radar
 

4873
01:18:18,239 --> 01:18:19,830
to get a different jet with better radar
but so they came back and they're in

4874
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:19,840
but so they came back and they're in
 

4875
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,590
but so they came back and they're in
their gear and they're they're talking

4876
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600
their gear and they're they're talking
 

4877
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,189
their gear and they're they're talking
to the front desk and talking to skipper

4878
01:18:23,189 --> 01:18:23,199
to the front desk and talking to skipper
 

4879
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:24,310
to the front desk and talking to skipper
and like hey we almost hit one of those

4880
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:24,320
and like hey we almost hit one of those
 

4881
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,229
and like hey we almost hit one of those
damn things out there and this kind of

4882
01:18:26,229 --> 01:18:26,239
damn things out there and this kind of
 

4883
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:28,229
damn things out there and this kind of
was one of those kind of slight

4884
01:18:28,229 --> 01:18:28,239
was one of those kind of slight
 

4885
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:29,750
was one of those kind of slight
watershed moments where we all were kind

4886
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760
watershed moments where we all were kind
 

4887
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:31,189
watershed moments where we all were kind
of like all right like this is a serious

4888
01:18:31,189 --> 01:18:31,199
of like all right like this is a serious
 

4889
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,430
of like all right like this is a serious
deal now yeah you know maybe it was a

4890
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:33,440
deal now yeah you know maybe it was a
 

4891
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:35,110
deal now yeah you know maybe it was a
maybe we thought they were

4892
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:35,120
maybe we thought they were
 

4893
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,790
maybe we thought they were
balloons or drones or malfunctions or

4894
01:18:36,790 --> 01:18:36,800
balloons or drones or malfunctions or
 

4895
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:38,070
balloons or drones or malfunctions or
maybe we thought it was fine but the end

4896
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,080
maybe we thought it was fine but the end
 

4897
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,510
maybe we thought it was fine but the end
of the day if we're to hit one of these

4898
01:18:39,510 --> 01:18:39,520
of the day if we're to hit one of these
 

4899
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:41,510
of the day if we're to hit one of these
things then we need to you know we need

4900
01:18:41,510 --> 01:18:41,520
things then we need to you know we need
 

4901
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,669
things then we need to you know we need
to take care of the situation

4902
01:18:43,669 --> 01:18:43,679
to take care of the situation
 

4903
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:45,350
to take care of the situation
and that's actually when we start

4904
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:45,360
and that's actually when we start
 

4905
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,590
and that's actually when we start
submitting hazard reports or hazard reps

safety
kind of communication networks and it's

4912
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
kind of communication networks and it's
 

4913
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:56,149
kind of communication networks and it's
you know it's not like a big proactive

4914
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
you know it's not like a big proactive
 

4915
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:57,510
you know it's not like a big proactive
thing where people can go investigate

4916
01:18:57,510 --> 01:18:57,520
thing where people can go investigate
 

4917
01:18:57,520 --> 01:18:59,110
thing where people can go investigate
it's more of a data collection mechanism

4918
01:18:59,110 --> 01:18:59,120
it's more of a data collection mechanism
 

4919
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:00,310
it's more of a data collection mechanism
so that you can kind of share that

4920
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:00,320
so that you can kind of share that
 

4921
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,630
so that you can kind of share that
aggregate data and make sure things are

4922
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:02,640
aggregate data and make sure things are
 

4923
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:04,149
aggregate data and make sure things are
uh progressing

4924
01:19:04,149 --> 01:19:04,159
uh progressing
 

4925
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:06,229
uh progressing
um so it wasn't a mechanism that would

4926
01:19:06,229 --> 01:19:06,239
um so it wasn't a mechanism that would
 

4927
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:08,790
um so it wasn't a mechanism that would
result in action being taken but we were

4928
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:08,800
result in action being taken but we were
 

4929
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:10,229
result in action being taken but we were
hoping to at least get the message out

4930
01:19:10,229 --> 01:19:10,239
hoping to at least get the message out
 

4931
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:11,830
hoping to at least get the message out
to whomever was maybe running a

4932
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:11,840
to whomever was maybe running a
 

4933
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:13,110
to whomever was maybe running a
classified program that we were not

4934
01:19:13,110 --> 01:19:13,120
classified program that we were not
 

4935
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,790
classified program that we were not
aware of or something like that that hey

4936
01:19:14,790 --> 01:19:14,800
aware of or something like that that hey
 

4937
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,310
aware of or something like that that hey
like you could kill somebody here like

4938
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:16,320
like you could kill somebody here like
 

4939
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,990
like you could kill somebody here like
you've you've grown too big for your

4940
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
you've you've grown too big for your
 

4941
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,470
you've you've grown too big for your
britches here take a step back

4942
01:19:20,470 --> 01:19:20,480
britches here take a step back
 

4943
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:22,229
britches here take a step back
so that was that was our concern at that

4944
01:19:22,229 --> 01:19:22,239
so that was that was our concern at that
 

4945
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,510
so that was that was our concern at that
point that's kind of where we were

4946
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:23,520
point that's kind of where we were
 

4947
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,950
point that's kind of where we were
thinking this was going

4948
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:24,960
thinking this was going
 

4949
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,709
thinking this was going
what's the protocol for shooting at a

4950
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
what's the protocol for shooting at a
 

4951
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,910
what's the protocol for shooting at a
thing

4952
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:27,920
thing
 

4953
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,270
thing
was was uh

4954
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
was was uh
 

4955
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,870
was was uh
was there a concern that it's a direct

4956
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
was there a concern that it's a direct
 

4957
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,189
was there a concern that it's a direct
threat not just surveillance but

4958
01:19:33,189 --> 01:19:33,199
threat not just surveillance but
 

4959
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,229
threat not just surveillance but
a thing that could be yeah a threat at

4960
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
a thing that could be yeah a threat at
 

4961
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,510
a thing that could be yeah a threat at
least from my perspective like that

4962
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:37,520
least from my perspective like that
 

4963
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,430
least from my perspective like that
never really crossed into my mind i

4964
01:19:39,430 --> 01:19:39,440
never really crossed into my mind i
 

4965
01:19:39,440 --> 01:19:41,030
never really crossed into my mind i
thought it was potentially an

4966
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:41,040
thought it was potentially an
 

4967
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:42,229
thought it was potentially an

4968
01:19:42,229 --> 01:19:42,239
intelligence
 

4969
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:44,550
intelligence
um you know failure that could be being

4970
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:44,560
um you know failure that could be being
 

4971
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:46,550
um you know failure that could be being
watched and information gathered

4972
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:46,560
watched and information gathered
 

4973
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:48,229
watched and information gathered
but i didn't think that it was something

4974
01:19:48,229 --> 01:19:48,239
but i didn't think that it was something
 

4975
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:50,070
but i didn't think that it was something
that would

4976
01:19:50,070 --> 01:19:50,080
that would
 

4977
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:51,990
that would
proactively engage me in a hostile

4978
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:52,000
proactively engage me in a hostile
 

4979
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,750
proactively engage me in a hostile
manner it wouldn't really make sense

4980
01:19:53,750 --> 01:19:53,760
manner it wouldn't really make sense
 

4981
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:54,790
manner it wouldn't really make sense
either too

4982
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:54,800
either too
 

4983
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,630
either too
it would be shocking to like have one of

4984
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
it would be shocking to like have one of
 

4985
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:57,990
it would be shocking to like have one of
these objects take out an f-18 but

4986
01:19:57,990 --> 01:19:58,000
these objects take out an f-18 but
 

4987
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,430
these objects take out an f-18 but
there's no real tactical advantage other

4988
01:19:59,430 --> 01:19:59,440
there's no real tactical advantage other
 

4989
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,510
there's no real tactical advantage other
than fear perhaps

4990
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:01,520
than fear perhaps
 

4991
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:02,830

the
 

4997
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,510
the
psychological warfare in ukraine this is

4998
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:09,520
psychological warfare in ukraine this is
 

4999
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:12,070
psychological warfare in ukraine this is
a big part of the war in terms of when

5000
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:12,080
a big part of the war in terms of when
 

5001
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:14,870
a big part of the war in terms of when
you talk about siege warfare about war

5002
01:20:14,870 --> 01:20:14,880
you talk about siege warfare about war
 

5003
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,950
you talk about siege warfare about war
wars that last for many years

5004
01:20:16,950 --> 01:20:16,960
wars that last for many years
 

5005
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,110
wars that last for many years
for many months and then perhaps could

5006
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
for many months and then perhaps could
 

5007
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,550
for many months and then perhaps could
extend to years but yes

5008
01:20:22,550 --> 01:20:22,560
extend to years but yes
 

5009
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,629
extend to years but yes
it didn't seem

5010
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:24,639
it didn't seem
 

5011
01:20:24,639 --> 01:20:27,669
it didn't seem
it didn't fit your conception of a

01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:27,679
it didn't fit your conception of a

it didn't fit your conception of a

so looking back now from the all the

5018
01:20:34,870 --> 01:20:34,880
so looking back now from the all the
 

5019
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:37,669
so looking back now from the all the
pieces of data you've integrated

5020
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:37,679
pieces of data you've integrated
 

5021
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:39,750
pieces of data you've integrated
you've personally added what what do you

5022
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:39,760
you've personally added what what do you
 

5023
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,830
you've personally added what what do you
think it could be

5024
01:20:41,830 --> 01:20:41,840
think it could be
 

5025
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,750
think it could be
i don't know i don't know what it could

5026
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:43,760
i don't know i don't know what it could
 

5027
01:20:43,760 --> 01:20:45,910
i don't know i don't know what it could
be i think we've been able to categorize

5028
01:20:45,910 --> 01:20:45,920
be i think we've been able to categorize
 

5029
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,390
be i think we've been able to categorize
it successfully into a few buckets

5030
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:48,400
it successfully into a few buckets
 

5031
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:50,070
it successfully into a few buckets
we've been able to say that you know

5032
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:50,080
we've been able to say that you know
 

5033
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:52,790
we've been able to say that you know
this could be u.s technology that

01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:52,800
this could be u.s technology that
 

5035
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,070
this could be u.s technology that
someone

01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,709
someone
put in the wrong piece of sky or you

5038
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:56,719
put in the wrong piece of sky or you
 

5039
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,790
put in the wrong piece of sky or you
know perhaps was developed and tested an

01:20:58,790 --> 01:20:58,800
know perhaps was developed and tested an
 

5041
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,270
know perhaps was developed and tested an
inappropriate spot by someone that uh

5042
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
inappropriate spot by someone that uh
 

5043
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,430
inappropriate spot by someone that uh
wasn't paying best practices is there uh

5044
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:03,440
wasn't paying best practices is there uh
 

5045
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,590
wasn't paying best practices is there uh
sorry to interrupt is there

5046
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:05,600
sorry to interrupt is there
 

5047
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,310
sorry to interrupt is there
a sort of uh modularity to the way

5048
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:08,320
a sort of uh modularity to the way
 

5049
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:10,390
a sort of uh modularity to the way
the the military operates to where it's

5050
01:21:10,390 --> 01:21:10,400
the the military operates to where it's
 

5051
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:12,470
the the military operates to where it's
possible for one branch not to know

5052
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:12,480
possible for one branch not to know
 

5053
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,390
possible for one branch not to know
about the tests of another yeah i think

5054
01:21:14,390 --> 01:21:14,400
about the tests of another yeah i think
 

5055
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,990
about the tests of another yeah i think
it's perfectly reasonable to think that

5056
01:21:15,990 --> 01:21:16,000
it's perfectly reasonable to think that
 

5057
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,390
it's perfectly reasonable to think that
that could occur right and so if we just

5058
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:18,400
that could occur right and so if we just
 

5059
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:20,390
that could occur right and so if we just
make that assumption we can integrate

5060
01:21:20,390 --> 01:21:20,400
make that assumption we can integrate
 

5061
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,229
make that assumption we can integrate
that into our analysis here and just say

5062
01:21:22,229 --> 01:21:22,239
that into our analysis here and just say
 

5063
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,390
that into our analysis here and just say
okay but at the point we're at now you

5064
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:24,400
okay but at the point we're at now you
 

5065
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,590
okay but at the point we're at now you
know we have to assume that that's not

5066
01:21:25,590 --> 01:21:25,600
know we have to assume that that's not
 

5067
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,030
know we have to assume that that's not
the case right with everything that's

5068
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:27,040
the case right with everything that's
 

5069
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,390
the case right with everything that's
been going on and the statements have

5070
01:21:28,390 --> 01:21:28,400
been going on and the statements have
 

5071
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,149
been going on and the statements have
been made and the hearings

5072
01:21:30,149 --> 01:21:30,159
been made and the hearings
 

5073
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,709
been made and the hearings
i think that if it was a

5074
01:21:32,709 --> 01:21:32,719
i think that if it was a
 

5075
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:33,430
i think that if it was a
a

5076
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:33,440
a
 

5077
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:35,669
a
non-communication issue um we're in big

5078
01:21:35,669 --> 01:21:35,679
non-communication issue um we're in big
 

5079
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:37,110
non-communication issue um we're in big
trouble at this point

5080
01:21:37,110 --> 01:21:37,120
trouble at this point
 

5081
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:39,430
trouble at this point
what about it being an object from

5082
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:39,440
what about it being an object from
 

5083
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,629
what about it being an object from
another nation from china from russia or

5084
01:21:42,629 --> 01:21:42,639
another nation from china from russia or
 

5085
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,149
another nation from china from russia or
even one of our allies perhaps right

5086
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:44,159
even one of our allies perhaps right
 

5087
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:44,950
even one of our allies perhaps right
maybe

5088
01:21:44,950 --> 01:21:44,960
maybe
 

5089
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,229
maybe
you know

5090
01:21:46,229 --> 01:21:46,239
you know
 

5091
01:21:46,239 --> 01:21:47,750
you know
i don't think it's

5092
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:47,760
i don't think it's
 

5093
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,229
i don't think it's
um controversial to say that our allies

5094
01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
um controversial to say that our allies
 

5095
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,510
um controversial to say that our allies
could be gathering information about us

5096
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:51,520
could be gathering information about us
 

5097
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:52,950
could be gathering information about us
or anything of that nature but that

5098
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:52,960
or anything of that nature but that
 

5099
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:54,229
or anything of that nature but that
would be an extreme case but i think

5100
01:21:54,229 --> 01:21:54,239
would be an extreme case but i think
 

5101
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:55,990
would be an extreme case but i think
it's just important to say right to not

5102
01:21:55,990 --> 01:21:56,000
it's just important to say right to not
 

5103
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,750
it's just important to say right to not
just say russia or china and just call

5104
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:57,760
just say russia or china and just call
 

5105
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,189
just say russia or china and just call
them the bad guys and assume that if

5106
01:21:59,189 --> 01:21:59,199
them the bad guys and assume that if
 

5107
01:21:59,199 --> 01:22:01,430
them the bad guys and assume that if
they don't have it no one can do it um

5108
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:01,440
they don't have it no one can do it um
 

5109
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,870
they don't have it no one can do it um
and so from my perspective you know

5110
01:22:02,870 --> 01:22:02,880
and so from my perspective you know
 

5111
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:04,390
and so from my perspective you know
anyone else anyone else it doesn't

5112
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:04,400
anyone else anyone else it doesn't
 

5113
01:22:04,400 --> 01:22:06,790
anyone else anyone else it doesn't
necessarily need to be a foreign power

5114
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:06,800
necessarily need to be a foreign power
 

5115
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,629
necessarily need to be a foreign power
it could be a non-government entity

5116
01:22:08,629 --> 01:22:08,639
it could be a non-government entity
 

5117
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:10,229
it could be a non-government entity
perhaps although i think that's very

5118
01:22:10,229 --> 01:22:10,239
perhaps although i think that's very
 

5119
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:12,149
perhaps although i think that's very
unlikely but again these are these are

5120
01:22:12,149 --> 01:22:12,159
unlikely but again these are these are
 

5121
01:22:12,159 --> 01:22:13,910
unlikely but again these are these are
things you must consider if you kind of

5122
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:13,920
things you must consider if you kind of
 

5123
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,510
things you must consider if you kind of
throw everything

5124
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:15,520
throw everything
 

5125
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:17,430
throw everything
everything other than the us under under

5126
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
everything other than the us under under
 

5127
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:18,470
everything other than the us under under
scrutiny

5128
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:18,480
scrutiny
 

5129
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:20,229
scrutiny
but you know from what

5130
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,239
but you know from what
 

5131
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:22,470
but you know from what
has been reported and the behaviors that

5132
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:22,480
has been reported and the behaviors that
 

5133
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:23,750
has been reported and the behaviors that
have been seen

5134
01:22:23,750 --> 01:22:23,760
have been seen
 

5135
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:25,030
have been seen
it would be

5136
01:22:25,030 --> 01:22:25,040
it would be
 

5137
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,870
it would be
i would expect to see remnants of that

5138
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:26,880
i would expect to see remnants of that
 

5139
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,750
i would expect to see remnants of that
technology elsewhere in the economy

5140
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:29,760
technology elsewhere in the economy
 

5141
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,750
technology elsewhere in the economy
there seems to be too many

5142
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:31,760
there seems to be too many
 

5143
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,629
there seems to be too many
things that require

5144
01:22:34,629 --> 01:22:34,639
things that require
 

5145
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:35,990
things that require
advanced technology that would be

5146
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
advanced technology that would be
 

5147
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,550
advanced technology that would be
beneficial commercially as well as in

5148
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
beneficial commercially as well as in
 

5149
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,870
beneficial commercially as well as in
other military applications for it to be

5150
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:40,880
other military applications for it to be
 

5151
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,870
other military applications for it to be
completely locked away by

5152
01:22:42,870 --> 01:22:42,880
completely locked away by
 

5153
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:44,709
completely locked away by
one of our competitors now i could see

5154
01:22:44,709 --> 01:22:44,719
one of our competitors now i could see
 

5155
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:46,229
one of our competitors now i could see
us perhaps locking something away if

5156
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
us perhaps locking something away if
 

5157
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:48,229
us perhaps locking something away if
we're already in the lead and having it

5158
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:48,239
we're already in the lead and having it
 

5159
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:48,950
we're already in the lead and having it
to

5160
01:22:48,950 --> 01:22:48,960
to
 

5161
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,110
to
pull out as needed but for someone

5162
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:51,120
pull out as needed but for someone
 

5163
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,510
pull out as needed but for someone
that's perhaps in a power struggle and

5164
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:53,520
that's perhaps in a power struggle and
 

5165
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:54,950
that's perhaps in a power struggle and
they're in second place

5166
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
they're in second place
 

5167
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:56,709
they're in second place
they might be more aggressive with the

5168
01:22:56,709 --> 01:22:56,719
they might be more aggressive with the
 

5169
01:22:56,719 --> 01:22:58,149
they might be more aggressive with the
development of different types of

01:22:58,149 --> 01:22:58,159
development of different types of
 

5171
01:22:58,159 --> 01:22:59,510
development of different types of
technology willing to accept bigger

technology willing to accept bigger
 

5173

risks
do you think it could be natural

5176
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:02,560
do you think it could be natural
 

5177
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,149
do you think it could be natural
phenomena that we don't yet understand i

5178
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:06,159
phenomena that we don't yet understand i
 

5179
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,229
phenomena that we don't yet understand i
think that there are a number of things

5180
01:23:08,229 --> 01:23:08,239
think that there are a number of things
 

5181
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:09,750
think that there are a number of things
that this is going to be right i don't

5182
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:09,760
that this is going to be right i don't
 

5183
01:23:09,760 --> 01:23:10,950
that this is going to be right i don't
think there's one thing at the end of

5184
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:10,960
think there's one thing at the end of
 

5185
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:12,709
think there's one thing at the end of
the day but i certainly think that that

5186
01:23:12,709 --> 01:23:12,719
the day but i certainly think that that
 

5187
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:14,629
the day but i certainly think that that
is part of what some of this could be i

5188
01:23:14,629 --> 01:23:14,639
is part of what some of this could be i
 

5189
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:16,229
is part of what some of this could be i
don't think it's what we were seeing on

5190
01:23:16,229 --> 01:23:16,239
don't think it's what we were seeing on
 

5191
01:23:16,239 --> 01:23:17,430
don't think it's what we were seeing on
the east coast

5192
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,440
the east coast
 

5193
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,110
the east coast
and i don't think it is related to the

5194
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,120
and i don't think it is related to the
 

5195
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:20,950
and i don't think it is related to the
roosevelt incident or i'll even go out

5196
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:20,960
roosevelt incident or i'll even go out
 

5197
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,030
roosevelt incident or i'll even go out
and say the nimitz incident but what's

5198
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
and say the nimitz incident but what's
 

5199
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,950
and say the nimitz incident but what's
the roosevelt incident the roosevelt

5200
01:23:24,950 --> 01:23:24,960
the roosevelt incident the roosevelt
 

5201
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:26,390
the roosevelt incident the roosevelt
incident typically referred to as the

5202
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:26,400
incident typically referred to as the
 

5203
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,830
incident typically referred to as the
gimbal

5204
01:23:27,830 --> 01:23:27,840
gimbal
 

5205
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:29,830
gimbal
and or the go fast video and then the

5206
01:23:29,830 --> 01:23:29,840
and or the go fast video and then the
 

5207
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,990
and or the go fast video and then the
nimitz is from uh

5208
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:32,000
nimitz is from uh
 

5209
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:33,990
nimitz is from uh
with the david fravor has uh witnessed

5210
01:23:33,990 --> 01:23:34,000
with the david fravor has uh witnessed
 

5211
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,830
with the david fravor has uh witnessed
directly and spoken about

5212
01:23:35,830 --> 01:23:35,840
directly and spoken about
 

5213
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:37,350
directly and spoken about
we'll talk about that as well i'd just

5214
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:37,360
we'll talk about that as well i'd just
 

5215
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:39,750
we'll talk about that as well i'd just
love to get your um

5216
01:23:39,750 --> 01:23:39,760
love to get your um
 

5217
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,149
love to get your um
your sort of uh interpretation of those

5218
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:42,159
your sort of uh interpretation of those
 

5219
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,350
your sort of uh interpretation of those
incidents but

5220
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
incidents but
 

5221
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:45,750
incidents but
yeah so in this particular case natural

5222
01:23:45,750 --> 01:23:45,760
yeah so in this particular case natural
 

5223
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:48,470
yeah so in this particular case natural
phenomena could be a part of the picture

5224
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,480
phenomena could be a part of the picture
 

5225
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,709
phenomena could be a part of the picture
but you're saying not the whole picture

5226
01:23:50,709 --> 01:23:50,719
but you're saying not the whole picture
 

5227
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:51,590
but you're saying not the whole picture
yes

5228
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:51,600
yes
 

5229
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,229
yes
yes and we can't discount it

5230
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:54,239
yes and we can't discount it
 

5231
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:56,709
yes and we can't discount it
oh the other thing is what about the

5232
01:23:56,709 --> 01:23:56,719
oh the other thing is what about the
 

5233
01:23:56,719 --> 01:23:58,470
oh the other thing is what about the
failure of

5234
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:58,480
failure of
 

5235
01:23:58,480 --> 01:24:00,390
failure of
pilot eyesight

5236
01:24:00,390 --> 01:24:00,400
pilot eyesight
 

5237
01:24:00,400 --> 01:24:01,590
pilot eyesight
like

5238
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:01,600
like
 

5239
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,950
like
sort of

5240
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:02,960
sort of
 

5241
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:05,669
sort of
some deep mixture of actual direct

5242
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:05,679
some deep mixture of actual direct
 

5243
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:06,709
some deep mixture of actual direct

vision
 

5245
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:08,709
vision
human vision system failure

5246
01:24:08,709 --> 01:24:08,719
human vision system failure
 

5247
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:10,790
human vision system failure
and like psychology

5248
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:10,800
and like psychology
 

5249
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,229
and like psychology
like

5250
01:24:12,229 --> 01:24:12,239
like
 

5251
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:14,870
like
um seeing something weird

5252
01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
um seeing something weird
 

5253
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,750
um seeing something weird
and then filling in the gaps

5254
01:24:17,750 --> 01:24:17,760
and then filling in the gaps
 

5255
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,990
and then filling in the gaps
because in order to make sense of the

5256
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:20,000
because in order to make sense of the
 

5257
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,390
because in order to make sense of the
weird i've tried to expose myself to

5258
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:24,400
weird i've tried to expose myself to
 

5259
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:26,310
weird i've tried to expose myself to
a scenarios like that that i don't

5260
01:24:26,310 --> 01:24:26,320
a scenarios like that that i don't
 

5261
01:24:26,320 --> 01:24:28,229
a scenarios like that that i don't
necessarily think are right but i've

5262
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:28,239
necessarily think are right but i've
 

5263
01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:30,149
necessarily think are right but i've
explored them to see if they could have

5264
01:24:30,149 --> 01:24:30,159
explored them to see if they could have
 

5265
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:33,030
explored them to see if they could have
some truth and one example is let's

5266
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:33,040
some truth and one example is let's
 

5267
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:34,470
some truth and one example is let's
imagine a scenario where if we're seeing

5268
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:34,480
imagine a scenario where if we're seeing
 

5269
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:35,990
imagine a scenario where if we're seeing
these objects every day off the east

5270
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:36,000
these objects every day off the east
 

5271
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,189
these objects every day off the east
coast

5272
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:37,199
coast
 

5273
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:39,189
coast
i can imagine a technology or an

5274
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
i can imagine a technology or an
 

5275
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:41,430
i can imagine a technology or an
operation where you had some type of

5276
01:24:41,430 --> 01:24:41,440
operation where you had some type of
 

5277
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:43,990
operation where you had some type of
traditional propulsion system operating

5278
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
traditional propulsion system operating
 

5279
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,390
traditional propulsion system operating
drones in order to gather data like we

5280
01:24:46,390 --> 01:24:46,400
drones in order to gather data like we
 

5281
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,510
drones in order to gather data like we
had discussed

5282
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:47,520
had discussed
 

5283
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,310
had discussed
and

5284
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:48,320
and
 

5285
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,790
and
i could i could envision a clever enough

5286
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:50,800
i could i could envision a clever enough
 

5287
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,110
i could i could envision a clever enough
adversary that could perhaps destroy or

5288
01:24:53,110 --> 01:24:53,120
adversary that could perhaps destroy or
 

5289
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:54,950
adversary that could perhaps destroy or
somehow remove these objects and replace

5290
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:54,960
somehow remove these objects and replace
 

5291
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:56,870
somehow remove these objects and replace
them with new objects essentially when

5292
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
them with new objects essentially when
 

5293
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,550
them with new objects essentially when
we're not looking right and that

5294
01:24:58,550 --> 01:24:58,560
we're not looking right and that
 

5295
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,990
we're not looking right and that
accounts for the

5296
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:00,000
accounts for the
 

5297
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:03,350
accounts for the
large uh airborne time and so i i

5298
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
large uh airborne time and so i i
 

5299
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,510
large uh airborne time and so i i
explore options like that and i try to

5300
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:05,520
explore options like that and i try to
 

5301
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:07,590
explore options like that and i try to
see you know what what evidence and

5302
01:25:07,590 --> 01:25:07,600
see you know what what evidence and
 

5303
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:09,510
see you know what what evidence and
assumptions need to be made in order to

5304
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:09,520
assumptions need to be made in order to
 

5305
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,270
assumptions need to be made in order to
prove or disprove that

5306
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:11,280
prove or disprove that
 

5307
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,709
prove or disprove that
and you know

5308
01:25:12,709 --> 01:25:12,719
and you know
 

5309
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:14,149
and you know
you would need so much infrastructure

5310
01:25:14,149 --> 01:25:14,159
you would need so much infrastructure
 

5311
01:25:14,159 --> 01:25:15,910
you would need so much infrastructure
you know you need some you need so many

5312
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
you know you need some you need so many
 

5313
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,510
you know you need some you need so many
assets and so i try to explore some of

5314
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:17,520
assets and so i try to explore some of
 

5315
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,350
assets and so i try to explore some of
those fallacies and some of those

5316
01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
those fallacies and some of those
 

5317
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,590
those fallacies and some of those
concerns and as aviators we're trained

5318
01:25:21,590 --> 01:25:21,600
concerns and as aviators we're trained
 

5319
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:23,110
concerns and as aviators we're trained
into many uh

5320
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:23,120
into many uh
 

5321
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:24,790
into many uh
like actual physical like eyesight and

5322
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:24,800
like actual physical like eyesight and
 

5323
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,590
like actual physical like eyesight and
kind of illusion training so like at

5324
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:27,600
kind of illusion training so like at
 

5325
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:28,950
kind of illusion training so like at
night time flying there's so many things

5326
01:25:28,950 --> 01:25:28,960
night time flying there's so many things
 

5327
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,229
night time flying there's so many things
that can happen flying with false

5328
01:25:30,229 --> 01:25:30,239
that can happen flying with false
 

5329
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:32,870
that can happen flying with false
horizons and so we receive hours of of

5330
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:32,880
horizons and so we receive hours of of
 

5331
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:35,510
horizons and so we receive hours of of
training on that type of of stuff but

5332
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:35,520
training on that type of of stuff but
 

5333
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:37,189
training on that type of of stuff but
this just falls outside the category

5334
01:25:37,189 --> 01:25:37,199
this just falls outside the category
 

5335
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:38,709
this just falls outside the category
from my perspective what was the

5336
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:38,719
from my perspective what was the
 

5337
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,030
from my perspective what was the
visibility conditions when in the times

5338
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:41,040
visibility conditions when in the times
 

5339
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:43,110
visibility conditions when in the times
when people were able to see it and then

5340
01:25:43,110 --> 01:25:43,120
when people were able to see it and then
 

5341
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,149
when people were able to see it and then
are we

5342
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:44,159
are we
 

5343
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:46,229
are we
we just earlier discussed complete

um in this case was was it during the

5350
01:25:52,149 --> 01:25:52,159
um in this case was was it during the
 

5351
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,629
um in this case was was it during the
day it was a perfectly clear day that

5352
01:25:54,629 --> 01:25:54,639
day it was a perfectly clear day that
 

5353
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:57,270
day it was a perfectly clear day that
that particular incident yep

5354
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
that particular incident yep
 

5355
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:59,189
that particular incident yep
in a world that's full of mystery i have

5356
01:25:59,189 --> 01:25:59,199
in a world that's full of mystery i have
 

5357
01:25:59,199 --> 01:26:01,189
in a world that's full of mystery i have
to ask what do you think

5358
01:26:01,189 --> 01:26:01,199
to ask what do you think
 

5359
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:04,070
to ask what do you think
is the possibility that

5360
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:04,080
is the possibility that
 

5361
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,830
is the possibility that
it's not of this earth origin

5362
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:07,840
it's not of this earth origin
 

5363
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:09,669
it's not of this earth origin
like the term non-human intelligence in

5364
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:09,679
like the term non-human intelligence in
 

5365
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:11,110
like the term non-human intelligence in
a sense

5366
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:11,120
a sense
 

5367
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:13,270
a sense
because

5368
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:13,280
because
 

5369
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:14,229
because
again

again
 

5371
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:15,189
again
there's so much there's a lot of

5372
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,199
there's so much there's a lot of
 

5373
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,870
there's so much there's a lot of
assumptions in there that

5374
01:26:16,870 --> 01:26:16,880
assumptions in there that
 

5375
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,910
assumptions in there that
may cause us to go down the wrong roads

5376
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:19,920
may cause us to go down the wrong roads
 

5377
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:21,510
may cause us to go down the wrong roads
it could you know these could be

5378
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:21,520
it could you know these could be
 

5379
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:23,590
it could you know these could be
something that our weather phenomena of

5380
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:23,600
something that our weather phenomena of
 

5381
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,270
something that our weather phenomena of
earth right or something else that is

earth right or something else that is
 

5383
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,870
earth right or something else that is
just something we don't understand or

5384
01:26:26,870 --> 01:26:26,880
just something we don't understand or
 

5385
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,229
just something we don't understand or
can't imagine right now that's still of

01:26:28,229 --> 01:26:28,239
can't imagine right now that's still of
 

5387
01:26:28,239 --> 01:26:30,149
can't imagine right now that's still of
this earth um

5388
01:26:30,149 --> 01:26:30,159
this earth um
 

5389
01:26:30,159 --> 01:26:31,830
this earth um
if we consider

5390
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:31,840
if we consider
 

5391
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,430
if we consider
extraterrestrials or something that came

5392
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:33,440
extraterrestrials or something that came
 

5393
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,149
extraterrestrials or something that came
from a physical place far away in space

5394
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:36,159
from a physical place far away in space
 

5395
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:37,270
from a physical place far away in space
time

5396
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:37,280
time
 

5397
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,270
time
you know that leads us to some detection

5398
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:39,280
you know that leads us to some detection
 

5399
01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:40,870
you know that leads us to some detection
assumptions that we would need to make

5400
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:40,880
assumptions that we would need to make
 

5401
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:43,030
assumptions that we would need to make
and so i just try to not categorize it

5402
01:26:43,030 --> 01:26:43,040
and so i just try to not categorize it
 

5403
01:26:43,040 --> 01:26:44,870
and so i just try to not categorize it
under anything and just say hey is this

5404
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:44,880
under anything and just say hey is this
 

5405
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,030
under anything and just say hey is this
demonstrating intelligence

5406
01:26:47,030 --> 01:26:47,040
demonstrating intelligence
 

5407
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,950
demonstrating intelligence
and start from there as a single object

5408
01:26:48,950 --> 01:26:48,960
and start from there as a single object
 

5409
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,629
and start from there as a single object
what can we learn about it kinematically

5410
01:26:50,629 --> 01:26:50,639
what can we learn about it kinematically
 

5411
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:51,910
what can we learn about it kinematically
how it's performing what does that mean

5412
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:51,920
how it's performing what does that mean
 

5413
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,750
how it's performing what does that mean
for its energy source what does that

5414
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
for its energy source what does that
 

5415
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,070
for its energy source what does that
mean for the g-forces inside

5416
01:26:56,070 --> 01:26:56,080
mean for the g-forces inside
 

5417
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,590
mean for the g-forces inside
and then step it out a level and say

5418
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
and then step it out a level and say
 

5419
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:59,590
and then step it out a level and say
okay how are these interacting with our

5420
01:26:59,590 --> 01:26:59,600
okay how are these interacting with our
 

5421
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,030
okay how are these interacting with our
fighters if they are how are they

5422
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,040
fighters if they are how are they
 

5423
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,229
fighters if they are how are they
interacting with the weather and their

5424
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
interacting with the weather and their
 

5425
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:03,910
interacting with the weather and their
environment how are they interacting

5426
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:03,920
environment how are they interacting
 

5427
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,910
environment how are they interacting
with each other so can we look at these

5428
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
with each other so can we look at these
 

5429
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,350
with each other so can we look at these
and how they're interacting perhaps as a

5430
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,360
and how they're interacting perhaps as a
 

5431
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:08,709
and how they're interacting perhaps as a
swarm

5432
01:27:08,709 --> 01:27:08,719
swarm
 

5433
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:09,910
swarm
especially off the east coast where this

5434
01:27:09,910 --> 01:27:09,920
especially off the east coast where this
 

5435
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,990
especially off the east coast where this
is happening all the time with multiple

5436
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,000
is happening all the time with multiple
 

5437
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,990
is happening all the time with multiple
objects right and so we might be able to

5438
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:14,000
objects right and so we might be able to
 

5439
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,149
objects right and so we might be able to
determine some things about their maybe

5440
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:16,159
determine some things about their maybe
 

5441
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:17,590
determine some things about their maybe
you know center capabilities are the

5442
01:27:17,590 --> 01:27:17,600
you know center capabilities are the
 

5443
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,270
you know center capabilities are the
areas of focus you know if we can

5444
01:27:19,270 --> 01:27:19,280
areas of focus you know if we can
 

5445
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,110
areas of focus you know if we can
determine uh how they're working in

5446
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:21,120
determine uh how they're working in
 

5447
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:23,110
determine uh how they're working in
conjunction with each other but you know

5448
01:27:23,110 --> 01:27:23,120
conjunction with each other but you know
 

5449
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:25,030
conjunction with each other but you know
seeing one little flash of an object uh

5450
01:27:25,030 --> 01:27:25,040
seeing one little flash of an object uh
 

5451
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:27,270
seeing one little flash of an object uh
doesn't provide that type of insight

5452
01:27:27,270 --> 01:27:27,280
doesn't provide that type of insight
 

5453
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:29,590
doesn't provide that type of insight
um but we have the systems four but and

5454
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:29,600
um but we have the systems four but and
 

5455
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,149
um but we have the systems four but and
it's kind of made on irony but it's it's

5456
01:27:32,149 --> 01:27:32,159
it's kind of made on irony but it's it's
 

5457
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,790
it's kind of made on irony but it's it's
a fact of life the reality that many of

5458
01:27:34,790 --> 01:27:34,800
a fact of life the reality that many of
 

5459
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,870
a fact of life the reality that many of
these well-deployed highly capable

5460
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:36,880
these well-deployed highly capable
 

5461
01:27:36,880 --> 01:27:39,510
these well-deployed highly capable
systems are held under the military

5462
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,520
systems are held under the military
 

5463
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,430
systems are held under the military
umbrella which makes it difficult to

5464
01:27:41,430 --> 01:27:41,440
umbrella which makes it difficult to
 

5465
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:43,030
umbrella which makes it difficult to
provide that data for scientific

5466
01:27:43,030 --> 01:27:43,040
provide that data for scientific
 

5467
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:44,310
provide that data for scientific
analysis

5468
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:44,320
analysis
 

5469
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,189
analysis
so there's probably a lot more data on

5470
01:27:47,189 --> 01:27:47,199
so there's probably a lot more data on
 

5471
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:49,750
so there's probably a lot more data on
these objects that's not being

5472
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
these objects that's not being
 

5473
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,470
these objects that's not being
that's not made available probably even

5474
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,480
that's not made available probably even
 

5475
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,030
that's not made available probably even
within the military for analysis i think

5476
01:27:55,030 --> 01:27:55,040
within the military for analysis i think
 

5477
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:56,950
within the military for analysis i think
so yeah i think there's a lot of data

5478
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:56,960
so yeah i think there's a lot of data
 

5479
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:58,629
so yeah i think there's a lot of data
that could be made available

5480
01:27:58,629 --> 01:27:58,639
that could be made available
 

5481
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,550
that could be made available
and you know that's one of the reasons

5482
01:28:00,550 --> 01:28:00,560
and you know that's one of the reasons
 

5483
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,870
and you know that's one of the reasons
why you know i've been engaged with the

5484
01:28:02,870 --> 01:28:02,880
why you know i've been engaged with the
 

5485
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:04,470
why you know i've been engaged with the
american institute of aeronautics and

5486
01:28:04,470 --> 01:28:04,480
american institute of aeronautics and
 

5487
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:07,669
american institute of aeronautics and
astronautics to build you know a large

5488
01:28:07,669 --> 01:28:07,679
astronautics to build you know a large
 

5489
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,550
astronautics to build you know a large
resources of cross-domain expertise so

5490
01:28:10,550 --> 01:28:10,560
resources of cross-domain expertise so
 

5491
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:12,950
resources of cross-domain expertise so
that if or when that data is available

5492
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
that if or when that data is available
 

5493
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,550
that if or when that data is available
or that there's additional analysis

5494
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:14,560
or that there's additional analysis
 

5495
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,709
or that there's additional analysis
needed you know we can spin up those

5496
01:28:16,709 --> 01:28:16,719
needed you know we can spin up those
 

5497
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:18,550
needed you know we can spin up those
teams and make that analysis

5498
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:18,560
teams and make that analysis
 

5499
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:20,950
teams and make that analysis
so there was a recently a house

5500
01:28:20,950 --> 01:28:20,960
so there was a recently a house
 

5501
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:22,390
so there was a recently a house
intelligence subcommittee hearing on

5502
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:22,400
intelligence subcommittee hearing on
 

5503
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,189
intelligence subcommittee hearing on
ufos that you were a part of what was

5504
01:28:25,189 --> 01:28:25,199
ufos that you were a part of what was
 

5505
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:26,870
ufos that you were a part of what was
the goal of that hearing and can you

5506
01:28:26,870 --> 01:28:26,880
the goal of that hearing and can you
 

5507
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,669
the goal of that hearing and can you
maybe summarize what

5508
01:28:29,669 --> 01:28:29,679
maybe summarize what
 

5509
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:30,709
maybe summarize what
you heard

5510
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
you heard
 

5511
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,189
you heard
the hearings from my perspective uh

5512
01:28:33,189 --> 01:28:33,199
the hearings from my perspective uh
 

5513
01:28:33,199 --> 01:28:35,750
the hearings from my perspective uh
seemed a bit disingenuous uh kind of top

5514
01:28:35,750 --> 01:28:35,760
seemed a bit disingenuous uh kind of top
 

5515
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:38,470
seemed a bit disingenuous uh kind of top
level uh i think um who was the run by i

5516
01:28:38,470 --> 01:28:38,480
level uh i think um who was the run by i
 

5517
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,229
level uh i think um who was the run by i
decided to interrupt like who were the

5518
01:28:40,229 --> 01:28:40,239
decided to interrupt like who were the
 

5519
01:28:40,239 --> 01:28:42,149
decided to interrupt like who were the
people involved and what was the goal

5520
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:42,159
people involved and what was the goal
 

5521
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,390
people involved and what was the goal
this day to go congressman andre carson

5522
01:28:44,390 --> 01:28:44,400
this day to go congressman andre carson
 

5523
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:46,470
this day to go congressman andre carson
uh did chair of the committee and he he

5524
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:46,480
uh did chair of the committee and he he
 

5525
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,149
uh did chair of the committee and he he
was i think ultimately responsible for

5526
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:48,159
was i think ultimately responsible for
 

5527
01:28:48,159 --> 01:28:49,910
was i think ultimately responsible for
bringing it all together you know i

5528
01:28:49,910 --> 01:28:49,920
bringing it all together you know i
 

5529
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,590
bringing it all together you know i
think the intent from congress was to

5530
01:28:51,590 --> 01:28:51,600
think the intent from congress was to
 

5531
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:53,510
think the intent from congress was to
try to bring light to

5532
01:28:53,510 --> 01:28:53,520
try to bring light to
 

5533
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:55,189
try to bring light to
what has been happening with the navy

5534
01:28:55,189 --> 01:28:55,199
what has been happening with the navy
 

5535
01:28:55,199 --> 01:28:57,910
what has been happening with the navy
and to help show the american people

5536
01:28:57,910 --> 01:28:57,920
and to help show the american people
 

5537
01:28:57,920 --> 01:28:59,510
and to help show the american people
that um

5538
01:28:59,510 --> 01:28:59,520
that um
 

5539
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:00,870
that um
congress is taking this serious because

5540
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:00,880
congress is taking this serious because
 

5541
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:02,629
congress is taking this serious because
something serious is happening

5542
01:29:02,629 --> 01:29:02,639
something serious is happening
 

5543
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:04,310
something serious is happening
but you know the sense i got seemed a

5544
01:29:04,310 --> 01:29:04,320
but you know the sense i got seemed a
 

5545
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,390
but you know the sense i got seemed a
bit disingenuous they talked around it a

5546
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:06,400
bit disingenuous they talked around it a
 

5547
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:09,830
bit disingenuous they talked around it a

you know see if we can't find anything
or take a look at them you know i don't

5906
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:09,040
or take a look at them you know i don't
 

5907
01:35:09,040 --> 01:35:10,870
or take a look at them you know i don't
know if it was ingest or not but you

5908
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:10,880
know if it was ingest or not but you
 

5909
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:13,510
know if it was ingest or not but you
know this they i actually would say it's

5910
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:13,520
know this they i actually would say it's
 

5911
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,430
know this they i actually would say it's
not just because there were there were

5912
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
not just because there were there were
 

5913
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:16,790
not just because there were there were
notices that were being briefed about

5914
01:35:16,790 --> 01:35:16,800
notices that were being briefed about
 

5915
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,709
notices that were being briefed about
this being a safety hazard at this point

5916
01:35:18,709 --> 01:35:18,719
this being a safety hazard at this point
 

5917
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:19,830
this being a safety hazard at this point
and so

5918
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:19,840
and so
 

5919
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:21,830
and so
i now that i i think about it it likely

5920
01:35:21,830 --> 01:35:21,840
i now that i i think about it it likely
 

5921
01:35:21,840 --> 01:35:23,830
i now that i i think about it it likely
wasn't just long story short they went

5922
01:35:23,830 --> 01:35:23,840
wasn't just long story short they went
 

5923
01:35:23,840 --> 01:35:25,990
wasn't just long story short they went
flying the weather was too bad they did

5924
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:26,000
flying the weather was too bad they did
 

5925
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,229
flying the weather was too bad they did
go into ufo and they physically saw one

5926
01:35:28,229 --> 01:35:28,239
go into ufo and they physically saw one
 

5927
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:29,910
go into ufo and they physically saw one
you know and he called me up and said

5928
01:35:29,910 --> 01:35:29,920
you know and he called me up and said
 

5929
01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:31,510
you know and he called me up and said
hey sir i saw a cuban sphere they're

5930
01:35:31,510 --> 01:35:31,520
hey sir i saw a cuban sphere they're
 

5931
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:33,350
hey sir i saw a cuban sphere they're
still out here you know years later and

5932
01:35:33,350 --> 01:35:33,360
still out here you know years later and
 

5933
01:35:33,360 --> 01:35:35,270
still out here you know years later and
so it's almost like a generational issue

5934
01:35:35,270 --> 01:35:35,280
so it's almost like a generational issue
 

5935
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:36,550
so it's almost like a generational issue
you know for these fighter pilots at

5936
01:35:36,550 --> 01:35:36,560
you know for these fighter pilots at
 

5937
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:38,310
you know for these fighter pilots at
least on east coast but that's great

5938
01:35:38,310 --> 01:35:38,320
least on east coast but that's great
 

5939
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:39,750
least on east coast but that's great
that they can talk about it right

5940
01:35:39,750 --> 01:35:39,760
that they can talk about it right
 

5941
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:41,669
that they can talk about it right
exactly exactly they feel at least

5942
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:41,679
exactly exactly they feel at least
 

5943
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:42,709
exactly exactly they feel at least
comfortable they have a reporting

5944
01:35:42,709 --> 01:35:42,719
comfortable they have a reporting
 

5945
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,950
comfortable they have a reporting
mechanism and so that was one of the

5946
01:35:44,950 --> 01:35:44,960
mechanism and so that was one of the
 

5947
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:47,189
mechanism and so that was one of the
problems that i noticed that we have a

5948
01:35:47,189 --> 01:35:47,199
problems that i noticed that we have a
 

5949
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,750
problems that i noticed that we have a
lot of reporting mechanisms to take care

5950
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:49,760
lot of reporting mechanisms to take care
 

5951
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,310
lot of reporting mechanisms to take care
of safety issues and and even tactical

5952
01:35:52,310 --> 01:35:52,320
of safety issues and and even tactical
 

5953
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,830
of safety issues and and even tactical
issues when the time is right in order

5954
01:35:53,830 --> 01:35:53,840
issues when the time is right in order
 

5955
01:35:53,840 --> 01:35:55,750
issues when the time is right in order
to keep track of what's going on but

5956
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:55,760
to keep track of what's going on but
 

5957
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,189
to keep track of what's going on but
there's no way to communicate about this

5958
01:35:59,189 --> 01:35:59,199
there's no way to communicate about this
 

5959
01:35:59,199 --> 01:36:00,950
there's no way to communicate about this
sure we could submit a hazard report but

5960
01:36:00,950 --> 01:36:00,960
sure we could submit a hazard report but
 

5961
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,109
sure we could submit a hazard report but
nothing's actually being investigated

5962
01:36:03,109 --> 01:36:03,119
nothing's actually being investigated
 

5963
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,109
nothing's actually being investigated
and if this is a tactical

5964
01:36:05,109 --> 01:36:05,119
and if this is a tactical
 

5965
01:36:05,119 --> 01:36:07,189
and if this is a tactical
vulnerability or something more it

5966
01:36:07,189 --> 01:36:07,199
vulnerability or something more it
 

5967
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:08,870
vulnerability or something more it
deserves attention

5968
01:36:08,870 --> 01:36:08,880
deserves attention
 

5969
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,550

6024
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
anything he says
 

6025
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:10,790
anything he says
yeah i agree with you uh

6026
01:37:10,790 --> 01:37:10,800
yeah i agree with you uh
 

6027
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:15,750
yeah i agree with you uh
but in terms of the actual ufo

6028
01:37:15,750 --> 01:37:15,760

 

6029
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,669

is there something anomalous and

6030
01:37:17,669 --> 01:37:17,679
is there something anomalous and
 

6031
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,350
is there something anomalous and
interesting to you about that particular

6032
01:37:19,350 --> 01:37:19,360
interesting to you about that particular
 

6033
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,430
interesting to you about that particular
case maybe

6034
01:37:21,430 --> 01:37:21,440
case maybe
 

6035
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:23,910
case maybe
one interesting aspect there is

6036
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:23,920
one interesting aspect there is
 

6037
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:27,350
one interesting aspect there is
how much do i understand about the

6038
01:37:27,350 --> 01:37:27,360
how much do i understand about the
 

6039
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:29,669
how much do i understand about the
water surface and underwater aspects of

6040
01:37:29,669 --> 01:37:29,679
water surface and underwater aspects of
 

6041
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:31,270
water surface and underwater aspects of
these ufos it seems like a lot of the

6042
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:31,280
these ufos it seems like a lot of the
 

6043
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:34,070
these ufos it seems like a lot of the
discussions about is about the movement

6044
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:34,080
discussions about is about the movement
 

6045
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:34,790
discussions about is about the movement
of

6046
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
of
 

6047
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,430
of
this particular thing that seems to be

6048
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,440
this particular thing that seems to be
 

6049
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:40,149
this particular thing that seems to be
weird anomalous seems to defy physics

6050
01:37:40,149 --> 01:37:40,159
weird anomalous seems to defy physics
 

6051
01:37:40,159 --> 01:37:41,510
weird anomalous seems to defy physics
but what about stuff that's happening

6052
01:37:41,510 --> 01:37:41,520
but what about stuff that's happening
 

6053
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:43,669
but what about stuff that's happening
underwater that's interesting to me

6054
01:37:43,669 --> 01:37:43,679
underwater that's interesting to me
 

6055
01:37:43,679 --> 01:37:45,990
underwater that's interesting to me
if i had advanced technology i would

6056
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:46,000
if i had advanced technology i would
 

6057
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,350
if i had advanced technology i would
certainly

6058
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:47,360
certainly
 

6059
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,270
certainly
like to operate in part underwater

6060
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:49,280
like to operate in part underwater
 

6061
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,470
like to operate in part underwater
because you can hide a lot of stuff

6062
01:37:50,470 --> 01:37:50,480
because you can hide a lot of stuff
 

6063
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,510
because you can hide a lot of stuff
there

6064
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,520
there
 

6065
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,430
there
you think it would be somewhat as easy

6066
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,440
you think it would be somewhat as easy
 

6067
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,030
you think it would be somewhat as easy
as traveling through interstellar space

6068
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:55,040
as traveling through interstellar space
 

6069
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:58,149
as traveling through interstellar space
at least right yeah

6070
01:37:58,149 --> 01:37:58,159

 

6071
01:37:58,159 --> 01:37:59,750

you know i wish i had a great answer for

6072
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
you know i wish i had a great answer for
 

6073
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,950
you know i wish i had a great answer for
that but as an aviator that's a kind of

6074
01:38:02,950 --> 01:38:02,960
that but as an aviator that's a kind of
 

6075
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,109
that but as an aviator that's a kind of
a black box for us you know we don't

6076
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:05,119
a black box for us you know we don't
 

6077
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:06,950
a black box for us you know we don't
have great what i would call cross

6078
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:06,960
have great what i would call cross
 

6079
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,709
have great what i would call cross
domain tracking right i can't see

6080
01:38:08,709 --> 01:38:08,719
domain tracking right i can't see
 

6081
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:10,390
domain tracking right i can't see
something go underwater and then follow

6082
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
something go underwater and then follow
 

6083
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:12,149
something go underwater and then follow
it under water so it's literally not

6084
01:38:12,149 --> 01:38:12,159
it under water so it's literally not
 

6085
01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,390
it under water so it's literally not
your domain like underwater like leave

6086
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
your domain like underwater like leave
 

6087
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,910
your domain like underwater like leave
that for somebody else yeah and you know

6088
01:38:15,910 --> 01:38:15,920
that for somebody else yeah and you know
 

6089
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:17,990
that for somebody else yeah and you know
i i use that terminology because it's

6090
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:18,000
i i use that terminology because it's
 

6091
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,830
i i use that terminology because it's
it's kind of important right um

6092
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:19,840
it's kind of important right um
 

6093
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:21,990
it's kind of important right um
cross-domain tracking uh is something

6094
01:38:21,990 --> 01:38:22,000
cross-domain tracking uh is something
 

6095
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,189
cross-domain tracking uh is something
that we haven't had to necessarily worry

6096
01:38:23,189 --> 01:38:23,199
that we haven't had to necessarily worry
 

6097
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:24,870
that we haven't had to necessarily worry
about right because airplanes operated

6098
01:38:24,870 --> 01:38:24,880
about right because airplanes operated
 

6099
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:26,390
about right because airplanes operated
in the air and

6100
01:38:26,390 --> 01:38:26,400
in the air and
 

6101
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,109
in the air and
submarines operated underwater and space

6102
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:29,119
submarines operated underwater and space
 

6103
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:30,870
submarines operated underwater and space
planes operating space right but you

6104
01:38:30,870 --> 01:38:30,880
planes operating space right but you
 

6105
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:32,790
planes operating space right but you
know there's going to be

6106
01:38:32,790 --> 01:38:32,800
know there's going to be
 

6107
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:34,550
know there's going to be
you know that's going to blur i think as

6108
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:34,560
you know that's going to blur i think as
 

6109
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,229
you know that's going to blur i think as
as we move along here especially in the

6110
01:38:36,229 --> 01:38:36,239
as we move along here especially in the
 

6111
01:38:36,239 --> 01:38:38,149
as we move along here especially in the
air and space regime

6112
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:38,159
air and space regime
 

6113
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,229
air and space regime
and being able to perhaps transition my

6114
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:40,239
and being able to perhaps transition my
 

6115
01:38:40,239 --> 01:38:43,750
and being able to perhaps transition my
radar contact at 40 000 feet to another

6116
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
radar contact at 40 000 feet to another
 

6117
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,149
radar contact at 40 000 feet to another
radar system that can track it up to 200

6118
01:38:46,149 --> 01:38:46,159
radar system that can track it up to 200
 

6119
01:38:46,159 --> 01:38:47,510
radar system that can track it up to 200
000 feet

6120
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:47,520
000 feet
 

6121
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,189
000 feet
you know that might be a value and so we

6122
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:49,199
you know that might be a value and so we
 

6123
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:51,109
you know that might be a value and so we
seem to be missing that right now

6124
01:38:51,109 --> 01:38:51,119
seem to be missing that right now
 

6125
01:38:51,119 --> 01:38:53,270
seem to be missing that right now
so what about the go fast and the gimbal

6126
01:38:53,270 --> 01:38:53,280
so what about the go fast and the gimbal
 

6127
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:54,550
so what about the go fast and the gimbal
videos that you mentioned earlier well

6128
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:54,560
videos that you mentioned earlier well
 

6129
01:38:54,560 --> 01:38:56,149
videos that you mentioned earlier well
there was a like what's interesting

6130
01:38:56,149 --> 01:38:56,159
there was a like what's interesting
 

6131
01:38:56,159 --> 01:38:57,109
there was a like what's interesting
there

6132
01:38:57,109 --> 01:38:57,119
there
 

6133
01:38:57,119 --> 01:38:58,629
there
to you

6134
01:38:58,629 --> 01:38:58,639
to you
 

6135
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:00,550
to you
so the gimbal i'll talk about that one

6136
01:39:00,550 --> 01:39:00,560
so the gimbal i'll talk about that one
 

6137
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:02,790
so the gimbal i'll talk about that one
first i was airborne for that one um the

6138
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800
first i was airborne for that one um the
 

6139
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,470
first i was airborne for that one um the
person that recorded it was a good

6140
01:39:04,470 --> 01:39:04,480
person that recorded it was a good
 

6141
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:05,590
person that recorded it was a good
friend of mine

6142
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
friend of mine
 

6143
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:07,030
friend of mine
uh but i mean both their crew i knew

6144
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
uh but i mean both their crew i knew
 

6145
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:08,870
uh but i mean both their crew i knew
both of them but the the wizard himself

6146
01:39:08,870 --> 01:39:08,880
both of them but the the wizard himself
 

6147
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,390
both of them but the the wizard himself
uh very close friends went through a lot

6148
01:39:10,390 --> 01:39:10,400
uh very close friends went through a lot
 

6149
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,550
uh very close friends went through a lot
of her training together i went to the

6150
01:39:12,550 --> 01:39:12,560
of her training together i went to the
 

6151
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:14,390
of her training together i went to the
same fleet squadron

6152
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:14,400
same fleet squadron
 

6153
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,629
same fleet squadron
he ended up transitioning to be a pilot

6154
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639
he ended up transitioning to be a pilot
 

6155
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,350
he ended up transitioning to be a pilot
and then came to where i was instructing

6156
01:39:19,350 --> 01:39:19,360
and then came to where i was instructing
 

6157
01:39:19,360 --> 01:39:21,030
and then came to where i was instructing
so i got to struck him a bit on his

6158
01:39:21,030 --> 01:39:21,040
so i got to struck him a bit on his
 

6159
01:39:21,040 --> 01:39:22,229
so i got to struck him a bit on his
transition

6160
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:22,239
transition
 

6161
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:23,430
transition
um

6162
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:23,440
um
 

6163
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,910
um
and you know the way that was was was we

6164
01:39:25,910 --> 01:39:25,920
and you know the way that was was was we
 

6165
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:27,350
and you know the way that was was was we
went out on a

6166
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,360
went out on a
 

6167
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:29,430
went out on a
air-to-air training mission so uh

6168
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:29,440
air-to-air training mission so uh
 

6169
01:39:29,440 --> 01:39:32,070
air-to-air training mission so uh
simulating a air fight against our own

6170
01:39:32,070 --> 01:39:32,080
simulating a air fight against our own
 

6171
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,070
simulating a air fight against our own
guys they're acting like the bad guys

6172
01:39:34,070 --> 01:39:34,080
guys they're acting like the bad guys
 

6173
01:39:34,080 --> 01:39:35,669
guys they're acting like the bad guys
and kind of go head-to-head against each

6174
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:35,679
and kind of go head-to-head against each
 

6175
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:36,470
and kind of go head-to-head against each
other

6176
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:36,480
other
 

6177
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,070
other
and when we fly on those missions we all

6178
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:38,080
and when we fly on those missions we all
 

6179
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:40,390
and when we fly on those missions we all
fly out together more or less

6180
01:39:40,390 --> 01:39:40,400
fly out together more or less
 

6181
01:39:40,400 --> 01:39:42,390
fly out together more or less
we set up and then we kind of a trite

6182
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:42,400
we set up and then we kind of a trite
 

6183
01:39:42,400 --> 01:39:44,629
we set up and then we kind of a trite
from the fight as we either you know run

6184
01:39:44,629 --> 01:39:44,639
from the fight as we either you know run
 

6185
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:46,229
from the fight as we either you know run
out of gas or something happens and so

6186
01:39:46,229 --> 01:39:46,239
out of gas or something happens and so
 

6187
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:47,910
out of gas or something happens and so
people usually go back onesies or

6188
01:39:47,910 --> 01:39:47,920
people usually go back onesies or
 

6189
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:49,189
people usually go back onesies or
twosies

6190
01:39:49,189 --> 01:39:49,199
twosies
 

6191
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:51,030
twosies
and so the aircrew that recorded the

6192
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:51,040
and so the aircrew that recorded the
 

6193
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:52,870
and so the aircrew that recorded the
gimbal they were going back to the boat

6194
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:52,880
gimbal they were going back to the boat
 

6195
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:54,470
gimbal they were going back to the boat
and we were on what's called a workup

6196
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,480
and we were on what's called a workup
 

6197
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:56,149
and we were on what's called a workup
training event and so this is like a

6198
01:39:56,149 --> 01:39:56,159
training event and so this is like a
 

6199
01:39:56,159 --> 01:39:57,590
training event and so this is like a
month on the boat

6200
01:39:57,590 --> 01:39:57,600
month on the boat
 

6201
01:39:57,600 --> 01:39:59,669
month on the boat
where we're essentially conducting more

6202
01:39:59,669 --> 01:39:59,679
where we're essentially conducting more
 

6203
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:01,830
where we're essentially conducting more
time operations more or less

6204
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:01,840
time operations more or less
 

6205
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,109
time operations more or less
to stress ourselves out and to kind of

6206
01:40:05,109 --> 01:40:05,119
to stress ourselves out and to kind of
 

6207
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:06,550
to stress ourselves out and to kind of
do the last training block before we go

6208
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:06,560
do the last training block before we go
 

6209
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,070
do the last training block before we go
on deployment essentially so it's pretty

6210
01:40:08,070 --> 01:40:08,080
on deployment essentially so it's pretty
 

6211
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,990
on deployment essentially so it's pretty
high stress uh they actually do send

6212
01:40:09,990 --> 01:40:10,000
high stress uh they actually do send
 

6213
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,350
high stress uh they actually do send
aircraft from

6214
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:11,360
aircraft from
 

6215
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,350
aircraft from
like land bases to kind of try to

6216
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:13,360
like land bases to kind of try to
 

6217
01:40:13,360 --> 01:40:15,270
like land bases to kind of try to
penetrate and we're expected to go

6218
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:15,280
penetrate and we're expected to go
 

6219
01:40:15,280 --> 01:40:16,950
penetrate and we're expected to go
intercept them and so we're kind of

6220
01:40:16,950 --> 01:40:16,960
intercept them and so we're kind of
 

6221
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:18,470
intercept them and so we're kind of
practicing like we play

6222
01:40:18,470 --> 01:40:18,480
practicing like we play
 

6223
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,590
practicing like we play
and so

6224
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,600
and so
 

6225
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,870
and so
he saw these objects on the radar

6226
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:22,880
he saw these objects on the radar
 

6227
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:23,990
he saw these objects on the radar
the gimbal

6228
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:24,000
the gimbal
 

6229
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,830
the gimbal
and a fleet of other aircraft or

6230
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:25,840
and a fleet of other aircraft or
 

6231
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:27,109
and a fleet of other aircraft or
vehicles

6232
01:40:27,109 --> 01:40:27,119
vehicles
 

6233
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:29,109
vehicles
and they initially thought it was

6234
01:40:29,109 --> 01:40:29,119
and they initially thought it was
 

6235
01:40:29,119 --> 01:40:30,870
and they initially thought it was
part of the training exercise that they

6236
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:30,880
part of the training exercise that they
 

6237
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,870
part of the training exercise that they
were sending something in to

6238
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:32,880
were sending something in to
 

6239
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:35,350
were sending something in to
try to penetrate the airspace

6240
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:35,360
try to penetrate the airspace
 

6241
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:36,950
try to penetrate the airspace
and so they you know they flew over to

6242
01:40:36,950 --> 01:40:36,960
and so they you know they flew over to
 

6243
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:38,390
and so they you know they flew over to
it and as they got close enough to get

6244
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:38,400
it and as they got close enough to get
 

6245
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:39,590
it and as they got close enough to get
on the flear

6246
01:40:39,590 --> 01:40:39,600
on the flear
 

6247
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:41,270
on the flear
uh you know i think everyone has heard

6248
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,280
uh you know i think everyone has heard
 

6249
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,750
uh you know i think everyone has heard
their reaction um and they realize that

6250
01:40:43,750 --> 01:40:43,760
their reaction um and they realize that
 

6251
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,030
their reaction um and they realize that
it wasn't something they were expecting

6252
01:40:45,030 --> 01:40:45,040
it wasn't something they were expecting
 

6253
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:45,910
it wasn't something they were expecting
to see

6254
01:40:45,910 --> 01:40:45,920
to see
 

6255
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:47,109
to see
can you actually describe what's in the

6256
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:47,119
can you actually describe what's in the
 

6257
01:40:47,119 --> 01:40:49,109
can you actually describe what's in the
video what's the reaction in case they

6258
01:40:49,109 --> 01:40:49,119
video what's the reaction in case they
 

6259
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:51,109
video what's the reaction in case they
haven't seen it yeah a lot of swearing

6260
01:40:51,109 --> 01:40:51,119
haven't seen it yeah a lot of swearing
 

6261
01:40:51,119 --> 01:40:52,629
haven't seen it yeah a lot of swearing
uh but so what you see on the flear

6262
01:40:52,629 --> 01:40:52,639
uh but so what you see on the flear
 

6263
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,189
uh but so what you see on the flear
footage is a

6264
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:55,199
footage is a
 

6265
01:40:55,199 --> 01:40:56,310
footage is a
black or white depending on when you

6266
01:40:56,310 --> 01:40:56,320
black or white depending on when you
 

6267
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,310
black or white depending on when you
look at it object that's somewhat shaped

6268
01:40:58,310 --> 01:40:58,320
look at it object that's somewhat shaped
 

6269
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,629
look at it object that's somewhat shaped
like a gimbal it appears almost as if

6270
01:41:00,629 --> 01:41:00,639
like a gimbal it appears almost as if
 

6271
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:02,550
like a gimbal it appears almost as if
someone put two plates together

6272
01:41:02,550 --> 01:41:02,560
someone put two plates together
 

6273
01:41:02,560 --> 01:41:04,470
someone put two plates together
and then there seems to be almost like a

6274
01:41:04,470 --> 01:41:04,480
and then there seems to be almost like a
 

6275
01:41:04,480 --> 01:41:07,430
and then there seems to be almost like a
small funnel of ir energy that's at the

6276
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
small funnel of ir energy that's at the
 

6277
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:09,189
small funnel of ir energy that's at the
top of the bottom of those plates in a

6278
01:41:09,189 --> 01:41:09,199
top of the bottom of those plates in a
 

6279
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:11,109
top of the bottom of those plates in a
sense so almost as if

6280
01:41:11,109 --> 01:41:11,119
sense so almost as if
 

6281
01:41:11,119 --> 01:41:12,229
sense so almost as if
you know there's a stick going in

6282
01:41:12,229 --> 01:41:12,239
you know there's a stick going in
 

6283
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:13,669
you know there's a stick going in
between two plates but not that

6284
01:41:13,669 --> 01:41:13,679
between two plates but not that
 

6285
01:41:13,679 --> 01:41:15,430
between two plates but not that
pronounced right so there's an energy

6286
01:41:15,430 --> 01:41:15,440
pronounced right so there's an energy
 

6287
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:16,870
pronounced right so there's an energy
field that kind of went to a funnel on

6288
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:16,880
field that kind of went to a funnel on
 

6289
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:17,910
field that kind of went to a funnel on
the top and the bottom at least that's

6290
01:41:17,910 --> 01:41:17,920
the top and the bottom at least that's
 

6291
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:21,109
the top and the bottom at least that's
how i was being portrayed on the fleer

6292
01:41:21,109 --> 01:41:21,119
how i was being portrayed on the fleer
 

6293
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:22,550
how i was being portrayed on the fleer
there's a lot of conversation about that

6294
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:22,560
there's a lot of conversation about that
 

6295
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,910
there's a lot of conversation about that
being glare things that nature but it

6296
01:41:23,910 --> 01:41:23,920
being glare things that nature but it
 

6297
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:26,550
being glare things that nature but it
was actually a very tight ir image it

6298
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:26,560
was actually a very tight ir image it
 

6299
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:28,950
was actually a very tight ir image it
just was non-descript shape

6300
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:28,960
just was non-descript shape
 

6301
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,109
just was non-descript shape
which was interesting typically we would

6302
01:41:31,109 --> 01:41:31,119
which was interesting typically we would
 

6303
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:33,109
which was interesting typically we would
see the skin of the aircraft we can see

6304
01:41:33,109 --> 01:41:33,119
see the skin of the aircraft we can see
 

6305
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:34,870
see the skin of the aircraft we can see
the flames coming out of the exhaust

6306
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:34,880
the flames coming out of the exhaust
 

6307
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,629
the flames coming out of the exhaust
especially at those ranges

6308
01:41:36,629 --> 01:41:36,639
especially at those ranges
 

6309
01:41:36,639 --> 01:41:38,709
especially at those ranges
um but and there was no flames or

6310
01:41:38,709 --> 01:41:38,719
um but and there was no flames or
 

6311
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:40,229
um but and there was no flames or
there's no exhaust here there was no

6312
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:40,239
there's no exhaust here there was no
 

6313
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:42,709
there's no exhaust here there was no
exhaust there was no you know there was

6314
01:41:42,709 --> 01:41:42,719
exhaust there was no you know there was
 

6315
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:43,669
exhaust there was no you know there was
no

6316
01:41:43,669 --> 01:41:43,679
no
 

6317
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:45,270
no
outgassing of repellent in any manner

6318
01:41:45,270 --> 01:41:45,280
outgassing of repellent in any manner
 

6319
01:41:45,280 --> 01:41:47,109
outgassing of repellent in any manner
right it was just an object that had

6320
01:41:47,109 --> 01:41:47,119
right it was just an object that had
 

6321
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:48,629
right it was just an object that had
nothing emitting from it that was

6322
01:41:48,629 --> 01:41:48,639
nothing emitting from it that was
 

6323
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:49,990
nothing emitting from it that was
stationary in the sky we're not

6324
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:50,000
stationary in the sky we're not
 

6325
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,550
stationary in the sky we're not
stationary but it was it was um moving

6326
01:41:52,550 --> 01:41:52,560
stationary but it was it was um moving
 

6327
01:41:52,560 --> 01:41:54,310
stationary but it was it was um moving
along a path right it wasn't falling out

6328
01:41:54,310 --> 01:41:54,320
along a path right it wasn't falling out
 

6329
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:55,830
along a path right it wasn't falling out
of the sky

6330
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
of the sky
 

6331
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,510
of the sky
and it continued along if we were to

6332
01:41:57,510 --> 01:41:57,520
and it continued along if we were to
 

6333
01:41:57,520 --> 01:41:59,590
and it continued along if we were to
consider it from a god's eye view again

6334
01:41:59,590 --> 01:41:59,600
consider it from a god's eye view again
 

6335
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,910
consider it from a god's eye view again
on the sa page it continued along in a

6336
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:01,920
on the sa page it continued along in a
 

6337
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:02,790
on the sa page it continued along in a
path

6338
01:42:02,790 --> 01:42:02,800
path
 

6339
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,790
path
and from the perspective that top-down

01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,790
view
it just went another direction so no um

6344
01:42:08,790 --> 01:42:08,800
it just went another direction so no um
 

6345
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:10,709
it just went another direction so no um
just an instantaneous direction change

6346
01:42:10,709 --> 01:42:10,719
just an instantaneous direction change
 

6347
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,950
just an instantaneous direction change
from that perspective

6348
01:42:12,950 --> 01:42:12,960
from that perspective
 

6349
01:42:12,960 --> 01:42:14,310
from that perspective
you also hear them you know very

6350
01:42:14,310 --> 01:42:14,320
you also hear them you know very
 

6351
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:17,270
you also hear them you know very
excitedly talking on the tapes about um

6352
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
excitedly talking on the tapes about um
 

6353
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:18,870
excitedly talking on the tapes about um
you know whatever the heck this thing is

6354
01:42:18,870 --> 01:42:18,880
you know whatever the heck this thing is
 

6355
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:20,950
you know whatever the heck this thing is
and look at the essay there's a whole

6356
01:42:20,950 --> 01:42:20,960
and look at the essay there's a whole
 

6357
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:22,709
and look at the essay there's a whole
formation of them

6358
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:22,719
formation of them
 

6359
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:24,550
formation of them
and so the essay is a situational

6360
01:42:24,550 --> 01:42:24,560
and so the essay is a situational
 

6361
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:26,629
and so the essay is a situational
awareness page and again it's a large

6362
01:42:26,629 --> 01:42:26,639
awareness page and again it's a large
 

6363
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:28,390
awareness page and again it's a large
display that gives that god's eye view

6364
01:42:28,390 --> 01:42:28,400
display that gives that god's eye view
 

6365
01:42:28,400 --> 01:42:30,229
display that gives that god's eye view
of all the radar contacts so the video

6366
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:30,239
of all the radar contacts so the video
 

6367
01:42:30,239 --> 01:42:32,310
of all the radar contacts so the video
is actually showing just one

6368
01:42:32,310 --> 01:42:32,320
is actually showing just one
 

6369
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:35,030
is actually showing just one
and then they're speaking about many of

6370
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:35,040
and then they're speaking about many of
 

6371
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:37,350
and then they're speaking about many of
them correct on the unless the essay

6372
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:37,360
them correct on the unless the essay
 

6373
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:39,350
them correct on the unless the essay
display correct and what they

6374
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:39,360
display correct and what they
 

6375
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,870
display correct and what they
essentially saw was if we were to

6376
01:42:40,870 --> 01:42:40,880
essentially saw was if we were to
 

6377
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,189
essentially saw was if we were to
consider above the object north so kind

6378
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
consider above the object north so kind
 

6379
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,229
consider above the object north so kind
of offset to the north of the object

6380
01:42:46,229 --> 01:42:46,239
of offset to the north of the object
 

6381
01:42:46,239 --> 01:42:47,750
of offset to the north of the object
there was a formation of about somewhere

6382
01:42:47,750 --> 01:42:47,760
there was a formation of about somewhere
 

6383
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:49,910
there was a formation of about somewhere
between four and six of these objects in

6384
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:49,920
between four and six of these objects in
 

6385
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:52,229
between four and six of these objects in
a rough wedge formation you know so kind

6386
01:42:52,229 --> 01:42:52,239
a rough wedge formation you know so kind
 

6387
01:42:52,239 --> 01:42:54,390
a rough wedge formation you know so kind
of side by side like this

6388
01:42:54,390 --> 01:42:54,400
of side by side like this
 

6389
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:57,030
of side by side like this
and again not in a like autopilot type

6390
01:42:57,030 --> 01:42:57,040
and again not in a like autopilot type
 

6391
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,470
and again not in a like autopilot type
manner where it was very stiff it was

6392
01:42:58,470 --> 01:42:58,480
manner where it was very stiff it was
 

6393
01:42:58,480 --> 01:42:59,669
manner where it was very stiff it was
very kind of

6394
01:42:59,669 --> 01:42:59,679
very kind of
 

6395
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:01,750
very kind of
non-mechanical the flight mechanics

6396
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:01,760
non-mechanical the flight mechanics
 

6397
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:03,590
non-mechanical the flight mechanics
again and these objects were in that

6398
01:43:03,590 --> 01:43:03,600
again and these objects were in that
 

6399
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,510
again and these objects were in that
formation and they were going along and

6400
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:05,520
formation and they were going along and
 

6401
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:06,870
formation and they were going along and
then they turned

6402
01:43:06,870 --> 01:43:06,880
then they turned
 

6403
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:08,310
then they turned
pretty sharply but they still had a

6404
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:08,320
pretty sharply but they still had a
 

6405
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:10,629
pretty sharply but they still had a
radius of turn and then went back in the

6406
01:43:10,629 --> 01:43:10,639
radius of turn and then went back in the
 

6407
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,870
radius of turn and then went back in the
opposite direction and during that turn

6408
01:43:12,870 --> 01:43:12,880
opposite direction and during that turn
 

6409
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:14,070
opposite direction and during that turn
it was they were kind of like all over

6410
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:14,080
it was they were kind of like all over
 

6411
01:43:14,080 --> 01:43:15,590
it was they were kind of like all over
the place like it wasn't tight they

6412
01:43:15,590 --> 01:43:15,600
the place like it wasn't tight they
 

6413
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,510
the place like it wasn't tight they
weren't even like super i they weren't

6414
01:43:17,510 --> 01:43:17,520
weren't even like super i they weren't
 

6415
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,870
weren't even like super i they weren't
flying in a way i would expect them to

6416
01:43:18,870 --> 01:43:18,880
flying in a way i would expect them to
 

6417
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:20,709
flying in a way i would expect them to
be flying in relation to a flight lead

6418
01:43:20,709 --> 01:43:20,719
be flying in relation to a flight lead
 

6419
01:43:20,719 --> 01:43:22,629
be flying in relation to a flight lead
they were flying as if they were flying

6420
01:43:22,629 --> 01:43:22,639
they were flying as if they were flying
 

6421
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:24,310
they were flying as if they were flying
close to each other but not in formation

6422
01:43:24,310 --> 01:43:24,320
close to each other but not in formation
 

6423
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,070
close to each other but not in formation
which was kind of strange right

6424
01:43:26,070 --> 01:43:26,080
which was kind of strange right
 

6425
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:27,030
which was kind of strange right
um

6426
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:27,040
um
 

6427
01:43:27,040 --> 01:43:28,229
um
and then when they rolled out they kind

6428
01:43:28,229 --> 01:43:28,239
and then when they rolled out they kind
 

6429
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:29,830
and then when they rolled out they kind
of tightened backed up like so when they

6430
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
of tightened backed up like so when they
 

6431
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:31,510
of tightened backed up like so when they
basically they started that turn and

6432
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:31,520
basically they started that turn and
 

6433
01:43:31,520 --> 01:43:33,590
basically they started that turn and
then 180 degrees out essentially they

6434
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:33,600
then 180 degrees out essentially they
 

6435
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:34,870
then 180 degrees out essentially they
started flowing in the opposite

6436
01:43:34,870 --> 01:43:34,880
started flowing in the opposite
 

6437
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,390
started flowing in the opposite
direction and kind of got back in that

6438
01:43:36,390 --> 01:43:36,400
direction and kind of got back in that
 

6439
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,550
direction and kind of got back in that
formation and while that was happening

6440
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:38,560
formation and while that was happening
 

6441
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:40,390
formation and while that was happening
the gimbal object was proceeding we'll

6442
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,400
the gimbal object was proceeding we'll
 

6443
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:41,669
the gimbal object was proceeding we'll
say left to right

6444
01:43:41,669 --> 01:43:41,679
say left to right
 

6445
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,790
say left to right
and as as those uh the formation kind of

6446
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:44,800
and as as those uh the formation kind of
 

6447
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,310
and as as those uh the formation kind of
turned up to the north and was just

6448
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:46,320
turned up to the north and was just
 

6449
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:48,149
turned up to the north and was just
passing back it the gimbal just kind of

6450
01:43:48,149 --> 01:43:48,159
passing back it the gimbal just kind of
 

6451
01:43:48,159 --> 01:43:49,830
passing back it the gimbal just kind of
went back in the opposite direction so

6452
01:43:49,830 --> 01:43:49,840
went back in the opposite direction so
 

6453
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:53,910
went back in the opposite direction so
to follow it back in that direction

6454
01:43:53,910 --> 01:43:53,920

 

6455
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:55,750

and in the in the flare itself you know

6456
01:43:55,750 --> 01:43:55,760
and in the in the flare itself you know
 

6457
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:57,510
and in the in the flare itself you know
you see the object uh changes

6458
01:43:57,510 --> 01:43:57,520
you see the object uh changes
 

6459
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,390
you see the object uh changes
orientation quite a bit so you see it um

6460
01:44:00,390 --> 01:44:00,400
orientation quite a bit so you see it um
 

6461
01:44:00,400 --> 01:44:02,470
orientation quite a bit so you see it um
more or less level maybe candid about 45

6462
01:44:02,470 --> 01:44:02,480
more or less level maybe candid about 45
 

6463
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,590
more or less level maybe candid about 45
degrees

6464
01:44:03,590 --> 01:44:03,600
degrees
 

6465
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:05,109
degrees
and then you see it kind of moving

6466
01:44:05,109 --> 01:44:05,119
and then you see it kind of moving
 

6467
01:44:05,119 --> 01:44:07,590
and then you see it kind of moving
around like this almost as if it was a

6468
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:07,600
around like this almost as if it was a
 

6469
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,149
around like this almost as if it was a
gimbal

6470
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:10,159

 

6471
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:11,910

i've come to learn after some you know

6472
01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:11,920
i've come to learn after some you know
 

6473
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,229
i've come to learn after some you know
having seen some research online and

6474
01:44:14,229 --> 01:44:14,239
having seen some research online and
 

6475
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,629
having seen some research online and
people really looking into this that

6476
01:44:16,629 --> 01:44:16,639
people really looking into this that
 

6477
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:18,070
people really looking into this that
it seemed that the object actually

6478
01:44:18,070 --> 01:44:18,080
it seemed that the object actually
 

6479
01:44:18,080 --> 01:44:20,790
it seemed that the object actually
climbed during that maneuver and so the

6480
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:20,800
climbed during that maneuver and so the
 

6481
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,629
climbed during that maneuver and so the
reason it looked like it turned

6482
01:44:22,629 --> 01:44:22,639
reason it looked like it turned
 

6483
01:44:22,639 --> 01:44:23,990
reason it looked like it turned
immediately is because it turned like

6484
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:24,000
immediately is because it turned like
 

6485
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,229
immediately is because it turned like
this it turned uh in a vertical fashion

6486
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:26,239
this it turned uh in a vertical fashion
 

6487
01:44:26,239 --> 01:44:28,310
this it turned uh in a vertical fashion
like that which was pretty interesting

6488
01:44:28,310 --> 01:44:28,320
like that which was pretty interesting
 

6489
01:44:28,320 --> 01:44:30,629
like that which was pretty interesting
that's kind of like another example of a

6490
01:44:30,629 --> 01:44:30,639
that's kind of like another example of a
 

6491
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:32,470
that's kind of like another example of a
flight mechanics that we don't normally

6492
01:44:32,470 --> 01:44:32,480
flight mechanics that we don't normally
 

6493
01:44:32,480 --> 01:44:35,030
flight mechanics that we don't normally
operate because we don't change our

6494
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,040
operate because we don't change our
 

6495
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,950
operate because we don't change our
directions by maneuvering in the

6496
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
directions by maneuvering in the
 

6497
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,430
directions by maneuvering in the
vertical if we can help it it's

6498
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
vertical if we can help it it's
 

6499
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:41,430
vertical if we can help it it's
you're just killing the fuel you know

6500
01:44:41,430 --> 01:44:41,440
you're just killing the fuel you know
 

6501
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:44,149
you're just killing the fuel you know
and so if you're like a surveillance

6502
01:44:44,149 --> 01:44:44,159
and so if you're like a surveillance
 

6503
01:44:44,159 --> 01:44:45,830
and so if you're like a surveillance
platform looking to spend as much time

6504
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:45,840
platform looking to spend as much time
 

6505
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:47,669
platform looking to spend as much time
around something you're not gonna you

6506
01:44:47,669 --> 01:44:47,679
around something you're not gonna you
 

6507
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,270
around something you're not gonna you
know climb

6508
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:49,280
know climb
 

6509
01:44:49,280 --> 01:44:51,109
know climb
500 feet every time you make a turn

6510
01:44:51,109 --> 01:44:51,119
500 feet every time you make a turn
 

6511
01:44:51,119 --> 01:44:52,470
500 feet every time you make a turn
unless you're

6512
01:44:52,470 --> 01:44:52,480
unless you're
 

6513
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,070
unless you're
tom cruise unless your tom cruise

6514
01:44:54,070 --> 01:44:54,080
tom cruise unless your tom cruise
 

6515
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:54,950
tom cruise unless your tom cruise
naturally

6516
01:44:54,950 --> 01:44:54,960
naturally
 

6517
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,470
naturally
okay so is that one of the more

6518
01:44:56,470 --> 01:44:56,480
okay so is that one of the more
 

6519
01:44:56,480 --> 01:44:58,229
okay so is that one of the more
impressive flight mechanics you've seen

6520
01:44:58,229 --> 01:44:58,239
impressive flight mechanics you've seen
 

6521
01:44:58,239 --> 01:45:00,709
impressive flight mechanics you've seen
in in the vid in video forms or not the

01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:00,719
in in the vid in video forms or not the

01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:01,750
in in the vid in video forms or not the

eyesight reports but like in terms of

6526
01:45:03,990 --> 01:45:04,000
eyesight reports but like in terms of
 

6527
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,950
eyesight reports but like in terms of
video evidence that we have i think so

6528
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:06,960
video evidence that we have i think so
 

6529
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:08,950
video evidence that we have i think so
we we were seeing a lot of these but we

6530
01:45:08,950 --> 01:45:08,960
we we were seeing a lot of these but we
 

6531
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,470
we we were seeing a lot of these but we
weren't just going on recording them all

6532
01:45:10,470 --> 01:45:10,480
weren't just going on recording them all
 

6533
01:45:10,480 --> 01:45:12,229
weren't just going on recording them all
day we we just kind of put them in that

6534
01:45:12,229 --> 01:45:12,239
day we we just kind of put them in that
 

6535
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:13,430
day we we just kind of put them in that
safety bucket be like all right there's

6536
01:45:13,430 --> 01:45:13,440
safety bucket be like all right there's
 

6537
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:14,629
safety bucket be like all right there's
objects over there we're just not going

6538
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
objects over there we're just not going
 

6539
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,550
objects over there we're just not going
to go near it you know and so we weren't

6540
01:45:16,550 --> 01:45:16,560
to go near it you know and so we weren't
 

6541
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:18,870
to go near it you know and so we weren't
putting our sensors on them that much so

6542
01:45:18,870 --> 01:45:18,880
putting our sensors on them that much so
 

6543
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:20,550
putting our sensors on them that much so
we were gathering the data kind of

6544
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:20,560
we were gathering the data kind of
 

6545
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,310
we were gathering the data kind of
secondarily but we weren't primarily

6546
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:22,320
secondarily but we weren't primarily
 

6547
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,629
secondarily but we weren't primarily
focusing on it to see all the details so

6548
01:45:24,629 --> 01:45:24,639
focusing on it to see all the details so
 

6549
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:26,390
focusing on it to see all the details so
that's so fascinating because you have a

6550
01:45:26,390 --> 01:45:26,400
that's so fascinating because you have a
 

6551
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:29,030
that's so fascinating because you have a
busy day you have a lot to do all right

6552
01:45:29,030 --> 01:45:29,040
busy day you have a lot to do all right
 

6553
01:45:29,040 --> 01:45:30,870
busy day you have a lot to do all right
well there's some weird stuff going on

6554
01:45:30,870 --> 01:45:30,880
well there's some weird stuff going on
 

6555
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:32,790
well there's some weird stuff going on
there we're just not gonna go there and

6556
01:45:32,790 --> 01:45:32,800
there we're just not gonna go there and
 

6557
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:35,750
there we're just not gonna go there and
that says something about sort of the

6558
01:45:35,750 --> 01:45:35,760
that says something about sort of the
 

6559
01:45:35,760 --> 01:45:38,550
that says something about sort of the
um about human nature about the the way

6560
01:45:38,550 --> 01:45:38,560
um about human nature about the the way
 

6561
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,550
um about human nature about the the way
that bureaucracies function the way the

6562
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:40,560
that bureaucracies function the way the
 

6563
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:42,790
that bureaucracies function the way the
military functions it fills up your day

6564
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:42,800
military functions it fills up your day
 

6565
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:45,189
military functions it fills up your day
with busy important things and you don't

6566
01:45:45,189 --> 01:45:45,199
with busy important things and you don't
 

6567
01:45:45,199 --> 01:45:48,070
with busy important things and you don't
get to um i mean that is something that

6568
01:45:48,070 --> 01:45:48,080
get to um i mean that is something that
 

6569
01:45:48,080 --> 01:45:49,669
get to um i mean that is something that
i'm

6570
01:45:49,669 --> 01:45:49,679
i'm
 

6571
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:52,070
i'm
in a sort of absurd way worried about

6572
01:45:52,070 --> 01:45:52,080
in a sort of absurd way worried about
 

6573
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:54,790
in a sort of absurd way worried about
which is like we fill our days

6574
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:54,800
which is like we fill our days
 

6575
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,629
which is like we fill our days
with so much busyness

6576
01:45:56,629 --> 01:45:56,639
with so much busyness
 

6577
01:45:56,639 --> 01:45:59,430
with so much busyness
then when truly beautiful things happen

6578
01:45:59,430 --> 01:45:59,440
then when truly beautiful things happen
 

6579
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:01,669
then when truly beautiful things happen
whatever they are truly anomalous things

6580
01:46:01,669 --> 01:46:01,679
whatever they are truly anomalous things
 

6581
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:03,910
whatever they are truly anomalous things
we just won't pay attention

6582
01:46:03,910 --> 01:46:03,920
we just won't pay attention
 

6583
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,590
we just won't pay attention
because they don't fit our busy schedule

6584
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:07,600
because they don't fit our busy schedule
 

6585
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:09,270
because they don't fit our busy schedule
beautiful i think that's right on the

6586
01:46:09,270 --> 01:46:09,280
beautiful i think that's right on the
 

6587
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,229
beautiful i think that's right on the
nose

6588
01:46:10,229 --> 01:46:10,239
nose
 

6589
01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:12,390
nose
and it's on my nose because you know i

6590
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:12,400
and it's on my nose because you know i
 

6591
01:46:12,400 --> 01:46:14,149
and it's on my nose because you know i
didn't give this topic the attention it

6592
01:46:14,149 --> 01:46:14,159
didn't give this topic the attention it
 

6593
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:16,709
didn't give this topic the attention it
deserved until i left right until i left

6594
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
deserved until i left right until i left
 

6595
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:18,070
deserved until i left right until i left
and i went to

6596
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:18,080
and i went to
 

6597
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:20,310
and i went to
be an instructor pilot where

6598
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:20,320
be an instructor pilot where
 

6599
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,629
be an instructor pilot where
i had more time you know i had more

6600
01:46:22,629 --> 01:46:22,639
i had more time you know i had more
 

6601
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:24,629
i had more time you know i had more
downtime to kind of process and think

6602
01:46:24,629 --> 01:46:24,639
downtime to kind of process and think
 

6603
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:26,629
downtime to kind of process and think
and get out of exactly what you just

6604
01:46:26,629 --> 01:46:26,639
and get out of exactly what you just
 

6605
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:28,390
and get out of exactly what you just
described and that's kind of what broke

6606
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:28,400
described and that's kind of what broke
 

6607
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,390
described and that's kind of what broke
me out of it and got me thinking more

6608
01:46:30,390 --> 01:46:30,400
me out of it and got me thinking more
 

6609
01:46:30,400 --> 01:46:32,310
me out of it and got me thinking more
about it why do you think the dod

6610
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:32,320
about it why do you think the dod
 

6611
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:34,390
about it why do you think the dod
released these videos

6612
01:46:34,390 --> 01:46:34,400
released these videos
 

6613
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:35,990
released these videos
it's a great question

6614
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:36,000
it's a great question
 

6615
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,669
it's a great question
did the dod release it or they kind of

6616
01:46:37,669 --> 01:46:37,679
did the dod release it or they kind of
 

6617
01:46:37,679 --> 01:46:39,669
did the dod release it or they kind of
get out on their own in some sense so i

6618
01:46:39,669 --> 01:46:39,679
get out on their own in some sense so i
 

6619
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:41,030
get out on their own in some sense so i
i don't know they answer that question

6620
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:41,040
i don't know they answer that question
 

6621
01:46:41,040 --> 01:46:42,870
i don't know they answer that question
but my understanding of the situation is

6622
01:46:42,870 --> 01:46:42,880
but my understanding of the situation is
 

6623
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:44,709
but my understanding of the situation is
that the dod

6624
01:46:44,709 --> 01:46:44,719
that the dod
 

6625
01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:45,910
that the dod
talked about them so much because

6626
01:46:45,910 --> 01:46:45,920
talked about them so much because
 

6627
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:47,750
talked about them so much because
they're already out there in a sense and

6628
01:46:47,750 --> 01:46:47,760
they're already out there in a sense and
 

6629
01:46:47,760 --> 01:46:48,550
they're already out there in a sense and
so

6630
01:46:48,550 --> 01:46:48,560
so
 

6631
01:46:48,560 --> 01:46:49,910
so
you know they could they had a choice

6632
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:49,920
you know they could they had a choice
 

6633
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:50,870
you know they could they had a choice
where they could have just straight up

6634
01:46:50,870 --> 01:46:50,880
where they could have just straight up
 

6635
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:52,470
where they could have just straight up
lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was

6636
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:52,480
lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was
 

6637
01:46:52,480 --> 01:46:55,189
lied and said it wasn't theirs or it was
fake but uh again i think our culture

6638
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:55,199
fake but uh again i think our culture
 

6639
01:46:55,199 --> 01:46:57,030
fake but uh again i think our culture
now is too open and their information

6640
01:46:57,030 --> 01:46:57,040
now is too open and their information
 

6641
01:46:57,040 --> 01:46:59,030
now is too open and their information
moves too freely to to do things like

6642
01:46:59,030 --> 01:46:59,040
moves too freely to to do things like
 

6643
01:46:59,040 --> 01:47:00,310
moves too freely to to do things like
that and it kind of left them in a

6644
01:47:00,310 --> 01:47:00,320
that and it kind of left them in a
 

6645
01:47:00,320 --> 01:47:02,629
that and it kind of left them in a
pickle that they had to respond to

6646
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:02,639
pickle that they had to respond to
 

6647
01:47:02,639 --> 01:47:03,750
pickle that they had to respond to
so

6648
01:47:03,750 --> 01:47:03,760
so
 

6649
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:05,990
so
what was the role of pentagon's advanced

6650
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
what was the role of pentagon's advanced
 

6651
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,229
what was the role of pentagon's advanced
aerospace threat intelligence program

6652
01:47:08,229 --> 01:47:08,239

6653
01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:10,550

something that they've been dealing with
 

6697
01:47:54,560 --> 01:47:55,430
something that they've been dealing with
you know

6698
01:47:55,430 --> 01:47:55,440
you know
 

6699
01:47:55,440 --> 01:47:57,350
you know

and you know he came in and he watched a
 

6701
01:47:57,360 --> 01:47:58,870
and you know he came in and he watched a
video for like five or six seconds and

6702
01:47:58,870 --> 01:47:58,880
video for like five or six seconds and
 

6703
01:47:58,880 --> 01:47:59,669
video for like five or six seconds and
went

6704
01:47:59,669 --> 01:47:59,679
went
 

6705
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,109
went
and like turned around and walked out

6706
01:48:01,109 --> 01:48:01,119
and like turned around and walked out
 

6707
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:02,629
and like turned around and walked out
and you know i was like he's definitely

6708
01:48:02,629 --> 01:48:02,639
and you know i was like he's definitely
 

6709
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:04,790
and you know i was like he's definitely
seen these before there's no way that

6710
01:48:04,790 --> 01:48:04,800
seen these before there's no way that
 

6711
01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:06,149
seen these before there's no way that
you only watch that for a few seconds

6712
01:48:06,149 --> 01:48:06,159
you only watch that for a few seconds
 

6713
01:48:06,159 --> 01:48:08,070
you only watch that for a few seconds
and don't have more interest

6714
01:48:08,070 --> 01:48:08,080
and don't have more interest
 

6715
01:48:08,080 --> 01:48:09,830
and don't have more interest
it was you know too bizarre

6716
01:48:09,830 --> 01:48:09,840
it was you know too bizarre
 

6717
01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:10,790
it was you know too bizarre
so

6718
01:48:10,790 --> 01:48:10,800
so
 

6719
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:12,790
so
kind of going back does the office exist

6720
01:48:12,790 --> 01:48:12,800
kind of going back does the office exist
 

6721
01:48:12,800 --> 01:48:15,750
kind of going back does the office exist
well you know i've heard that though the

6722
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:15,760
well you know i've heard that though the
 

6723
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:16,830
well you know i've heard that though the
admiral

6724
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:16,840
admiral
 

6725
01:48:16,840 --> 01:48:19,030
admiral
essentially reported back to the

6726
01:48:19,030 --> 01:48:19,040
essentially reported back to the
 

6727
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,189
essentially reported back to the
pentagon about that that

6728
01:48:21,189 --> 01:48:21,199
pentagon about that that
 

6729
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:21,990
pentagon about that that
case

6730
01:48:21,990 --> 01:48:22,000
case
 

6731
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:23,590
case
real time essentially after he left

6732
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:23,600
real time essentially after he left
 

6733
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:25,189
real time essentially after he left
right so he basically went back and i

6734
01:48:25,189 --> 01:48:25,199
right so he basically went back and i
 

6735
01:48:25,199 --> 01:48:27,590
right so he basically went back and i
was totally reported that to either atep

6736
01:48:27,590 --> 01:48:27,600
was totally reported that to either atep
 

6737
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:29,590
was totally reported that to either atep
directly or to other you know somehow

6738
01:48:29,590 --> 01:48:29,600
directly or to other you know somehow
 

6739
01:48:29,600 --> 01:48:31,109
directly or to other you know somehow
the information got there so from my

6740
01:48:31,109 --> 01:48:31,119
the information got there so from my
 

6741

know as an aviator i wouldn't know
 

6749
01:48:39,600 --> 01:48:40,709
know as an aviator i wouldn't know
either way right that's just my

6750
01:48:40,709 --> 01:48:40,719
either way right that's just my
 

6751
01:48:40,719 --> 01:48:42,070
either way right that's just my
experience from what happened but it

01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:42,080
experience from what happened but it
 

6753
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:44,229
experience from what happened but it
seems like there's somewhere

6754
01:48:44,229 --> 01:48:44,239
seems like there's somewhere
 

6755
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:46,709
seems like there's somewhere
to report to

6756
01:48:46,709 --> 01:48:46,719
to report to
 

6757
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:47,910
to report to
at the time it seemed like there was at

6758
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:47,920
at the time it seemed like there was at
 

6759
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:49,669
at the time it seemed like there was at
least some place to complain to it's not

6760
01:48:49,669 --> 01:48:49,679
least some place to complain to it's not
 

6761
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:51,350
least some place to complain to it's not
report to

6762
01:48:51,350 --> 01:48:51,360
report to
 

6763
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:54,070
report to
let me ask you about sort of um people

6764
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
let me ask you about sort of um people
 

6765
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,070
let me ask you about sort of um people
that are taking a serious look at at the

6766
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:56,080
that are taking a serious look at at the
 

6767
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:57,990
that are taking a serious look at at the
videos and just the different ufo

sighting reports
 

6771
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:01,350
sighting reports
uh so there's a there's a person named

6772
01:49:01,350 --> 01:49:01,360
uh so there's a there's a person named
 

6773
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:04,310
uh so there's a there's a person named
west who uh is a skeptic and tries to

6774
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:04,320
west who uh is a skeptic and tries to
 

6775
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,470
west who uh is a skeptic and tries to
take a skeptical view on every single

6776
01:49:06,470 --> 01:49:06,480
take a skeptical view on every single
 

6777
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,790
take a skeptical view on every single
piece of evidence on these ufo sightings

6778
01:49:08,790 --> 01:49:08,800
piece of evidence on these ufo sightings
 

6779
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:10,870
piece of evidence on these ufo sightings
uh what do you think about his analysis

6780
01:49:10,870 --> 01:49:10,880
uh what do you think about his analysis
 

6781
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:12,390
uh what do you think about his analysis
he tries to

6782
01:49:12,390 --> 01:49:12,400
he tries to
 

6783
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:14,390
he tries to
analyze in a way that debunks some of

6784
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400
analyze in a way that debunks some of
 

6785
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:15,669
analyze in a way that debunks some of
these videos

6786
01:49:15,669 --> 01:49:15,679
these videos
 

6787
01:49:15,679 --> 01:49:17,350
these videos
and assign probabilities to their

6788
01:49:17,350 --> 01:49:17,360
and assign probabilities to their
 

6789
01:49:17,360 --> 01:49:21,350
and assign probabilities to their
explanations sort of leaning towards

6790
01:49:21,350 --> 01:49:21,360
explanations sort of leaning towards
 

6791
01:49:21,360 --> 01:49:23,189
explanations sort of leaning towards
things that uh

6792
01:49:23,189 --> 01:49:23,199
things that uh
 

6793
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:25,830
things that uh
give a very low probability to

6794
01:49:25,830 --> 01:49:25,840
give a very low probability to
 

6795
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,430
give a very low probability to
um

6796
01:49:27,430 --> 01:49:27,440
um
 

6797
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:29,510
um
alien extraterrestrial type of

6798
01:49:29,510 --> 01:49:29,520
alien extraterrestrial type of
 

6799
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:31,510
alien extraterrestrial type of
explanations for these ufos what do you

6800
01:49:31,510 --> 01:49:31,520
explanations for these ufos what do you
 

6801
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,709
explanations for these ufos what do you
think about

6802
01:49:32,709 --> 01:49:32,719
think about
 

6803
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:35,990
think about
his approach to these uh analysis well

6804
01:49:35,990 --> 01:49:36,000
his approach to these uh analysis well
 

6805
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:38,070
his approach to these uh analysis well
two parts to his approach one uh i

6806
01:49:38,070 --> 01:49:38,080
two parts to his approach one uh i
 

6807
01:49:38,080 --> 01:49:39,430
two parts to his approach one uh i
commend him for all the good work and

6808
01:49:39,430 --> 01:49:39,440
commend him for all the good work and
 

6809
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,589
commend him for all the good work and
effort he put into it um i've seen him

6810
01:49:41,589 --> 01:49:41,599
effort he put into it um i've seen him
 

6811
01:49:41,599 --> 01:49:42,950
effort he put into it um i've seen him
build some models and things of that

6812
01:49:42,950 --> 01:49:42,960
build some models and things of that
 

6813
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:44,390
build some models and things of that
nature

6814
01:49:44,390 --> 01:49:44,400
nature
 

6815
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,149
nature
and so i think that's something that's

6816
01:49:46,149 --> 01:49:46,159
and so i think that's something that's
 

6817
01:49:46,159 --> 01:49:47,589
and so i think that's something that's
absolutely needed in this environment no

6818
01:49:47,589 --> 01:49:47,599

been it's been like a very safe business
to be in to tell people that they

changed a little bit and
 

6853
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:28,629
changed a little bit and
the tactics i've seen to try to retain

completely dismissing what the air crew
 

6863
01:50:35,840 --> 01:50:38,229
completely dismissing what the air crew
are saying um and i think that is a

01:50:38,229 --> 01:50:38,239
are saying um and i think that is a
 

6865
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:40,629
are saying um and i think that is a
fallacy to think that we have to take

6866
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:40,639
fallacy to think that we have to take
 

6867
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:43,030
fallacy to think that we have to take
the human outside of that analysis so

6868
01:50:43,030 --> 01:50:43,040
the human outside of that analysis so
 

6869
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,350
the human outside of that analysis so
those are the two things i disagree with

6870
01:50:45,350 --> 01:50:45,360
those are the two things i disagree with
 

6871
01:50:45,360 --> 01:50:47,430
those are the two things i disagree with
when you uh put the night vision on and

6872
01:50:47,430 --> 01:50:47,440
when you uh put the night vision on and
 

6873
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:49,270
when you uh put the night vision on and
you look at the stars and you look out

6874
01:50:49,270 --> 01:50:49,280
you look at the stars and you look out
 

6875
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,669
you look at the stars and you look out
there and in the vast cosmos only a

there and in the vast cosmos only a
 

6877
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:54,149
there and in the vast cosmos only a
small fraction of which we can see

6878
01:50:54,149 --> 01:50:54,159
small fraction of which we can see
 

6879
01:50:54,159 --> 01:50:55,430
small fraction of which we can see
um

6880
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:55,440
um
 

6881
01:50:55,440 --> 01:50:57,430
um
how many intelligent alien civilizations

6882
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:57,440
how many intelligent alien civilizations
 

6883
01:50:57,440 --> 01:50:59,030
how many intelligent alien civilizations
do you think are out there do you think

6884
01:50:59,030 --> 01:50:59,040
do you think are out there do you think
 

6885
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,430
do you think are out there do you think
about this kind of stuff i do

6886
01:51:01,430 --> 01:51:01,440
about this kind of stuff i do
 

6887
01:51:01,440 --> 01:51:02,870
about this kind of stuff i do
you know i'm i'm of the theory that we

6888
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:02,880
you know i'm i'm of the theory that we
 

6889
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:03,990
you know i'm i'm of the theory that we
are not the only people out there i

6890
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:04,000
are not the only people out there i
 

6891
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,270
are not the only people out there i
think it's it's it would be a

6892
01:51:05,270 --> 01:51:05,280
think it's it's it would be a
 

6893
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:07,510
think it's it's it would be a
statistically silly comment to assume we

6894
01:51:07,510 --> 01:51:07,520
statistically silly comment to assume we
 

6895
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:09,510
statistically silly comment to assume we
are although i get that we are the only

6896
01:51:09,510 --> 01:51:09,520
are although i get that we are the only
 

6897
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:11,030
are although i get that we are the only
data point that we currently have

6898
01:51:11,030 --> 01:51:11,040
data point that we currently have
 

6899
01:51:11,040 --> 01:51:12,149
data point that we currently have
although

6900
01:51:12,149 --> 01:51:12,159
although
 

6901
01:51:12,159 --> 01:51:13,830
although
i'm willing to jump over that fence and

6902
01:51:13,830 --> 01:51:13,840
i'm willing to jump over that fence and
 

6903
01:51:13,840 --> 01:51:15,750
i'm willing to jump over that fence and
say that yes there most likely is

6904
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:15,760
say that yes there most likely is
 

6905
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,229
say that yes there most likely is
intelligent life elsewhere uh although

6906
01:51:18,229 --> 01:51:18,239
intelligent life elsewhere uh although
 

6907
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:19,910
intelligent life elsewhere uh although
i'll concede that it is a possibility we

6908
01:51:19,910 --> 01:51:19,920
i'll concede that it is a possibility we
 

6909
01:51:19,920 --> 01:51:22,229
i'll concede that it is a possibility we
are early or it could be limited or it

6910
01:51:22,229 --> 01:51:22,239
are early or it could be limited or it
 

6911
01:51:22,239 --> 01:51:23,270
are early or it could be limited or it
could be

6912
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
could be
 

6913
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:25,430
could be
in a manner that we don't recognize or

6914
01:51:25,430 --> 01:51:25,440
in a manner that we don't recognize or
 

6915
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:26,950
in a manner that we don't recognize or
can really understand

6916
01:51:26,950 --> 01:51:26,960
can really understand
 

6917
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,070
can really understand
i i spend so much time thinking about

6918
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:30,080
i i spend so much time thinking about
 

6919
01:51:30,080 --> 01:51:32,950
i i spend so much time thinking about
how we anthropomorphize things on this

6920
01:51:32,950 --> 01:51:32,960
how we anthropomorphize things on this
 

6921
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,950
how we anthropomorphize things on this
ufo topic and we've done it to ourselves

6922
01:51:34,950 --> 01:51:34,960
ufo topic and we've done it to ourselves
 

6923
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:36,550
ufo topic and we've done it to ourselves
with media in a sense right we've

6924
01:51:36,550 --> 01:51:36,560
with media in a sense right we've
 

6925
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,709
with media in a sense right we've
trained ourselves what to think about uh

6926
01:51:38,709 --> 01:51:38,719
trained ourselves what to think about uh
 

6927
01:51:38,719 --> 01:51:40,629
trained ourselves what to think about uh
what we think is true or what this would

6928
01:51:40,629 --> 01:51:40,639
what we think is true or what this would
 

6929
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:41,750
what we think is true or what this would
be like

6930
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:41,760
be like
 

6931
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:43,830
be like
and by doing so i think we're closing

6932
01:51:43,830 --> 01:51:43,840
and by doing so i think we're closing
 

6933
01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:46,149
and by doing so i think we're closing
ourselves off to a lot of what the

6934
01:51:46,149 --> 01:51:46,159
ourselves off to a lot of what the
 

6935
01:51:46,159 --> 01:51:48,070
ourselves off to a lot of what the
possibilities could be and the things

6936
01:51:48,070 --> 01:51:48,080
possibilities could be and the things
 

6937
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:50,629
possibilities could be and the things
that we could miss

6938
01:51:50,629 --> 01:51:50,639
that we could miss
 

6939
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:52,550
that we could miss
you beautifully put

6940
01:51:52,550 --> 01:51:52,560
you beautifully put
 

6941
01:51:52,560 --> 01:51:55,350
you beautifully put
that the thing that drew you to fighter

6942
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:55,360
that the thing that drew you to fighter
 

6943
01:51:55,360 --> 01:51:58,149
that the thing that drew you to fighter
jets is the technology so if you were to

6944
01:51:58,149 --> 01:51:58,159
jets is the technology so if you were to
 

6945
01:51:58,159 --> 01:51:59,030
jets is the technology so if you were to
think

6946
01:51:59,030 --> 01:51:59,040
think
 

6947
01:51:59,040 --> 01:52:02,709
think
to imagine from an alien perspective

6948
01:52:02,709 --> 01:52:02,719
to imagine from an alien perspective
 

6949
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:05,510
to imagine from an alien perspective
what kind of technologies would we first

6950
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:05,520
what kind of technologies would we first
 

6951
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,510
what kind of technologies would we first
encounter as human beings

6952
01:52:07,510 --> 01:52:07,520
encounter as human beings
 

6953
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,750
encounter as human beings
if we were to meet another alien

6954
01:52:09,750 --> 01:52:09,760
if we were to meet another alien
 

6955
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:11,109
if we were to meet another alien
civilization

6956
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
civilization
 

6957
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:13,109
civilization
in the next few centuries

6958
01:52:13,109 --> 01:52:13,119
in the next few centuries
 

6959
01:52:13,119 --> 01:52:15,910
in the next few centuries
what kind of thing would we see so

6960
01:52:15,910 --> 01:52:15,920
what kind of thing would we see so
 

6961
01:52:15,920 --> 01:52:17,750
what kind of thing would we see so
you're now at the cutting edge and you

6962
01:52:17,750 --> 01:52:17,760
you're now at the cutting edge and you
 

6963
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,910
you're now at the cutting edge and you
see the quick progress that's happening

6964
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:19,920
see the quick progress that's happening
 

6965
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:21,350
see the quick progress that's happening
that was happening throughout the 20th

6966
01:52:21,350 --> 01:52:21,360
that was happening throughout the 20th
 

6967
01:52:21,360 --> 01:52:23,189
that was happening throughout the 20th
century that's happening now with

6968
01:52:23,189 --> 01:52:23,199
century that's happening now with
 

6969
01:52:23,199 --> 01:52:25,350
century that's happening now with
greater degrees of autonomy with robots

6970
01:52:25,350 --> 01:52:25,360
greater degrees of autonomy with robots
 

6971
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:27,109
greater degrees of autonomy with robots
and that kind of stuff what do you think

6972
01:52:27,109 --> 01:52:27,119
and that kind of stuff what do you think
 

6973
01:52:27,119 --> 01:52:28,790
and that kind of stuff what do you think
we will encounter

6974
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:28,800
we will encounter
 

6975
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,270
we will encounter
i think we're gonna see uh the ability

6976
01:52:31,270 --> 01:52:31,280
i think we're gonna see uh the ability
 

6977
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:33,030
i think we're gonna see uh the ability
to manipulate matter like we used to

6978
01:52:33,030 --> 01:52:33,040
to manipulate matter like we used to
 

6979
01:52:33,040 --> 01:52:35,030
to manipulate matter like we used to
manipulate information like i think

6980
01:52:35,030 --> 01:52:35,040
manipulate information like i think
 

6981
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:37,910
manipulate information like i think
that's what um whether that means

6982
01:52:37,910 --> 01:52:37,920
that's what um whether that means
 

6983
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:40,149
that's what um whether that means
being able to pop something on the table

6984
01:52:40,149 --> 01:52:40,159
being able to pop something on the table
 

6985
01:52:40,159 --> 01:52:43,270
being able to pop something on the table
that didn't exist or to

6986
01:52:43,270 --> 01:52:43,280
that didn't exist or to
 

6987
01:52:43,280 --> 01:52:45,270
that didn't exist or to
influence a chemical reaction somewhere

6988
01:52:45,270 --> 01:52:45,280
influence a chemical reaction somewhere
 

6989
01:52:45,280 --> 01:52:48,070
influence a chemical reaction somewhere
but being able to manipulate and

6990
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:48,080
but being able to manipulate and
 

6991
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:50,950
but being able to manipulate and
treat matter as if it was information

6992
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:50,960
treat matter as if it was information
 

6993
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,950
treat matter as if it was information
and so being able to design specific

6994
01:52:52,950 --> 01:52:52,960
and so being able to design specific
 

6995
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:55,830
and so being able to design specific
materials being able to

6996
01:52:55,830 --> 01:52:55,840
materials being able to
 

6997
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,589
materials being able to
move past a lot of the barriers that

6998
01:52:57,589 --> 01:52:57,599
move past a lot of the barriers that
 

6999
01:52:57,599 --> 01:52:59,510
move past a lot of the barriers that
seem to limit our progress with things

7000
01:52:59,510 --> 01:52:59,520
seem to limit our progress with things
 

7001
01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:01,510
seem to limit our progress with things
such as miniaturized fusion or even just

7002
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:01,520
such as miniaturized fusion or even just
 

7003
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,030
such as miniaturized fusion or even just
fusion in general

7004
01:53:03,030 --> 01:53:03,040
fusion in general
 

7005
01:53:03,040 --> 01:53:05,669
fusion in general
is you know a lot of it is is matter

7006
01:53:05,669 --> 01:53:05,679
is you know a lot of it is is matter
 

7007
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:07,669
is you know a lot of it is is matter
based as material based and our ability

7008
01:53:07,669 --> 01:53:07,679
based as material based and our ability
 

7009
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:10,149
based as material based and our ability
to not

7010
01:53:10,149 --> 01:53:10,159

 

7011
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:11,830

manipulate we can only discover

7012
01:53:11,830 --> 01:53:11,840
manipulate we can only discover
 

7013
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,390
manipulate we can only discover
materials in a sense and so i think that

7014
01:53:14,390 --> 01:53:14,400
materials in a sense and so i think that
 

7015
01:53:14,400 --> 01:53:16,390
materials in a sense and so i think that
a complete mastery of the physical

7016
01:53:16,390 --> 01:53:16,400
a complete mastery of the physical
 

7017
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:18,390
a complete mastery of the physical
reality would be one of the key traits

7018
01:53:18,390 --> 01:53:18,400
reality would be one of the key traits
 

7019
01:53:18,400 --> 01:53:21,109
reality would be one of the key traits
of a very intelligent species well

7020
01:53:21,109 --> 01:53:21,119
of a very intelligent species well
 

7021
01:53:21,119 --> 01:53:23,109
of a very intelligent species well
you're actually working on some maybe

7022
01:53:23,109 --> 01:53:23,119
you're actually working on some maybe
 

7023
01:53:23,119 --> 01:53:24,950
you're actually working on some maybe
you can correct me but sort of quantum

7024
01:53:24,950 --> 01:53:24,960
you can correct me but sort of quantum
 

7025
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:26,470
you can correct me but sort of quantum
mechanical simulation to understand

7026
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:26,480
mechanical simulation to understand
 

7027
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:27,910
mechanical simulation to understand
materials

7028
01:53:27,910 --> 01:53:27,920
materials
 

7029
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,470
materials
so is that do you see sort of the the

7030
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:30,480
so is that do you see sort of the the
 

7031
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,070
so is that do you see sort of the the
early steps that we're doing on quantum

7032
01:53:32,070 --> 01:53:32,080
early steps that we're doing on quantum
 

7033
01:53:32,080 --> 01:53:33,669
early steps that we're doing on quantum
computing side

7034
01:53:33,669 --> 01:53:33,679
computing side
 

7035
01:53:33,679 --> 01:53:34,390
computing side
to

7036
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:34,400
to
 

7037
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:36,550
to
start to simulate to deeper understand

7038
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:36,560
start to simulate to deeper understand
 

7039
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:38,790
start to simulate to deeper understand
materials but maybe to engineer to mess

7040
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:38,800
materials but maybe to engineer to mess
 

7041
01:53:38,800 --> 01:53:41,109
materials but maybe to engineer to mess
with materials at the at the very low

7042
01:53:41,109 --> 01:53:41,119
with materials at the at the very low
 

7043
01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:43,350
with materials at the at the very low
level that aliens would be able to do

7044
01:53:43,350 --> 01:53:43,360
level that aliens would be able to do
 

7045
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:45,510
level that aliens would be able to do
and hopefully humans would be able to do

7046
01:53:45,510 --> 01:53:45,520
and hopefully humans would be able to do
 

7047
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,390
and hopefully humans would be able to do
soon

7048
01:53:46,390 --> 01:53:46,400
soon
 

7049
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:48,950
soon
yeah i think that's you know so if we

7050
01:53:48,950 --> 01:53:48,960
yeah i think that's you know so if we
 

7051
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,070
yeah i think that's you know so if we
think about

7052
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:50,080
think about
 

7053
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:52,390
think about
how what materials are made of it's just

7054
01:53:52,390 --> 01:53:52,400
how what materials are made of it's just
 

7055
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,149
how what materials are made of it's just
a collection of atoms but each one of

7056
01:53:54,149 --> 01:53:54,159
a collection of atoms but each one of
 

7057
01:53:54,159 --> 01:53:55,910
a collection of atoms but each one of
those atoms has a lot of data associated

7058
01:53:55,910 --> 01:53:55,920
those atoms has a lot of data associated
 

7059
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:57,270
those atoms has a lot of data associated
with it so if we want to kind of

7060
01:53:57,270 --> 01:53:57,280
with it so if we want to kind of
 

7061
01:53:57,280 --> 01:53:58,790
with it so if we want to kind of
calculate how they interact with each

7062
01:53:58,790 --> 01:53:58,800
calculate how they interact with each
 

7063
01:53:58,800 --> 01:53:59,750
calculate how they interact with each
other

7064
01:53:59,750 --> 01:53:59,760
other
 

7065
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,030
other
it requires a massive amount of

7066
01:54:01,030 --> 01:54:01,040
it requires a massive amount of
 

7067
01:54:01,040 --> 01:54:03,109
it requires a massive amount of
computational resources so much so that

7068
01:54:03,109 --> 01:54:03,119
computational resources so much so that
 

7069
01:54:03,119 --> 01:54:04,629
computational resources so much so that
it can't be done in a lot of cases with

7070
01:54:04,629 --> 01:54:04,639
it can't be done in a lot of cases with
 

7071
01:54:04,639 --> 01:54:06,550
it can't be done in a lot of cases with
classical computers and that's where

7072
01:54:06,550 --> 01:54:06,560
classical computers and that's where
 

7073
01:54:06,560 --> 01:54:08,950
classical computers and that's where
quantum computers come in

7074
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:08,960
quantum computers come in
 

7075
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,310
quantum computers come in
although we don't have a perfectly

7076
01:54:10,310 --> 01:54:10,320
although we don't have a perfectly
 

7077
01:54:10,320 --> 01:54:11,750
although we don't have a perfectly
functioning quantum computer at this

7078
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:11,760
functioning quantum computer at this
 

7079
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:12,950
functioning quantum computer at this
point

7080
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:12,960
point
 

7081
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:14,470
point
one of the things that we're working at

7082
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:14,480
one of the things that we're working at
 

7083
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,149
one of the things that we're working at
at quantum general materials is to

7084
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:16,159
at quantum general materials is to
 

7085
01:54:16,159 --> 01:54:17,910
at quantum general materials is to
essentially bridge that gap between what

7086
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:17,920
essentially bridge that gap between what
 

7087
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:19,910
essentially bridge that gap between what
a classical computer can do as far as

7088
01:54:19,910 --> 01:54:19,920
a classical computer can do as far as
 

7089
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:21,910
a classical computer can do as far as
simulating materials and of course what

7090
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:21,920
simulating materials and of course what
 

7091
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:23,589
simulating materials and of course what
a fully functioning quantum computer

7092
01:54:23,589 --> 01:54:23,599
a fully functioning quantum computer
 

7093
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:25,189
a fully functioning quantum computer
would mean for being able to design

7094
01:54:25,189 --> 01:54:25,199
would mean for being able to design
 

7095
01:54:25,199 --> 01:54:28,070
would mean for being able to design
materials and so you know having the

7096
01:54:28,070 --> 01:54:28,080
materials and so you know having the
 

7097
01:54:28,080 --> 01:54:30,070
materials and so you know having the
ability to study matter at a very

7098
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:30,080
ability to study matter at a very
 

7099
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:31,750
ability to study matter at a very
fundamental level and unleashing

7100
01:54:31,750 --> 01:54:31,760
fundamental level and unleashing
 

7101
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,270
fundamental level and unleashing
artificial intelligence and machine

7102
01:54:33,270 --> 01:54:33,280
artificial intelligence and machine
 

7103
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,350
artificial intelligence and machine
learning on that problem

7104
01:54:35,350 --> 01:54:35,360
learning on that problem
 

7105
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:37,669
learning on that problem
i think is you know in a sense you know

7106
01:54:37,669 --> 01:54:37,679
i think is you know in a sense you know
 

7107
01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:39,589
i think is you know in a sense you know
alien in a way that we're able to

7108
01:54:39,589 --> 01:54:39,599
alien in a way that we're able to
 

7109
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,910
alien in a way that we're able to
advance our science using you know a

7110
01:54:41,910 --> 01:54:41,920
advance our science using you know a
 

7111
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:43,589
advance our science using you know a
process that we may not fully understand

7112
01:54:43,589 --> 01:54:43,599
process that we may not fully understand
 

7113
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:45,589
process that we may not fully understand
with a perhaps a non-human based

7114
01:54:45,589 --> 01:54:45,599
with a perhaps a non-human based
 

7115
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,669
with a perhaps a non-human based
intelligence in some sense and so we may

7116
01:54:47,669 --> 01:54:47,679
intelligence in some sense and so we may
 

7117
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:50,149
intelligence in some sense and so we may
find patterns in the the processes right

7118
01:54:50,149 --> 01:54:50,159
find patterns in the the processes right
 

7119
01:54:50,159 --> 01:54:52,070
find patterns in the the processes right
how does our machine learning output you

7120
01:54:52,070 --> 01:54:52,080
how does our machine learning output you
 

7121
01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:54,629
how does our machine learning output you
know can we we match behaviors with

7122
01:54:54,629 --> 01:54:54,639
know can we we match behaviors with
 

7123
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:56,470
know can we we match behaviors with
um what we're observing with what maybe

7124
01:54:56,470 --> 01:54:56,480
um what we're observing with what maybe
 

7125
01:54:56,480 --> 01:54:57,910
um what we're observing with what maybe
a machine learning element with output

7126
01:54:57,910 --> 01:54:57,920
a machine learning element with output
 

7127
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:59,189
a machine learning element with output
right can we try to classify the

7128
01:54:59,189 --> 01:54:59,199
right can we try to classify the
 

7129
01:54:59,199 --> 01:55:01,350
right can we try to classify the
intelligence in that manner perhaps

7130
01:55:01,350 --> 01:55:01,360
intelligence in that manner perhaps
 

7131
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:03,430
intelligence in that manner perhaps
um and so you know at gen mads we're

7132
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:03,440
um and so you know at gen mads we're
 

7133
01:55:03,440 --> 01:55:05,109
um and so you know at gen mads we're
looking at these materials

7134
01:55:05,109 --> 01:55:05,119
looking at these materials
 

7135
01:55:05,119 --> 01:55:06,709
looking at these materials
we're considering what these algorithms

7136
01:55:06,709 --> 01:55:06,719
we're considering what these algorithms
 

7137
01:55:06,719 --> 01:55:08,950
we're considering what these algorithms
could have used for later on um

7138
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:08,960
could have used for later on um
 

7139
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:10,709
could have used for later on um
could we perhaps reverse the process and

7140
01:55:10,709 --> 01:55:10,719
could we perhaps reverse the process and
 

7141
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:12,950
could we perhaps reverse the process and
determine what a unique or anomalous

7142
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:12,960
determine what a unique or anomalous
 

7143
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,510
determine what a unique or anomalous
material what type of properties it

7144
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:15,520
material what type of properties it
 

7145
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:17,669
material what type of properties it
potentially could have

7146
01:55:17,669 --> 01:55:17,679
potentially could have
 

7147
01:55:17,679 --> 01:55:20,229
potentially could have
and you said gen matt right

intended to be the first launch
uh that will help us

7198
01:56:09,510 --> 01:56:09,520
uh that will help us
 

7199
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:11,830
uh that will help us
detect different types of materials uh

7200
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:11,840
detect different types of materials uh
 

7201
01:56:11,840 --> 01:56:14,950
detect different types of materials uh
using our advanced knowledge of uh

7202
01:56:14,950 --> 01:56:14,960
using our advanced knowledge of uh
 

7203
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:16,149
using our advanced knowledge of uh
quantum chemistry right we're gonna be

7204
01:56:16,149 --> 01:56:16,159
quantum chemistry right we're gonna be
 

7205
01:56:16,159 --> 01:56:17,589
quantum chemistry right we're gonna be
leveraging that experience in order to

7206
01:56:17,589 --> 01:56:17,599
leveraging that experience in order to
 

7207
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:20,070
leveraging that experience in order to
better analyze that data oh interesting

7208
01:56:20,070 --> 01:56:20,080
better analyze that data oh interesting
 

7209
01:56:20,080 --> 01:56:23,589
better analyze that data oh interesting
so uh materials that are strange

7210
01:56:23,589 --> 01:56:23,599
so uh materials that are strange
 

7211
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:25,030
so uh materials that are strange
or novel

7212
01:56:25,030 --> 01:56:25,040
or novel
 

7213
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:27,189
or novel
out there in space not necessarily but

7214
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:27,199
out there in space not necessarily but
 

7215
01:56:27,199 --> 01:56:28,629
out there in space not necessarily but
we'll be looking back at earth to be

7216
01:56:28,629 --> 01:56:28,639
we'll be looking back at earth to be
 

7217
01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:31,270
we'll be looking back at earth to be
able to detect deposits on earth god i

7218
01:56:31,270 --> 01:56:31,280
able to detect deposits on earth god i
 

7219
01:56:31,280 --> 01:56:33,430
able to detect deposits on earth god i
got it getting the greater perspective

7220
01:56:33,430 --> 01:56:33,440
got it getting the greater perspective
 

7221
01:56:33,440 --> 01:56:35,030
got it getting the greater perspective
for mountain space to do analysis of

7222
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:35,040
for mountain space to do analysis of
 

7223
01:56:35,040 --> 01:56:37,189
for mountain space to do analysis of
different materials correct interesting

7224
01:56:37,189 --> 01:56:37,199
different materials correct interesting
 

7225
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,430
different materials correct interesting
yeah i was really impressed by the

7226
01:56:39,430 --> 01:56:39,440
yeah i was really impressed by the
 

7227
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,790
yeah i was really impressed by the
deep mine i got to hang out deep

7228
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:40,800
deep mine i got to hang out deep
 

7229
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:42,790
deep mine i got to hang out deep
deepmind recently and they really

7230
01:56:42,790 --> 01:56:42,800
deepmind recently and they really
 

7231
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,870
deepmind recently and they really
impressed me the the possibility of the

7232
01:56:44,870 --> 01:56:44,880
impressed me the the possibility of the
 

7233
01:56:44,880 --> 01:56:46,629
impressed me the the possibility of the
application as you're saying of machine

7234
01:56:46,629 --> 01:56:46,639
application as you're saying of machine
 

7235
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:48,870
application as you're saying of machine
learning in the context of quantum

7236
01:56:48,870 --> 01:56:48,880
learning in the context of quantum
 

7237
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,589
learning in the context of quantum
mechanical simulation for materials so

7238
01:56:51,589 --> 01:56:51,599
mechanical simulation for materials so
 

7239
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:53,430
mechanical simulation for materials so
to understand materials

7240
01:56:53,430 --> 01:56:53,440
to understand materials
 

7241
01:56:53,440 --> 01:56:54,870
to understand materials
it's uh it's really really really

7242
01:56:54,870 --> 01:56:54,880
it's uh it's really really really
 

7243
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,070
it's uh it's really really really
interesting um so

7244
01:56:58,070 --> 01:56:58,080
interesting um so
 

7245
01:56:58,080 --> 01:57:00,149
interesting um so
manipulate matter huh i would say the

7246
01:57:00,149 --> 01:57:00,159
manipulate matter huh i would say the
 

7247
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:01,270
manipulate matter huh i would say the
next thing is

7248
01:57:01,270 --> 01:57:01,280
next thing is
 

7249
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:04,709
next thing is
horses right or maybe fields so um

7250
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
horses right or maybe fields so um
 

7251
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:06,149
horses right or maybe fields so um
you know manipulating or managing

7252
01:57:06,149 --> 01:57:06,159
you know manipulating or managing
 

7253
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:10,550
you know manipulating or managing
gravity um can we you know um maneuver

7254
01:57:10,550 --> 01:57:10,560
gravity um can we you know um maneuver
 

7255
01:57:10,560 --> 01:57:12,870
gravity um can we you know um maneuver
within fields in some manner that allows

7256
01:57:12,870 --> 01:57:12,880
within fields in some manner that allows
 

7257
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:15,990
within fields in some manner that allows
us to um perhaps move propellantless or

7258
01:57:15,990 --> 01:57:16,000
us to um perhaps move propellantless or
 

7259
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:17,669
us to um perhaps move propellantless or
in other manners right and so

7260
01:57:17,669 --> 01:57:17,679
in other manners right and so
 

7261
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:19,589
in other manners right and so
i think essentially

7262
01:57:19,589 --> 01:57:19,599
i think essentially
 

7263
01:57:19,599 --> 01:57:22,470
i think essentially
having a deeper understanding of um

7264
01:57:22,470 --> 01:57:22,480
having a deeper understanding of um
 

7265
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:23,830
having a deeper understanding of um
you know different fields and being able

7266
01:57:23,830 --> 01:57:23,840
you know different fields and being able
 

7267
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,189
you know different fields and being able
to interact with them

7268
01:57:25,189 --> 01:57:25,199
to interact with them
 

7269
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:27,830
to interact with them
i think would be you know a potential

7270
01:57:27,830 --> 01:57:27,840
i think would be you know a potential
 

7271
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,910
i think would be you know a potential
avenue for you know travel or advanced

7272
01:57:29,910 --> 01:57:29,920
avenue for you know travel or advanced
 

7273
01:57:29,920 --> 01:57:33,270
avenue for you know travel or advanced
travel right um propel let's travel um

7274
01:57:33,270 --> 01:57:33,280
travel right um propel let's travel um
 

7275
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:35,510
travel right um propel let's travel um
can we can we quantum entangle gravity

7276
01:57:35,510 --> 01:57:35,520
can we can we quantum entangle gravity
 

7277
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:37,350
can we can we quantum entangle gravity
fields together and propel our ship via

7278
01:57:37,350 --> 01:57:37,360
fields together and propel our ship via
 

7279
01:57:37,360 --> 01:57:38,870
fields together and propel our ship via
you know the gravity field of a planet

7280
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:38,880
you know the gravity field of a planet
 

7281
01:57:38,880 --> 01:57:41,189

the massive planet and a drive on a ship

7282
01:57:41,189 --> 01:57:41,199
the massive planet and a drive on a ship
 

7283
01:57:41,199 --> 01:57:42,070
the massive planet and a drive on a ship
you know there's all sorts of

7284
01:57:42,070 --> 01:57:42,080
you know there's all sorts of
 

7285
01:57:42,080 --> 01:57:43,589
you know there's all sorts of
interesting things but

7286
01:57:43,589 --> 01:57:43,599
interesting things but
 

7287
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:44,390
interesting things but
um

7288
01:57:44,390 --> 01:57:44,400
um
 

7289
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,629
um
yeah people look back at people like you

7290
01:57:46,629 --> 01:57:46,639
yeah people look back at people like you
 

7291
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,189
yeah people look back at people like you
and say wow they used to fly

7292
01:57:49,189 --> 01:57:49,199
and say wow they used to fly
 

7293
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:49,990
and say wow they used to fly
like

7294
01:57:49,990 --> 01:57:50,000
like
 

7295
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,430
like
with this kind of propellant it seems

7296
01:57:51,430 --> 01:57:51,440
with this kind of propellant it seems
 

7297
01:57:51,440 --> 01:57:53,109
with this kind of propellant it seems
like to be a very antiquated way of

7298
01:57:53,109 --> 01:57:53,119
like to be a very antiquated way of
 

7299
01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:55,189
like to be a very antiquated way of
flying and they were very impressed with

7300
01:57:55,189 --> 01:57:55,199
flying and they were very impressed with
 

7301
01:57:55,199 --> 01:57:56,629
flying and they were very impressed with
themselves these humans that they could

7302
01:57:56,629 --> 01:57:56,639
themselves these humans that they could
 

7303
01:57:56,639 --> 01:57:58,070
themselves these humans that they could
fly like birds

7304
01:57:58,070 --> 01:57:58,080
fly like birds
 

7305
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:00,870
fly like birds
uh it's like so much energy

7306
01:58:00,870 --> 01:58:00,880
uh it's like so much energy
 

7307
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:04,149
uh it's like so much energy
is used to fly such short distances from

7308
01:58:04,149 --> 01:58:04,159
is used to fly such short distances from
 

7309
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:05,669
is used to fly such short distances from
their perspective we can only throw so

7310
01:58:05,669 --> 01:58:05,679
their perspective we can only throw so
 

7311
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:07,350
their perspective we can only throw so
many rocks at the back yeah there needs

7312
01:58:07,350 --> 01:58:07,360
many rocks at the back yeah there needs
 

7313
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:09,910
many rocks at the back yeah there needs
to be a better way exactly it just seems

7314
01:58:09,910 --> 01:58:09,920
to be a better way exactly it just seems
 

7315
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,550
to be a better way exactly it just seems
dumb like these

7316
01:58:12,550 --> 01:58:12,560
dumb like these
 

7317
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,310
dumb like these
it's like flintstones or something like

7318
01:58:14,310 --> 01:58:14,320
it's like flintstones or something like
 

7319
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:16,070
it's like flintstones or something like
that good at it but yeah there's a limit

7320
01:58:16,070 --> 01:58:16,080
that good at it but yeah there's a limit
 

7321
01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:17,990
that good at it but yeah there's a limit
right like we need something good

7322
01:58:17,990 --> 01:58:18,000
right like we need something good
 

7323
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:20,149
right like we need something good
i mean that that's an interesting sort

7324
01:58:20,149 --> 01:58:20,159
i mean that that's an interesting sort
 

7325
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:22,950
i mean that that's an interesting sort
of uh trade-off how much do you invest

7326
01:58:22,950 --> 01:58:22,960
of uh trade-off how much do you invest
 

7327
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:25,109
of uh trade-off how much do you invest
in getting really good at it i tend to

7328
01:58:25,109 --> 01:58:25,119
in getting really good at it i tend to
 

7329
01:58:25,119 --> 01:58:27,750
in getting really good at it i tend to
believe the reason why

7330
01:58:27,750 --> 01:58:27,760
believe the reason why
 

7331
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,990
believe the reason why
it would be very important

7332
01:58:29,990 --> 01:58:30,000
it would be very important
 

7333
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:31,990
it would be very important
and very powerful to put a human on mars

7334
01:58:31,990 --> 01:58:32,000
and very powerful to put a human on mars
 

7335
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:34,229
and very powerful to put a human on mars
is not necessarily for the exploration

7336
01:58:34,229 --> 01:58:34,239
is not necessarily for the exploration
 

7337
01:58:34,239 --> 01:58:35,510
is not necessarily for the exploration
facet

7338
01:58:35,510 --> 01:58:35,520
facet
 

7339
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:37,189
facet
but in all the different technologies

7340
01:58:37,189 --> 01:58:37,199
but in all the different technologies
 

7341
01:58:37,199 --> 01:58:39,270
but in all the different technologies
that come from that

7342
01:58:39,270 --> 01:58:39,280
that come from that
 

7343
01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:41,430
that come from that
so the in putting our there's something

7344
01:58:41,430 --> 01:58:41,440
so the in putting our there's something
 

7345
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:42,790
so the in putting our there's something
about putting humans in extreme

7346
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:42,800
about putting humans in extreme
 

7347
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:43,990
about putting humans in extreme
conditions

7348
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,000
conditions
 

7349
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,229
conditions
where we figure out how to make it less

7350
01:58:46,229 --> 01:58:46,239
where we figure out how to make it less
 

7351
01:58:46,239 --> 01:58:49,830
where we figure out how to make it less
extreme more comfortable and uh for that

7352
01:58:49,830 --> 01:58:49,840
extreme more comfortable and uh for that
 

7353
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:52,550
extreme more comfortable and uh for that
we invent things like

7354
01:58:52,550 --> 01:58:52,560
we invent things like
 

7355
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:54,629
we invent things like
the dod sort of helping invent the

7356
01:58:54,629 --> 01:58:54,639
the dod sort of helping invent the
 

7357
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:56,070
the dod sort of helping invent the
internet and all the different

7358
01:58:56,070 --> 01:58:56,080
internet and all the different
 

7359
01:58:56,080 --> 01:58:58,310
internet and all the different
technologies we've invented it's almost

7360
01:58:58,310 --> 01:58:58,320
technologies we've invented it's almost
 

7361
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,550
technologies we've invented it's almost
like an indirect consequence of solving

7362
01:59:00,550 --> 01:59:00,560
like an indirect consequence of solving
 

7363
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:02,470
like an indirect consequence of solving
difficult problems whether that problem

7364
01:59:02,470 --> 01:59:02,480
difficult problems whether that problem
 

7365
01:59:02,480 --> 01:59:03,350
difficult problems whether that problem
means

7366
01:59:03,350 --> 01:59:03,360
means
 

7367
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:05,030
means
winning wars

7368
01:59:05,030 --> 01:59:05,040
winning wars
 

7369
01:59:05,040 --> 01:59:08,149
winning wars
or colonizing other planets and so i

7370
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:08,159
or colonizing other planets and so i
 

7371
01:59:08,159 --> 01:59:10,390
or colonizing other planets and so i
don't think mars will help us figure out

7372
01:59:10,390 --> 01:59:10,400
don't think mars will help us figure out
 

7373
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,950
don't think mars will help us figure out
propulsion systems or to crack open

7374
01:59:12,950 --> 01:59:12,960
propulsion systems or to crack open
 

7375
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:15,189
propulsion systems or to crack open
physics to where you can travel close to

7376
01:59:15,189 --> 01:59:15,199
physics to where you can travel close to
 

7377
01:59:15,199 --> 01:59:16,870
physics to where you can travel close to
the speed of light or fasten the speed

7378
01:59:16,870 --> 01:59:16,880
the speed of light or fasten the speed
 

7379
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:18,709
the speed of light or fasten the speed
of light but it will

7380
01:59:18,709 --> 01:59:18,719
of light but it will
 

7381
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:20,470
of light but it will
help us figure out how to build some

7382
01:59:20,470 --> 01:59:20,480
help us figure out how to build some
 

7383
01:59:20,480 --> 01:59:22,709
help us figure out how to build some
cool technology here on earth i think

7384
01:59:22,709 --> 01:59:22,719
cool technology here on earth i think
 

7385
01:59:22,719 --> 01:59:25,350
cool technology here on earth i think
um so it's i'm a big proponent of doing

7386
01:59:25,350 --> 01:59:25,360
um so it's i'm a big proponent of doing
 

7387
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:27,589
um so it's i'm a big proponent of doing
really difficult things really difficult

7388
01:59:27,589 --> 01:59:27,599
really difficult things really difficult
 

7389
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:30,629
really difficult things really difficult
engineering things to um to see what

7390
01:59:30,629 --> 01:59:30,639
engineering things to um to see what
 

7391
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:32,709
engineering things to um to see what
kind of technologies emerge from that

7392
01:59:32,709 --> 01:59:32,719
kind of technologies emerge from that
 

7393
01:59:32,719 --> 01:59:33,990
kind of technologies emerge from that
but

7394
01:59:33,990 --> 01:59:34,000
but
 

7395
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:35,350
but
let me ask you this do you think u.s

7396
01:59:35,350 --> 01:59:35,360
let me ask you this do you think u.s
 

7397
01:59:35,360 --> 01:59:37,750
let me ask you this do you think u.s
government is hiding

7398
01:59:37,750 --> 01:59:37,760
government is hiding
 

7399
01:59:37,760 --> 01:59:39,510
government is hiding
some technology

7400
01:59:39,510 --> 01:59:39,520
some technology
 

7401
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:44,149
some technology
like alien spacecraft technology

7402
01:59:44,149 --> 01:59:44,159
like alien spacecraft technology
 

7403
01:59:44,159 --> 01:59:47,030
like alien spacecraft technology
i have no information either way

7404
01:59:47,030 --> 01:59:47,040
i have no information either way
 

7405
01:59:47,040 --> 01:59:48,470
i have no information either way
and if you did you probably wouldn't

7406
01:59:48,470 --> 01:59:48,480
and if you did you probably wouldn't
 

7407
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:51,430
and if you did you probably wouldn't
tell me but my assumptions you know how

7408
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:51,440
tell me but my assumptions you know how
 

7409
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:53,030
tell me but my assumptions you know how
like what did my heart tell me my heart

7410
01:59:53,030 --> 01:59:53,040
like what did my heart tell me my heart
 

7411
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,109
like what did my heart tell me my heart
tells me something's going on but i have

7412
01:59:55,109 --> 01:59:55,119
tells me something's going on but i have
 

7413
01:59:55,119 --> 01:59:56,550
tells me something's going on but i have
no evidence for that

7414
01:59:56,550 --> 01:59:56,560
no evidence for that
 

7415
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:58,229
no evidence for that
maybe that's me wanting something to go

7416
01:59:58,229 --> 01:59:58,239
maybe that's me wanting something to go
 

7417
01:59:58,239 --> 02:00:01,109
maybe that's me wanting something to go
on maybe that's a human feeling to want

7418
02:00:01,109 --> 02:00:01,119
on maybe that's a human feeling to want
 

7419
02:00:01,119 --> 02:00:02,870
on maybe that's a human feeling to want
to know that my government's in control

7420
02:00:02,870 --> 02:00:02,880
to know that my government's in control
 

7421
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:05,830
to know that my government's in control
of what some strange unknown thing is

7422
02:00:05,830 --> 02:00:05,840
of what some strange unknown thing is
 

7423
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:06,080
of what some strange unknown thing is
um

7424
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:06,090

what's your sense if such a thing

7428
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:09,280
what's your sense if such a thing
 

7429
02:00:09,280 --> 02:00:11,109
what's your sense if such a thing
happened would uh

7430

with this kind of information leak with

02:00:12,790 --> 02:00:12,800
with this kind of information leak with
 

7433
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,229
with this kind of information leak with

this kind of information be released by
 

7435

the government
 

7437
02:00:15,440 --> 02:00:16,950
the government
i mean that's the worry that you have is

7438
02:00:16,950 --> 02:00:16,960
i mean that's the worry that you have is
 

7439
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,390
i mean that's the worry that you have is
because when you don't understand a

7440
02:00:18,390 --> 02:00:18,400
because when you don't understand a
 

7441
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:20,149
because when you don't understand a
thing and it's novel you you want to

7442
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:20,159
thing and it's novel you you want to
 

7443
02:00:20,159 --> 02:00:21,910
thing and it's novel you you want to
hide it so that

7444
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:21,920
hide it so that
 

7445
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:24,629
hide it so that
uh some kind of enemy doesn't get access

7446
02:00:24,629 --> 02:00:24,639
uh some kind of enemy doesn't get access
 

7447
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,030
uh some kind of enemy doesn't get access
to it and use it against you

7448
02:00:27,030 --> 02:00:27,040
to it and use it against you
 

7449
02:00:27,040 --> 02:00:28,470
to it and use it against you
i wonder if that is the underlying

7450
02:00:28,470 --> 02:00:28,480
i wonder if that is the underlying
 

7451
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,550
i wonder if that is the underlying
assumption i it's a it's the one people

7452
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:30,560
assumption i it's a it's the one people
 

7453
02:00:30,560 --> 02:00:32,870
assumption i it's a it's the one people
always jump to that it's for to you know

7454
02:00:32,870 --> 02:00:32,880
always jump to that it's for to you know
 

7455
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:33,589
always jump to that it's for to you know
to

7456
02:00:33,589 --> 02:00:33,599
to
 

7457
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:35,270
to
maintain secrecy of technology and i

7458
02:00:35,270 --> 02:00:35,280
maintain secrecy of technology and i
 

7459
02:00:35,280 --> 02:00:36,870
maintain secrecy of technology and i
assume that's part of it i wonder if

7460
02:00:36,870 --> 02:00:36,880
assume that's part of it i wonder if
 

7461
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:39,030
assume that's part of it i wonder if
there's any other reasons that we would

7462
02:00:39,030 --> 02:00:39,040
there's any other reasons that we would
 

7463
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:41,350
there's any other reasons that we would
want to not talk about it i imagine that

7464
02:00:41,350 --> 02:00:41,360
want to not talk about it i imagine that
 

7465
02:00:41,360 --> 02:00:43,270
want to not talk about it i imagine that
in such information would have a shock

7466
02:00:43,270 --> 02:00:43,280
in such information would have a shock
 

7467
02:00:43,280 --> 02:00:45,910
in such information would have a shock
to these you know social economic system

7468
02:00:45,910 --> 02:00:45,920
to these you know social economic system
 

7469
02:00:45,920 --> 02:00:48,149
to these you know social economic system
of any country if not the world

7470
02:00:48,149 --> 02:00:48,159
of any country if not the world
 

7471
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:50,070
of any country if not the world
and so i wonder if perhaps that was part

7472
02:00:50,070 --> 02:00:50,080
and so i wonder if perhaps that was part
 

7473
02:00:50,080 --> 02:00:52,070
and so i wonder if perhaps that was part
of the concern as well you know how

7474
02:00:52,070 --> 02:00:52,080
of the concern as well you know how
 

7475
02:00:52,080 --> 02:00:54,470
of the concern as well you know how
society can react to it maybe we're

7476
02:00:54,470 --> 02:00:54,480
society can react to it maybe we're
 

7477
02:00:54,480 --> 02:00:56,390
society can react to it maybe we're
anti-fragile enough now with everything

7478
02:00:56,390 --> 02:00:56,400
anti-fragile enough now with everything
 

7479
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,070
anti-fragile enough now with everything
that's going on and with our

7480
02:00:58,070 --> 02:00:58,080
that's going on and with our
 

7481
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:00,950
that's going on and with our
communication networks that um

7482
02:01:00,950 --> 02:01:00,960
communication networks that um
 

7483
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:03,830
communication networks that um
you know why not now i don't know but

7484
02:01:03,830 --> 02:01:03,840
you know why not now i don't know but
 

7485
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:05,350
you know why not now i don't know but
it's uh that's something i think about

7486
02:01:05,350 --> 02:01:05,360
it's uh that's something i think about
 

7487
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:06,950
it's uh that's something i think about
as well

7488
02:01:06,950 --> 02:01:06,960
as well
 

7489
02:01:06,960 --> 02:01:08,709
as well
yeah the effect on the

7490
02:01:08,709 --> 02:01:08,719
yeah the effect on the
 

7491
02:01:08,719 --> 02:01:10,550
yeah the effect on the
the mass psyche

7492
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,560
the mass psyche
 

7493
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:12,950
the mass psyche
uh of of something like this

7494
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:12,960
uh of of something like this
 

7495
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,550
uh of of something like this
that uh

7496
02:01:14,550 --> 02:01:14,560
that uh
 

7497
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:16,149
that uh
that there's another intelligence out

7498
02:01:16,149 --> 02:01:16,159
that there's another intelligence out
 

7499
02:01:16,159 --> 02:01:18,709
that there's another intelligence out
there

7500
02:01:18,709 --> 02:01:18,719

 

7501
02:01:18,719 --> 02:01:21,030

we had trouble enough to deal with the

7502
02:01:21,030 --> 02:01:21,040
we had trouble enough to deal with the
 

7503
02:01:21,040 --> 02:01:23,189
we had trouble enough to deal with the
pandemic

7504
02:01:23,189 --> 02:01:23,199
pandemic
 

7505
02:01:23,199 --> 02:01:27,189
pandemic
to have something of this scale

7506
02:01:27,189 --> 02:01:27,199

 

7507
02:01:27,199 --> 02:01:29,830

basically having just an inkling

7508
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
basically having just an inkling
 

7509
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:31,510
basically having just an inkling
of a phenomena that we have no

7510
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:31,520
of a phenomena that we have no
 

7511
02:01:31,520 --> 02:01:33,189
of a phenomena that we have no
understanding of and could lead to

7512
02:01:33,189 --> 02:01:33,199
understanding of and could lead to
 

7513
02:01:33,199 --> 02:01:34,550
understanding of and could lead to
complete destruction of human

7514
02:01:34,550 --> 02:01:34,560
complete destruction of human
 

7515
02:01:34,560 --> 02:01:37,830
complete destruction of human
civilization or a flourishing of it

7516
02:01:37,830 --> 02:01:37,840
civilization or a flourishing of it
 

7517
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:39,669
civilization or a flourishing of it
and what do you do

7518
02:01:39,669 --> 02:01:39,679
and what do you do
 

7519
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:41,270
and what do you do
what does the bureaucracy of government

7520
02:01:41,270 --> 02:01:41,280
what does the bureaucracy of government
 

7521
02:01:41,280 --> 02:01:43,669
what does the bureaucracy of government
do with that yeah especially when

7522
02:01:43,669 --> 02:01:43,679
do with that yeah especially when
 

7523
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:44,790
do with that yeah especially when
they're the ones holding the range of

7524
02:01:44,790 --> 02:01:44,800
they're the ones holding the range of
 

7525
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:47,350
they're the ones holding the range of
power and such a communication would

7526
02:01:47,350 --> 02:01:47,360
power and such a communication would
 

7527
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,270
power and such a communication would
relinquish that power essentially to

7528
02:01:49,270 --> 02:01:49,280
relinquish that power essentially to
 

7529
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,310
relinquish that power essentially to
some degree

7530
02:01:52,310 --> 02:01:52,320

 

7531
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:56,149

since you think there's aliens out there

7532
02:01:56,149 --> 02:01:56,159
since you think there's aliens out there
 

7533
02:01:56,159 --> 02:01:57,990
since you think there's aliens out there
and

7534
02:01:57,990 --> 02:01:58,000
and
 

7535
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:01,910
and
you're somebody that's thought about war

7536
02:02:01,910 --> 02:02:01,920
you're somebody that's thought about war
 

7537
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:03,390
you're somebody that's thought about war
quite a bit do you think alien

7538
02:02:03,390 --> 02:02:03,400
quite a bit do you think alien
 

7539
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:05,189
quite a bit do you think alien
civilizations

7540
02:02:05,189 --> 02:02:05,199
civilizations
 

7541
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:08,229
civilizations
when we meet them would want war

7542
02:02:08,229 --> 02:02:08,239
when we meet them would want war
 

7543
02:02:08,239 --> 02:02:10,629
when we meet them would want war
would would they be a danger to us would

7544
02:02:10,629 --> 02:02:10,639
would would they be a danger to us would
 

7545
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:13,030
would would they be a danger to us would
they be a friend to us

7546
02:02:13,030 --> 02:02:13,040
they be a friend to us
 

7547
02:02:13,040 --> 02:02:14,629
they be a friend to us
what's your intuition

7548
02:02:14,629 --> 02:02:14,639
what's your intuition
 

7549
02:02:14,639 --> 02:02:16,870
what's your intuition
about intelligences out there

7550
02:02:16,870 --> 02:02:16,880
about intelligences out there
 

7551
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:19,589
about intelligences out there
my intuition tells me that when two

7552
02:02:19,589 --> 02:02:19,599
my intuition tells me that when two
 

7553
02:02:19,599 --> 02:02:21,589
my intuition tells me that when two
people like yourself and myself or

7554
02:02:21,589 --> 02:02:21,599
people like yourself and myself or
 

7555
02:02:21,599 --> 02:02:23,350
people like yourself and myself or
anyone get together

7556
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
anyone get together
 

7557
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:25,589
anyone get together
often the output is greater than

7558
02:02:25,589 --> 02:02:25,599
often the output is greater than
 

7559
02:02:25,599 --> 02:02:26,790
often the output is greater than
individuals

7560
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:26,800
individuals
 

7561
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:28,550
individuals
and when we work together we can

7562
02:02:28,550 --> 02:02:28,560
and when we work together we can
 

7563
02:02:28,560 --> 02:02:30,310
and when we work together we can
typically do things

7564
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:30,320
typically do things
 

7565
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,990
typically do things
that are more impressive and better than

7566
02:02:31,990 --> 02:02:32,000
that are more impressive and better than
 

7567
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:35,510
that are more impressive and better than
if a single person works alone

7568
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:35,520
if a single person works alone
 

7569
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,270
if a single person works alone
and now i know that

7570
02:02:37,270 --> 02:02:37,280
and now i know that
 

7571
02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:39,109
and now i know that
war has

7572
02:02:39,109 --> 02:02:39,119
war has
 

7573
02:02:39,119 --> 02:02:41,750
war has
driven technology technological

7574
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:41,760
driven technology technological
 

7575
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:43,189
driven technology technological
progress

7576
02:02:43,189 --> 02:02:43,199
progress
 

7577
02:02:43,199 --> 02:02:44,550
progress
but perhaps there's other mechanisms

7578
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:44,560
but perhaps there's other mechanisms
 

7579
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:47,910
but perhaps there's other mechanisms
that can do so but regardless

7580
02:02:47,910 --> 02:02:47,920
that can do so but regardless
 

7581
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:50,229
that can do so but regardless
i wonder you know if we truly think

7582
02:02:50,229 --> 02:02:50,239
i wonder you know if we truly think
 

7583
02:02:50,239 --> 02:02:52,709
i wonder you know if we truly think
about an advanced society that has been

7584
02:02:52,709 --> 02:02:52,719
about an advanced society that has been
 

7585
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:54,470
about an advanced society that has been
perhaps thousands or millions of years

7586
02:02:54,470 --> 02:02:54,480
perhaps thousands or millions of years
 

7587
02:02:54,480 --> 02:02:55,750
perhaps thousands or millions of years
ahead of us

7588
02:02:55,750 --> 02:02:55,760
ahead of us
 

7589
02:02:55,760 --> 02:02:58,390
ahead of us
i would imagine that same

7590
02:02:58,390 --> 02:02:58,400
i would imagine that same
 

7591
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:00,310
i would imagine that same
same truth to be there that people

7592
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:00,320
same truth to be there that people
 

7593
02:03:00,320 --> 02:03:01,830
same truth to be there that people
working together creatures working

7594
02:03:01,830 --> 02:03:01,840
working together creatures working
 

7595
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:04,550
working together creatures working
together is a good thing for

7596
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:04,560
together is a good thing for
 

7597
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,669
together is a good thing for
society or its society as a whole

7598
02:03:07,669 --> 02:03:07,679
society or its society as a whole
 

7599
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:09,589
society or its society as a whole
and if we consider that

7600
02:03:09,589 --> 02:03:09,599
and if we consider that
 

7601
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:10,550
and if we consider that
as

7602
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:10,560
as
 

7603
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:12,709
as
we imagine a society growing and

7604
02:03:12,709 --> 02:03:12,719
we imagine a society growing and
 

7605
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,990
we imagine a society growing and
expanding in a sense the ultimate

7606
02:03:15,990 --> 02:03:16,000
expanding in a sense the ultimate
 

7607
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:17,270
expanding in a sense the ultimate
output of a planet could only be

7608
02:03:17,270 --> 02:03:17,280
output of a planet could only be
 

7609
02:03:17,280 --> 02:03:19,350
output of a planet could only be
achieved in some senses if everyone was

7610
02:03:19,350 --> 02:03:19,360
achieved in some senses if everyone was
 

7611
02:03:19,360 --> 02:03:21,189
achieved in some senses if everyone was
working towards the same goal and there

7612
02:03:21,189 --> 02:03:21,199
working towards the same goal and there
 

7613
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:22,790
working towards the same goal and there
might be

7614
02:03:22,790 --> 02:03:22,800
might be
 

7615
02:03:22,800 --> 02:03:24,550
might be
you know wonders and secrets and things

7616
02:03:24,550 --> 02:03:24,560
you know wonders and secrets and things
 

7617
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:25,990
you know wonders and secrets and things
that we can't imagine just simply

7618
02:03:25,990 --> 02:03:26,000
that we can't imagine just simply
 

7619
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:28,310
that we can't imagine just simply
because of time frames that we we live

7620
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:28,320
because of time frames that we we live
 

7621
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:30,149
because of time frames that we we live
under and we think in

7622
02:03:30,149 --> 02:03:30,159
under and we think in
 

7623
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:33,669
under and we think in
but if a planet has a single unit and it

that's how they've evolved and they've
 

7639
02:03:46,080 --> 02:03:48,310
that's how they've evolved and they've
assumed any intelligent species would

approach it from the um
position that

7788
02:06:14,870 --> 02:06:14,880
position that
 

7789
02:06:14,880 --> 02:06:17,430
position that
the human should be

7790
02:06:17,430 --> 02:06:17,440
the human should be
 

7791
02:06:17,440 --> 02:06:18,629
the human should be
commanding from the highest level

7792
02:06:18,629 --> 02:06:18,639
commanding from the highest level
 

7793
02:06:18,639 --> 02:06:20,229
commanding from the highest level
possible right so

7794
02:06:20,229 --> 02:06:20,239
possible right so
 

7795
02:06:20,239 --> 02:06:21,750
possible right so
mission objective

7796
02:06:21,750 --> 02:06:21,760
mission objective
 

7797
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:24,629
mission objective
based targeting and so if

7798
02:06:24,629 --> 02:06:24,639
based targeting and so if
 

7799
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:26,069
based targeting and so if
just for example if there's a building

7800
02:06:26,069 --> 02:06:26,079
just for example if there's a building
 

7801
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:28,069
just for example if there's a building
here and i want that building to go away

7802
02:06:28,069 --> 02:06:28,079
here and i want that building to go away
 

7803
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:29,589
here and i want that building to go away
that's the message i want to communicate

7804
02:06:29,589 --> 02:06:29,599
that's the message i want to communicate
 

7805
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:31,350
that's the message i want to communicate
i don't want to tell certain vehicles to

7806
02:06:31,350 --> 02:06:31,360
i don't want to tell certain vehicles to
 

7807
02:06:31,360 --> 02:06:32,629
i don't want to tell certain vehicles to
be in a certain spot i don't want to

7808
02:06:32,629 --> 02:06:32,639
be in a certain spot i don't want to
 

7809
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:34,229
be in a certain spot i don't want to
know how much fuel i have i don't even

7810
02:06:34,229 --> 02:06:34,239
know how much fuel i have i don't even
 

7811
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:35,830
know how much fuel i have i don't even
want to know what capabilities they have

7812
02:06:35,830 --> 02:06:35,840
want to know what capabilities they have
 

7813
02:06:35,840 --> 02:06:37,750
want to know what capabilities they have
necessarily i just want to know

7814
02:06:37,750 --> 02:06:37,760
necessarily i just want to know
 

7815
02:06:37,760 --> 02:06:40,229
necessarily i just want to know
that i have the ability to select from a

7816
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:40,239
that i have the ability to select from a
 

7817
02:06:40,239 --> 02:06:42,310
that i have the ability to select from a
cloud of capabilities and the right

7818
02:06:42,310 --> 02:06:42,320
cloud of capabilities and the right
 

7819
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:44,069
cloud of capabilities and the right
assets are going to arrive such that

7820
02:06:44,069 --> 02:06:44,079
assets are going to arrive such that
 

7821
02:06:44,079 --> 02:06:46,470
assets are going to arrive such that
they deal with the contingencies around

7822
02:06:46,470 --> 02:06:46,480
they deal with the contingencies around
 

7823
02:06:46,480 --> 02:06:48,390
they deal with the contingencies around
the target such as protection systems or

7824
02:06:48,390 --> 02:06:48,400
the target such as protection systems or
 

7825
02:06:48,400 --> 02:06:50,950
the target such as protection systems or
ew and then can prosecute the target to

7826
02:06:50,950 --> 02:06:50,960
ew and then can prosecute the target to
 

7827
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:52,470
ew and then can prosecute the target to
the higher enough probability of

7828
02:06:52,470 --> 02:06:52,480
the higher enough probability of
 

7829
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,910
the higher enough probability of
satisfaction that's needed by the

7830
02:06:53,910 --> 02:06:53,920
satisfaction that's needed by the
 

7831
02:06:53,920 --> 02:06:55,589
satisfaction that's needed by the
mission command and that's the power of

7832
02:06:55,589 --> 02:06:55,599
mission command and that's the power of
 

7833
02:06:55,599 --> 02:06:57,990
mission command and that's the power of
the the human mind is it's able to do

7834
02:06:57,990 --> 02:06:58,000
the the human mind is it's able to do
 

7835
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:00,709
the the human mind is it's able to do
some of these strategic calculations but

7836
02:07:00,709 --> 02:07:00,719
some of these strategic calculations but
 

7837
02:07:00,719 --> 02:07:02,790
some of these strategic calculations but
also ethical calculations all that kind

7838
02:07:02,790 --> 02:07:02,800
also ethical calculations all that kind
 

7839
02:07:02,800 --> 02:07:04,310
also ethical calculations all that kind
of stuff exactly that's what humans are

7840
02:07:04,310 --> 02:07:04,320
of stuff exactly that's what humans are
 

7841
02:07:04,320 --> 02:07:05,270
of stuff exactly that's what humans are
good at

7842
02:07:05,270 --> 02:07:05,280
good at
 

7843
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,589
good at
does it worry you

7844
02:07:07,589 --> 02:07:07,599
does it worry you
 

7845
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:10,550
does it worry you
a future will have increasingly

7846
02:07:10,550 --> 02:07:10,560
a future will have increasingly
 

7847
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:13,430
a future will have increasingly
higher autonomy in our weapon systems in

7848
02:07:13,430 --> 02:07:13,440
higher autonomy in our weapon systems in
 

7849
02:07:13,440 --> 02:07:16,470
higher autonomy in our weapon systems in
our war so you said building

7850
02:07:16,470 --> 02:07:16,480
our war so you said building
 

7851
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,069
our war so you said building
what about

7852
02:07:18,069 --> 02:07:18,079
what about
 

7853
02:07:18,079 --> 02:07:21,189
what about
uh telling a set of

7854
02:07:21,189 --> 02:07:21,199
uh telling a set of
 

7855
02:07:21,199 --> 02:07:23,510
uh telling a set of
fully autonomous drones to get rid of

7856
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:23,520
fully autonomous drones to get rid of
 

7857
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:26,390
fully autonomous drones to get rid of
all the terrorists in this city

7858
02:07:26,390 --> 02:07:26,400
all the terrorists in this city
 

7859
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,550
all the terrorists in this city
so these multiple buildings

7860
02:07:28,550 --> 02:07:28,560
so these multiple buildings
 

7861
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:29,669
so these multiple buildings
region

7862
02:07:29,669 --> 02:07:29,679
region
 

7863
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:31,750
region
that kind of it's a greater and greater

7864
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:31,760
that kind of it's a greater and greater
 

7865
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:33,109
that kind of it's a greater and greater
um

7866
02:07:33,109 --> 02:07:33,119
um
 

7867
02:07:33,119 --> 02:07:35,109
um
autonomy

7868
02:07:35,109 --> 02:07:35,119
autonomy
 

7869
02:07:35,119 --> 02:07:38,629
autonomy
so that that's a fear right um

7870
02:07:38,629 --> 02:07:38,639
so that that's a fear right um
 

7871
02:07:38,639 --> 02:07:40,310
so that that's a fear right um
you're viewing it from a we can cover

7872
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:40,320
you're viewing it from a we can cover
 

7873
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:43,589
you're viewing it from a we can cover
more perspective which is um

7874
02:07:43,589 --> 02:07:43,599
more perspective which is um
 

7875
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:44,870
more perspective which is um
fair and

7876
02:07:44,870 --> 02:07:44,880
fair and
 

7877
02:07:44,880 --> 02:07:46,229
fair and
a lot of

7878
02:07:46,229 --> 02:07:46,239
a lot of
 

7879
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:48,310
a lot of
we i don't approach it from that topic

7880
02:07:48,310 --> 02:07:48,320
we i don't approach it from that topic
 

7881
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:49,510
we i don't approach it from that topic
at least i don't think of it that way at

7882
02:07:49,510 --> 02:07:49,520
at least i don't think of it that way at
 

7883
02:07:49,520 --> 02:07:50,870
at least i don't think of it that way at
least morally

7884
02:07:50,870 --> 02:07:50,880
least morally
 

7885
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:51,990
least morally
um

7886
02:07:51,990 --> 02:07:52,000
um
 

7887
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,510
um
i think that with the advancement of

7888
02:07:53,510 --> 02:07:53,520
i think that with the advancement of
 

7889
02:07:53,520 --> 02:07:56,550
i think that with the advancement of
warfare assuming we have a justin and

7890
02:07:56,550 --> 02:07:56,560
warfare assuming we have a justin and
 

7891
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:58,550
warfare assuming we have a justin and
moral leadership

7892
02:07:58,550 --> 02:07:58,560
moral leadership
 

7893
02:07:58,560 --> 02:08:01,030
moral leadership
um if that's the case then

7894
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:01,040
um if that's the case then
 

7895
02:08:01,040 --> 02:08:03,669
um if that's the case then
i am an advocate for increased autonomy

7896
02:08:03,669 --> 02:08:03,679
i am an advocate for increased autonomy
 

7897
02:08:03,679 --> 02:08:05,910
i am an advocate for increased autonomy
and technology because i see it as an

7898
02:08:05,910 --> 02:08:05,920
and technology because i see it as an
 

7899
02:08:05,920 --> 02:08:08,950
and technology because i see it as an
ability to be more precise

7900
02:08:08,950 --> 02:08:08,960
ability to be more precise
 

7901
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,910
ability to be more precise
and if we trust the moral leadership of

7902
02:08:11,910 --> 02:08:11,920
and if we trust the moral leadership of
 

7903
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:13,430
and if we trust the moral leadership of
our

7904
02:08:13,430 --> 02:08:13,440
our
 

7905
02:08:13,440 --> 02:08:15,990
our
government then we would want to be as

7906
02:08:15,990 --> 02:08:16,000
government then we would want to be as
 

7907
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:19,030
government then we would want to be as
precise as possible in order to mitigate

7908
02:08:19,030 --> 02:08:19,040
precise as possible in order to mitigate
 

7909
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:21,030
precise as possible in order to mitigate
effects that we don't want

7910
02:08:21,030 --> 02:08:21,040
effects that we don't want
 

7911
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:22,629
effects that we don't want
so

7912
02:08:22,629 --> 02:08:22,639
so
 

7913
02:08:22,639 --> 02:08:24,229
so
i know that's not a satisfying answer

7914
02:08:24,229 --> 02:08:24,239
i know that's not a satisfying answer
 

7915
02:08:24,239 --> 02:08:26,470
i know that's not a satisfying answer
and it leaves us well no bad feelings

7916
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:26,480
and it leaves us well no bad feelings
 

7917
02:08:26,480 --> 02:08:29,350
and it leaves us well no bad feelings
but no because having experienced sort

7918
02:08:29,350 --> 02:08:29,360
but no because having experienced sort
 

7919
02:08:29,360 --> 02:08:32,629
but no because having experienced sort
of um

7920
02:08:32,629 --> 02:08:32,639

 

7921
02:08:32,639 --> 02:08:34,790

directly seeing

7922
02:08:34,790 --> 02:08:34,800
directly seeing
 

7923
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:36,950
directly seeing
what it looks like

7924
02:08:36,950 --> 02:08:36,960
what it looks like
 

7925
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:39,430
what it looks like
when deliberately or

7926
02:08:39,430 --> 02:08:39,440
when deliberately or
 

7927
02:08:39,440 --> 02:08:41,830
when deliberately or
carelessly

7928
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:41,840
carelessly
 

7929
02:08:41,840 --> 02:08:43,589
carelessly
war leads to the death of a large number

7930
02:08:43,589 --> 02:08:43,599
war leads to the death of a large number
 

7931
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:45,830
war leads to the death of a large number
of civilians it doesn't currently in

7932
02:08:45,830 --> 02:08:45,840
of civilians it doesn't currently in
 

7933
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:47,589
of civilians it doesn't currently in
ukraine

7934
02:08:47,589 --> 02:08:47,599
ukraine
 

7935
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,950
ukraine
the the value of precision

7936
02:08:50,950 --> 02:08:50,960
the the value of precision
 

7937
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:52,870
the the value of precision
given ethical leadership becomes

7938
02:08:52,870 --> 02:08:52,880
given ethical leadership becomes
 

7939
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:54,149
given ethical leadership becomes
apparent

7940
02:08:54,149 --> 02:08:54,159
apparent
 

7941
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:55,830
apparent
so there's something

7942
02:08:55,830 --> 02:08:55,840
so there's something
 

7943
02:08:55,840 --> 02:08:58,149
so there's something
distinctly unethical about the the

7944
02:08:58,149 --> 02:08:58,159
distinctly unethical about the the
 

7945
02:08:58,159 --> 02:09:02,629
distinctly unethical about the the
murder of civilians in a time of war

7946
02:09:02,629 --> 02:09:02,639
murder of civilians in a time of war
 

7947
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:05,830
murder of civilians in a time of war
and i think technology helps lessen that

7948
02:09:05,830 --> 02:09:05,840
and i think technology helps lessen that
 

7949
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:08,390
and i think technology helps lessen that
of course all death is is terrible

7950
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:08,400
of course all death is is terrible
 

7951
02:09:08,400 --> 02:09:11,990
of course all death is is terrible

being killed um
 

7959
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:21,109
being killed um
yeah it's particularly terrible

7960
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:21,119
yeah it's particularly terrible
 

7961
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:22,310
yeah it's particularly terrible
it is

7962
02:09:22,310 --> 02:09:22,320
it is
 

7963
02:09:22,320 --> 02:09:23,750
it is
and you know you approached it from the

7964
02:09:23,750 --> 02:09:23,760
and you know you approached it from the
 

7965
02:09:23,760 --> 02:09:27,750
and you know you approached it from the
angle of more autonomy enables a wider

7966
02:09:27,750 --> 02:09:27,760
angle of more autonomy enables a wider
 

7967
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:30,870
angle of more autonomy enables a wider
you know swath of destruction and

7968
02:09:30,870 --> 02:09:30,880
you know swath of destruction and
 

7969
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:32,310
you know swath of destruction and
that's where we get back into you know

7970
02:09:32,310 --> 02:09:32,320
that's where we get back into you know
 

7971
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:34,310
that's where we get back into you know
who who's making the decisions based off

7972
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:34,320
who who's making the decisions based off
 

7973
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:35,910
who who's making the decisions based off
of this and

7974
02:09:35,910 --> 02:09:35,920
of this and
 

7975
02:09:35,920 --> 02:09:37,589
of this and
you know my hope again would be that we

7976
02:09:37,589 --> 02:09:37,599
you know my hope again would be that we
 

7977
02:09:37,599 --> 02:09:38,870
you know my hope again would be that we
would have the leadership that would use

7978
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
would have the leadership that would use
 

7979
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,790
would have the leadership that would use
these things when needed in the precise

7980
02:09:40,790 --> 02:09:40,800
these things when needed in the precise
 

7981
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,870
these things when needed in the precise
way as possible to minimize that and

7982
02:09:42,870 --> 02:09:42,880
way as possible to minimize that and
 

7983
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:44,470
way as possible to minimize that and
i've seen that firsthand you know i've

while escorting convoys and you know it
 

7997
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,790
while escorting convoys and you know it
wasn't easy then and i'm sure it's not

7998
02:10:00,790 --> 02:10:00,800
wasn't easy then and i'm sure it's not
 

7999
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,390
wasn't easy then and i'm sure it's not
any easier now especially after what

8000
02:10:02,390 --> 02:10:02,400
any easier now especially after what
 

8001
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,750
any easier now especially after what
you've just seen

8002
02:10:03,750 --> 02:10:03,760
you've just seen
 

8003
02:10:03,760 --> 02:10:05,750
you've just seen
do you have thoughts about the current

8004

do you have thoughts about the current
war in ukraine maybe from a military

8006
02:10:08,229 --> 02:10:08,239
war in ukraine maybe from a military
 

8007
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:09,430
war in ukraine maybe from a military
perspective

8008
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:09,440
perspective
 

8009
02:10:09,440 --> 02:10:11,990
perspective
maybe from the air force perspective so

8010
02:10:11,990 --> 02:10:12,000
maybe from the air force perspective so
 

8011
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,990
maybe from the air force perspective so
i can just mention a few things there's

8012
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:14,000
i can just mention a few things there's
 

8013
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,550
i can just mention a few things there's
the uh baraktar drones that are being

8014
02:10:16,550 --> 02:10:16,560
the uh baraktar drones that are being
 

8015
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:17,669
the uh baraktar drones that are being
used

8016
02:10:17,669 --> 02:10:17,679
used
 

8017
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:19,990
used
uh they're unmanned i think they have

8018
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,000
uh they're unmanned i think they have
 

8019
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,750
uh they're unmanned i think they have
capability to be autonomous but they're

8020
02:10:21,750 --> 02:10:21,760
capability to be autonomous but they're
 

8021
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:24,310
capability to be autonomous but they're
usually remotely controlled they're used

8022
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:24,320
usually remotely controlled they're used
 

8023
02:10:24,320 --> 02:10:26,470
usually remotely controlled they're used
for reconnaissance but they're also used

8024
02:10:26,470 --> 02:10:26,480
for reconnaissance but they're also used
 

8025
02:10:26,480 --> 02:10:28,470
for reconnaissance but they're also used
by the ukraine side for reconnaissance

8026
02:10:28,470 --> 02:10:28,480
by the ukraine side for reconnaissance
 

8027
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,189
by the ukraine side for reconnaissance
and

8028
02:10:29,189 --> 02:10:29,199
and
 

8029
02:10:29,199 --> 02:10:30,550
and
i think um

8030
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,560
i think um
 

8031
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,390
i think um
also to destroy

8032
02:10:32,390 --> 02:10:32,400
also to destroy
 

8033
02:10:32,400 --> 02:10:34,229
also to destroy
different technology tanks and so on

8034
02:10:34,229 --> 02:10:34,239
different technology tanks and so on
 

8035
02:10:34,239 --> 02:10:35,830
different technology tanks and so on
different targets like this

8036
02:10:35,830 --> 02:10:35,840
different targets like this
 

8037
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:37,750
different targets like this
uh so there's also on the on the russian

8038
02:10:37,750 --> 02:10:37,760
uh so there's also on the on the russian
 

8039
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:39,910
uh so there's also on the on the russian
side the the orlan 10

8040
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:39,920
side the the orlan 10
 

8041
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:42,390
side the the orlan 10
there's the the fighter jets

8042
02:10:42,390 --> 02:10:42,400
there's the the fighter jets
 

8043
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,510
there's the the fighter jets
uh mig-29 the ukraine side and the su-25

8044
02:10:45,510 --> 02:10:45,520
uh mig-29 the ukraine side and the su-25
 

8045
02:10:45,520 --> 02:10:46,950
uh mig-29 the ukraine side and the su-25
and the russian side is there anything

8046
02:10:46,950 --> 02:10:46,960
and the russian side is there anything
 

8047
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:48,390
and the russian side is there anything
kind of stands out to you about this

8048
02:10:48,390 --> 02:10:48,400
kind of stands out to you about this
 

8049
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:49,669

02:11:48,800 --> 02:11:51,669
um
what happens if that is more widespread

8112
02:11:51,669 --> 02:11:51,679
what happens if that is more widespread
 

8113
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:53,750
what happens if that is more widespread
right like what if we were creating our

8114
02:11:53,750 --> 02:11:53,760
right like what if we were creating our
 

8115
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:55,109
right like what if we were creating our
own drones and they were being used

8116
02:11:55,109 --> 02:11:55,119
own drones and they were being used
 

8117
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:56,709
own drones and they were being used
against us would we want to have some

8118
02:11:56,709 --> 02:11:56,719
against us would we want to have some
 

8119
02:11:56,719 --> 02:11:58,149
against us would we want to have some
type of kill switch or something like

8120
02:11:58,149 --> 02:11:58,159
type of kill switch or something like
 

8121
02:11:58,159 --> 02:11:59,510
type of kill switch or something like
that right so

8122
02:11:59,510 --> 02:11:59,520
that right so
 

8123
02:11:59,520 --> 02:12:00,629
that right so
what i think governments are going to

8124
02:12:00,629 --> 02:12:00,639

8126
02:12:02,470 --> 02:12:02,480
have to consider like all these tools
 

8127
02:12:02,480 --> 02:12:04,709
have to consider like all these tools
that are going to be easily available to

8128
02:12:04,709 --> 02:12:04,719
that are going to be easily available to
 

8129
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:07,189
that are going to be easily available to
just any person could be turned into a

especially as we look at you know 10
years from now when we have a large

8138
02:12:13,830 --> 02:12:13,840
years from now when we have a large
 

8139
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:15,750
years from now when we have a large
number of autonomous uavs delivering

8140

our country and any one of those could
be potentially a weapon if we don't have

02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:40,320
think there will always be war in the
 

8273
02:14:40,320 --> 02:14:43,350
think there will always be war in the
world

8274
02:14:43,350 --> 02:14:43,360

 

8275
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:50,229

is this just a part of human nature

8276
02:14:50,229 --> 02:14:50,239

 

8277
02:14:50,239 --> 02:14:51,350

i think so

8278
02:14:51,350 --> 02:14:51,360
i think so
 

8279
02:14:51,360 --> 02:14:54,390
i think so
i think i think it is uh

8280
02:14:54,390 --> 02:14:54,400
i think i think it is uh
 

8281
02:14:54,400 --> 02:14:57,109
i think i think it is uh
until we until we move past resource

8282
02:14:57,109 --> 02:14:57,119
until we until we move past resource
 

8283
02:14:57,119 --> 02:14:59,350
until we until we move past resource
limitation

8284
02:14:59,350 --> 02:14:59,360
limitation
 

8285
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:01,109
limitation
there's always going to be at least that

8286
02:15:01,109 --> 02:15:01,119
there's always going to be at least that
 

8287
02:15:01,119 --> 02:15:03,910
there's always going to be at least that
one particular cause

8288
02:15:03,910 --> 02:15:03,920
one particular cause
 

8289
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:06,229
one particular cause
of conflict

8290
02:15:06,229 --> 02:15:06,239
of conflict
 

8291
02:15:06,239 --> 02:15:08,069
of conflict
and then we can also consider all our

8292
02:15:08,069 --> 02:15:08,079
and then we can also consider all our
 

8293
02:15:08,079 --> 02:15:10,069
and then we can also consider all our
psychological

8294
02:15:10,069 --> 02:15:10,079
psychological
 

8295
02:15:10,079 --> 02:15:14,149
psychological
lizard brain emotions that cause us to

8296
02:15:14,149 --> 02:15:14,159
lizard brain emotions that cause us to
 

8297
02:15:14,159 --> 02:15:16,629
lizard brain emotions that cause us to
act out although you know we're

8298
02:15:16,629 --> 02:15:16,639
act out although you know we're
 

8299
02:15:16,639 --> 02:15:18,629
act out although you know we're
hopefully we have enough things in place

8300
02:15:18,629 --> 02:15:18,639
hopefully we have enough things in place
 

8301
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:20,069
hopefully we have enough things in place
to stop that from

8302
02:15:20,069 --> 02:15:20,079
to stop that from
 

8303
02:15:20,079 --> 02:15:22,390
to stop that from
rising to the level of war but you know

8304
02:15:22,390 --> 02:15:22,400
rising to the level of war but you know
 

8305
02:15:22,400 --> 02:15:23,430
rising to the level of war but you know
we have our own biology our own

8306
02:15:23,430 --> 02:15:23,440
we have our own biology our own
 

8307
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:25,750
we have our own biology our own
psychology and evolution to combat

8308
02:15:25,750 --> 02:15:25,760
psychology and evolution to combat
 

8309
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:27,669
psychology and evolution to combat
um and then but there are pragmatic

8310
02:15:27,669 --> 02:15:27,679
um and then but there are pragmatic
 

8311
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:29,669
um and then but there are pragmatic
reasons to exert violence sometimes

8312
02:15:29,669 --> 02:15:29,679
reasons to exert violence sometimes
 

8313
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:31,109
reasons to exert violence sometimes
unfortunately and that one of those

8314
02:15:31,109 --> 02:15:31,119
unfortunately and that one of those
 

8315
02:15:31,119 --> 02:15:33,430
unfortunately and that one of those
cases could be resource limitations and

8316
02:15:33,430 --> 02:15:33,440
cases could be resource limitations and
 

8317
02:15:33,440 --> 02:15:34,870
cases could be resource limitations and
so while your question was do i think

8318
02:15:34,870 --> 02:15:34,880
so while your question was do i think
 

8319
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:37,189
so while your question was do i think
there'll always be war in this world i

8320
02:15:37,189 --> 02:15:37,199
there'll always be war in this world i
 

8321
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,910
there'll always be war in this world i
my unfortunate answer is perhaps yes but

8322
02:15:39,910 --> 02:15:39,920
my unfortunate answer is perhaps yes but
 

8323
02:15:39,920 --> 02:15:41,510
my unfortunate answer is perhaps yes but
once there's more than one world then

8324
02:15:41,510 --> 02:15:41,520
once there's more than one world then
 

8325
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:43,030
once there's more than one world then
we're less resource constrained then

8326
02:15:43,030 --> 02:15:43,040
we're less resource constrained then
 

8327
02:15:43,040 --> 02:15:45,270
we're less resource constrained then
perhaps it'll be a valve of sorts for

8328
02:15:45,270 --> 02:15:45,280
perhaps it'll be a valve of sorts for
 

8329
02:15:45,280 --> 02:15:47,030
perhaps it'll be a valve of sorts for
that

8330
02:15:47,030 --> 02:15:47,040
that
 

8331
02:15:47,040 --> 02:15:48,950
that
i talked to

8332
02:15:48,950 --> 02:15:48,960
i talked to
 

8333
02:15:48,960 --> 02:15:51,990
i talked to
joko on this podcast i i i told him

8334
02:15:51,990 --> 02:15:52,000
joko on this podcast i i i told him
 

8335
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:53,350
joko on this podcast i i i told him
about a song

8336
02:15:53,350 --> 02:15:53,360
about a song
 

8337
02:15:53,360 --> 02:15:55,350
about a song
called brothers in arms

8338
02:15:55,350 --> 02:15:55,360
called brothers in arms
 

8339
02:15:55,360 --> 02:15:57,910
called brothers in arms
by dire straits

8340
02:15:57,910 --> 02:15:57,920
by dire straits
 

8341
02:15:57,920 --> 02:15:59,669
by dire straits
and uh the question i asked them i'd

8342
02:15:59,669 --> 02:15:59,679
and uh the question i asked them i'd
 

8343
02:15:59,679 --> 02:16:03,270
and uh the question i asked them i'd
like to ask you the same question is

8344
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:03,280
like to ask you the same question is
 

8345
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:04,870
like to ask you the same question is
like the song goes

8346
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:04,880
like the song goes
 

8347
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:07,109
like the song goes
do you think we're fools to wage war and

8348
02:16:07,109 --> 02:16:07,119
do you think we're fools to wage war and
 

8349
02:16:07,119 --> 02:16:09,109
do you think we're fools to wage war and
our brothers in arms

8350
02:16:09,109 --> 02:16:09,119
our brothers in arms
 

8351
02:16:09,119 --> 02:16:11,910
our brothers in arms
and jacob said

8352
02:16:11,910 --> 02:16:11,920
and jacob said
 

8353
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:13,990
and jacob said
our enemy is not our brothers and arms

8354
02:16:13,990 --> 02:16:14,000
our enemy is not our brothers and arms
 

8355
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:16,709
our enemy is not our brothers and arms
they're the enemy

8356
02:16:16,709 --> 02:16:16,719
they're the enemy
 

8357
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:19,350
they're the enemy
and so this kind of notion that we're

8358
02:16:19,350 --> 02:16:19,360
and so this kind of notion that we're
 

8359
02:16:19,360 --> 02:16:21,109
and so this kind of notion that we're
all human

8360
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:21,119
all human
 

8361
02:16:21,119 --> 02:16:23,750
all human
that's a notion that's a luxury you can

8362
02:16:23,750 --> 02:16:23,760
that's a notion that's a luxury you can
 

8363
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:24,950
that's a notion that's a luxury you can
have

8364
02:16:24,950 --> 02:16:24,960
have
 

8365
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:26,310
have
but there is

8366
02:16:26,310 --> 02:16:26,320
but there is
 

8367
02:16:26,320 --> 02:16:28,390
but there is
good and bad in this world according to

8368
02:16:28,390 --> 02:16:28,400
good and bad in this world according to
 

8369
02:16:28,400 --> 02:16:29,510
good and bad in this world according to
jocko

8370
02:16:29,510 --> 02:16:29,520
jocko
 

8371
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:31,350
jocko
i hear that

8372
02:16:31,350 --> 02:16:31,360
i hear that
 

8373
02:16:31,360 --> 02:16:33,750
i hear that
anger and hate when i

8374
02:16:33,750 --> 02:16:33,760
anger and hate when i
 

8375
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:36,790
anger and hate when i
was in ukraine among some people

8376
02:16:36,790 --> 02:16:36,800
was in ukraine among some people
 

8377
02:16:36,800 --> 02:16:39,830
was in ukraine among some people
were

8378
02:16:39,830 --> 02:16:39,840

 

8379
02:16:39,840 --> 02:16:41,270

there was a sense where you could be

8380
02:16:41,270 --> 02:16:41,280
there was a sense where you could be
 

8381
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:43,190
there was a sense where you could be
brothers and sisters you can have family

8382
02:16:43,190 --> 02:16:43,200
brothers and sisters you can have family
 

8383
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,950
brothers and sisters you can have family
you can have love

8384
02:16:44,950 --> 02:16:44,960
you can have love
 

8385
02:16:44,960 --> 02:16:45,669
you can have love
for

8386
02:16:45,669 --> 02:16:45,679
for
 

8387
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:47,589
for
from ukraine to russia

8388
02:16:47,589 --> 02:16:47,599
from ukraine to russia
 

8389
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:51,110
from ukraine to russia
um but now that everything changed and

8390
02:16:51,110 --> 02:16:51,120
um but now that everything changed and
 

8391
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:53,509
um but now that everything changed and
generational hate for some people have

8392
02:16:53,509 --> 02:16:53,519
generational hate for some people have
 

8393
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:54,790
generational hate for some people have
taken over

8394
02:16:54,790 --> 02:16:54,800
taken over
 

8395
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:57,349
taken over
so i guess the question is um

8396
02:16:57,349 --> 02:16:57,359
so i guess the question is um
 

8397
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:00,469
so i guess the question is um
when you think about the enemy

8398
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:00,479
when you think about the enemy
 

8399
02:17:00,479 --> 02:17:02,950
when you think about the enemy
is there hate there to acknowledge that

8400
02:17:02,950 --> 02:17:02,960
is there hate there to acknowledge that
 

8401
02:17:02,960 --> 02:17:04,230
is there hate there to acknowledge that
they're human

8402
02:17:04,230 --> 02:17:04,240
they're human
 

8403
02:17:04,240 --> 02:17:06,950
they're human
i'd never had any hate or discontent

8404
02:17:06,950 --> 02:17:06,960
i'd never had any hate or discontent
 

8405
02:17:06,960 --> 02:17:09,429
i'd never had any hate or discontent
you know when i was doing my job i'll

8406
02:17:09,429 --> 02:17:09,439
you know when i was doing my job i'll
 

8407
02:17:09,439 --> 02:17:10,150
you know when i was doing my job i'll
say

8408
02:17:10,150 --> 02:17:10,160
say
 

8409
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:12,830
say
but i was also never in a true life for

8410
02:17:12,830 --> 02:17:12,840
but i was also never in a true life for
 

8411
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:15,509
but i was also never in a true life for
death situation where they were gonna

8412
02:17:15,509 --> 02:17:15,519
death situation where they were gonna
 

8413
02:17:15,519 --> 02:17:17,830
death situation where they were gonna
kill me if i didn't kill them

8414
02:17:17,830 --> 02:17:17,840
kill me if i didn't kill them
 

8415
02:17:17,840 --> 02:17:18,629
kill me if i didn't kill them
um

8416
02:17:18,629 --> 02:17:18,639
um
 

8417
02:17:18,639 --> 02:17:20,629
um
but you know i think that environment

8418
02:17:20,629 --> 02:17:20,639
but you know i think that environment
 

8419
02:17:20,639 --> 02:17:22,790
but you know i think that environment
isn't one born out of hate

8420
02:17:22,790 --> 02:17:22,800
isn't one born out of hate
 

8421
02:17:22,800 --> 02:17:25,030
isn't one born out of hate
you know being in that type of scenario

8422
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:25,040
you know being in that type of scenario
 

8423
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:27,190
you know being in that type of scenario
you know a sense how to be alive right i

8424
02:17:27,190 --> 02:17:27,200
you know a sense how to be alive right i
 

8425
02:17:27,200 --> 02:17:29,509
you know a sense how to be alive right i
mean that's the our natural state is be

8426
02:17:29,509 --> 02:17:29,519
mean that's the our natural state is be
 

8427
02:17:29,519 --> 02:17:31,750
mean that's the our natural state is be
fighting for our survival in a sense and

8428
02:17:31,750 --> 02:17:31,760
fighting for our survival in a sense and
 

8429
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:34,150
fighting for our survival in a sense and
so i think there's there's great

8430
02:17:34,150 --> 02:17:34,160
so i think there's there's great
 

8431
02:17:34,160 --> 02:17:36,309
so i think there's there's great
power and strength and clarity perhaps

8432
02:17:36,309 --> 02:17:36,319
power and strength and clarity perhaps
 

8433
02:17:36,319 --> 02:17:38,309
power and strength and clarity perhaps
in that and it's not always borne out of

8434
02:17:38,309 --> 02:17:38,319
in that and it's not always borne out of
 

8435
02:17:38,319 --> 02:17:40,150

we're both there
 

8525
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,509
we're both there
maybe because we chose to be in some

8526
02:19:17,509 --> 02:19:17,519
maybe because we chose to be in some
 

8527
02:19:17,519 --> 02:19:20,150
maybe because we chose to be in some
sense but at the behest of of someone

8528
02:19:20,150 --> 02:19:20,160
sense but at the behest of of someone
 

8529
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,070
sense but at the behest of of someone
else and outside of our control and

8530
02:19:22,070 --> 02:19:22,080
else and outside of our control and
 

8531
02:19:22,080 --> 02:19:24,790
else and outside of our control and
power and so in a sense for me

8532
02:19:24,790 --> 02:19:24,800
power and so in a sense for me
 

8533
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,150
power and so in a sense for me
it's almost a challenge that we've

8534
02:19:26,150 --> 02:19:26,160
it's almost a challenge that we've
 

8535
02:19:26,160 --> 02:19:28,629
it's almost a challenge that we've
engaged upon agreeably but that's such a

8536
02:19:28,629 --> 02:19:28,639
engaged upon agreeably but that's such a
 

8537
02:19:28,639 --> 02:19:30,709
engaged upon agreeably but that's such a
romantic version that i have the luxury

8538
02:19:30,709 --> 02:19:30,719
romantic version that i have the luxury
 

8539
02:19:30,719 --> 02:19:33,349
romantic version that i have the luxury
to have being high in my castle in the

8540
02:19:33,349 --> 02:19:33,359
to have being high in my castle in the
 

8541
02:19:33,359 --> 02:19:35,669
to have being high in my castle in the
jet up there not on the ground so i

8542
02:19:35,669 --> 02:19:35,679
jet up there not on the ground so i
 

8543
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:37,509
jet up there not on the ground so i
understand that it's a bit more romantic

8544
02:19:37,509 --> 02:19:37,519
understand that it's a bit more romantic
 

8545
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:39,750
understand that it's a bit more romantic
than perhaps

8546
02:19:39,750 --> 02:19:39,760
than perhaps
 

8547
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:40,790
than perhaps
you know someone on the ground

8548
02:19:40,790 --> 02:19:40,800
you know someone on the ground
 

8549
02:19:40,800 --> 02:19:42,629
you know someone on the ground
experiencing all the horrors down there

8550
02:19:42,629 --> 02:19:42,639
experiencing all the horrors down there
 

8551
02:19:42,639 --> 02:19:44,070
experiencing all the horrors down there
because everything looks very small from

8552
02:19:44,070 --> 02:19:44,080
because everything looks very small from
 

8553
02:19:44,080 --> 02:19:46,389
because everything looks very small from
above

above
 

8555
02:19:46,399 --> 02:19:48,790
above
and that's another aspect of war with

and that's another aspect of war with
 

8557
02:19:48,800 --> 02:19:50,870
and that's another aspect of war with
greater autonomy when you're controlling

greater autonomy when you're controlling

in something that
um

8830
02:24:32,950 --> 02:24:32,960
um
 

8831
02:24:32,960 --> 02:24:34,790

that you know just was i was involved

8832
02:24:34,790 --> 02:24:34,800

how to fill that space essentially you
 

8837
02:24:38,160 --> 02:24:39,030

overly traumatic experience i think it's
one that's not accounted for enough that

8844
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:45,200
one that's not accounted for enough that

8880
02:25:20,550 --> 02:25:20,560
about eight or nine times in the navy of
 

8881
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:23,030
about eight or nine times in the navy of
kind of what we what we wanted just

8882
02:25:23,030 --> 02:25:23,040
kind of what we what we wanted just
 

8883
02:25:23,040 --> 02:25:25,110
kind of what we what we wanted just
generally and it was all really about

8884
02:25:25,110 --> 02:25:25,120
generally and it was all really about
 

8885
02:25:25,120 --> 02:25:26,630
generally and it was all really about
the land and not about the house you

8886
02:25:26,630 --> 02:25:26,640
the land and not about the house you
 

8887
02:25:26,640 --> 02:25:28,150
the land and not about the house you
know we just wanted privacy and to be

8888
02:25:28,150 --> 02:25:28,160

nearby
 

8891
02:25:29,359 --> 02:25:31,110
nearby

02:25:31,110 --> 02:25:31,120
and so we end up finding a lot of land
 

8893

9001
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:24,870

there were times when i was in

there were times when i was in
 

9003
02:27:24,880 --> 02:27:26,550
there were times when i was in
situations that could have resulted in

02:27:26,550 --> 02:27:26,560
situations that could have resulted in
 

9005

death from from flying or from emergency
 

9007
02:27:30,319 --> 02:27:33,270
death from from flying or from emergency
in the aircraft but

9008
02:27:33,270 --> 02:27:33,280
in the aircraft but
 

9009
02:27:33,280 --> 02:27:35,270
in the aircraft but
i'll be honest i never really kind of

9010
02:27:35,270 --> 02:27:35,280
i'll be honest i never really kind of
 

9011
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:37,270
i'll be honest i never really kind of
sat down to think about the morale the

9012
02:27:37,270 --> 02:27:37,280
sat down to think about the morale the
 

9013
02:27:37,280 --> 02:27:39,750
sat down to think about the morale the
mortality of it afterwards i feel like i

9014
02:27:39,750 --> 02:27:39,760
mortality of it afterwards i feel like i
 

9015
02:27:39,760 --> 02:27:41,670
mortality of it afterwards i feel like i
kind of signed a check at the beginning

9016
02:27:41,670 --> 02:27:41,680
kind of signed a check at the beginning
 

9017
02:27:41,680 --> 02:27:43,510
kind of signed a check at the beginning
and it was my job to perform as well as

9018
02:27:43,510 --> 02:27:43,520
and it was my job to perform as well as
 

9019
02:27:43,520 --> 02:27:45,510
and it was my job to perform as well as
i could and if something happened in

9020
02:27:45,510 --> 02:27:45,520
i could and if something happened in
 

9021
02:27:45,520 --> 02:27:47,590
i could and if something happened in
that then i better damn well be sure i

9022
02:27:47,590 --> 02:27:47,600
that then i better damn well be sure i
 

9023
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,830
that then i better damn well be sure i
would do my best at the time then

9024
02:27:49,830 --> 02:27:49,840
would do my best at the time then
 

9025
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:52,630
would do my best at the time then
um so you know i i maybe didn't

9026
02:27:52,630 --> 02:27:52,640
um so you know i i maybe didn't
 

9027
02:27:52,640 --> 02:27:54,230
um so you know i i maybe didn't
personally reflect on it as much as of

9028
02:27:54,230 --> 02:27:54,240
personally reflect on it as much as of
 

9029
02:27:54,240 --> 02:27:55,590
personally reflect on it as much as of
it i

9030
02:27:55,590 --> 02:27:55,600
it i
 

9031
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,429
it i
one would think you know because once

9032
02:27:57,429 --> 02:27:57,439
one would think you know because once
 

9033
02:27:57,439 --> 02:27:59,429
one would think you know because once
you get in that machine it doesn't give

9034
02:27:59,429 --> 02:27:59,439
you get in that machine it doesn't give
 

9035
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:01,510
you get in that machine it doesn't give
you a lot of time to sit back and

9036
02:28:01,510 --> 02:28:01,520
you a lot of time to sit back and
 

9037
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:02,950
you a lot of time to sit back and
philosophize on

9038
02:28:02,950 --> 02:28:02,960
philosophize on
 

9039
02:28:02,960 --> 02:28:05,349
philosophize on
on your current situation and that same

9040
02:28:05,349 --> 02:28:05,359
on your current situation and that same
 

9041
02:28:05,359 --> 02:28:06,790
on your current situation and that same
just like we weren't seeing these off or

9042
02:28:06,790 --> 02:28:06,800
just like we weren't seeing these off or
 

9043
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:08,389
just like we weren't seeing these off or
when we seen these objects off the coast

9044
02:28:08,389 --> 02:28:08,399
when we seen these objects off the coast
 

9045
02:28:08,399 --> 02:28:09,510
when we seen these objects off the coast
we weren't necessarily you know

9046
02:28:09,510 --> 02:28:09,520
we weren't necessarily you know
 

9047
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:10,950
we weren't necessarily you know
examining them every day right we'd put

9048
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:10,960
examining them every day right we'd put
 

9049
02:28:10,960 --> 02:28:12,309
examining them every day right we'd put
him into that bucket because it wasn't

9050
02:28:12,309 --> 02:28:12,319
him into that bucket because it wasn't
 

9051
02:28:12,319 --> 02:28:13,349
him into that bucket because it wasn't
something that was going to kill us

9052
02:28:13,349 --> 02:28:13,359
something that was going to kill us
 

9053
02:28:13,359 --> 02:28:14,870
something that was going to kill us
right away

9054
02:28:14,870 --> 02:28:14,880
right away
 

9055
02:28:14,880 --> 02:28:17,190
right away
and thinking about death when you're so

9056
02:28:17,190 --> 02:28:17,200
and thinking about death when you're so
 

9057
02:28:17,200 --> 02:28:18,550
and thinking about death when you're so
close to it all the time would be

9058
02:28:18,550 --> 02:28:18,560
close to it all the time would be
 

9059
02:28:18,560 --> 02:28:20,309
close to it all the time would be
debilitating

9060
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:20,319
debilitating
 

9061
02:28:20,319 --> 02:28:21,910
debilitating
it would probably make you worse at your

9062
02:28:21,910 --> 02:28:21,920
it would probably make you worse at your
 

9063
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:24,950
it would probably make you worse at your
job it would

9064
02:28:24,950 --> 02:28:24,960

 

9065
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:26,550

well maybe you can think about death

9066
02:28:26,550 --> 02:28:26,560
well maybe you can think about death
 

9067
02:28:26,560 --> 02:28:27,830
well maybe you can think about death
when you look out when you go out into

9068
02:28:27,830 --> 02:28:27,840
when you look out when you go out into
 

9069
02:28:27,840 --> 02:28:29,750
when you look out when you go out into
nature and think like the

9070
02:28:29,750 --> 02:28:29,760
nature and think like the
 

9071
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:30,790
nature and think like the
the

9072
02:28:30,790 --> 02:28:30,800
the
 

9073
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:32,950
the
the fact that this whole ride ends this

9074
02:28:32,950 --> 02:28:32,960
the fact that this whole ride ends this
 

9075
02:28:32,960 --> 02:28:35,590
the fact that this whole ride ends this
is such a weird thing and the the old

9076
02:28:35,590 --> 02:28:35,600
is such a weird thing and the the old
 

9077
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:37,670
is such a weird thing and the the old
makes way to new

9078
02:28:37,670 --> 02:28:37,680
makes way to new
 

9079
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:39,349
makes way to new
and that's all throughout nature and if

9080
02:28:39,349 --> 02:28:39,359
and that's all throughout nature and if
 

9081
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:41,110
and that's all throughout nature and if
you just look at the the cruelty of

9082
02:28:41,110 --> 02:28:41,120
you just look at the the cruelty of
 

9083
02:28:41,120 --> 02:28:43,270
you just look at the the cruelty of
nature or the beauty of nature however

9084
02:28:43,270 --> 02:28:43,280
nature or the beauty of nature however
 

9085
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:45,670
nature or the beauty of nature however
you think about it the the fact that the

9086
02:28:45,670 --> 02:28:45,680
you think about it the the fact that the
 

9087
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,190
you think about it the the fact that the
the big thing eats the little thing

9088
02:28:49,190 --> 02:28:49,200
the big thing eats the little thing
 

9089
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:50,870
the big thing eats the little thing
over and over

9090
02:28:50,870 --> 02:28:50,880
over and over
 

9091
02:28:50,880 --> 02:28:53,349
over and over
um and that's just how it progresses and

9092
02:28:53,349 --> 02:28:53,359
um and that's just how it progresses and
 

9093
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:55,510
um and that's just how it progresses and
that's how adaptation happens

9094
02:28:55,510 --> 02:28:55,520
that's how adaptation happens
 

9095
02:28:55,520 --> 02:28:57,750
that's how adaptation happens
death is a requirement for

9096
02:28:57,750 --> 02:28:57,760
death is a requirement for
 

9097
02:28:57,760 --> 02:28:59,429
death is a requirement for
uh evolution

9098
02:28:59,429 --> 02:28:59,439
uh evolution
 

9099
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:00,790
uh evolution
and you know

9100
02:29:00,790 --> 02:29:00,800
and you know
 

9101
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,630
and you know
whether evolution allows us to see

9102
02:29:02,630 --> 02:29:02,640
whether evolution allows us to see
 

9103
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:04,710
whether evolution allows us to see
objective reality or not

9104
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:04,720
objective reality or not
 

9105
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:06,070
objective reality or not
it still gives you some interesting

9106
02:29:06,070 --> 02:29:06,080
it still gives you some interesting
 

9107
02:29:06,080 --> 02:29:08,710
it still gives you some interesting
thoughts about perspectives of death and

9108
02:29:08,710 --> 02:29:08,720
thoughts about perspectives of death and
 

9109
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:11,030
thoughts about perspectives of death and
especially concerning it's a biological

9110
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:11,040
especially concerning it's a biological
 

9111
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:12,389
especially concerning it's a biological
necessity as far as evolution is

9112
02:29:12,389 --> 02:29:12,399
necessity as far as evolution is
 

9113
02:29:12,399 --> 02:29:13,590
necessity as far as evolution is
concerned

9114
02:29:13,590 --> 02:29:13,600
concerned
 

9115
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:16,389
concerned
yeah it's weird it's weird that uh

9116
02:29:16,389 --> 02:29:16,399
yeah it's weird it's weird that uh
 

9117
02:29:16,399 --> 02:29:18,150
yeah it's weird it's weird that uh
there's been like a hundred billion

9118
02:29:18,150 --> 02:29:18,160
there's been like a hundred billion
 

9119
02:29:18,160 --> 02:29:20,309
there's been like a hundred billion
people that lived before us

9120
02:29:20,309 --> 02:29:20,319
people that lived before us
 

9121
02:29:20,319 --> 02:29:21,990
people that lived before us
and that you and i will be forgotten

9122
02:29:21,990 --> 02:29:22,000
and that you and i will be forgotten

this whole thing we're doing right now

9124
02:29:23,830 --> 02:29:23,840
this whole thing we're doing right now
 

9125
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:26,230
this whole thing we're doing right now
is meaningless in that sense but at the

9126
02:29:26,230 --> 02:29:26,240
is meaningless in that sense but at the
 

9127
02:29:26,240 --> 02:29:27,990
is meaningless in that sense but at the
same time it feels deeply meaningful

9128
02:29:27,990 --> 02:29:28,000
same time it feels deeply meaningful
 

9129
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:29,349
same time it feels deeply meaningful
somehow

9130
02:29:29,349 --> 02:29:29,359
somehow
 

9131
02:29:29,359 --> 02:29:30,870
somehow
um

9132
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:30,880
um
 

9133
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:32,389
um
i guess that that's the question i want

9134
02:29:32,389 --> 02:29:32,399
i guess that that's the question i want
 

9135
02:29:32,399 --> 02:29:35,190
i guess that that's the question i want
to ask when you go out to nature

9136
02:29:35,190 --> 02:29:35,200
to ask when you go out to nature
 

9137
02:29:35,200 --> 02:29:37,030
to ask when you go out to nature

what do you think is the meaning of it

9140
02:29:38,230 --> 02:29:38,240
what do you think is the meaning of it
 

9141
02:29:38,240 --> 02:29:42,150
what do you think is the meaning of it
all what's the meaning of life

9143
02:29:42,160 --> 02:29:43,590

or maybe when you put on the night

9144
02:29:43,590 --> 02:29:43,600
or maybe when you put on the night
 

9145
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:45,750
or maybe when you put on the night
goggles the the night vision goggles and

everyone but
 

9153
02:29:52,880 --> 02:29:55,429
everyone but
at least the way i interpret it you know

9154

is just to be

9160
02:30:01,750 --> 02:30:01,760
is just to be
 

9161
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,349
is just to be
curious about the environment in a

i think that the human mind

9168
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:09,760
i think that the human mind
 

9169
02:30:09,760 --> 02:30:11,910
i think that the human mind
whether it's just the mass inside our

9170

whether it's just the mass inside our
 

9171
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:14,150
whether it's just the mass inside our
skull or you know whether there's some

9172
02:30:14,150 --> 02:30:14,160
skull or you know whether there's some
 

9173
02:30:14,160 --> 02:30:16,469
skull or you know whether there's some
type of quantum interactions going on

9174
02:30:16,469 --> 02:30:16,479
type of quantum interactions going on
 

9175
02:30:16,479 --> 02:30:18,389
type of quantum interactions going on
her mind is an incredible has incredible

ability to output new information
in

9180
02:30:22,230 --> 02:30:22,240
in
 

9181
02:30:22,240 --> 02:30:23,910
in
in a universe that

9182
02:30:23,910 --> 02:30:23,920
in a universe that
 

9183
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:25,990
in a universe that
you know somewhat stale of information

9184
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:26,000
you know somewhat stale of information
 

9185
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,550
you know somewhat stale of information
right um our our minds are and some

9186
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
right um our our minds are and some
 

9187
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:30,790
right um our our minds are and some
somewhat unique in that we can imagine

9188
02:30:30,790 --> 02:30:30,800
somewhat unique in that we can imagine
 

9189
02:30:30,800 --> 02:30:32,710
somewhat unique in that we can imagine
and perceive things that could never

9190
02:30:32,710 --> 02:30:32,720
and perceive things that could never
 

9191
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:35,030
and perceive things that could never
ever have possibly naturally occurred

9192
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:35,040
ever have possibly naturally occurred
 

9193
02:30:35,040 --> 02:30:36,950
ever have possibly naturally occurred
and yet we can make it happen we can

9194
02:30:36,950 --> 02:30:36,960
and yet we can make it happen we can
 

9195
02:30:36,960 --> 02:30:38,790
and yet we can make it happen we can
substantiate that with enough belief

9196
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:38,800
substantiate that with enough belief
 

9197
02:30:38,800 --> 02:30:40,710
substantiate that with enough belief
that it's true and it can happen

9198
02:30:40,710 --> 02:30:40,720
that it's true and it can happen
 

9199
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:42,389
that it's true and it can happen
and so for me

9200
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:42,399
and so for me
 

9201
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:44,070
and so for me
i feel like i just need to encourage

9202
02:30:44,070 --> 02:30:44,080
i feel like i just need to encourage
 

9203
02:30:44,080 --> 02:30:46,550
i feel like i just need to encourage
that to encourage you know interaction

9204
02:30:46,550 --> 02:30:46,560
that to encourage you know interaction
 

9205
02:30:46,560 --> 02:30:48,469
that to encourage you know interaction
with reality such that it leads us to

9206
02:30:48,469 --> 02:30:48,479
with reality such that it leads us to
 

9207
02:30:48,479 --> 02:30:50,630
with reality such that it leads us to
newer and grander you know interactions

9208
02:30:50,630 --> 02:30:50,640
newer and grander you know interactions
 

9209
02:30:50,640 --> 02:30:52,469
newer and grander you know interactions
with this universe

9210
02:30:52,469 --> 02:30:52,479
with this universe
 

9211
02:30:52,479 --> 02:30:54,469
with this universe
and all that starts with a little bit of

9212
02:30:54,469 --> 02:30:54,479
and all that starts with a little bit of
 

9213
02:30:54,479 --> 02:30:56,870
and all that starts with a little bit of
curiosity exactly

9214
02:30:56,870 --> 02:30:56,880
curiosity exactly
 

9215
02:30:56,880 --> 02:30:58,870
curiosity exactly
