00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:28,630
mathematics
i love

24
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,640
i love
 

25
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,470
i love
a mathematics that some people don't

26
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:30,480
a mathematics that some people don't
 

27
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,910
a mathematics that some people don't
even think of as mathematics which is

28
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:33,920
even think of as mathematics which is
 

29
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,630
even think of as mathematics which is
beautiful creative

30
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,640
beautiful creative
 

31
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,709
beautiful creative
mathematics where we look at maths in

32
00:00:38,709 --> 00:00:38,719
mathematics where we look at maths in
 

33
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,110
mathematics where we look at maths in
different ways we visualize it

34
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:41,120
different ways we visualize it
 

35
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,549
different ways we visualize it
we think about

36
00:00:42,549 --> 00:00:42,559
we think about
 

37
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,869
we think about
different solutions to problems a lot of

38
00:00:44,869 --> 00:00:44,879
different solutions to problems a lot of
 

39
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,869
different solutions to problems a lot of
people think of maths as

40
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:46,879
people think of maths as
 

41
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,510
people think of maths as
you have one method and one answer

42
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:49,520
you have one method and one answer
 

43
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,430
you have one method and one answer
and what i love about maths is the

44
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:51,440
and what i love about maths is the
 

45
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,950
and what i love about maths is the
multiple different ways you can see

46
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:52,960
multiple different ways you can see
 

47
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,910
multiple different ways you can see
things

48
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:53,920
things
 

49
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,430
things
different methods different ways of

50
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:55,440
different methods different ways of
 

51
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,709
different methods different ways of
seeing different

52
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
seeing different
 

53
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,110
seeing different
in some cases different solutions

54
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,120
in some cases different solutions
 

55
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,189
in some cases different solutions
so that is what is beautiful to me about

56
00:01:01,189 --> 00:01:01,199
so that is what is beautiful to me about
 

57
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,830
so that is what is beautiful to me about
mathematics that you can see and solve

58
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:03,840
mathematics that you can see and solve
 

59
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,549
mathematics that you can see and solve
it

60
00:01:04,549 --> 00:01:04,559
it
 

61
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,789
it
in many different ways and

62
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:06,799
in many different ways and
 

63
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,830
in many different ways and
also the sad part that many people think

64
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:09,840
also the sad part that many people think
 

65
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,670
also the sad part that many people think
that maths is just

66
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:11,680
that maths is just
 

67
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,670
that maths is just
one answer and one method

68
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,680
one answer and one method
 

69
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,670
one answer and one method
so to you the beautiful the beauty

70
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:15,680
so to you the beautiful the beauty
 

71
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,910
so to you the beautiful the beauty
emerges when you have a problem with a

72
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:17,920
emerges when you have a problem with a
 

73
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,990
emerges when you have a problem with a
solution and you start adding other

74
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,000
solution and you start adding other
 

75
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,109
solution and you start adding other
solutions

76
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:21,119
solutions
 

77
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,510
solutions
simpler solutions

78
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:23,520
simpler solutions
 

79
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,590
simpler solutions
weirder solutions more interesting some

80
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:25,600
weirder solutions more interesting some
 

81
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,070
weirder solutions more interesting some
of their visual some of their algebraic

82
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,080
of their visual some of their algebraic
 

83
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,630
of their visual some of their algebraic
geometry all that kind of stuff yeah i

84
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:30,640
geometry all that kind of stuff yeah i
 

85
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,870
geometry all that kind of stuff yeah i
mean i i always say that you can take

86
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:32,880
mean i i always say that you can take
 

87
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,270
mean i i always say that you can take
any maths area and make it visual

88
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:35,280
any maths area and make it visual
 

89
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,510
any maths area and make it visual
and we say to teachers give us your most

90
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:37,520
and we say to teachers give us your most
 

91
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,270
and we say to teachers give us your most
dry boring

92
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,280
dry boring
 

93
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,670
dry boring
maths and we'll make it a visual

94
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:41,680
maths and we'll make it a visual
 

95
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,910
maths and we'll make it a visual
interesting creative problem and

96
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:43,920
interesting creative problem and
 

97
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,590
interesting creative problem and
turns out you can do that with any area

98
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:45,600
turns out you can do that with any area
 

99
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,789
turns out you can do that with any area
of maths

100
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:46,799
of maths
 

101
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,190
of maths
and i think we've given

102
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,200
and i think we've given
 

103
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,190
and i think we've given
p it's been a great disservice to kids

104
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,200
p it's been a great disservice to kids
 

105
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,230
p it's been a great disservice to kids
and others that it's always been numbers

106
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,240
and others that it's always been numbers
 

107
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,069
and others that it's always been numbers
lots and lots of numbers

108
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:56,079
lots and lots of numbers
 

109
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:57,749
lots and lots of numbers
numbers can be great but you can think

110
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:57,759
numbers can be great but you can think
 

111
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,149
numbers can be great but you can think
about maths in other ways besides

112
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:00,159
about maths in other ways besides
 

113
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,310
about maths in other ways besides
numbers do you find that

114
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:02,320
numbers do you find that
 

115
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,950
numbers do you find that
most people are better visual learners

116
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:04,960
most people are better visual learners
 

117
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,469
most people are better visual learners
or is this just something that's

118
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:06,479
or is this just something that's
 

119
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,630
or is this just something that's
complementary

120
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:08,640
complementary
 

121
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,550
complementary
what's the kind of the full spectrum of

122
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
what's the kind of the full spectrum of
 

123
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,309
what's the kind of the full spectrum of
students in the way they like to explore

124
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:12,319
students in the way they like to explore
 

125
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,390
students in the way they like to explore
math would you say there's definitely

126
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:14,400
math would you say there's definitely
 

127
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,430
math would you say there's definitely
people who come into the classes i do

128
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:17,440
people who come into the classes i do
 

129
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,110
people who come into the classes i do
who are more interested in visual

130
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:19,120
who are more interested in visual
 

131
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,990
who are more interested in visual
thinking and like visual approaches but

132
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,000
thinking and like visual approaches but
 

133
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,070
thinking and like visual approaches but
it turns out what the neuroscience is

134
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,080
it turns out what the neuroscience is
 

135
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,150
it turns out what the neuroscience is
telling us is that when we think about

136
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,160
telling us is that when we think about
 

137
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,550
telling us is that when we think about
maths there are two visual pathways in

138
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:28,560
maths there are two visual pathways in
 

139
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,070
maths there are two visual pathways in
the brain and

140
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:30,080
the brain and
 

141
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,430
the brain and
we should all be thinking about it

142
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:31,440
we should all be thinking about it
 

143
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,790
we should all be thinking about it
visually

144
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:32,800
visually
 

145
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,630
visually
some approaches have been to say well

146
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:34,640
some approaches have been to say well
 

147
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,390
some approaches have been to say well
you're a visual learner so we'll give

148
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:36,400
you're a visual learner so we'll give
 

149
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,869
you're a visual learner so we'll give
you visuals and you're

150
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:38,879
you visuals and you're
 

151
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,589
you visuals and you're
not a visual learner but

152
00:02:41,589 --> 00:02:41,599
not a visual learner but
 

153
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,150
not a visual learner but
actually if you think you're not a

154
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,160
actually if you think you're not a
 

155
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,830
actually if you think you're not a
visual learner it's probably more

156
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
visual learner it's probably more
 

157
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,509
visual learner it's probably more
important that you have a visual

158
00:02:47,509 --> 00:02:47,519
important that you have a visual
 

159
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,790
important that you have a visual
approach

160
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:48,800
approach
 

161
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,710
approach
so you can develop that part of your

162
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:50,720
so you can develop that part of your
 

163
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,390
so you can develop that part of your
brain so you were saying that there's

164
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
brain so you were saying that there's
 

165
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,390
brain so you were saying that there's
some kind of interconnected aspect to it

166
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:54,400
some kind of interconnected aspect to it
 

167
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,750
some kind of interconnected aspect to it
so the visual connects with the

168
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:55,760
so the visual connects with the
 

169
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,149
so the visual connects with the
non-visual yeah so this is what the

170
00:02:58,149 --> 00:02:58,159
non-visual yeah so this is what the
 

171
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,070
non-visual yeah so this is what the
neuroscience has shown us that when you

172
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,080
neuroscience has shown us that when you
 

173
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,589
neuroscience has shown us that when you
work on a maths problem there are five

174
00:03:01,589 --> 00:03:01,599
work on a maths problem there are five
 

175
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,350
work on a maths problem there are five
different brain pathways

176
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:03,360
different brain pathways
 

177
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,030
different brain pathways
and that the most

178
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:05,040
and that the most
 

179
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,790
and that the most
high achieving people in the world are

180
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:06,800
high achieving people in the world are
 

181
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,790
high achieving people in the world are
people who have more connections between

182
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
people who have more connections between
 

183
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,470
people who have more connections between
these pathways

184
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:10,480
these pathways
 

185
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,710
these pathways
so if you see a maths problem with

186
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:12,720
so if you see a maths problem with
 

187
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,750
so if you see a maths problem with
numbers but you also see it visually

188
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:15,760
numbers but you also see it visually
 

189
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,270
numbers but you also see it visually
that will cause a connection to happen

190
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:17,280
that will cause a connection to happen
 

191
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,750
that will cause a connection to happen
in your brain between these pathways

192
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:19,760
in your brain between these pathways
 

193
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,509
in your brain between these pathways
and if you maybe write about it with

194
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:21,519
and if you maybe write about it with
 

195
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,790
and if you maybe write about it with
words that would cause another

196
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:22,800
words that would cause another
 

197
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,270
words that would cause another
connection or maybe you build it with

198
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:25,280
connection or maybe you build it with
 

199
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,949
connection or maybe you build it with
something physical that would cause a

200
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
something physical that would cause a
 

201
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,309
something physical that would cause a
different connection

202
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:28,319
different connection
 

203
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,190
different connection
and

204
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:29,200
and
 

205
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,589
and
what we want for kids is we call it a

206
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:31,599
what we want for kids is we call it a
 

207
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,589
what we want for kids is we call it a
multi-dimensional experience of math

208
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:33,599
multi-dimensional experience of math
 

209
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,229
multi-dimensional experience of math
seeing it in different ways experiencing

210
00:03:36,229 --> 00:03:36,239
seeing it in different ways experiencing
 

211
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,750
seeing it in different ways experiencing
it in different ways

212
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:37,760
it in different ways
 

213
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,830
it in different ways
that will cause that great connected

214
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:39,840
that will cause that great connected
 

215
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,710
that will cause that great connected
brain

216
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:40,720
brain
 

217
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,990
brain
you know there's these stories of

218
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:42,000
you know there's these stories of
 

219
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,589
you know there's these stories of
physicists doing the same i find

220
00:03:43,589 --> 00:03:43,599
physicists doing the same i find
 

221
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,750
physicists doing the same i find
physicists are often better at

222
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:45,760
physicists are often better at
 

223
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,589
physicists are often better at
building that part of their brain of

224
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:47,599
building that part of their brain of
 

225
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,670
building that part of their brain of
using visualization for intuition

226
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:49,680
using visualization for intuition
 

227
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,990
using visualization for intuition
building because you ultimately want to

228
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:52,000
building because you ultimately want to
 

229
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,830
building because you ultimately want to
understand

230
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
understand
 

231
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,309
understand
the like the deepest secret underneath

232
00:03:56,309 --> 00:03:56,319
the like the deepest secret underneath
 

233
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,309
the like the deepest secret underneath
this problem and for that you have to

234
00:03:58,309 --> 00:03:58,319
this problem and for that you have to
 

235
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,309
this problem and for that you have to
intuit your way there yeah and you you

236
00:04:00,309 --> 00:04:00,319
intuit your way there yeah and you you
 

237
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,390
intuit your way there yeah and you you
mentioned offline that um one of the

238
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:02,400
mentioned offline that um one of the
 

239
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,830
mentioned offline that um one of the
ways you might approach a problem is to

240
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:03,840
ways you might approach a problem is to
 

241
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,750
ways you might approach a problem is to
try to tell a story about it

242
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:05,760
try to tell a story about it
 

243
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,710
try to tell a story about it
and some of it is like legend but i'm

244
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:08,720
and some of it is like legend but i'm
 

245
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,949
and some of it is like legend but i'm
sure it's not always is you know you

246
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
sure it's not always is you know you
 

247
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,470
sure it's not always is you know you
have einstein

248
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:12,480
have einstein
 

249
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,789
have einstein
uh thinking about a train

250
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799
uh thinking about a train
 

251
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,189
uh thinking about a train
you know and the speed of light and you

252
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:17,199
you know and the speed of light and you
 

253
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:19,590
you know and the speed of light and you
know that kind of intuition is useful

254
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:19,600
know that kind of intuition is useful
 

255
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,909
know that kind of intuition is useful
yeah you start to like imagine

256
00:04:21,909 --> 00:04:21,919
yeah you start to like imagine
 

257
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:23,909
yeah you start to like imagine
a physical world like how does

258
00:04:23,909 --> 00:04:23,919
a physical world like how does
 

259
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,510
a physical world like how does
this idea manifest itself in the

260
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,520
this idea manifest itself in the
 

261
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,030
this idea manifest itself in the
physical world and then start playing in

262
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
physical world and then start playing in
 

263
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,870
physical world and then start playing in
your mind with that physical world and

264
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:28,880
your mind with that physical world and
 

265
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,390
your mind with that physical world and
think is this going to be true is this

266
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
think is this going to be true is this
 

267
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,230
think is this going to be true is this
going to be true right

268
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:32,240
going to be true right
 

269
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,629
going to be true right
einstein is well known for thinking

270
00:04:34,629 --> 00:04:34,639
einstein is well known for thinking
 

271
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:35,749
einstein is well known for thinking
visually

272
00:04:35,749 --> 00:04:35,759
visually
 

273
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:36,710
visually
and

274
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:36,720
and
 

275
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,189
and
people talk about how he really didn't

276
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:39,199
people talk about how he really didn't
 

277
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,350
people talk about how he really didn't
want to go anywhere with problems

278
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
want to go anywhere with problems
 

279
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,590
want to go anywhere with problems
without thinking about them visually but

280
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
without thinking about them visually but
 

281
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,189
without thinking about them visually but
the other thing you mentioned that

282
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:45,199
the other thing you mentioned that
 

283
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,030
the other thing you mentioned that
sparked something for me is

284
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,040
sparked something for me is
 

285
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,110
sparked something for me is
thinking with intuition like having

286
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,120
thinking with intuition like having
 

287
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,270
thinking with intuition like having
intuition about maths problems

288
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,280
intuition about maths problems
 

289
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,110
intuition about maths problems
that's another thing that's often absent

290
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:53,120
that's another thing that's often absent
 

291
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,870
that's another thing that's often absent
in maths class the idea that you might

292
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
in maths class the idea that you might
 

293
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,469
in maths class the idea that you might
think about a problem and

294
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
think about a problem and
 

295
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,790
think about a problem and
use your intuition

296
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
use your intuition
 

297
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,710
use your intuition
but so important

298
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
but so important
 

299
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,710
but so important
and when mathematicians are interviewed

300
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
and when mathematicians are interviewed
 

301
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,150
and when mathematicians are interviewed
they will very frequently talk about the

302
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:04,160
they will very frequently talk about the
 

303
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,110
they will very frequently talk about the
role of intuition in solving problems

304
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:07,120
role of intuition in solving problems
 

305
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,590
role of intuition in solving problems
but not commonly

306
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:09,600
but not commonly
 

307
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,110
but not commonly
acknowledged or

308
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,120
acknowledged or
 

309
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,749
acknowledged or
brought into education yeah i mean

310
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:13,759
brought into education yeah i mean
 

311
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,830
brought into education yeah i mean
that's what it is like

312
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:15,840
that's what it is like
 

313
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,110
that's what it is like
if if you

314
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:17,120
if if you
 

315
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,350
if if you
task yourself with building an intuition

316
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:19,360
task yourself with building an intuition
 

317
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,189
task yourself with building an intuition
about a problem

318
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:21,199
about a problem
 

319
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,310
about a problem
that's what

320
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:22,320
that's what
 

321
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,990
that's what
that's where you start to pull in like

322
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:24,000
that's where you start to pull in like
 

323
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,430
that's where you start to pull in like
um

324
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:25,440
um
 

325
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,430
um
what is the pattern i'm seeing in order

326
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:27,440
what is the pattern i'm seeing in order
 

327
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,870
what is the pattern i'm seeing in order
to understand the pattern you might want

328
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:28,880
to understand the pattern you might want
 

329
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,590
to understand the pattern you might want
to then start utilizing visualization

330
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:31,600
to then start utilizing visualization
 

331
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,150
to then start utilizing visualization
but ultimately that's all in service of

332
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:34,160
but ultimately that's all in service of
 

333
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,670
but ultimately that's all in service of
like

334
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:35,680
like
 

335
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,270
like
solving the puzzle

336
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
solving the puzzle
 

337
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,189
solving the puzzle
like cracking it open yeah you get the

338
00:05:39,189 --> 00:05:39,199
like cracking it open yeah you get the
 

339
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,590
like cracking it open yeah you get the
simple explanation of what why

340
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:41,600
simple explanation of what why
 

341
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,830
simple explanation of what why
why things are the way they are

342
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
why things are the way they are
 

343
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,430
why things are the way they are
as opposed to um

344
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
as opposed to um
 

345
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,950
as opposed to um
like you said having a particular

346
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:46,960
like you said having a particular
 

347
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,629
like you said having a particular
algorithm that you can then execute to

348
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:48,639
algorithm that you can then execute to
 

349
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,909
algorithm that you can then execute to
solve the problem

350
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919
solve the problem
 

351
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,990
solve the problem
yeah but it's hard it's hard yeah

352
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,000
yeah but it's hard it's hard yeah
 

353
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,310
yeah but it's hard it's hard yeah
reasoning is really hard yeah it's it's

354
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:54,320
reasoning is really hard yeah it's it's
 

355
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,909
reasoning is really hard yeah it's it's
hard i mean

356
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:55,919
hard i mean
 

357
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,790
hard i mean
i love to value what's hard in maths

358
00:05:58,790 --> 00:05:58,800
i love to value what's hard in maths
 

359
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,870
i love to value what's hard in maths
instead of being afraid of it we know

360
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:00,880
instead of being afraid of it we know
 

361
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,790
instead of being afraid of it we know
that when you struggle that's actually a

362
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:02,800
that when you struggle that's actually a
 

363
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,950
that when you struggle that's actually a
really good time for your brain you want

364
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
really good time for your brain you want
 

365
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,550
really good time for your brain you want
to be struggling when you're thinking

366
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:06,560
to be struggling when you're thinking
 

367
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,909
to be struggling when you're thinking
about things so

368
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:07,919
about things so
 

369
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,670
about things so
if it's hard to think intuitively about

370
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:09,680
if it's hard to think intuitively about
 

371
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,909
if it's hard to think intuitively about
something that's probably a really good

372
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
something that's probably a really good
 

373
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,510
something that's probably a really good
time for your brain

374
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:13,520
time for your brain
 

375
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,670
time for your brain
i i used to work with somebody called

376
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:15,680
i i used to work with somebody called
 

377
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,830
i i used to work with somebody called
sebastian thoran who

378
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:17,840
sebastian thoran who
 

379
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,590
sebastian thoran who
it's a great sort of mathematician you

380
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:19,600
it's a great sort of mathematician you
 

381
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,830
it's a great sort of mathematician you
might think of him an ai person and

382
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:21,840
might think of him an ai person and
 

383
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,430
might think of him an ai person and
i remember in one interview i did with

384
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:23,440
i remember in one interview i did with
 

385
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,029
i remember in one interview i did with
him he talked about how they'd built

386
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:25,039
him he talked about how they'd built
 

387
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,510
him he talked about how they'd built
robots i think for the smithsonian

388
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:27,520
robots i think for the smithsonian
 

389
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,270
robots i think for the smithsonian
and how they were having this trouble

390
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:29,280
and how they were having this trouble
 

391
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,309
and how they were having this trouble
with them picking up white noise

392
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
with them picking up white noise
 

393
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:33,110
with them picking up white noise
and

394
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:33,120
and
 

395
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,790
and
he said they had to solve it they had to

396
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:34,800
he said they had to solve it they had to
 

397
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,350
he said they had to solve it they had to
work out what's going on and how he

398
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,360
work out what's going on and how he
 

399
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,110
work out what's going on and how he
intuitively

400
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
intuitively
 

401
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,189
intuitively
worked out what the problem was

402
00:06:41,189 --> 00:06:41,199
worked out what the problem was
 

403
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,070
worked out what the problem was
but then it took him three weeks to show

404
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:44,080
but then it took him three weeks to show
 

405
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,070
but then it took him three weeks to show
it mathematically i thought that was

406
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,080
it mathematically i thought that was
 

407
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,550
it mathematically i thought that was
really interesting that how you can have

408
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:48,560
really interesting that how you can have
 

409
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,749
really interesting that how you can have
this intuition and know something works

410
00:06:51,749 --> 00:06:51,759
this intuition and know something works
 

411
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,189
this intuition and know something works
it's kind of different from going

412
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:53,199
it's kind of different from going
 

413
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,189
it's kind of different from going
through that long mathematical process

414
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:55,199
through that long mathematical process
 

415
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,870
through that long mathematical process
of proving it

416
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:56,880
of proving it
 

417
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,510
of proving it
but so important yeah i think probably

418
00:06:59,510 --> 00:06:59,520
but so important yeah i think probably
 

419
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,510
but so important yeah i think probably
our brains are evolved

420
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:01,520
our brains are evolved
 

421
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,909
our brains are evolved
as like intuition machines

422
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:03,919
as like intuition machines
 

423
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,629
as like intuition machines
and the uh the the math of like showing

424
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
and the uh the the math of like showing
 

425
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,150
and the uh the the math of like showing
it like

426
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,160
it like
 

427
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,629
it like
formally is probably an extra thing that

428
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:10,639
formally is probably an extra thing that
 

429
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,629
formally is probably an extra thing that
we're not designed for you see that with

430
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:12,639
we're not designed for you see that with
 

431
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,790
we're not designed for you see that with
feynman and his

432
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:14,800
feynman and his
 

433
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,950
feynman and his
i mean it's just all of these physicists

434
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:16,960
i mean it's just all of these physicists
 

435
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,670
i mean it's just all of these physicists
definitely you see um

436
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:19,680
definitely you see um
 

437
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,589
definitely you see um
starting with intuition sometimes

438
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:21,599
starting with intuition sometimes
 

439
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,390
starting with intuition sometimes
starting with an experiment

440
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,400
starting with an experiment
 

441
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,870
starting with an experiment
and then the experiment inspires

442
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:26,880
and then the experiment inspires
 

443
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,710
and then the experiment inspires
intuition but you can think of an

444
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:28,720
intuition but you can think of an
 

445
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,790
intuition but you can think of an
experiment as a kind of visualization

446
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:30,800
experiment as a kind of visualization
 

447
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,230
experiment as a kind of visualization
right just like let's

448
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:32,240
right just like let's
 

449
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,670
right just like let's
let's take whatever the heck we're

450
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:33,680
let's take whatever the heck we're
 

451
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,909
let's take whatever the heck we're
looking at and draw it

452
00:07:35,909 --> 00:07:35,919
looking at and draw it
 

453
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,070
looking at and draw it
and and draw like uh the pattern as it

454
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
and and draw like uh the pattern as it
 

455
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,790
and and draw like uh the pattern as it
evolves as the thing grows for n equals

456
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:40,800
evolves as the thing grows for n equals
 

457
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,710
evolves as the thing grows for n equals
one for n equals two n equals three and

458
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
one for n equals two n equals three and
 

459
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,430
one for n equals two n equals three and
you start uh to play with it and then in

460
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:45,440
you start uh to play with it and then in
 

461
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,629
you start uh to play with it and then in
the modern day which i loved uh doing

462
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:48,639
the modern day which i loved uh doing
 

463
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,629
the modern day which i loved uh doing
is you know you can write a program that

464
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:50,639
is you know you can write a program that
 

465
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,469
is you know you can write a program that
then visualizes it for you right and

466
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:52,479
then visualizes it for you right and
 

467
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,990
then visualizes it for you right and
then you can start exploring it

468
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:54,000
then you can start exploring it
 

469
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,430
then you can start exploring it
programmatically

470
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:55,440
programmatically
 

471
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,830
programmatically
and that that and

472
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:56,840
and that that and
 

473
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,469
and that that and
then you can do so interactively too i

474
00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:00,479
then you can do so interactively too i
 

475
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,309
then you can do so interactively too i
tend to not

476
00:08:02,309 --> 00:08:02,319
tend to not
 

477
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,150
tend to not
uh like interactive because the way it

478
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,160
uh like interactive because the way it
 

479
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,749
uh like interactive because the way it
takes to way too much work because you

480
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:05,759
takes to way too much work because you
 

481
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,430
takes to way too much work because you
have to click and move and stuff i love

482
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:07,440
have to click and move and stuff i love
 

483
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,830
have to click and move and stuff i love
to interact through writing programs

484
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:09,840
to interact through writing programs
 

485
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,830
to interact through writing programs
that's my particular brain software

486
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:11,840
that's my particular brain software
 

487
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,589
that's my particular brain software
engineer so like

488
00:08:13,589 --> 00:08:13,599
engineer so like
 

489
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,670
engineer so like
you can you can uh do all these kinds of

490
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:15,680
you can you can uh do all these kinds of
 

491
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,150
you can you can uh do all these kinds of
visualizations uh and then there's the

492
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,160
visualizations uh and then there's the
 

493
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,710
visualizations uh and then there's the
tools of visualization like color

494
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:20,720
tools of visualization like color
 

495
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,110
tools of visualization like color
uh all those kinds of things yeah that

496
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,120
uh all those kinds of things yeah that
 

497
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,629
uh all those kinds of things yeah that
you're absolutely right they're actually

498
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:24,639
you're absolutely right they're actually
 

499
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,430
you're absolutely right they're actually
not

500
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:25,440
not
 

501
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,830
not
taught very much right like the art of

502
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:27,840
taught very much right like the art of
 

503
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,990
taught very much right like the art of
visualization not taught

504
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:30,000
visualization not taught
 

505
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,189
visualization not taught
and

506
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:31,199
and
 

507
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,070
and
we love as well color coding like when

508
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,080
we love as well color coding like when
 

509
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,469
we love as well color coding like when
you represent something mathematically

510
00:08:36,469 --> 00:08:36,479
you represent something mathematically
 

511
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,029
you represent something mathematically
you can show color to show the growth

512
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:39,039
you can show color to show the growth
 

513
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,829
you can show color to show the growth
yeah and kind of code that so if i have

514
00:08:41,829 --> 00:08:41,839
yeah and kind of code that so if i have
 

515
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,149
yeah and kind of code that so if i have
an algebraic expression for a pattern

516
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
an algebraic expression for a pattern
 

517
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,550
an algebraic expression for a pattern
maybe i show the x with a certain color

518
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:46,560
maybe i show the x with a certain color
 

519
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,030
maybe i show the x with a certain color
but also write in that color so you can

520
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,040
but also write in that color so you can
 

521
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,350
but also write in that color so you can
see the relationship

522
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,360
see the relationship
 

523
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,470
see the relationship
very cool and um yeah we particularly in

524
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:54,480
very cool and um yeah we particularly in
 

525
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,790
very cool and um yeah we particularly in
our work with elementary teachers

526
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:56,800
our work with elementary teachers
 

527
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,790
our work with elementary teachers
many of them come to our workshops and

528
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:58,800
many of them come to our workshops and
 

529
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,430
many of them come to our workshops and
they're literally in tears when they see

530
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:01,440
they're literally in tears when they see
 

531
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,750
they're literally in tears when they see
things making sense visually

532
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:03,760
things making sense visually
 

533
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,750
things making sense visually
because they've spent their whole lives

534
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:05,760
because they've spent their whole lives
 

535
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,230
because they've spent their whole lives
think not realizing you can really

536
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:08,240
think not realizing you can really
 

537
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,870
think not realizing you can really
understand things with these visuals

538
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:10,880
understand things with these visuals
 

539
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,630
understand things with these visuals
it's quite powerful

540
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
it's quite powerful
 

541
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,030
it's quite powerful
you say that uh there's something about

542
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
you say that uh there's something about
 

543
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,750
you say that uh there's something about
there's something valuable to learning

544
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:17,760
there's something valuable to learning
 

545
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,829
there's something valuable to learning
when the thing that you're doing is

546
00:09:19,829 --> 00:09:19,839
when the thing that you're doing is
 

547
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,990
when the thing that you're doing is
challenging it's difficult so a lot of

548
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:22,000
challenging it's difficult so a lot of
 

549
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,550
challenging it's difficult so a lot of
people say you know math is hard or math

550
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:24,560
people say you know math is hard or math
 

551
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,070
people say you know math is hard or math
is too hard

552
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
is too hard
 

553
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,990
is too hard
or too hard for me

554
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:28,000
or too hard for me
 

555
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,110
or too hard for me
do you think

556
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:29,120
do you think
 

557
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,350
do you think
math should be easy or should it be hard

558
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:33,360
math should be easy or should it be hard
 

559
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,829
math should be easy or should it be hard
i think it's great when

560
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:35,839
i think it's great when
 

561
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,269
i think it's great when
things are challenging but there's

562
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:37,279
things are challenging but there's
 

563
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,430
things are challenging but there's
something that that's really key to

564
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
something that that's really key to
 

565
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,110
something that that's really key to
being able to

566
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
being able to
 

567
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,630
being able to
deal with challenging maths and that is

568
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:44,640
deal with challenging maths and that is
 

569
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,430
deal with challenging maths and that is
knowing that you can do it and i think

570
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:47,440
knowing that you can do it and i think
 

571
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,350
knowing that you can do it and i think
the problem in education is a lot of

572
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
the problem in education is a lot of
 

573
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,430
the problem in education is a lot of
people have got this idea that you're

574
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
people have got this idea that you're
 

575
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,030
people have got this idea that you're
either born with a math sprain or you're

576
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
either born with a math sprain or you're
 

577
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,990
either born with a math sprain or you're
not

578
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:54,000
not
 

579
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,829
not
so when they start to struggle they

580
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:55,839
so when they start to struggle they
 

581
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,389
so when they start to struggle they
think oh i don't have that maths brain

582
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:58,399
think oh i don't have that maths brain
 

583
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,230
think oh i don't have that maths brain
and then they will literally sort of

584
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
and then they will literally sort of
 

585
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,910
and then they will literally sort of
switch off in their brain and things

586
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:01,920
switch off in their brain and things
 

587
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,230
switch off in their brain and things
will go downhill from that point so

588
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
will go downhill from that point so
 

589
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,509
will go downhill from that point so
struggle becomes a lot easier and

590
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:07,519
struggle becomes a lot easier and
 

591
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,509
struggle becomes a lot easier and
you're able to struggle if you don't

592
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:09,519
you're able to struggle if you don't
 

593
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,870
you're able to struggle if you don't
have that idea

594
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:10,880
have that idea
 

595
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,670
have that idea
but you know that you you can do it you

596
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:13,680
but you know that you you can do it you
 

597
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,350
but you know that you you can do it you
have to go through this struggle to get

598
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:15,360
have to go through this struggle to get
 

599
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,630
have to go through this struggle to get
there but you're you're able to do that

600
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
there but you're you're able to do that
 

601
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,269
there but you're you're able to do that
and so we're hampered in being able to

602
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:21,279
and so we're hampered in being able to
 

603
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,190
and so we're hampered in being able to
struggle with these ideas we've been

604
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,200
struggle with these ideas we've been
 

605
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,509
struggle with these ideas we've been
given about what we can do i ask a

606
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:25,519
given about what we can do i ask a
 

607
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,069
given about what we can do i ask a
difficult question here yes so there's

608
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:28,079
difficult question here yes so there's
 

609
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,230
difficult question here yes so there's
kind of um

610
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
kind of um
 

611
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,310
kind of um
i don't know what the right term is but

612
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
i don't know what the right term is but
 

613
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,910
i don't know what the right term is but
some people

614
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:33,920
some people
 

615
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,590
some people
are um

616
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,600
are um
 

617
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,550
are um
struggle with learning in different ways

618
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:38,560
struggle with learning in different ways
 

619
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,310
struggle with learning in different ways
like their brain is

620
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:40,320
like their brain is
 

621
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,389
like their brain is
constructed in different ways

622
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
constructed in different ways
 

623
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,069
constructed in different ways
and um

624
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:44,079
and um
 

625
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,590
and um
how much should

626
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:45,600
how much should
 

627
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,230
how much should
as educators should we make room for

628
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:48,240
as educators should we make room for
 

629
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,269
as educators should we make room for
that

630
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:49,279
that
 

631
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,630
that
so how do you know the difference

632
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:50,640
so how do you know the difference
 

633
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,030
so how do you know the difference
between this is hard and i don't like

634
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,040
between this is hard and i don't like
 

635
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,069
between this is hard and i don't like
doing hard things versus my brain is

636
00:10:56,069 --> 00:10:56,079
doing hard things versus my brain is
 

637
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,990
doing hard things versus my brain is
wired in a way where i need to learn in

638
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,000
wired in a way where i need to learn in
 

639
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,670
wired in a way where i need to learn in
very different ways i can't learn it

640
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
very different ways i can't learn it
 

641
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,910
very different ways i can't learn it
this way how do you find that

642
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:01,920
this way how do you find that
 

643
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,350
this way how do you find that
line how do you operate in that gray

644
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:03,360
line how do you operate in that gray
 

645
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,230
line how do you operate in that gray
area so this is why being a teacher is

646
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:06,240
area so this is why being a teacher is
 

647
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,710
area so this is why being a teacher is
so hard and people really don't

648
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:08,720
so hard and people really don't
 

649
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,030
so hard and people really don't
appreciate how difficult teaching is

650
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,040
appreciate how difficult teaching is
 

651
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,949
appreciate how difficult teaching is
when you're faced with i know 30

652
00:11:12,949 --> 00:11:12,959
when you're faced with i know 30
 

653
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,230
when you're faced with i know 30
students who think in different ways and

654
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,240
students who think in different ways and
 

655
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,030
students who think in different ways and
but this is also why i believe it's so

656
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,040
but this is also why i believe it's so
 

657
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,949
but this is also why i believe it's so
important to have this multi-dimensional

658
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:20,959
important to have this multi-dimensional
 

659
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,790
important to have this multi-dimensional
approach to maths we've really offered

660
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:22,800
approach to maths we've really offered
 

661
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,910
approach to maths we've really offered
it in one way which is

662
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:25,920
it in one way which is
 

663
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,509
it in one way which is
here's some numbers in a method you

664
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:27,519
here's some numbers in a method you
 

665
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,670
here's some numbers in a method you
follow me do what i just did and then

666
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:29,680
follow me do what i just did and then
 

667
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,110
follow me do what i just did and then
reproduce it

668
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
reproduce it
 

669
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,190
reproduce it
and so there are some kids who like

670
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,200
and so there are some kids who like
 

671
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,430
and so there are some kids who like
doing that and they do well and a lot of

672
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,440
doing that and they do well and a lot of
 

673
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,550
doing that and they do well and a lot of
kids who

674
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:36,560
kids who
 

675
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,949
kids who
don't like doing it and don't do well

676
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
don't like doing it and don't do well
 

677
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,710
don't like doing it and don't do well
but when you open up maths and you give

678
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:42,720
but when you open up maths and you give
 

679
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,230
but when you open up maths and you give
you let kids experience it in different

680
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,240
you let kids experience it in different
 

681
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,310
you let kids experience it in different
ways maybe visually with numbers with

682
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
ways maybe visually with numbers with
 

683
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,509
ways maybe visually with numbers with
words

684
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:47,519
words
 

685
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,829
words
what happens is kids

686
00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:49,839
what happens is kids
 

687
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,509
what happens is kids
there are many more kids who can access

688
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:51,519
there are many more kids who can access
 

689
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,470
there are many more kids who can access
it

690
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:52,480
it
 

691
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,990
it
so those different

692
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:54,000
so those different
 

693
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,310
so those different
brain wirings you're talking about where

694
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:56,320
brain wirings you're talking about where
 

695
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,670
brain wirings you're talking about where
some people are just

696
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:57,680
some people are just
 

697
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,870
some people are just
more able to do something in a

698
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
more able to do something in a
 

699
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,150
more able to do something in a
particular way

700
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
particular way
 

701
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,310
particular way
that's why we want to that's one of the

702
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,320
that's why we want to that's one of the
 

703
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,629
that's why we want to that's one of the
reasons we want to open it up

704
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:04,639
reasons we want to open it up
 

705
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,470
reasons we want to open it up
so that there are different ways of

706
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:06,480
so that there are different ways of
 

707
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,310
so that there are different ways of
accessing it

708
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
accessing it
 

709
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,110
accessing it
and then that's not really a problem

710
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:11,120
and then that's not really a problem
 

711
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,990
and then that's not really a problem
so

712
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,000
so
 

713
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,389
so
i grew up in the soviet union

714
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:14,399
i grew up in the soviet union
 

715
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,350
i grew up in the soviet union
and uh fell in love with math early i

716
00:12:17,350 --> 00:12:17,360
and uh fell in love with math early i
 

717
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,310
and uh fell in love with math early i
was forced into math early and fell in

718
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:20,320
was forced into math early and fell in
 

719
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,350
was forced into math early and fell in
love

720
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:21,360
love
 

721
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,910
love
through force that's good well you fell

722
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:23,920
through force that's good well you fell
 

723
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,230
through force that's good well you fell
in love with other people well but there

724
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,240
in love with other people well but there
 

725
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,990
in love with other people well but there
uh something we talked about a little

726
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:28,000
uh something we talked about a little
 

727
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,790
uh something we talked about a little
bit is there's such a

728
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:30,800
bit is there's such a
 

729
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,949
bit is there's such a
value for excellence

730
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
value for excellence
 

731
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,870
value for excellence
uh it's competitive

732
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:34,880
uh it's competitive
 

733
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,750
uh it's competitive
and it's also everybody kind of looks up

734
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:37,760
and it's also everybody kind of looks up
 

735
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,069
and it's also everybody kind of looks up
the the definition

736
00:12:40,069 --> 00:12:40,079
the the definition
 

737
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,030
the the definition
of

738
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,040
of
 

739
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,190
of
success is being

740
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,200
success is being
 

741
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,190
success is being
in a particular class is you know being

742
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:45,200
in a particular class is you know being
 

743
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,870
in a particular class is you know being
really good at it

744
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:46,880
really good at it
 

745
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,990
really good at it
um and like it's not improving it's like

746
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,000
um and like it's not improving it's like
 

747
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,990
um and like it's not improving it's like
being really good i mean we are much

748
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
being really good i mean we are much
 

749
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,670
being really good i mean we are much
more like that with sports for example

750
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
more like that with sports for example
 

751
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,790
more like that with sports for example
we're not

752
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:54,800
we're not
 

753
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,790
we're not
it's like it's understood you know

754
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:56,800
it's like it's understood you know
 

755
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,629
it's like it's understood you know
you're going to star on the basketball

756
00:12:58,629 --> 00:12:58,639
you're going to star on the basketball
 

757
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,670
you're going to star on the basketball
team

758
00:12:59,670 --> 00:12:59,680
team
 

759
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,590
team
if uh you're going to start on the

760
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:01,600
if uh you're going to start on the
 

761
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,269
if uh you're going to start on the
basketball team if you're going to be

762
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:03,279
basketball team if you're going to be
 

763
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,350
basketball team if you're going to be
better than the other guys the other

764
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:05,360
better than the other guys the other
 

765
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,790
better than the other guys the other
girls on the team

766
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:06,800
girls on the team
 

767
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,590
girls on the team
uh

768
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:07,600
uh
 

769
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,190
uh
so

770
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:09,200
so
 

771
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,389
so
that coupled with the belief this could

772
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:12,399
that coupled with the belief this could
 

773
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,150
that coupled with the belief this could
be partially a communist belief i don't

774
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:14,160
be partially a communist belief i don't
 

775
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,790
be partially a communist belief i don't
know but the belief that everybody is

776
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
know but the belief that everybody is
 

777
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,110
know but the belief that everybody is
capable of being great

778
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:19,120
capable of being great
 

779
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,110
capable of being great
but if you're not great that's your

780
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
but if you're not great that's your
 

781
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,069
but if you're not great that's your
fault

782
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,079
fault
 

783
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,750
fault
and you need to work harder and i

784
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:23,760
and you need to work harder and i
 

785
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,870
and you need to work harder and i
remember i had a sense that um probably

786
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:26,880
remember i had a sense that um probably
 

787
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,509
remember i had a sense that um probably
delusional but i could win a nobel prize

788
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
delusional but i could win a nobel prize
 

789
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,150
delusional but i could win a nobel prize
i don't even know what that entails

790
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:32,160
i don't even know what that entails
 

791
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,269
i don't even know what that entails
um but i thought um

792
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:35,279
um but i thought um
 

793
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,550
um but i thought um
like uh my dad early on told me

794
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:38,560
like uh my dad early on told me
 

795
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,310
like uh my dad early on told me
just off hand and it always stuck with

796
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:40,320
just off hand and it always stuck with
 

797
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,629
just off hand and it always stuck with
me that if you if you can figure out how

798
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:42,639
me that if you if you can figure out how
 

799
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,030
me that if you if you can figure out how
to build a time machine how to travel

800
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:45,040
to build a time machine how to travel
 

801
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,949
to build a time machine how to travel
back in time it will probably give you a

802
00:13:46,949 --> 00:13:46,959
back in time it will probably give you a
 

803
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,509
back in time it will probably give you a
nobel prize and i remember early in my

804
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:49,519
nobel prize and i remember early in my
 

805
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,509
nobel prize and i remember early in my
life thinking i'm going to invent the

806
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:51,519
life thinking i'm going to invent the
 

807
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,310
life thinking i'm going to invent the
time machine and like like the tools of

808
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:54,320
time machine and like like the tools of
 

809
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,110
time machine and like like the tools of
mathematics were in service of that

810
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,120
mathematics were in service of that
 

811
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,069
mathematics were in service of that
dream of winning the nobel prize and

812
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:00,079
dream of winning the nobel prize and
 

813
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,310
dream of winning the nobel prize and
it's silly i didn't really think in

814
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:02,320
it's silly i didn't really think in
 

815
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,389
it's silly i didn't really think in
those concrete terms but i just thought

816
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
those concrete terms but i just thought
 

817
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,710
those concrete terms but i just thought
i could be great feeling

818
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
i could be great feeling
 

819
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,790
i could be great feeling
and then then when you struggle the

820
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:08,800
and then then when you struggle the
 

821
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,030
and then then when you struggle the
belief that you could be great

822
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,040
belief that you could be great
 

823
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,750
belief that you could be great
is like struggle is good right pushes

824
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:13,760
is like struggle is good right pushes
 

825
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,910
is like struggle is good right pushes
you on yeah and so the other thing about

826
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:15,920
you on yeah and so the other thing about
 

827
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,430
you on yeah and so the other thing about
the soviet system

828
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
the soviet system
 

829
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,629
the soviet system
that might

830
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:18,639
that might
 

831
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,949
that might
love to hear your comments about is just

832
00:14:20,949 --> 00:14:20,959
love to hear your comments about is just
 

833
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,389
love to hear your comments about is just
the sheer like hours of math like the

834
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:24,399
the sheer like hours of math like the
 

835
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,710
the sheer like hours of math like the
number of courses you're talking about

836
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:26,720
number of courses you're talking about
 

837
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,750
number of courses you're talking about
a lot of geometry a lot more i think in

838
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:29,760
a lot of geometry a lot more i think in
 

839
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,990
a lot of geometry a lot more i think in
the american system you take maybe one

840
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:32,000
the american system you take maybe one
 

841
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,069
the american system you take maybe one
year of geometry in high school yeah in

842
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:34,079
year of geometry in high school yeah in
 

843
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,189
year of geometry in high school yeah in
high school

844
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:35,199
high school
 

845
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,030
high school
first of all geometry is beautiful it's

846
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,040
first of all geometry is beautiful it's
 

847
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,470
first of all geometry is beautiful it's
visual and then you get to reason

848
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
visual and then you get to reason
 

849
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,629
visual and then you get to reason
through proofs and stuff like that in in

850
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:40,639
through proofs and stuff like that in in
 

851
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,949
through proofs and stuff like that in in
russia i remember just being nailed over

852
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:42,959
russia i remember just being nailed over
 

853
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,590
russia i remember just being nailed over
and over would you it was just non-stop

854
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
and over would you it was just non-stop
 

855
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,509
and over would you it was just non-stop
and then of course there's different

856
00:14:47,509 --> 00:14:47,519
and then of course there's different
 

857
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,590
and then of course there's different
perspectives on calculus and just the

858
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:49,600
perspectives on calculus and just the
 

859
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,470
perspectives on calculus and just the
whole

860
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:50,480
whole
 

861
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,470
whole
the sense was

862
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:52,480
the sense was
 

863
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,949
the sense was
that math is like

864
00:14:54,949 --> 00:14:54,959
that math is like
 

865
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,030
that math is like
like fundamental to the development of

866
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,040
like fundamental to the development of
 

867
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,550
like fundamental to the development of
the human mind

868
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:58,560
the human mind
 

869
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,430
the human mind
so

870
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
so
 

871
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,509
so
math but also science and literature by

872
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:01,519
math but also science and literature by
 

873
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,389
math but also science and literature by
the way

874
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
the way
 

875
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,750
the way
was also hit very hard like we read a

876
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:05,760
was also hit very hard like we read a
 

877
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,710
was also hit very hard like we read a
lot of serious adult stuff america does

878
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:08,720
lot of serious adult stuff america does
 

879
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,030
lot of serious adult stuff america does
that a little bit too they challenge

880
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,040
that a little bit too they challenge
 

881
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,189
that a little bit too they challenge
young adults with good literature but

882
00:15:13,189 --> 00:15:13,199
young adults with good literature but
 

883
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,949
young adults with good literature but
they don't challenge adults very much

884
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:14,959
they don't challenge adults very much
 

885
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,230
they don't challenge adults very much
with math math so those two things um

886
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:18,240
with math math so those two things um
 

887
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,590
with math math so those two things um
valuing

888
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:19,600
valuing
 

889
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,870
valuing
excellence

890
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:20,880
excellence
 

891
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,590
excellence
and just a lot of math in the curriculum

892
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:23,600
and just a lot of math in the curriculum
 

893
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,829
and just a lot of math in the curriculum
do you think do you think do you find

894
00:15:25,829 --> 00:15:25,839
do you think do you think do you find
 

895
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,430
do you think do you think do you find
that interesting because it seems to

896
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:27,440
that interesting because it seems to
 

897
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,430
that interesting because it seems to
have been successful yeah i think that's

898
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:29,440
have been successful yeah i think that's
 

899
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,269
have been successful yeah i think that's
very interesting and

900
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
very interesting and
 

901
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,110
very interesting and
there is a lot of success people coming

902
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,120
there is a lot of success people coming
 

903
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,030
there is a lot of success people coming
through the soviet system i think

904
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,040
through the soviet system i think
 

905
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,790
through the soviet system i think
something that's very different to the

906
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
something that's very different to the
 

907
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,430
something that's very different to the
us and other countries in the world

908
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:39,440
us and other countries in the world
 

909
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,430
us and other countries in the world
is that idea that excellence is

910
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,440
is that idea that excellence is
 

911
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,269
is that idea that excellence is
important and you can get there if you

912
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
important and you can get there if you
 

913
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,870
important and you can get there if you
work hard

914
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
work hard
 

915
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,710
work hard
in the u.s

916
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
in the u.s
 

917
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,230
in the u.s
there's an idea that excellence is

918
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
there's an idea that excellence is
 

919
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,990
there's an idea that excellence is
important but then kids are given the

920
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,000
important but then kids are given the
 

921
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,069
important but then kids are given the
idea in many ways

922
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:52,079
idea in many ways
 

923
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,150
idea in many ways
that you can either do it or you're one

924
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:54,160
that you can either do it or you're one
 

925
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,150
that you can either do it or you're one
of the people who can't

926
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:56,160
of the people who can't
 

927
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,389
of the people who can't
so many students in the school system

928
00:15:58,389 --> 00:15:58,399
so many students in the school system
 

929
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,670
so many students in the school system
think they're one of the kids who can't

930
00:15:59,670 --> 00:15:59,680
think they're one of the kids who can't
 

931
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,230
think they're one of the kids who can't
so there's no point in trying hard

932
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:02,240
so there's no point in trying hard
 

933
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,710
so there's no point in trying hard
because you're never going to get there

934
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:04,720
because you're never going to get there
 

935
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,110
because you're never going to get there
so if you can switch that

936
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
so if you can switch that
 

937
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,389
so if you can switch that
idea it would be huge and it seems from

938
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
idea it would be huge and it seems from
 

939
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,110
idea it would be huge and it seems from
what you've said that in the uh in the

940
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,120
what you've said that in the uh in the
 

941
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,470
what you've said that in the uh in the
soviet union

942
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
soviet union
 

943
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,790
soviet union
that idea is really different now the

944
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
that idea is really different now the
 

945
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,870
that idea is really different now the
downside of that idea that anybody can

946
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:18,880
downside of that idea that anybody can
 

947
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,670
downside of that idea that anybody can
get there if you work hard

948
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
get there if you work hard
 

949
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,189
get there if you work hard
is

950
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:23,199
is
 

951
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:24,790
is
that thought that if you're not getting

952
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:24,800
that thought that if you're not getting
 

953
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,389
that thought that if you're not getting
there it's your fault

954
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:26,399
there it's your fault
 

955
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,710
there it's your fault
and i i would add something into that i

956
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:28,720
and i i would add something into that i
 

957
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,749
and i i would add something into that i
would say that anybody can get there

958
00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:31,759
would say that anybody can get there
 

959
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,350
would say that anybody can get there
but they they need to work hard and they

960
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,360
but they they need to work hard and they
 

961
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,110
but they they need to work hard and they
also need good teaching

962
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
also need good teaching
 

963
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,350
also need good teaching
because there are some people who really

964
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:37,360
because there are some people who really
 

965
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,389
because there are some people who really
can't get there because they're not

966
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:38,399
can't get there because they're not
 

967
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,269
can't get there because they're not
given access to that good teaching

968
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:41,279
given access to that good teaching
 

969
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,150
given access to that good teaching
so

970
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:42,160
so
 

971
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,870
so
but that would be huge that change as to

972
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
but that would be huge that change as to
 

973
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,910
but that would be huge that change as to
doing lots of maths if um

974
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:47,920
doing lots of maths if um
 

975
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,310
doing lots of maths if um
if maths was interesting and open and

976
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,320
if maths was interesting and open and
 

977
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,230
if maths was interesting and open and
creative and multi-dimensional i would

978
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,240
creative and multi-dimensional i would
 

979
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,670
creative and multi-dimensional i would
be all for it

980
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
be all for it
 

981
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,509
be all for it
we we actually run summer camps at

982
00:16:55,509 --> 00:16:55,519
we we actually run summer camps at
 

983
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,829
we we actually run summer camps at
stanford where we invite kids in and we

984
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:57,839
stanford where we invite kids in and we
 

985
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,629
stanford where we invite kids in and we
give them this maths that i love

986
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:00,639
give them this maths that i love
 

987
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:01,430
give them this maths that i love
and

988
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,440
and
 

989
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,350
and
the in our camp classrooms they were

990
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
the in our camp classrooms they were
 

991
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,270
the in our camp classrooms they were
three hours long

992
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,280
three hours long
 

993
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,309
three hours long
and

994
00:17:06,309 --> 00:17:06,319
and
 

995
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,230
and
when we were planning the teachers were

996
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:08,240
when we were planning the teachers were
 

997
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,069
when we were planning the teachers were
like three hours are we gonna be able to

998
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:10,079
like three hours are we gonna be able to
 

999
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,390
like three hours are we gonna be able to
keep the kids excited for three hours

1000
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:12,400
keep the kids excited for three hours
 

1001
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,789
keep the kids excited for three hours
turned out they didn't want to go to

1002
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:14,799
turned out they didn't want to go to
 

1003
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,669
turned out they didn't want to go to
break or lunch they'd be so into these

1004
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:17,679
break or lunch they'd be so into these
 

1005
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:19,350
break or lunch they'd be so into these
mathematical patterns

1006
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:19,360
mathematical patterns
 

1007
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,230
mathematical patterns
we couldn't stop them it was

1008
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:22,240
we couldn't stop them it was
 

1009
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,309
we couldn't stop them it was
amazing so yeah if maths was more like

1010
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:24,319
amazing so yeah if maths was more like
 

1011
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,590
amazing so yeah if maths was more like
that then i think having more of it

1012
00:17:27,590 --> 00:17:27,600
that then i think having more of it
 

1013
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,750
that then i think having more of it
would be a really good thing so what uh

1014
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:29,760
would be a really good thing so what uh
 

1015
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,270
would be a really good thing so what uh
what age are you talking about is there

1016
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:31,280
what age are you talking about is there
 

1017
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,630
what age are you talking about is there
um could you comment on what age

1018
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
um could you comment on what age
 

1019
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,150
um could you comment on what age
is like the most important when people

1020
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
is like the most important when people
 

1021
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,110
is like the most important when people
quit math or give up on themselves or on

1022
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:41,120
quit math or give up on themselves or on
 

1023
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,789
quit math or give up on themselves or on
math in general

1024
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:42,799
math in general
 

1025
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,029
math in general
and perhaps that age or something

1026
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:45,039
and perhaps that age or something
 

1027
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,710
and perhaps that age or something
earlier is really

1028
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:46,720
earlier is really
 

1029
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,630
earlier is really
important moment for them to discover to

1030
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:48,640
important moment for them to discover to
 

1031
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,470
important moment for them to discover to
be inspired to discover the magic of

1032
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:50,480
be inspired to discover the magic of
 

1033
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,350
be inspired to discover the magic of
math

1034
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:51,360
math
 

1035
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,190
math
i think a lot of kids start to give up

1036
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:53,200
i think a lot of kids start to give up
 

1037
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,110
i think a lot of kids start to give up
on themselves and

1038
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:55,120
on themselves and
 

1039
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,430
on themselves and
maths around

1040
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
maths around
 

1041
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,110
maths around
from about fifth grade

1042
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,120
from about fifth grade
 

1043
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,630
from about fifth grade
and then those middle school years are

1044
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:00,640
and then those middle school years are
 

1045
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,310
and then those middle school years are
really important

1046
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:02,320
really important
 

1047
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,470
really important
and fifth grade can be pivotal for kids

1048
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:04,480
and fifth grade can be pivotal for kids
 

1049
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,070
and fifth grade can be pivotal for kids
just because

1050
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,080
just because
 

1051
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,789
just because
they're allowed to explore and

1052
00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:08,799
they're allowed to explore and
 

1053
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,470
they're allowed to explore and
think in good ways

1054
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:10,480
think in good ways
 

1055
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,150
think in good ways
in the early grades of elementary school

1056
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,160
in the early grades of elementary school
 

1057
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,430
in the early grades of elementary school
but fifth grade teachers are often like

1058
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
but fifth grade teachers are often like
 

1059
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,789
but fifth grade teachers are often like
okay we're going to prepare you now for

1060
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:14,799
okay we're going to prepare you now for
 

1061
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,390
okay we're going to prepare you now for
middle school and we're going to give

1062
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,400
middle school and we're going to give
 

1063
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,470
middle school and we're going to give
you grades and lots of tests and that's

1064
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
you grades and lots of tests and that's
 

1065
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,950
you grades and lots of tests and that's
when kids start to

1066
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:20,960
when kids start to
 

1067
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,190
when kids start to
feel really badly about themselves and

1068
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:23,200
feel really badly about themselves and
 

1069
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,430
feel really badly about themselves and
so middle school years we our camps are

1070
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:25,440
so middle school years we our camps are
 

1071
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,669
so middle school years we our camps are
middle school students we think of those

1072
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:27,679
middle school students we think of those
 

1073
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,230
middle school students we think of those
years as really pivotal many kids in in

1074
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:30,240
years as really pivotal many kids in in
 

1075
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,870
years as really pivotal many kids in in
those years are deciding yes i'm gonna

1076
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:32,880
those years are deciding yes i'm gonna
 

1077
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,510
those years are deciding yes i'm gonna
keep going with stem subjects

1078
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
keep going with stem subjects
 

1079
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,310
keep going with stem subjects
or no i'm not that this isn't for me

1080
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,320
or no i'm not that this isn't for me
 

1081
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,270
or no i'm not that this isn't for me
so i mean all years are important and in

1082
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,280
so i mean all years are important and in
 

1083
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,029
so i mean all years are important and in
all years you can kind of switch kids

1084
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:43,039
all years you can kind of switch kids
 

1085
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,549
all years you can kind of switch kids
and get them

1086
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:44,559
and get them
 

1087
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,230
and get them
on a different pathway but i think those

1088
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:46,240
on a different pathway but i think those
 

1089
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,310
on a different pathway but i think those
middle school years are really important

1090
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:48,320
middle school years are really important
 

1091
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,150
middle school years are really important
so what's the role of the teacher in

1092
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:50,160
so what's the role of the teacher in
 

1093
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,470
so what's the role of the teacher in
this so one is the explanation of the

1094
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:52,480
this so one is the explanation of the
 

1095
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,150
this so one is the explanation of the
subject but

1096
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:54,160
subject but
 

1097
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,590
subject but
do you think teachers

1098
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:55,600
do you think teachers
 

1099
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,230
do you think teachers
should almost do like one-on-one

1100
00:18:58,230 --> 00:18:58,240
should almost do like one-on-one
 

1101
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,110
should almost do like one-on-one
you know

1102
00:18:59,110 --> 00:18:59,120
you know
 

1103
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,430
you know
little johnny i believe in you kind of

1104
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:01,440
little johnny i believe in you kind of
 

1105
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,830
little johnny i believe in you kind of
thing like yeah that energy of like

1106
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:03,840
thing like yeah that energy of like
 

1107
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,510
thing like yeah that energy of like
turns out it's really important there's

1108
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:05,520
turns out it's really important there's
 

1109
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,830
turns out it's really important there's
um a study that was done it was actually

1110
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:07,840
um a study that was done it was actually
 

1111
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,310
um a study that was done it was actually
done in high school english classrooms

1112
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:10,320
done in high school english classrooms
 

1113
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,909
done in high school english classrooms
where all kids

1114
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
where all kids
 

1115
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,909
where all kids
wrote an essay for their teacher

1116
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:13,919
wrote an essay for their teacher
 

1117
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,070
wrote an essay for their teacher
and this was done as an experiment

1118
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:16,080
and this was done as an experiment
 

1119
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,150
and this was done as an experiment
half of the kids got feedback from their

1120
00:19:18,150 --> 00:19:18,160
half of the kids got feedback from their
 

1121
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,150
half of the kids got feedback from their
teacher diagnostic feedback which is

1122
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:20,160
teacher diagnostic feedback which is
 

1123
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,150
teacher diagnostic feedback which is
great but for half of the kids it said

1124
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,160
great but for half of the kids it said
 

1125
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,070
great but for half of the kids it said
an extra sentence at the bottom that the

1126
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:24,080
an extra sentence at the bottom that the
 

1127
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,150
an extra sentence at the bottom that the
researchers had put on

1128
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,160
researchers had put on
 

1129
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,029
researchers had put on
and the kids who read that extra

1130
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,039
and the kids who read that extra
 

1131
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,590
and the kids who read that extra
sentence did significantly better in

1132
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:31,600
sentence did significantly better in
 

1133
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,070
sentence did significantly better in
english a whole year later the only

1134
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,080
english a whole year later the only
 

1135
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,190
english a whole year later the only
change

1136
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:35,200
change
 

1137
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,029
change
was this one sentence what are the

1138
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:37,039
was this one sentence what are the
 

1139
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,590
was this one sentence what are the
sentences so what did the sentence say

1140
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:39,600
sentences so what did the sentence say
 

1141
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,310
sentences so what did the sentence say
the sentence said i'm giving you this

1142
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:42,320
the sentence said i'm giving you this
 

1143
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,110
the sentence said i'm giving you this
feedback because i believe in you

1144
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
feedback because i believe in you
 

1145
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,350
feedback because i believe in you
and the kids who read that did better a

1146
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:47,360
and the kids who read that did better a
 

1147
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,430
and the kids who read that did better a
year later yeah

1148
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:49,440
year later yeah
 

1149
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,789
year later yeah
so

1150
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:50,799
so
 

1151
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,630
so

this feedback i believe in you
 

1159
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,669
this feedback i believe in you
one of the teachers said to me we don't

1160
00:19:59,669 --> 00:19:59,679
one of the teachers said to me we don't
 

1161
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,990
one of the teachers said to me we don't
put it on a stamp i said no

1165
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,710
don't put it on a stamp it's um
but your words are really important and

1166
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:08,720
but your words are really important and
 

1167
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,710
but your words are really important and
kids are sitting in classrooms all the

1168
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:10,720
kids are sitting in classrooms all the
 

1169
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,390
kids are sitting in classrooms all the
time thinking

1170
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
time thinking
 

1171
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,149
time thinking
what does my teacher think of me does my

1172
00:20:14,149 --> 00:20:14,159
what does my teacher think of me does my
 

1173
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,230
what does my teacher think of me does my
teacher think i can do this

1174
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
teacher think i can do this
 

1175
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,270
teacher think i can do this
um

1176
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
um
 

1177
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,430
um
so it turns out it is really important

1178
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:19,440
so it turns out it is really important
 

1179
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,270
so it turns out it is really important
to be saying to kids i know you can do

1180
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:21,280
to be saying to kids i know you can do
 

1181
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,549
to be saying to kids i know you can do
this

1182
00:20:22,549 --> 00:20:22,559
this
 

1183
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,750
this
and

1184
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:23,760
and
 

1185
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,710
and
those messages are not given enough by

1186
00:20:26,710 --> 00:20:26,720
those messages are not given enough by
 

1187
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,110
those messages are not given enough by
teachers and really believe it and

1188
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,120
teachers and really believe it and
 

1189
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,710
teachers and really believe it and
believe it yeah it's like you can't just

1190
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:30,720
believe it yeah it's like you can't just
 

1191
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,110
believe it yeah it's like you can't just
say it you have to believe it i i

1192
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:33,120
say it you have to believe it i i
 

1193
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,549
say it you have to believe it i i
sometimes cause like

1194
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:36,559

 

1195
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,630

it's such a funny dance because i'm such

1196
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:38,640
it's such a funny dance because i'm such
 

1197
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,549
it's such a funny dance because i'm such
a perfectionist i'm extremely

1198
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:40,559
a perfectionist i'm extremely
 

1199
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,470
a perfectionist i'm extremely
self-critical and i have when students

1200
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
self-critical and i have when students
 

1201
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,870
self-critical and i have when students
come up to me and it's clear to me that

1202
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:44,880
come up to me and it's clear to me that
 

1203
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,789
come up to me and it's clear to me that
they're

1204
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:46,799
they're
 

1205
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,510
they're
not even close to good

1206
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:49,520
not even close to good
 

1207
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,230
not even close to good
and it's tempting for me to be like uh

1208
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,240
and it's tempting for me to be like uh
 

1209
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,470
and it's tempting for me to be like uh
to sort of give up on them mentally but

1210
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:54,480
to sort of give up on them mentally but
 

1211
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,950
to sort of give up on them mentally but
the reality is like if you look at many

1212
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:56,960
the reality is like if you look at many
 

1213
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,950
the reality is like if you look at many
great people throughout history

1214
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:58,960
great people throughout history
 

1215
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,029
great people throughout history
they sucked at some point yeah exactly

1216
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:01,039
they sucked at some point yeah exactly
 

1217
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,029
they sucked at some point yeah exactly
and and some of the greatest took

1218
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:03,039
and and some of the greatest took
 

1219
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,190
and and some of the greatest took
non-linear paths to where they sucked

1220
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,200
non-linear paths to where they sucked
 

1221
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,110
non-linear paths to where they sucked
for long into la into later life and so

1222
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:09,120
for long into la into later life and so
 

1223
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,710
for long into la into later life and so
always kind of believing that this

1224
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:10,720
always kind of believing that this
 

1225
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,390
always kind of believing that this
person uh can be great exactly

1226
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:14,400
person uh can be great exactly
 

1227
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,149
person uh can be great exactly
you have to communicate that plus the

1228
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
you have to communicate that plus the
 

1229
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,830
you have to communicate that plus the
fact that they have to work hard that's

1230
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:17,840
fact that they have to work hard that's
 

1231
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,950
fact that they have to work hard that's
it yeah

1232
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:18,960
it yeah
 

1233
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,710
it yeah
yeah and you're right silicon valley

1234
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
yeah and you're right silicon valley
 

1235
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,870
yeah and you're right silicon valley
where i live is filled with people who

1236
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:22,880
where i live is filled with people who
 

1237
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,430
where i live is filled with people who
are dropouts at school or who had

1238
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:25,440
are dropouts at school or who had
 

1239
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,390
are dropouts at school or who had
special needs who didn't succeed

1240
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:28,400
special needs who didn't succeed
 

1241
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,549
special needs who didn't succeed
um it's very interesting that have gone

1242
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:30,559
um it's very interesting that have gone
 

1243
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,149
um it's very interesting that have gone
on to do amazing work in creative ways

1244
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:34,159
on to do amazing work in creative ways
 

1245
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,990
on to do amazing work in creative ways
i mean i do think our school system is

1246
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
i mean i do think our school system is
 

1247
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,669
i mean i do think our school system is
set up to

1248
00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:37,679
set up to
 

1249
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,070
set up to
um value

1250
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:40,080
um value
 

1251
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,110
um value
good memorizers who can reproduce what a

1252
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:43,120
good memorizers who can reproduce what a
 

1253
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,710
good memorizers who can reproduce what a
teacher is showing them

1254
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:44,720
teacher is showing them
 

1255
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,909
teacher is showing them
and push away those creative deep

1256
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:47,919
and push away those creative deep
 

1257
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,190
and push away those creative deep
thinkers

1258
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:49,200
thinkers
 

1259
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,470
thinkers
often

1260
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:50,480
often
 

1261
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,549
often
slower thinkers they think slowly and

1262
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:52,559
slower thinkers they think slowly and
 

1263
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,110
slower thinkers they think slowly and
deeply and they often get the idea early

1264
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,120
deeply and they often get the idea early
 

1265
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,270
deeply and they often get the idea early
on that they can't be good at maths or

1266
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,280
on that they can't be good at maths or
 

1267
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,029
on that they can't be good at maths or
other subjects

1268
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
other subjects
 

1269
00:21:59,039 --> 00:21:59,909
other subjects
so

1270
00:21:59,909 --> 00:21:59,919
so
 

1271
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,390
so
um yeah i think many of those people are

1272
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:02,400
um yeah i think many of those people are
 

1273
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,110
um yeah i think many of those people are
the ones who go on and do amazing things

1274
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,120
the ones who go on and do amazing things
 

1275
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,789
the ones who go on and do amazing things
so there's a guy

1276
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:06,799
so there's a guy
 

1277
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,710
so there's a guy
named eric weinstein i know many

1278
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:08,720
named eric weinstein i know many
 

1279
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,110
named eric weinstein i know many
mathematicians like this but he

1280
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:11,120
mathematicians like this but he
 

1281
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,909
mathematicians like this but he
he talks a lot about not having us

1282
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:13,919
he talks a lot about not having us
 

1283
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,149
he talks a lot about not having us
about having a non-standard way of

1284
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
about having a non-standard way of
 

1285
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,590
about having a non-standard way of
learning

1286
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:17,600
learning
 

1287
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,669
learning
i mean a lot of great mathematicians a

1288
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
i mean a lot of great mathematicians a
 

1289
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,070
i mean a lot of great mathematicians a
lot of great physicists are like that

1290
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
lot of great physicists are like that
 

1291
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,870
lot of great physicists are like that
and he felt like he became quickly he

1292
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:24,880
and he felt like he became quickly he
 

1293
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,470
and he felt like he became quickly he
got his phd at harvard

1294
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:26,480
got his phd at harvard
 

1295
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,470
got his phd at harvard
became quickly an outcast of the system

1296
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:28,480
became quickly an outcast of the system
 

1297
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,669
became quickly an outcast of the system
like the

1298
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:29,679
like the
 

1299
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,830
like the
the education especially early education

1300
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
the education especially early education
 

1301
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,710
the education especially early education
system didn't help them

1302
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:34,720
system didn't help them
 

1303
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,070
system didn't help them
is there

1304
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,080
is there
 

1305
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,430
is there
ways for an education system to support

1306
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,440
ways for an education system to support
 

1307
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,110
ways for an education system to support
people like that is it this kind of

1308
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,120
people like that is it this kind of
 

1309
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,549
people like that is it this kind of
multi-dimensional learning that you're

1310
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
multi-dimensional learning that you're
 

1311
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,190

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,350
told
by a lot of people in my life that i

1432

by a lot of people in my life that i
 

1433
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,029
by a lot of people in my life that i
can't do something i'm very definitely

1434

non-standard
 

1437
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,110
non-standard
um but all it takes is that's

1438
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:43,120
um but all it takes is that's
 

1439
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,630
um but all it takes is that's
that's why people talk about like the

1440

let's go to another difficult subject

1486
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:31,520
let's go to another difficult subject
 

1487
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,070
let's go to another difficult subject
yeah that is a difficult subject um

1488
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:34,080
yeah that is a difficult subject um
 

1489
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,870
yeah that is a difficult subject um
one study found that

1490
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:36,880
one study found that
 

1491
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,470
one study found that
um

1492
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:38,480
um
 

1493
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,710
um
the amount of maths anxiety parents had

1494
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
the amount of maths anxiety parents had
 

1495
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,710
the amount of maths anxiety parents had
predicted their child's achievement in

1496
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:44,720
predicted their child's achievement in
 

1497
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,710
predicted their child's achievement in
school

1498
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:46,720
school
 

1499
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,230
school
but

1500
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:48,240
but
 

1501
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,350
but
only if they helped with homework

1502
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:51,360
only if they helped with homework
 

1503
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,950
only if they helped with homework
so

1504
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:54,960

 

1505
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,630

that's so funny yeah

1506
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:56,640
that's so funny yeah
 

1507
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,710
that's so funny yeah
but there are some interesting

1508
00:25:58,710 --> 00:25:58,720
but there are some interesting
 

1509
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,470
but there are some interesting
implications for this i mean you can see

1510
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:00,480
implications for this i mean you can see
 

1511
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,390
implications for this i mean you can see
how it works if you have maths anxiety

1512
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
how it works if you have maths anxiety
 

1513
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,350
how it works if you have maths anxiety
and you're helping your kids with

1514
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:03,360
and you're helping your kids with
 

1515
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,269
and you're helping your kids with
homework you're probably communicating

1516
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
homework you're probably communicating
 

1517
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:06,390
homework you're probably communicating
things like

1518
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:06,400
things like
 

1519
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,029
things like
i was terrible at this at school and

1520
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:09,039
i was terrible at this at school and
 

1521
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,470
i was terrible at this at school and
and that's how it gets passed on to kids

1522
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:12,480
and that's how it gets passed on to kids
 

1523
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,510
and that's how it gets passed on to kids
so

1524
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
so
 

1525
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,830
so
one implication is if you have a really

1526
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:15,840
one implication is if you have a really
 

1527
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,190
one implication is if you have a really
bad relationship with maths you hate

1528
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
bad relationship with maths you hate
 

1529
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,390
bad relationship with maths you hate
maths you have math anxiety just don't

1530
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:20,400
maths you have math anxiety just don't
 

1531
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,830
maths you have math anxiety just don't
don't do math say well with your kids

1532
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:22,840
don't do math say well with your kids
 

1533
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,990
don't do math say well with your kids
um but we have a on our website we have

1534

um are parents okay with like sucking at
math and then

1572
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
math and then
 

1573
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,870
math and then
trying to get their kid to be better

1574

become better than them it can be hard
 

1599
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,750
become better than them it can be hard
on the ego

1600
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:31,760
on the ego

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,710
haven't experienced parents worrying
that their kids will be better than them

1610
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:40,720
that their kids will be better than them
 

1611
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,710
that their kids will be better than them
i have experienced

1612
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
i have experienced
 

1613
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,510
i have experienced
i have experienced parents

1614
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:45,520
i have experienced parents
 

1615
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,190
i have experienced parents
just having a really bad relationship

1616
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:47,200
just having a really bad relationship
 

1617
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,830
just having a really bad relationship
with maths and yeah you know not wanting

1618
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:49,840
with maths and yeah you know not wanting
 

1619
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,230
with maths and yeah you know not wanting
to help not knowing how to help

1620
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:52,240
to help not knowing how to help
 

1621
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,909
to help not knowing how to help
saying things

1622
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:53,919
saying things
 

1623
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,070
saying things
like another study showed that when

1624
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,080
like another study showed that when
 

1625
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,710
like another study showed that when
mothers say to their daughters i was bad

1626
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:58,720
mothers say to their daughters i was bad
 

1627
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,630
mothers say to their daughters i was bad
at maths in school their daughter's

1628
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:00,640
at maths in school their daughter's
 

1629
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,389
at maths in school their daughter's
achievement goes down

1630
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:02,399
achievement goes down
 

1631
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,070
achievement goes down
so we know that kids pick up on these

1632
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:04,080
so we know that kids pick up on these
 

1633
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,269
so we know that kids pick up on these
messages

1634
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
messages
 

1635
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,510
messages
and um which is why i say you should

1636
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:07,520
and um which is why i say you should
 

1637
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,830
and um which is why i say you should
fake it but also i know that lots of

1638
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:09,840
fake it but also i know that lots of
 

1639
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,110
fake it but also i know that lots of
people have just had a really bad

1640
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
people have just had a really bad
 

1641
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,430
people have just had a really bad
relationship with maths even

1642
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:13,440
relationship with maths even
 

1643
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,830
relationship with maths even
successful people like the

1644
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:15,840
successful people like the
 

1645
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,830
successful people like the
undergrads i teach at stanford have

1646
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:17,840
undergrads i teach at stanford have
 

1647
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,950
undergrads i teach at stanford have
pretty much always done well in maths

1648
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:20,960
pretty much always done well in maths
 

1649
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,070
pretty much always done well in maths
but they come to stanford thinking maths

1650
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
but they come to stanford thinking maths
 

1651
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,149
but they come to stanford thinking maths
is a set of methods to memorize

1652
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:28,159
is a set of methods to memorize
 

1653
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,669
is a set of methods to memorize
and so

1654
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:29,679
and so
 

1655
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:31,590
and so
so do many parents believe that there's

1656
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:31,600
so do many parents believe that there's
 

1657
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,310
so do many parents believe that there's
one method that you memorize

1658
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,320
one method that you memorize
 

1659
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,870
one method that you memorize
and then you reproduce it

1660
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:36,880
and then you reproduce it
 

1661
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,269
and then you reproduce it
so until people have really had an

1662
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:39,279
so until people have really had an
 

1663
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,110
so until people have really had an
experience of what i think of as the

1664
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,120
experience of what i think of as the
 

1665
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,350
experience of what i think of as the
other maths where until they've really

1666
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:43,360
other maths where until they've really
 

1667
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,470
other maths where until they've really
seen that it's a really different

1668
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:44,480
seen that it's a really different
 

1669
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,149
seen that it's a really different
subject

1670
00:28:46,149 --> 00:28:46,159
subject
 

1671
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,549
subject
um

1672
00:28:48,549 --> 00:28:48,559

 

1673
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,549

it's hard for them to be able to shift

1674
00:28:50,549 --> 00:28:50,559
it's hard for them to be able to shift
 

1675
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,710
it's hard for them to be able to shift
their kids to see it differently is

1676
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:52,720
their kids to see it differently is
 

1677
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,950
their kids to see it differently is
there for a teacher

1678
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
there for a teacher
 

1679
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,990
there for a teacher
if we were to like systematize it is

1680
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
if we were to like systematize it is
 

1681
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,990
if we were to like systematize it is
there something teachers can do to do

1682
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:00,000
there something teachers can do to do
 

1683
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,710
there something teachers can do to do
this more effectively so you must you

1684
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:02,720
this more effectively so you must you
 

1685
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,350
this more effectively so you must you
mentioned the textbook yeah so so what

1686
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:05,360
mentioned the textbook yeah so so what
 

1687
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,430
mentioned the textbook yeah so so what
what are the additional things you can

1688
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
what are the additional things you can
 

1689
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,350
what are the additional things you can
add on top of this whole

1690
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:09,360
add on top of this whole
 

1691
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,070
add on top of this whole
old school traditional way of teaching

1692
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,080
old school traditional way of teaching
 

1693
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,710
old school traditional way of teaching
that can improve the the process

1694
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:14,720
that can improve the the process
 

1695
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,029
that can improve the the process
so i do think there's a way of teaching

1696
00:29:17,029 --> 00:29:17,039
so i do think there's a way of teaching
 

1697
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,789
so i do think there's a way of teaching
maths that changes everything for kids

1698
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:20,799
maths that changes everything for kids
 

1699
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,909
maths that changes everything for kids
and teachers so i'm one of five writers

1700
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:23,919
and teachers so i'm one of five writers
 

1701
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,909
and teachers so i'm one of five writers
of a new framework for the state of

1702
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919
of a new framework for the state of
 

1703
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,590
of a new framework for the state of
california new maths framework it's

1704
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:27,600
california new maths framework it's
 

1705
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,190
california new maths framework it's
coming out next year

1706
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:29,200
coming out next year
 

1707
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,269
coming out next year
and we are recommending through this

1708
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:31,279
and we are recommending through this
 

1709
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,950
and we are recommending through this
maths framework that people teach in

1710
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:32,960
maths framework that people teach in
 

1711
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,310
maths framework that people teach in
this way it's called teaching to

1712
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:36,320
this way it's called teaching to
 

1713
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,630
this way it's called teaching to
big ideas

1714
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
big ideas
 

1715
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,669
big ideas
so um at the moment people have

1716
00:29:41,669 --> 00:29:41,679
so um at the moment people have
 

1717
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,510
so um at the moment people have
standards that have been written and

1718
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:43,520
standards that have been written and
 

1719
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,029
standards that have been written and
then textbooks have taken these

1720
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:45,039
then textbooks have taken these
 

1721
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,870
then textbooks have taken these
standards and made

1722
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:46,880
standards and made
 

1723
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,710
standards and made
not very good questions

1724
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:48,720
not very good questions
 

1725
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,630
not very good questions
and if you look at the standards like i

1726
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:50,640
and if you look at the standards like i
 

1727
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,950
and if you look at the standards like i
have some written down here

1728
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:52,960
have some written down here
 

1729
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,430
have some written down here
just reading the standards it makes math

1730
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:55,440
just reading the standards it makes math
 

1731
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,909
just reading the standards it makes math
seem really boring and uninspiring what

1732
00:29:57,909 --> 00:29:57,919
seem really boring and uninspiring what
 

1733
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:59,750
seem really boring and uninspiring what
what what are the kind of can you give a

1734
00:29:59,750 --> 00:29:59,760
what what are the kind of can you give a
 

1735
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,590
what what are the kind of can you give a
few examples what so

1736
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:01,600
few examples what so
 

1737
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,590
few examples what so
this is an interesting example in third

1738
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
this is an interesting example in third
 

1739
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,190
this is an interesting example in third
grade there are three different

1740
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:05,200
grade there are three different
 

1741
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:10,389
grade there are three different
standards about unit squares

1742
00:30:10,389 --> 00:30:10,399

 

1743
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,950

okay um so this is one of them a square

1744
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:12,960
okay um so this is one of them a square
 

1745
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,430
okay um so this is one of them a square
with side length one unit called a unit

1746
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:15,440
with side length one unit called a unit
 

1747
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,909
with side length one unit called a unit
square is said to have one square unit

1748
00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:17,919
square is said to have one square unit
 

1749
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,470
square is said to have one square unit
of area and can be used to measure area

1750
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
of area and can be used to measure area
 

1751
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,389
of area and can be used to measure area
and that's something you're expected to

1752
00:30:22,389 --> 00:30:22,399
and that's something you're expected to
 

1753
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,350
and that's something you're expected to
learn

1754
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
learn
 

1755
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,789
learn
that is something that so that's a

1756
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:24,799
that is something that so that's a
 

1757
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,029
that is something that so that's a
standard the textbook authors say oh i'm

1758
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:27,039
standard the textbook authors say oh i'm
 

1759
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,470
standard the textbook authors say oh i'm
going to make a question about that and

1760
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:28,480
going to make a question about that and
 

1761
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,789
going to make a question about that and
they translate the standards into narrow

1762
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
they translate the standards into narrow
 

1763
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:31,990
they translate the standards into narrow
questions

1764
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:32,000
questions
 

1765
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,510
questions
and then you measure success by your

1766
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:33,520
and then you measure success by your
 

1767
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,870
and then you measure success by your
ability to deliver on on these standards

1768
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
ability to deliver on on these standards
 

1769
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,430
ability to deliver on on these standards
so the standards themselves uh i think

1770
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:39,440
so the standards themselves uh i think
 

1771
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,350
so the standards themselves uh i think
of maths and many people think maths in

1772
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,360
of maths and many people think maths in
 

1773
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,590
of maths and many people think maths in
this way is a subject of like a few big

1774
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:43,600
this way is a subject of like a few big
 

1775
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,230
this way is a subject of like a few big
ideas and really important connections

1776
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
ideas and really important connections
 

1777
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,830
ideas and really important connections
between them

1778
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:47,840
between them
 

1779
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,430
between them
um so like you could think of it as like

1780
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
um so like you could think of it as like
 

1781
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,549
um so like you could think of it as like
a network map of ideas and connections

1782
00:30:52,549 --> 00:30:52,559
a network map of ideas and connections
 

1783
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,870
a network map of ideas and connections
and what standards do is they take that

1784
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:54,880
and what standards do is they take that
 

1785
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,110
and what standards do is they take that
beautiful map and they chop it up like

1786
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,120
beautiful map and they chop it up like
 

1787
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,870
beautiful map and they chop it up like
this into lots of little pieces and they

1788
00:30:58,870 --> 00:30:58,880
this into lots of little pieces and they
 

1789
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:01,750
this into lots of little pieces and they
deliver the pieces to schools and

1790
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:01,760
deliver the pieces to schools and
 

1791
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,230
deliver the pieces to schools and
so teachers don't see the connections

1792
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:04,240
so teachers don't see the connections
 

1793
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,710
so teachers don't see the connections
between ideas nor do the kids so anyway

1794
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:06,720
between ideas nor do the kids so anyway
 

1795
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,310
between ideas nor do the kids so anyway
this is a bit of a long way of saying

1796
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:08,320
this is a bit of a long way of saying
 

1797
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,549
this is a bit of a long way of saying
that what we've done in this new

1798
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:10,559
that what we've done in this new
 

1799
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:11,830
that what we've done in this new
initiative

1800
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,840
initiative
 

1801
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,029
initiative
is we have set out maths as a set of big

1802
00:31:15,029 --> 00:31:15,039
is we have set out maths as a set of big
 

1803
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,990
is we have set out maths as a set of big
ideas

1804
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:16,000
ideas
 

1805
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,149
ideas
and connections between them so this is

1806
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:18,159
and connections between them so this is
 

1807
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:19,350
and connections between them so this is
a

1808
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:19,360
a
 

1809
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,789
a
grade three

1810
00:31:20,789 --> 00:31:20,799
grade three
 

1811
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,789
grade three
so instead of there being

1812
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
so instead of there being
 

1813
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,029
so instead of there being
60 standards

1814
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
60 standards
 

1815
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:26,230
60 standards
we've said

1816
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,240
we've said
 

1817
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,070
we've said
well you can

1818
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:28,080
well you can
 

1819
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,710
well you can
pull these different standards to get in

1820
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
pull these different standards to get in
 

1821
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,269
pull these different standards to get in
with each other and

1822
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:33,279
with each other and
 

1823
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,710
with each other and
um

1824
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:34,720
um
 

1825
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,909
um
also value the ways these are connected

1826
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
also value the ways these are connected
 

1827
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,350
also value the ways these are connected
and by the way for people who are just

1828
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:39,360
and by the way for people who are just
 

1829
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,509
and by the way for people who are just
listening we're looking at a small

1830
00:31:41,509 --> 00:31:41,519
listening we're looking at a small
 

1831
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,230
listening we're looking at a small
number of uh like big concepts within

1832
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:44,240
number of uh like big concepts within
 

1833
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,430
number of uh like big concepts within
mathematics

1834
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:45,440
mathematics
 

1835
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,909
mathematics
square towels measuring fraction shape

1836
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:47,919
square towels measuring fraction shape
 

1837
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:48,950
square towels measuring fraction shape
and time

1838
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
and time
 

1839
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,590
and time
and then how they're interconnected

1840
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:51,600
and then how they're interconnected
 

1841
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,590
and then how they're interconnected
and so the goal is for this is for grade

1842
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:53,600
and so the goal is for this is for grade
 

1843
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,909
and so the goal is for this is for grade
three for example yeah

1844
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:55,919
three for example yeah
 

1845
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,149
three for example yeah
and so we've set out for the state of

1846
00:31:58,149 --> 00:31:58,159
and so we've set out for the state of
 

1847
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,909
and so we've set out for the state of
california the whole of mathematics k

1848
00:32:01,909 --> 00:32:01,919
california the whole of mathematics k
 

1849
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,110
california the whole of mathematics k
10 as a set of big ideas and connections

1850
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:05,120
10 as a set of big ideas and connections
 

1851
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,909
10 as a set of big ideas and connections
so

1852
00:32:05,909 --> 00:32:05,919
so
 

1853
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,070
so
we know that teachers it works really

1854
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,080
we know that teachers it works really
 

1855
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,950
we know that teachers it works really
well if they say okay so a big idea in

1856
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:10,960
well if they say okay so a big idea in
 

1857
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,470
well if they say okay so a big idea in
my grade

1858
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:12,480
my grade
 

1859
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,269
my grade
is

1860
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:13,279
is
 

1861
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,430
is
measuring

1862
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:15,440
measuring
 

1863
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,149
measuring
and instead of reading five procedural

1864
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
and instead of reading five procedural
 

1865
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,710
and instead of reading five procedural
statements that involve measuring

1866
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
statements that involve measuring
 

1867
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,549
statements that involve measuring
they think okay measuring is a big idea

1868
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:22,559
they think okay measuring is a big idea
 

1869
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,830
they think okay measuring is a big idea
what rich deep activity can i use that

1870
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:25,840
what rich deep activity can i use that
 

1871
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,389
what rich deep activity can i use that
teaches measuring to kids and as kids

1872
00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:28,399
teaches measuring to kids and as kids
 

1873
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,630
teaches measuring to kids and as kids
work on these deep rich activities maybe

1874
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:30,640
work on these deep rich activities maybe
 

1875
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,549
work on these deep rich activities maybe
over a few days

1876
00:32:32,549 --> 00:32:32,559
over a few days
 

1877
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,830
over a few days
turns out a lot of maths comes into it

1878
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:35,840
turns out a lot of maths comes into it
 

1879
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,630
turns out a lot of maths comes into it
so

1880
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:36,640
so
 

1881
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,590
so
we're recommending that let's not teach

1882
00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:39,600
we're recommending that let's not teach
 

1883
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,350
we're recommending that let's not teach
maths according to all these multiple

1884
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:41,360
maths according to all these multiple
 

1885
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,269
maths according to all these multiple
multiple statements

1886
00:32:43,269 --> 00:32:43,279
multiple statements
 

1887
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:45,509
multiple statements
and lots and lots of short questions

1888
00:32:45,509 --> 00:32:45,519
and lots and lots of short questions
 

1889
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,750
and lots and lots of short questions
instead let's teach maths by thinking

1890
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
instead let's teach maths by thinking
 

1891
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,590
instead let's teach maths by thinking
about what are the big ideas and what

1892
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:49,600
about what are the big ideas and what
 

1893
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,230
about what are the big ideas and what
are really rich deep activities that

1894
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:52,240
are really rich deep activities that
 

1895
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,710
are really rich deep activities that
teach those big ideas so that's the like

1896
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:54,720
teach those big ideas so that's the like
 

1897
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,430
teach those big ideas so that's the like
how you teach it and maximize learning

1898
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:57,440
how you teach it and maximize learning
 

1899
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,990
how you teach it and maximize learning
what about like from a school district

1900
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:00,000
what about like from a school district
 

1901
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,590
what about like from a school district
perspective

1902
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:01,600
perspective
 

1903
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,110
perspective
like measuring

1904
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:03,120
like measuring
 

1905
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,269
like measuring
how well you're doing you know grades

1906
00:33:05,269 --> 00:33:05,279
how well you're doing you know grades
 

1907
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,110
how well you're doing you know grades
and tests and stuff like that do you

1908
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,120
and tests and stuff like that do you
 

1909
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,230
and tests and stuff like that do you
throw those out or is there is not a fan

1910
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,240
throw those out or is there is not a fan
 

1911
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,350
throw those out or is there is not a fan
of grades and tests um myself

1912
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:13,360
of grades and tests um myself
 

1913
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,630
of grades and tests um myself
i think

1914
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:14,640
i think
 

1915
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,509
i think
grades are fine if they're used at the

1916
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:17,519
grades are fine if they're used at the
 

1917
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,950
grades are fine if they're used at the
end of a course

1918
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
end of a course
 

1919
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,190
end of a course
so at the end of my maths course i might

1920
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:21,200
so at the end of my maths course i might
 

1921
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,110
so at the end of my maths course i might
get a grade because a grade is meant to

1922
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,120
get a grade because a grade is meant to
 

1923
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,630
get a grade because a grade is meant to
be a summative measure it kind of

1924
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:24,640
be a summative measure it kind of
 

1925
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,149
be a summative measure it kind of
describes your

1926
00:33:26,149 --> 00:33:26,159
describes your
 

1927
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,470
describes your
summit of achievement but the problem we

1928
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:28,480
summit of achievement but the problem we
 

1929
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,710
summit of achievement but the problem we
have in maths classrooms across the uh

1930
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
have in maths classrooms across the uh
 

1931
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,350
have in maths classrooms across the uh
the us is people use grades all the time

1932
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:33,360
the us is people use grades all the time
 

1933
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,310
the us is people use grades all the time
every week or every day even

1934
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
every week or every day even
 

1935
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,149
every week or every day even
my own kids when they went through high

1936
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
my own kids when they went through high
 

1937
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,669
my own kids when they went through high
school technology has not helped with

1938
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:39,679
school technology has not helped with
 

1939
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,669
school technology has not helped with
this when they went through high school

1940
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
this when they went through high school
 

1941
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,430
this when they went through high school
they knew they had been graded for

1942
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:43,440
they knew they had been graded for
 

1943
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,830
they knew they had been graded for
everything they did everything

1944
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:45,840
everything they did everything
 

1945
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,750
everything they did everything
and not only were they being graded for

1946
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:47,760
and not only were they being graded for
 

1947
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,110
and not only were they being graded for
everything but they could see it in the

1948
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:49,120
everything but they could see it in the
 

1949
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,430
everything but they could see it in the
grade book online and it would alter

1950
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:51,440
grade book online and it would alter
 

1951
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,669
grade book online and it would alter
every class they went into so

1952
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:53,679
every class they went into so
 

1953
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:55,750
every class they went into so
this is the ultimate what i think of as

1954
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:55,760
this is the ultimate what i think of as
 

1955
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,990
this is the ultimate what i think of as
a performance culture you're there to

1956
00:33:57,990 --> 00:33:58,000
a performance culture you're there to
 

1957
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,630
a performance culture you're there to
perform somebody's measuring you you see

1958
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,640
perform somebody's measuring you you see
 

1959
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,389
perform somebody's measuring you you see
your score

1960
00:34:02,389 --> 00:34:02,399
your score
 

1961
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,590
your score
um

1962
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:03,600
um
 

1963
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,950
um
so i think that's not conducive for

1964
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:06,960
so i think that's not conducive for
 

1965
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,550
so i think that's not conducive for
deep learning

1966
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:08,560
deep learning
 

1967
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,629
deep learning
and yes have a grade at the end of the

1968
00:34:10,629 --> 00:34:10,639
and yes have a grade at the end of the
 

1969
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,109
and yes have a grade at the end of the
year but during the year you can assess

1970
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:13,119
year but during the year you can assess
 

1971
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,230
year but during the year you can assess
kids in much better ways like teachers

1972
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,240
kids in much better ways like teachers
 

1973
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,349
kids in much better ways like teachers
can

1974
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:17,359
can
 

1975
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,190
can
a great way of assessing kids is to give

1976
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
a great way of assessing kids is to give
 

1977
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,869
a great way of assessing kids is to give
them a rubric

1978
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
them a rubric
 

1979
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,310
them a rubric
that kind of outlines what they're

1980
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:22,320
that kind of outlines what they're
 

1981
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,550
that kind of outlines what they're
learning over the course of a unit or a

1982
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:24,560
learning over the course of a unit or a
 

1983
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,750
learning over the course of a unit or a
few weeks

1984
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:25,760
few weeks
 

1985
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,230
few weeks
so kids can actually see the journey

1986
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:28,240
so kids can actually see the journey
 

1987
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,669
so kids can actually see the journey
they're on like this is what we're doing

1988
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:29,679
they're on like this is what we're doing
 

1989
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,109
they're on like this is what we're doing
mathematically

1990
00:34:31,109 --> 00:34:31,119
mathematically
 

1991
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,270
mathematically
sometimes they self-assess on those

1992
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:33,280
sometimes they self-assess on those
 

1993
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,710
sometimes they self-assess on those
units and then teachers

1994
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:36,720
units and then teachers
 

1995
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,109
units and then teachers
um will show where what they can what

1996
00:34:39,109 --> 00:34:39,119
um will show where what they can what
 

1997
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,510
um will show where what they can what
the kids can do with a rubric and also

1998
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
the kids can do with a rubric and also
 

1999
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,109
the kids can do with a rubric and also
write notes like you know in the next

2000
00:34:43,109 --> 00:34:43,119
write notes like you know in the next
 

2001
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,430
write notes like you know in the next
few weeks you might like to learn to do

2002
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:45,440
few weeks you might like to learn to do
 

2003
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,869
few weeks you might like to learn to do
this so

2004
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:46,879
this so
 

2005
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,510
this so
um so instead of kids just thinking

2006
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:49,520
um so instead of kids just thinking
 

2007
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,669
um so instead of kids just thinking
about i'm an a kid or a b kid or i have

2008
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:51,679
about i'm an a kid or a b kid or i have
 

2009
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,349
about i'm an a kid or a b kid or i have
this letter attached to me they're

2010
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:53,359
this letter attached to me they're
 

2011
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,589
this letter attached to me they're
actually seeing mathematically what's

2012
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:55,599
actually seeing mathematically what's
 

2013
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:56,869
actually seeing mathematically what's
important

2014
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
important
 

2015
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,589
important
and they're involved in the process of

2016
00:34:59,589 --> 00:34:59,599
and they're involved in the process of
 

2017
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,230
and they're involved in the process of
knowing where they are mathematically

2018
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:02,240
knowing where they are mathematically
 

2019
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,069
knowing where they are mathematically
at the end of the year sure they can

2020
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
at the end of the year sure they can
 

2021
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:06,310
at the end of the year sure they can
have a grade but um during the year they

2022
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
have a grade but um during the year they
 

2023
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,069
have a grade but um during the year they
get these much more informative measures

2024
00:35:10,069 --> 00:35:10,079
get these much more informative measures
 

2025
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,069
get these much more informative measures
i do think

2026
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:12,079
i do think
 

2027
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:14,630
i do think
this this might be more for college

2028
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:14,640
this this might be more for college
 

2029
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,390
this this might be more for college
but maybe not i

2030
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
but maybe not i
 

2031
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,790
but maybe not i
some of the best classes i've had is

2032
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:18,800
some of the best classes i've had is
 

2033
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,750
some of the best classes i've had is
when

2034
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:19,760
when
 

2035
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,510
when
i got a special

2036
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:21,520
i got a special
 

2037
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,670
i got a special
like set aside

2038
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:23,680
like set aside
 

2039
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,910
like set aside
like the the professor

2040
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:25,920
like the the professor
 

2041
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,910
like the the professor
clearly saw that i was interested in

2042
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:27,920
clearly saw that i was interested in
 

2043
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,109
clearly saw that i was interested in
some aspect of a thing and then um i

2044
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:31,119
some aspect of a thing and then um i
 

2045
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,630
some aspect of a thing and then um i
have a few in mind and one in particular

2046
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:34,640
have a few in mind and one in particular
 

2047
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,950
have a few in mind and one in particular
but he said that um

2048
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:36,960
but he said that um
 

2049
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,390
but he said that um
he kind of challenged me so this is

2050
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:38,400
he kind of challenged me so this is
 

2051
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,150
he kind of challenged me so this is
outside of grades and all that that kind

2052
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:40,160
outside of grades and all that that kind
 

2053
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,349
outside of grades and all that that kind
of stuff

2054
00:35:41,349 --> 00:35:41,359
of stuff
 

2055
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,109
of stuff
that

2056
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:43,119
that
 

2057
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,950
that
basically it's like reverse psychology i

2058
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:44,960
basically it's like reverse psychology i
 

2059
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,190
basically it's like reverse psychology i
don't i don't think this can be done

2060
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:47,200
don't i don't think this can be done
 

2061
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,230
don't i don't think this can be done
and so i gave everything to do that

2062
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:50,240
and so i gave everything to do that
 

2063
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,990
and so i gave everything to do that
particular thing so this was happened to

2064
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
particular thing so this was happened to
 

2065
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,390
particular thing so this was happened to
be in an artificial intelligence class

2066
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:54,400
be in an artificial intelligence class
 

2067
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,430
be in an artificial intelligence class
but

2068
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
but
 

2069
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,829
but
i i think that like special treatment of

2070
00:35:57,829 --> 00:35:57,839
i i think that like special treatment of
 

2071
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,670
i i think that like special treatment of
taking students

2072
00:35:59,670 --> 00:35:59,680
taking students
 

2073
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,069
taking students
who are especially like excellent at a

2074
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:02,079
who are especially like excellent at a
 

2075
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,910
who are especially like excellent at a
particular little aspect that you see

2076
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:03,920
particular little aspect that you see
 

2077
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,069
particular little aspect that you see
their eyes light up

2078
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:06,079
their eyes light up
 

2079
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:08,790
their eyes light up
i i often think like maybe it's tempting

2080
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:08,800
i i often think like maybe it's tempting
 

2081
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,230
i i often think like maybe it's tempting
for a teacher to think you've already

2082
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:10,240
for a teacher to think you've already
 

2083
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,310
for a teacher to think you've already
succeeded there but they're actually

2084
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
succeeded there but they're actually
 

2085
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,230
succeeded there but they're actually
signaling to you that

2086
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,240
signaling to you that
 

2087
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,390
signaling to you that
like you could really launch them on

2088
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:16,400
like you could really launch them on
 

2089
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,270
like you could really launch them on
their way yeah um and

2090
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
their way yeah um and
 

2091
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,030
their way yeah um and
i don't know that's too much to expect

2092
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
i don't know that's too much to expect
 

2093
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,670
i don't know that's too much to expect
from teachers i think to to to

2094
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:23,680
from teachers i think to to to
 

2095
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,950
from teachers i think to to to
pay attention to all of that because

2096
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:24,960
pay attention to all of that because
 

2097
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,190
pay attention to all of that because
it's really difficult but i i just kind

2098
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,200
it's really difficult but i i just kind
 

2099
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,910
it's really difficult but i i just kind
of remember who are the biggest

2100
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
of remember who are the biggest
 

2101
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,310
of remember who are the biggest
the most important people in the history

2102
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,320
the most important people in the history
 

2103
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,030
the most important people in the history
of

2104
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:33,040
of
 

2105
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,349
of
my life of education and it's those

2106
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:35,359
my life of education and it's those
 

2107
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,270
my life of education and it's those
people that who really

2108
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:37,280
people that who really
 

2109
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,109
people that who really
didn't just like inspire me with their

2110
00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:39,119
didn't just like inspire me with their
 

2111
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,430
didn't just like inspire me with their
awesomeness which they did but also just

2112
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:41,440
awesomeness which they did but also just
 

2113
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,190
awesomeness which they did but also just
they pushed me a little yeah like it

2114
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:43,200
they pushed me a little yeah like it
 

2115
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,109
they pushed me a little yeah like it
gave me a little push

2116
00:36:45,109 --> 00:36:45,119
gave me a little push
 

2117
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,030
gave me a little push
and that requires focusing on the quote

2118
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,040
and that requires focusing on the quote
 

2119
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,870
and that requires focusing on the quote
unquote excellent

2120
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:48,880
unquote excellent
 

2121
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,670
unquote excellent
uh yes in the class yeah i think what's

2122
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
uh yes in the class yeah i think what's
 

2123
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,150
uh yes in the class yeah i think what's
important though is teachers to have the

2124
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:54,160
important though is teachers to have the
 

2125
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,310
important though is teachers to have the
perspective that they don't know who's

2126
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:56,320
perspective that they don't know who's
 

2127
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,390
perspective that they don't know who's
going to be excellent at something

2128
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:58,400
going to be excellent at something
 

2129
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,150
going to be excellent at something
before they give out the activity

2130
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:00,160
before they give out the activity
 

2131
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,990
before they give out the activity
exactly and in our camp classes that we

2132
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,000
exactly and in our camp classes that we
 

2133
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,670
exactly and in our camp classes that we
ran

2134
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:05,680
ran
 

2135
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,630
ran
sometimes students would finish ahead of

2136
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:08,640
sometimes students would finish ahead of
 

2137
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,310
sometimes students would finish ahead of
other students

2138
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:10,320
other students
 

2139
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,470
other students
and we would say to them

2140
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:12,480
and we would say to them
 

2141
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,230
and we would say to them
can you

2142
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:14,240
can you
 

2143
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,150
can you
write a question that's like this but

2144
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
write a question that's like this but
 

2145
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,510
write a question that's like this but
different

2146
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:17,520
different
 

2147
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,950
different
um

2148
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:18,960
um
 

2149
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,270
um
oh and and over time we encourage them

2150
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:21,280
oh and and over time we encourage them
 

2151
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,630
oh and and over time we encourage them
to like extend things further

2152
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:24,640
to like extend things further
 

2153
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,710
to like extend things further
i remember we were doing one activity

2154
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:26,720
i remember we were doing one activity
 

2155
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,710
i remember we were doing one activity
where kids were working at the borders

2156
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
where kids were working at the borders
 

2157
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,109
where kids were working at the borders
of a square and how big this border

2158
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:31,119
of a square and how big this border
 

2159
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,430
of a square and how big this border
would be in different case sizes

2160
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
would be in different case sizes
 

2161
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,430
would be in different case sizes
and one of the boys came up

2162
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:35,440
and one of the boys came up
 

2163
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,349
and one of the boys came up
at the end of the class and said

2164
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:37,359
at the end of the class and said
 

2165
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:38,630
at the end of the class and said
i've been thinking about how you'd do

2166
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
i've been thinking about how you'd do
 

2167
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,310
i've been thinking about how you'd do
this with a pentagon

2168
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,320
this with a pentagon
 

2169
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,790
this with a pentagon
and i said that's fantastic how do you

2170
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:42,800
and i said that's fantastic how do you
 

2171
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,390
and i said that's fantastic how do you
how what does it look like with pentagon

2172
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
how what does it look like with pentagon
 

2173
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,990
how what does it look like with pentagon
go you know find out see if you can

2174
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,000
go you know find out see if you can
 

2175
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,190
go you know find out see if you can
discover

2176
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,200
discover
 

2177
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,870
discover
so i didn't know he was going to come up

2178
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:48,880
so i didn't know he was going to come up
 

2179
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,870
so i didn't know he was going to come up
and say that and

2180
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:50,880
and say that and
 

2181
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,109
and say that and
i didn't have in my head like this is

2182
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:53,119
i didn't have in my head like this is
 

2183
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,030
i didn't have in my head like this is
the kid who could have this extension

2184
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:55,040
the kid who could have this extension
 

2185
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,790
the kid who could have this extension
task but

2186
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:56,800
task but
 

2187
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,589
task but
you can still do that as a teacher

2188
00:37:59,589 --> 00:37:59,599
you can still do that as a teacher
 

2189
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:01,349
you can still do that as a teacher
when kids get excited about something or

2190
00:38:01,349 --> 00:38:01,359
when kids get excited about something or
 

2191
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,430
when kids get excited about something or
they're doing well in something have

2192
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
they're doing well in something have
 

2193
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,990
they're doing well in something have
them extend it go further

2194
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:06,000
them extend it go further
 

2195
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,390
them extend it go further
it's great and then you also like this

2196
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
it's great and then you also like this
 

2197
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,270
it's great and then you also like this
is like

2198
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:09,280
is like
 

2199
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,589
is like
teacher and coach

2200
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:11,599
teacher and coach
 

2201
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,030
teacher and coach
you could say it in different ways to

2202
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:13,040
you could say it in different ways to
 

2203
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,109
you could say it in different ways to
different students like for me the right

2204
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:15,119
different students like for me the right
 

2205
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,030
different students like for me the right
thing to say is uh

2206
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,040
thing to say is uh
 

2207
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,550
thing to say is uh
almost to say

2208
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:18,560
almost to say
 

2209
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,390
almost to say
uh i don't think you could do this this

2210
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:20,400
uh i don't think you could do this this
 

2211
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,550
uh i don't think you could do this this
is too hard like that's what i need to

2212
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:22,560
is too hard like that's what i need to
 

2213
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,790
is too hard like that's what i need to
hear it's just like no i you know you

2214
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:24,800
hear it's just like no i you know you
 

2215
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,870
hear it's just like no i you know you
there's an immediate push but with some

2216
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
there's an immediate push but with some
 

2217
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,030
there's an immediate push but with some
people if they're a little bit more

2218
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:29,040
people if they're a little bit more
 

2219
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,030
people if they're a little bit more
i mean it all has to do with upbringing

2220
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:31,040
i mean it all has to do with upbringing
 

2221
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,109
i mean it all has to do with upbringing
how your genetics is

2222
00:38:33,109 --> 00:38:33,119
how your genetics is
 

2223
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,950
how your genetics is
they might be much more that might break

2224
00:38:34,950 --> 00:38:34,960
they might be much more that might break
 

2225
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,870
they might be much more that might break
them yeah that might break them so you

2226
00:38:36,870 --> 00:38:36,880
them yeah that might break them so you
 

2227
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,550
them yeah that might break them so you
have to be also sensitive to that i mean

2228
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:38,560
have to be also sensitive to that i mean
 

2229
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,230
have to be also sensitive to that i mean
teaching is really difficult it's really

2230
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:40,240
teaching is really difficult it's really
 

2231
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,270
teaching is really difficult it's really
difficult for this very reason it is

2232
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:43,280
difficult for this very reason it is
 

2233
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,710
difficult for this very reason it is
so um what is the best way

2234
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:46,720
so um what is the best way
 

2235
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,430
so um what is the best way
to teach math to learn math at those

2236
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:49,440
to teach math to learn math at those
 

2237
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,510
to teach math to learn math at those
early few days when you just want to

2238
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:51,520
early few days when you just want to
 

2239
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,670
early few days when you just want to
capture them

2240
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:53,680
capture them
 

2241
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,589
capture them
i do something actually there's a video

2242
00:38:55,589 --> 00:38:55,599
i do something actually there's a video
 

2243
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,069

of me doing this on our website

2244
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:58,079
of me doing this on our website
 

2245
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,589
of me doing this on our website
that i love when i first

that i love when i first
 

2247
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,109
that i love when i first
meet students

2248
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
meet students
 

2249
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,270
meet students
and this is what i do i show

and this is what i do i show
 

2251
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,109
and this is what i do i show
them a picture this is the picture i

2252
00:39:07,109 --> 00:39:07,119
them a picture this is the picture i
 

2253
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,150
them a picture this is the picture i

show them
 

2255
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,470
show them
and it's a picture of seven dots like

2256
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:10,480
and it's a picture of seven dots like
 

2257
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,950
and it's a picture of seven dots like
this

2258
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:12,960

 

2259
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,109

and i show it for just a few seconds and

2260
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:15,119
and i show it for just a few seconds and
 

2261
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,630
and i show it for just a few seconds and
i say to them i'd like you to tell me

2262
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:16,640
i say to them i'd like you to tell me
 

2263
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,150
i say to them i'd like you to tell me
how many dots there are but i don't need

2264
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:18,160
how many dots there are but i don't need
 

2265
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,910
how many dots there are but i don't need
to count them i'm going to group the

2266
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:19,920
to count them i'm going to group the
 

2267
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,870
to count them i'm going to group the
dots and i show it them and then i

2268
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:22,880
dots and i show it them and then i
 

2269
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,349
dots and i show it them and then i
i i take it away before they've even had

2270
00:39:25,349 --> 00:39:25,359
i i take it away before they've even had
 

2271
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:27,430
i i take it away before they've even had
enough time to count them and then i

2272
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:27,440
enough time to count them and then i
 

2273
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,750
enough time to count them and then i
asked them so how did you see it

2274
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:29,760
asked them so how did you see it
 

2275
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,430
asked them so how did you see it
and i go around the room and

2276
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:33,440
and i go around the room and
 

2277
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,870
and i go around the room and
amazingly enough

2278
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:34,880
amazingly enough
 

2279
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,030
amazingly enough
there's probably 18 different ways of

2280
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,040
there's probably 18 different ways of
 

2281
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,190
there's probably 18 different ways of
seeing these seven dots

2282
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:39,200
seeing these seven dots
 

2283
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,589
seeing these seven dots
and so i asked people tell me how how

2284
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:41,599
and so i asked people tell me how how
 

2285
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,190
and so i asked people tell me how how
you grouped it and some people see it as

2286
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,200
you grouped it and some people see it as
 

2287
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,670
you grouped it and some people see it as
like an outside hole with a center dot

2288
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:45,680
like an outside hole with a center dot
 

2289
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,910
like an outside hole with a center dot
some people see like stripes

2290
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
some people see like stripes
 

2291
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,190
some people see like stripes
of lines

2292
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:49,200
of lines
 

2293
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,670
of lines
some people see segments

2294
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:51,680
some people see segments
 

2295
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,190
some people see segments
and i collect them all and i put them on

2296
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:53,200
and i collect them all and i put them on
 

2297
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,790
and i collect them all and i put them on
the board and at the end i say look at

2298
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:54,800
the board and at the end i say look at
 

2299
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:57,430
the board and at the end i say look at
this we are a class of 30 kids and we

2300
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
this we are a class of 30 kids and we
 

2301
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,589
this we are a class of 30 kids and we
saw these seven dots in 18 different

2302
00:39:59,589 --> 00:39:59,599
saw these seven dots in 18 different
 

2303
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,270
saw these seven dots in 18 different
ways there's actually a mathematical

2304
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
ways there's actually a mathematical
 

2305
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,829
ways there's actually a mathematical
term for this it's called groupitizing

2306
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
term for this it's called groupitizing
 

2307
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,990
term for this it's called groupitizing
groupitizing yeah

2308
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,000
groupitizing yeah
 

2309
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,309
groupitizing yeah
i like it it's kind of cool so

2310
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:08,319
i like it it's kind of cool so
 

2311
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,630
i like it it's kind of cool so
turns out though that how well you

2312
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:10,640
turns out though that how well you
 

2313
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:13,430
turns out though that how well you
groupitize predicts

2314
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:13,440
groupitize predicts
 

2315
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,430
groupitize predicts
how well you do in maths

2316
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:15,440
how well you do in maths
 

2317
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,390
how well you do in maths
is is it uh is it a raw talent or is it

2318
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:18,400
is is it uh is it a raw talent or is it
 

2319
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,510
is is it uh is it a raw talent or is it
just something that you can develop i

2320
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,520
just something that you can develop i
 

2321
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,190
just something that you can develop i
think it's i don't think you're born

2322
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:21,200
think it's i don't think you're born
 

2323
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,430
think it's i don't think you're born
groupitizing i think but some kids have

2324
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:23,440
groupitizing i think but some kids have
 

2325
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,270
groupitizing i think but some kids have
developed that

2326
00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:25,280
developed that
 

2327
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,910
developed that
um ability if you like and you can learn

2328
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:27,920
um ability if you like and you can learn
 

2329
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,150
um ability if you like and you can learn
it you can so

2330
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:30,160
it you can so
 

2331
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,589
it you can so
this to me is part of how wrong we have

2332
00:40:33,589 --> 00:40:33,599
this to me is part of how wrong we have
 

2333
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,750
this to me is part of how wrong we have
maths that we think to tell whether a

2334
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:35,760
maths that we think to tell whether a
 

2335
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,950
maths that we think to tell whether a
kid's good at maths we're going to give

2336
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:36,960
kid's good at maths we're going to give
 

2337
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,950
kid's good at maths we're going to give
them a speed test on

2338
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:38,960
them a speed test on
 

2339
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,150
them a speed test on
fact on multiples but actually

2340
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:42,160
fact on multiples but actually
 

2341
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,309
fact on multiples but actually
seeing how kids group dots could be a

2342
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:44,319
seeing how kids group dots could be a
 

2343
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,030
seeing how kids group dots could be a
more important assessment of how well

2344
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:47,040
more important assessment of how well
 

2345
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,950
more important assessment of how well
they're going to do maths anyway i

2346
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:48,960
they're going to do maths anyway i
 

2347
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,349
they're going to do maths anyway i
diverge what i like to do though when i

2348
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:51,359
diverge what i like to do though when i
 

2349
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:53,270
diverge what i like to do though when i
start off with kids is show them i'm

2350
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:53,280
start off with kids is show them i'm
 

2351
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,550
start off with kids is show them i'm
going to give you math problems i'm

2352
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:54,560
going to give you math problems i'm
 

2353
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,990
going to give you math problems i'm
going to value the different ways you

2354
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,000
going to value the different ways you
 

2355
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,030
going to value the different ways you
see them

2356
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
see them
 

2357
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,150
see them
and

2358
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
and
 

2359
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,349
and
turns out you can do this kind of

2360
00:40:59,349 --> 00:40:59,359
turns out you can do this kind of
 

2361
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,030
turns out you can do this kind of
problem asking people how they group

2362
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,040
problem asking people how they group
 

2363
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,910
problem asking people how they group
dots with young children or with

2364
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:03,920
dots with young children or with
 

2365
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:06,630
dots with young children or with
graduate students and it's

2366
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:06,640
graduate students and it's
 

2367
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,510
graduate students and it's
engaging for all of them

2368
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
engaging for all of them
 

2369
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,829
engaging for all of them
is uh you talk about creativity a little

2370
00:41:11,829 --> 00:41:11,839
is uh you talk about creativity a little
 

2371
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,589
is uh you talk about creativity a little
bit and flexibility

2372
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:13,599
bit and flexibility
 

2373
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,829
bit and flexibility
in your book limitless what's the role

2374
00:41:15,829 --> 00:41:15,839
in your book limitless what's the role
 

2375
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,910
in your book limitless what's the role
of that so it sounds like there's a bit

2376
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:17,920
of that so it sounds like there's a bit
 

2377
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,030
of that so it sounds like there's a bit
of that

2378
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,040
of that
 

2379
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,589
of that
kind of thing involved in

2380
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:21,599
kind of thing involved in
 

2381
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,510
kind of thing involved in
grupotizing yeah

2382
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:23,520
grupotizing yeah
 

2383
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,550
grupotizing yeah
yeah i love this term so what's what

2384
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:26,560
yeah i love this term so what's what
 

2385
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,390
yeah i love this term so what's what
would you say is the role of creativity

2386
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:28,400
would you say is the role of creativity
 

2387
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,550
would you say is the role of creativity
and flexibility in in the learning of

2388
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:30,560
and flexibility in in the learning of
 

2389
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,910
and flexibility in in the learning of
math i think what we know now is that

2390
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:33,920
math i think what we know now is that
 

2391
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,910
math i think what we know now is that
what we need for this

2392
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:35,920
what we need for this
 

2393
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,950
what we need for this
21st century world we live in

2394
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:38,960
21st century world we live in
 

2395
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,670
21st century world we live in
is a flexible mind

2396
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:41,680
is a flexible mind
 

2397
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,510
is a flexible mind
it's school should not really be about

2398
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:43,520
it's school should not really be about
 

2399
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,589
it's school should not really be about
teaching kids particular methods but

2400
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:45,599
teaching kids particular methods but
 

2401
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,950
teaching kids particular methods but
teaching them to

2402
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:46,960
teaching them to
 

2403
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,430
teaching them to
approach problems with flexibility

2404
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:49,440
approach problems with flexibility
 

2405
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,270
approach problems with flexibility
being creative thinking creatively is

2406
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:51,280
being creative thinking creatively is
 

2407
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,790
being creative thinking creatively is
really important

2408
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:52,800
really important
 

2409
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,589
really important
so people don't think the words maths

2410
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:55,599
so people don't think the words maths
 

2411
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,550
so people don't think the words maths
and creativity come together but i

2412
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:58,560
and creativity come together but i
 

2413
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,470
and creativity come together but i
that's what i love about maths is the

2414
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:00,480
that's what i love about maths is the
 

2415
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,790
that's what i love about maths is the
creative different ways you can see it

2416
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:02,800
creative different ways you can see it
 

2417
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,990
creative different ways you can see it
and so helping our kids

2418
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:06,000
and so helping our kids
 

2419
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,510
and so helping our kids
there's a book

2420
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:07,520
there's a book
 

2421
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,870
there's a book
i like a lot but i've been by physicists

2422
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
i like a lot but i've been by physicists
 

2423
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,069
i like a lot but i've been by physicists
you probably know this book could

2424
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
you probably know this book could
 

2425
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:13,910
you probably know this book could
elastic

2426
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:13,920
elastic
 

2427
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,670
elastic
you might know it um

2428
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:15,680
you might know it um
 

2429
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,390
you might know it um
and it's about how we want elastic minds

2430
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:18,400
and it's about how we want elastic minds
 

2431
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,150
and it's about how we want elastic minds
same kind of thing flexible creative

2432
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:20,160
same kind of thing flexible creative
 

2433
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,430
same kind of thing flexible creative
minds

2434
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:21,440
minds
 

2435
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,710
minds
and

2436
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:22,720
and
 

2437
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,069
and
schools

2438
00:42:24,069 --> 00:42:24,079
schools
 

2439
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,150
schools
do very little on developing that kind

2440
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:26,160
do very little on developing that kind
 

2441
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,309
do very little on developing that kind
of mind they do a lot

2442
00:42:28,309 --> 00:42:28,319
of mind they do a lot
 

2443
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:32,150
of mind they do a lot
of developing the kind of mind that a

2444
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:32,160
of developing the kind of mind that a
 

2445
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,829
of developing the kind of mind that a
computer now

2446
00:42:33,829 --> 00:42:33,839
computer now
 

2447
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,190
computer now
does for us

2448
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:35,200
does for us
 

2449
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,230
does for us
memorization memorization

2450
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:38,240
memorization memorization
 

2451
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,390
memorization memorization
doing procedures

2452
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:40,400
doing procedures
 

2453
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,790
doing procedures
a lot of things that we spend a lot of

2454
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:42,800
a lot of things that we spend a lot of
 

2455
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,270
a lot of things that we spend a lot of
time in school on

2456
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
time in school on
 

2457
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,510
time in school on
in the world when kids leave school a

2458
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:47,520
in the world when kids leave school a
 

2459
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,510
in the world when kids leave school a
computer will do that

2460
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:49,520
computer will do that
 

2461
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,470
computer will do that
and

2462
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:50,480
and
 

2463
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,470
and
better than they will

2464
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:52,480
better than they will
 

2465
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,710
better than they will
but that creative flexible thinking

2466
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:54,720
but that creative flexible thinking
 

2467
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,750
but that creative flexible thinking
we're kind of

2468
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:55,760
we're kind of
 

2469
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,589
we're kind of
ground zero at computers being able to

2470
00:42:57,589 --> 00:42:57,599
ground zero at computers being able to
 

2471
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,349
ground zero at computers being able to
engage in that thinking

2472
00:42:59,349 --> 00:42:59,359
engage in that thinking
 

2473
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,870
engage in that thinking
maybe we're a little above ground zero

2474
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:00,880
maybe we're a little above ground zero
 

2475
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,190
maybe we're a little above ground zero
but um the human brain is perfectly

2476
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:05,200
but um the human brain is perfectly
 

2477
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,109
but um the human brain is perfectly
suited for that creative flexible

2478
00:43:07,109 --> 00:43:07,119
suited for that creative flexible
 

2479
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:08,790
suited for that creative flexible
thinking that's what humans are so great

2480
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
thinking that's what humans are so great
 

2481
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,829
thinking that's what humans are so great
at

2482
00:43:09,829 --> 00:43:09,839
at
 

2483
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,510
at
so i would like the balance to shift in

2484
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:11,520
so i would like the balance to shift in
 

2485
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,430
so i would like the balance to shift in
schools maybe you still need to do some

2486
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
schools maybe you still need to do some
 

2487
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,829
schools maybe you still need to do some
procedural kind of thinking but there

2488
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
procedural kind of thinking but there
 

2489
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,589
procedural kind of thinking but there
should be a lot more of that creative

2490
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:17,599
should be a lot more of that creative
 

2491
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,150
should be a lot more of that creative
flexible thinking

2492
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
flexible thinking
 

2493
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,030
flexible thinking
and uh what's the role of other humans

2494
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
and uh what's the role of other humans
 

2495
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,829
and uh what's the role of other humans
in this picture so

2496
00:43:24,829 --> 00:43:24,839
in this picture so
 

2497
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:26,470
in this picture so
collaborative

2498
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,480
collaborative
 

2499
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,349
collaborative
yeah learning so brainstorming together

2500
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
yeah learning so brainstorming together
 

2501
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,390
yeah learning so brainstorming together
so creativity as it emerges from

2502
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:32,400
so creativity as it emerges from
 

2503
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,230
so creativity as it emerges from
the collective intelligence of multiple

2504
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,240
the collective intelligence of multiple
 

2505
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:35,670
the collective intelligence of multiple
humans yeah

2506
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:35,680
humans yeah
 

2507
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,190
humans yeah
super important and

2508
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:37,200
super important and
 

2509
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,150
super important and
um we know that also helps develop your

2510
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:40,160
um we know that also helps develop your
 

2511
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:42,950
um we know that also helps develop your
brain that social side of thinking and i

2512
00:43:42,950 --> 00:43:42,960
brain that social side of thinking and i
 

2513
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,030
brain that social side of thinking and i
love mathematics collaboration where

2514
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:45,040
love mathematics collaboration where
 

2515
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,430
love mathematics collaboration where
people build on each other's ideas

2516
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:47,440
people build on each other's ideas
 

2517
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,750
people build on each other's ideas
and they come up with amazing things i

2518
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:49,760
and they come up with amazing things i
 

2519
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,069
and they come up with amazing things i
actually taught a hundred

2520
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
actually taught a hundred
 

2521
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:56,069
actually taught a hundred
students calculus at stanford recently

2522
00:43:56,069 --> 00:43:56,079
students calculus at stanford recently
 

2523
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:57,750
students calculus at stanford recently
undergrads and

2524
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:57,760
undergrads and
 

2525
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,910
undergrads and
we taught them to collaborate so these

2526
00:43:59,910 --> 00:43:59,920
we taught them to collaborate so these
 

2527
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,670
we taught them to collaborate so these
students came into stanford and most of

2528
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
students came into stanford and most of
 

2529
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,990
students came into stanford and most of
them were against collaboration

2530
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:04,000
them were against collaboration
 

2531
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,670
them were against collaboration
in maths this is before covered in

2532
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,680
in maths this is before covered in
 

2533
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,990
in maths this is before covered in
person yeah it was just before covert

2534
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
person yeah it was just before covert
 

2535
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,230
person yeah it was just before covert
hit it was 2019.

2536
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:10,240
hit it was 2019.
 

2537
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,230
hit it was 2019.
and um

2538
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:12,240
and um
 

2539
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:15,829
and um
you said they're against uh so yeah so

2540
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:15,839
you said they're against uh so yeah so
 

2541
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:17,990
you said they're against uh so yeah so
it's really interesting so they'd only

2542
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:18,000
it's really interesting so they'd only
 

2543
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,309
it's really interesting so they'd only
experience maths individually as in a

2544
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:20,319
experience maths individually as in a
 

2545
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,150
experience maths individually as in a
kind of competitive individual way and

2546
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:22,160
kind of competitive individual way and
 

2547
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,550
kind of competitive individual way and
if they had experienced it as group work

2548
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:24,560
if they had experienced it as group work
 

2549
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,950
if they had experienced it as group work
it had been a bad experience like maybe

2550
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
it had been a bad experience like maybe
 

2551
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,030
it had been a bad experience like maybe
they were the one who did it all and the

2552
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:29,040
they were the one who did it all and the
 

2553
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:30,470
they were the one who did it all and the
others didn't

2554
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:30,480
others didn't
 

2555
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,470
others didn't
do much so they were kind of against

2556
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:32,480
do much so they were kind of against
 

2557
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,069
do much so they were kind of against
collaboration they didn't see any role

2558
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
collaboration they didn't see any role
 

2559
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,470
collaboration they didn't see any role
for it in maths and we taught them to

2560
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,480
for it in maths and we taught them to
 

2561
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,309
for it in maths and we taught them to
collaborate

2562
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:38,319
collaborate
 

2563
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,870
collaborate
and it was hard work because

2564
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:40,880
and it was hard work because
 

2565
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,470
and it was hard work because
as well as the fact that they were kind

2566
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:42,480
as well as the fact that they were kind
 

2567
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,910
as well as the fact that they were kind
of against collaboration they came in

2568
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
of against collaboration they came in
 

2569
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,430
of against collaboration they came in
with a lot of like

2570
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:45,440
with a lot of like
 

2571
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,349
with a lot of like
social comparison

2572
00:44:47,349 --> 00:44:47,359
social comparison
 

2573
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,390
social comparison
thinking

2574
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:48,400
thinking
 

2575
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,870
thinking
so i'm in this room with other stanford

2576
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:50,880
so i'm in this room with other stanford
 

2577
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,430
so i'm in this room with other stanford
undergrads and they're better than me or

2578
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
undergrads and they're better than me or
 

2579
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,950
undergrads and they're better than me or
so when we send them to work on a maths

2580
00:44:54,950 --> 00:44:54,960
so when we send them to work on a maths
 

2581
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,390
so when we send them to work on a maths
problem together the first one was kind

2582
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:56,400
problem together the first one was kind
 

2583
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,390
problem together the first one was kind
of a disaster because they were all like

2584
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:58,400
of a disaster because they were all like
 

2585
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,750
of a disaster because they were all like
they're better than me they're faster

2586
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
they're better than me they're faster
 

2587
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:01,270
they're better than me they're faster
than me they came up with something i

2588
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:01,280
than me they came up with something i
 

2589
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,550
than me they came up with something i
didn't come up with

2590
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:02,560
didn't come up with
 

2591
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,710
didn't come up with
so we taught them

2592
00:45:04,710 --> 00:45:04,720
so we taught them
 

2593
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,870
so we taught them
to let go of that thinking and to work

2594
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:06,880
to let go of that thinking and to work
 

2595
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,470
to let go of that thinking and to work
well together

2596
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,480
well together
 

2597
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,630
well together
and one of the things we did we decided

2598
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:10,640
and one of the things we did we decided
 

2599
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,470
and one of the things we did we decided
we wanted to do a pre and post test at

2600
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:12,480
we wanted to do a pre and post test at
 

2601
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,390
we wanted to do a pre and post test at
the end of this teaching it was only

2602
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:14,400
the end of this teaching it was only
 

2603
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,630
the end of this teaching it was only
four weeks long but we knew we didn't

2604
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:16,640
four weeks long but we knew we didn't
 

2605
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,390
four weeks long but we knew we didn't
want to give them like a timed test of

2606
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:18,400
want to give them like a timed test of
 

2607
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,950
want to give them like a timed test of
individual work so we gave them

2608
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:20,960
individual work so we gave them
 

2609
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,390
individual work so we gave them
an applied problem to do at the

2610
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:22,400
an applied problem to do at the
 

2611
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,510
an applied problem to do at the
beginning

2612
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
beginning
 

2613
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:26,069
beginning
and we gave them to do in pairs together

2614
00:45:26,069 --> 00:45:26,079
and we gave them to do in pairs together
 

2615
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:27,349
and we gave them to do in pairs together
and we gave each of them a different

2616
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:27,359
and we gave each of them a different
 

2617
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,990
and we gave each of them a different
colored pen and said work on this

2618
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:30,000
colored pen and said work on this
 

2619
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,990
colored pen and said work on this
activity together and keep using that

2620
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
activity together and keep using that
 

2621
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:32,870
activity together and keep using that
pen

2622
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:32,880
pen
 

2623
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,630
pen
so then we had all these pieces of

2624
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:34,640
so then we had all these pieces of
 

2625
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,710
so then we had all these pieces of
student work and what we saw was they

2626
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:36,720
student work and what we saw was they
 

2627
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,670
student work and what we saw was they
just were on separate parts of the paper

2628
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:39,680
just were on separate parts of the paper
 

2629
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,910
just were on separate parts of the paper
uh so this little like red pen section

2630
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:41,920
uh so this little like red pen section
 

2631
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,589
uh so this little like red pen section
and a green pen section

2632
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:43,599
and a green pen section
 

2633
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,829
and a green pen section
and they didn't do that well on it

2634
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:45,839
and they didn't do that well on it
 

2635
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,589
and they didn't do that well on it
even though it was a

2636
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:47,599
even though it was a
 

2637
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,349
even though it was a
problem that middle or high school kids

2638
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:49,359
problem that middle or high school kids
 

2639
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,390
problem that middle or high school kids
could do but it was like a

2640
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
could do but it was like a
 

2641
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,550
could do but it was like a
problem-solving kind of problem

2642
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
problem-solving kind of problem
 

2643
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,309
problem-solving kind of problem
and then we gave them the same one to do

2644
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:54,319
and then we gave them the same one to do
 

2645
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,309
and then we gave them the same one to do
at the end gave them the same colors and

2646
00:45:56,309 --> 00:45:56,319
at the end gave them the same colors and
 

2647
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,990
at the end gave them the same colors and
it actually they had learned to

2648
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
it actually they had learned to
 

2649
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,230
it actually they had learned to
collaborate and not only were they

2650
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
collaborate and not only were they
 

2651
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,150
collaborate and not only were they
collaborating the second time around but

2652
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:02,160
collaborating the second time around but
 

2653
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,150
collaborating the second time around but
that boosted their achievement and the

2654
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:04,160
that boosted their achievement and the
 

2655
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,470
that boosted their achievement and the
ones who collaborated did better on the

2656
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:06,480
ones who collaborated did better on the
 

2657
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,750
ones who collaborated did better on the
problem

2658
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:07,760
problem
 

2659
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,069
problem
collaboration is important having people

2660
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:10,079
collaboration is important having people
 

2661
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,910
collaboration is important having people
and what was so eye-opening for these

2662
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:11,920
and what was so eye-opening for these
 

2663
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,069
and what was so eye-opening for these
undergrads and they talked about it in

2664
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:14,079
undergrads and they talked about it in
 

2665
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,309
undergrads and they talked about it in
lovely ways was

2666
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
lovely ways was
 

2667
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,470
lovely ways was

i learned to value other people's
 

2669
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,710
i learned to value other people's
thinking on a problem and i learned to

2670
00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:20,720
thinking on a problem and i learned to
 

2671
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,710
thinking on a problem and i learned to
value that other people saw it in

2672
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:22,720
value that other people saw it in
 

2673

big experience for them
 

2681
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,670
big experience for them
that they came out thinking you know i

2682
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:31,680
that they came out thinking you know i
 

2683

that they came out thinking you know i
can do maths with other people people

2684
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:33,760
can do maths with other people people
 

2685
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,430
can do maths with other people people
can see it differently we can build on

2686
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:35,440
can see it differently we can build on
 

2687
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,950

00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:41,839
kahneman has
 

2695
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,990
kahneman has
got a chance to interact with him

2696
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
got a chance to interact with him
 

2697
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,470
got a chance to interact with him
and like the first because he had

2698
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:46,480
and like the first because he had
 

2699
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,670

a few but
 

2701
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,990
a few but
one famous collaboration throughout his

2702
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
one famous collaboration throughout his
 

2703
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,030
one famous collaboration throughout his
life

2704
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
life
 

2705
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,390
life
uh with taversky and

2706
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:54,400
uh with taversky and
 

2707
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,589
uh with taversky and
just like

2708
00:46:55,589 --> 00:46:55,599
just like
 

2709
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,910
just like
you know he hasn't met me before uh in

2710
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:57,920
you know he hasn't met me before uh in
 

2711
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,470
you know he hasn't met me before uh in
person but just the number of questions

2712
00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:00,480
person but just the number of questions
 

2713
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,030
person but just the number of questions
he was asking just the curiosity

2714
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,040
he was asking just the curiosity
 

2715
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,430
he was asking just the curiosity
so i think one of the skills

2716
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:05,440
so i think one of the skills
 

2717
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,829
so i think one of the skills
the collaboration itself is a skill

2718
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:07,839
the collaboration itself is a skill
 

2719
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,309
the collaboration itself is a skill
and i remember my experience with him

2720
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:10,319
and i remember my experience with him
 

2721
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,470
and i remember my experience with him
was like okay i get why you're so good

2722
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
was like okay i get why you're so good
 

2723
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,990
was like okay i get why you're so good
at collaboration

2724
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:14,000
at collaboration
 

2725
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,390
at collaboration
because he was just extremely good at

2726
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:16,400
because he was just extremely good at
 

2727
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,870
because he was just extremely good at
listening and genuine

2728
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:18,880
listening and genuine
 

2729
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,349
listening and genuine
curiosity about how the other person

2730
00:47:21,349 --> 00:47:21,359
curiosity about how the other person
 

2731
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,349
curiosity about how the other person
thinks about the world sees the world

2732
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
thinks about the world sees the world
 

2733
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,829
thinks about the world sees the world
and then together he's he pulled me in

2734
00:47:25,829 --> 00:47:25,839
and then together he's he pulled me in
 

2735
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:27,430
and then together he's he pulled me in
in that particular case

2736
00:47:27,430 --> 00:47:27,440
in that particular case
 

2737
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,589
in that particular case
he doesn't know in particular like that

2738
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:29,599
he doesn't know in particular like that
 

2739
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,430
he doesn't know in particular like that
much about autonomous vehicles but he

2740
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:31,440
much about autonomous vehicles but he
 

2741
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,710
much about autonomous vehicles but he
kept like

2742
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:32,720
kept like
 

2743
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,430
kept like
asking all these questions and then like

2744
00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:35,440
asking all these questions and then like
 

2745
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,270
asking all these questions and then like
10 minutes in we're together trying to

2746
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
10 minutes in we're together trying to
 

2747
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,829
10 minutes in we're together trying to
solve the problem of autonomous driving

2748
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:39,839
solve the problem of autonomous driving
 

2749
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:41,589
solve the problem of autonomous driving
and like and that

2750
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:41,599
and like and that
 

2751
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,109
and like and that
i mean that's really fulfilling that's

2752
00:47:43,109 --> 00:47:43,119
i mean that's really fulfilling that's
 

2753
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,270
i mean that's really fulfilling that's
really enriching but it also in that

2754
00:47:45,270 --> 00:47:45,280
really enriching but it also in that
 

2755
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,270
really enriching but it also in that
moment made me realize it's kind of a

2756
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:47,280
moment made me realize it's kind of a
 

2757
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,950
moment made me realize it's kind of a
skill because you have to kind of put

2758
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:48,960
skill because you have to kind of put
 

2759
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,589
skill because you have to kind of put
your ego aside yep put your view of the

2760
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
your ego aside yep put your view of the
 

2761
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:53,990
your ego aside yep put your view of the
world aside and try to learn how the

2762
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:54,000
world aside and try to learn how the
 

2763
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,670
world aside and try to learn how the
other person right

2764
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:55,680
other person right
 

2765
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,030
other person right
and the other thing you have to put

2766
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
and the other thing you have to put
 

2767
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,549
and the other thing you have to put
aside is this social comparison thinking

2768
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:00,559
aside is this social comparison thinking
 

2769
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:01,829
aside is this social comparison thinking
like if you

2770
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
like if you
 

2771
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,829
like if you
are sitting there thinking wow that was

2772
00:48:03,829 --> 00:48:03,839
are sitting there thinking wow that was
 

2773
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,750
are sitting there thinking wow that was
an amazing idea he's so much better than

2774
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:05,760
an amazing idea he's so much better than
 

2775
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:09,109
an amazing idea he's so much better than
i am that's really gonna stop you

2776
00:48:09,109 --> 00:48:09,119
i am that's really gonna stop you
 

2777
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,069
i am that's really gonna stop you
taking on the value of that idea

2778
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:12,079
taking on the value of that idea
 

2779
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,150
taking on the value of that idea
and so there's a lot of that going on

2780
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:14,160
and so there's a lot of that going on
 

2781
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,670
and so there's a lot of that going on
between these stanford students when

2782
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:15,680
between these stanford students when
 

2783
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,349
between these stanford students when
they came

2784
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
they came
 

2785
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:18,829
they came
and

2786
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:18,839
and
 

2787
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:20,950
and
yeah but trying to help them let go of

2788
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:20,960
yeah but trying to help them let go of
 

2789
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:21,750
yeah but trying to help them let go of
that

2790
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:21,760
that
 

2791
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,230
that
one of the things i've discovered

2792
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:24,240
one of the things i've discovered
 

2793
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,910
one of the things i've discovered
just because being a little bit more in

2794
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:25,920
just because being a little bit more in
 

2795
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,349
just because being a little bit more in
the public eye

2796
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:27,359
the public eye
 

2797
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:30,630
the public eye
how rewarding it is to celebrate others

2798
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
how rewarding it is to celebrate others
 

2799
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,670
how rewarding it is to celebrate others
yeah and how much is going to actually

2800
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
yeah and how much is going to actually
 

2801
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:35,990
yeah and how much is going to actually
pay off in the long term yeah so this

2802
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:36,000
pay off in the long term yeah so this
 

2803
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,630
pay off in the long term yeah so this
kind of silo thinking of like i want to

2804
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:38,640
kind of silo thinking of like i want to
 

2805
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,109
kind of silo thinking of like i want to
prove to a small set of people around me

2806
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:41,119
prove to a small set of people around me
 

2807
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,109
prove to a small set of people around me
that i'm really smart

2808
00:48:43,109 --> 00:48:43,119
that i'm really smart
 

2809
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:43,990
that i'm really smart
and

2810
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:44,000
and
 

2811
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,190
and
do so

2812
00:48:45,190 --> 00:48:45,200
do so
 

2813
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,910
do so
by basically not celebrating how smart

2814
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:47,920
by basically not celebrating how smart
 

2815
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:49,589
by basically not celebrating how smart
the other people are that's actually

2816
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:49,599
the other people are that's actually
 

2817
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,430
the other people are that's actually
maybe short term

2818
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:51,440
maybe short term
 

2819
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:53,349
maybe short term
it seems like a good strategy but long

2820
00:48:53,349 --> 00:48:53,359
it seems like a good strategy but long
 

2821
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,190
it seems like a good strategy but long
term it's not and i think if you

2822
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:55,200
term it's not and i think if you
 

2823
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:56,710
term it's not and i think if you
practice at the student level and then

2824
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:56,720
practice at the student level and then
 

2825
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,870
practice at the student level and then
at the career la at every single stage i

2826
00:48:58,870 --> 00:48:58,880
at the career la at every single stage i
 

2827
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,950
at the career la at every single stage i
think that's ultimately i i agree with

2828
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:00,960
think that's ultimately i i agree with
 

2829
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:02,309
think that's ultimately i i agree with
you i think that's a really good way of

2830
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:02,319
you i think that's a really good way of
 

2831
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:04,309
you i think that's a really good way of
thinking about it

2832
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
thinking about it
 

2833
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:07,190
thinking about it
you mentioned textbooks you said and you

2834
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:07,200
you mentioned textbooks you said and you
 

2835
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,950
you mentioned textbooks you said and you
didn't say it

2836
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:08,960
didn't say it
 

2837
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,150
didn't say it
you know

2838
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:10,160
you know
 

2839
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,190
you know
um

2840
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:11,200
um
 

2841
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,829
um
maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to

2842
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:13,839
maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to
 

2843
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,870
maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to
teach mathematics but i i love textbooks

2844
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:16,880
teach mathematics but i i love textbooks
 

2845
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,549
teach mathematics but i i love textbooks
there's they're like pretty pictures and

2846
00:49:18,549 --> 00:49:18,559
there's they're like pretty pictures and
 

2847
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:20,150
there's they're like pretty pictures and
they smell nice and they open i mean i

2848
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:20,160
they smell nice and they open i mean i
 

2849
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,150
they smell nice and they open i mean i

2857
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,430
like because they're really well done
when we're talking about basic like high

easy honestly
 

2891
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,910
easy honestly
it felt hard at the time but you're

2892
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
it felt hard at the time but you're
 

2893

it felt hard at the time but you're
basically doing a um

basically doing a um

you're just doing all those things
 

2913
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,910
you're just doing all those things
that's a good thing you're right but i

2914
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:29,920
that's a good thing you're right but i
 

2915
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,309
that's a good thing you're right but i
remember the textbooks weren't

2916
00:50:32,309 --> 00:50:32,319
remember the textbooks weren't
 

2917
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:33,270
remember the textbooks weren't
i mean

2918
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:33,280
i mean
 

2919
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,510
i mean
maybe i'm romanticizing the past but i

2920
00:50:35,510 --> 00:50:35,520
maybe i'm romanticizing the past but i
 

2921

good

2924
00:50:38,150 --> 00:50:38,160
good
 

2925
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,069
good
um but so you think what role do you

a lot of the kids
 

2993

our camp was just that there were no
 

2997
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,950

00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:48,960
books even though we gave them
 

2999
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:50,630
books even though we gave them
sheets of paper instead

3000
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:50,640
sheets of paper instead
 

3001
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,190
sheets of paper instead
they still felt more free

3002
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:53,200
they still felt more free
 

3003
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,109
they still felt more free
because they weren't just like trotting

3004
00:51:55,109 --> 00:51:55,119
because they weren't just like trotting
 

3005
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,069
because they weren't just like trotting
through exercises exercises

3006
00:51:58,069 --> 00:51:58,079
through exercises exercises
 

3007
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:01,430

like you're
 

3011
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,910
like you're
the the very thing you said they might

3012
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:05,920
the the very thing you said they might
 

3013
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,309
the the very thing you said they might
not like the two point yeah point three

3014
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:08,319
not like the two point yeah point three
 

3015
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,150
not like the two point yeah point three
two point if you feels like you're

3016
00:52:10,150 --> 00:52:10,160
two point if you feels like you're
 

3017
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,910
two point if you feels like you're
making progress and like it's little

3018
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:11,920
making progress and like it's little
 

3019
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,790
making progress and like it's little
celebrations because you do the problem

3020
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,800
celebrations because you do the problem
 

3021
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,470
celebrations because you do the problem
and it seems really hard and you don't

3022
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
and it seems really hard and you don't
 

3023
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,390
and it seems really hard and you don't
know how to do it and then you

3024
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:18,400
know how to do it and then you
 

3025
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,790
know how to do it and then you
try and try and then eventually succeed

3026
00:52:20,790 --> 00:52:20,800
try and try and then eventually succeed
 

3027
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,630
try and try and then eventually succeed
then you make that little step and yeah

3028
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:22,640
then you make that little step and yeah
 

3029
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:25,190
then you make that little step and yeah
further progress and then you get to the

3030
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
further progress and then you get to the
 

3031
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,109
further progress and then you get to the
end of a chapter and you get to like

3032
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:27,119
end of a chapter and you get to like
 

3033
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:28,790
end of a chapter and you get to like
it's closure you're like yeah all right

3034
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:28,800
it's closure you're like yeah all right
 

3035
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,150
it's closure you're like yeah all right
i got that figured out and then you go

3036
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,160
i got that figured out and then you go
 

3037
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,230
i got that figured out and then you go
on to the next chapter i can see that i

3038
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:32,240
on to the next chapter i can see that i
 

3039
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,510
on to the next chapter i can see that i
mean i think

3040
00:52:33,510 --> 00:52:33,520
mean i think
 

3041
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,549
mean i think
it could be in a textbook you can have

3042
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:36,559
it could be in a textbook you can have
 

3043
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,870
it could be in a textbook you can have
a good experience with a textbook

3044
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:38,880
a good experience with a textbook
 

3045
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,790
a good experience with a textbook
but it what's really important is what

3046
00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:40,800
but it what's really important is what
 

3047
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,109
but it what's really important is what
is what is in that textbook

3048
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:43,119
is what is in that textbook
 

3049
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,630
is what is in that textbook
what are you doing inside it and i mean

3050
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
what are you doing inside it and i mean
 

3051
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:49,349
what are you doing inside it and i mean
i grew up in england and in england we

3052
00:52:49,349 --> 00:52:49,359
i grew up in england and in england we
 

3053
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,430
i grew up in england and in england we
learn maths we don't have this

3054
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:51,440
learn maths we don't have this
 

3055
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,309
learn maths we don't have this
separation of algebra and geometry

3056
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:54,319
separation of algebra and geometry
 

3057
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:55,990
separation of algebra and geometry
and i don't think any other country

3058
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:56,000
and i don't think any other country
 

3059
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,150
and i don't think any other country
apart from the us has that

3060
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
apart from the us has that
 

3061
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,109
apart from the us has that
but

3062
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
but
 

3063
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,270
but
i look at kids in algebra classes where

3064
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:01,280
i look at kids in algebra classes where
 

3065
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:02,950
i look at kids in algebra classes where
they're doing algebra for a year and i

3066
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:02,960
they're doing algebra for a year and i
 

3067
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,109
they're doing algebra for a year and i
think i would have been pretty bored

3068
00:53:05,109 --> 00:53:05,119
think i would have been pretty bored
 

3069
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,430
think i would have been pretty bored
doing that

3070
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:07,440
doing that
 

3071
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,309
doing that
um

3072
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:08,319

of everything you're saying where it's a
bunch of sub-disciplines yeah i mean

3088
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
bunch of sub-disciplines yeah i mean
 

3089
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,750
bunch of sub-disciplines yeah i mean
mathematics is sure is supposed to be

3090
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:29,760
mathematics is sure is supposed to be
 

3091
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:30,630
mathematics is sure is supposed to be
the

3092
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:30,640
the
 

3093
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:31,670
the
uh

3094
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:31,680
uh
 

3095
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:33,910
uh
the map the different maths that you

3096
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:33,920
the map the different maths that you
 

3097
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,030
the map the different maths that you
look at

3098
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:35,040
look at
 

3099
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:38,069
look at
whether you think of that as topics like

3100
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:38,079
whether you think of that as topics like
 

3101
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,790
whether you think of that as topics like
geometry and probability or

3102
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:40,800
geometry and probability or
 

3103
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:41,750
geometry and probability or
or

3104
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:41,760
or
 

3105
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,589
or
i think of it as

3106
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:43,599
i think of it as
 

3107
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,430
i think of it as
maths is just multi-dimensional lots of

3108
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440
maths is just multi-dimensional lots of
 

3109
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,710
maths is just multi-dimensional lots of
ways but

3110
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:46,720
ways but
 

3111
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,710
ways but
that's why it was called mathematics and

3112
00:53:48,710 --> 00:53:48,720
that's why it was called mathematics and
 

3113
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,510
that's why it was called mathematics and
then it was shortened to maths and then

3114
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
then it was shortened to maths and then
 

3115
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,950
then it was shortened to maths and then
for some reason it was just math in the

3116
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
for some reason it was just math in the
 

3117
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,309
for some reason it was just math in the
us but

3118
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,319
us but
 

3119
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:57,829
us but
to me math has that more singular feel

3120
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:57,839
to me math has that more singular feel
 

3121
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,750
to me math has that more singular feel
to it and

3122
00:53:59,750 --> 00:53:59,760
to it and
 

3123
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:01,750
to it and
there's an expression here which is do

3124
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:01,760
there's an expression here which is do
 

3125
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,870
there's an expression here which is do
the math

3126
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:02,880
the math
 

3127
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,030
the math
which basically means do a calculation

3128
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:05,040
which basically means do a calculation
 

3129
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,510
which basically means do a calculation
that's what people mean by do the math

3130
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:07,520
that's what people mean by do the math
 

3131
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,910
that's what people mean by do the math
so i don't like that expression because

3132
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:09,920
so i don't like that expression because
 

3133
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,349
so i don't like that expression because
no math could be anything it doesn't

3134
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:11,359
no math could be anything it doesn't
 

3135
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,349
no math could be anything it doesn't
have to be calculation and

3136
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:13,359
have to be calculation and
 

3137
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,270
have to be calculation and
so yeah i like maths because it has more

3138
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:15,280
so yeah i like maths because it has more
 

3139
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,589
so yeah i like maths because it has more
of that broad feel to it yeah i love

3140
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:17,599
of that broad feel to it yeah i love
 

3141
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,109
of that broad feel to it yeah i love
that maths kind of emphasizes the

3142
00:54:19,109 --> 00:54:19,119
that maths kind of emphasizes the
 

3143
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,790
that maths kind of emphasizes the
multi-dimensional like yeah variety of

3144
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:20,800
multi-dimensional like yeah variety of
 

3145
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,790
multi-dimensional like yeah variety of
different different disciplines

3146
00:54:22,790 --> 00:54:22,800
different different disciplines
 

3147
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,270
different different disciplines
different approaches yeah

3148
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:25,280
different approaches yeah
 

3149
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,990
different approaches yeah
okay uh what so but outside of the

3150
00:54:27,990 --> 00:54:28,000
okay uh what so but outside of the
 

3151
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,790
okay uh what so but outside of the
textbook what do you

3152
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:30,800
textbook what do you
 

3153
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,670
textbook what do you
see like broadly being used you

3154
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
see like broadly being used you
 

3155
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,789
see like broadly being used you
mentioned sebastian through and moocs

3156
00:54:36,789 --> 00:54:36,799
mentioned sebastian through and moocs
 

3157
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,630
mentioned sebastian through and moocs
online education do you think that's an

3158
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
online education do you think that's an
 

3159
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,789
online education do you think that's an
effective so can be

3160
00:54:40,789 --> 00:54:40,799
effective so can be
 

3161
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,950
effective so can be
i mean online

3162
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
i mean online
 

3163
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:45,910
i mean online
having great teachers online obviously

3164
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:45,920
having great teachers online obviously
 

3165
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,589
having great teachers online obviously
extends those teachers to many more

3166
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:47,599
extends those teachers to many more
 

3167
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:50,309
extends those teachers to many more
people and that's a wonderful thing

3168
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:50,319
people and that's a wonderful thing
 

3169
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,349
people and that's a wonderful thing
um

3170
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
um
 

3171
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,390
um
i have

3172
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:52,400
i have
 

3173
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,549
i have
quite a few online courses myself i got

3174
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:54,559
quite a few online courses myself i got
 

3175
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,549
quite a few online courses myself i got
the bug working with sebastian when he

3176
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:56,559
the bug working with sebastian when he
 

3177
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,430
the bug working with sebastian when he
was

3178
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:57,440
was
 

3179
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,750
was
had released his first mooc

3180
00:54:59,750 --> 00:54:59,760
had released his first mooc
 

3181
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,230
had released his first mooc
and i thought maybe i could do one in

3182
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:02,240
and i thought maybe i could do one in
 

3183
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:04,150
and i thought maybe i could do one in
maths education and i didn't know if

3184
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:04,160
maths education and i didn't know if
 

3185
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,789
maths education and i didn't know if
anybody would take it um i remember

3186
00:55:06,789 --> 00:55:06,799
anybody would take it um i remember
 

3187
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,549
anybody would take it um i remember
releasing it that first summer and it

3188
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:08,559
releasing it that first summer and it
 

3189
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,549
releasing it that first summer and it
was a free online class and

3190
00:55:10,549 --> 00:55:10,559
was a free online class and
 

3191
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,950
was a free online class and
30 000 maths teachers took it that first

3192
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:12,960
30 000 maths teachers took it that first
 

3193
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,190
30 000 maths teachers took it that first
summer and they were all talking about

3194
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:15,200
summer and they were all talking about
 

3195
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,030
summer and they were all talking about
it with each other and sharing it and it

3196
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
it with each other and sharing it and it
 

3197
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,030
it with each other and sharing it and it
was like took off in fact

3198
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
was like took off in fact
 

3199
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,589
was like took off in fact
it was that mooc that caught

3200
00:55:21,589 --> 00:55:21,599
it was that mooc that caught
 

3201
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,870
it was that mooc that caught
got me to

3202
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:22,880
got me to
 

3203
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,990
got me to
create you cubed with kathy williams

3204
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:26,000
create you cubed with kathy williams
 

3205
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,549
create you cubed with kathy williams
who's the co-founder um because people

3206
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
who's the co-founder um because people
 

3207
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:31,030
who's the co-founder um because people
took the mooc and then they said okay

3208
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
took the mooc and then they said okay
 

3209
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,150
took the mooc and then they said okay
what now

3210
00:55:32,150 --> 00:55:32,160
what now
 

3211
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:35,270
what now
i finished what what can i have next and

3212
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:35,280
i finished what what can i have next and
 

3213
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,789
i finished what what can i have next and
so that was where we made our website

3214
00:55:36,789 --> 00:55:36,799
so that was where we made our website
 

3215
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:37,910
so that was where we made our website
but

3216
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:37,920
but
 

3217
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:40,069
but
um so yeah i think online education can

3218
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:40,079
um so yeah i think online education can
 

3219
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,910
um so yeah i think online education can
be great i do think a lot of the moocs

3220
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:43,920
be great i do think a lot of the moocs
 

3221
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:46,069
be great i do think a lot of the moocs
don't have great pedagogy they're just a

3222
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:46,079
don't have great pedagogy they're just a
 

3223
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,510
don't have great pedagogy they're just a
talking head

3224
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:47,520
talking head
 

3225
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,670
talking head
and

3226
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
and
 

3227
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,589
and
it you can actually engage people in

3228
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:51,599
it you can actually engage people in
 

3229
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:54,789
it you can actually engage people in
more active ways even in online learning

3230
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799
more active ways even in online learning
 

3231
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,589
more active ways even in online learning
so i learned from the udacity principle

3232
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:57,599
so i learned from the udacity principle
 

3233
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:00,069
so i learned from the udacity principle
when i was working udacity never to talk

3234
00:56:00,069 --> 00:56:00,079
when i was working udacity never to talk
 

3235
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,870
when i was working udacity never to talk
more than like five minutes and but then

3236
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
more than like five minutes and but then
 

3237
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,750
more than like five minutes and but then
and then to ask people to do something

3238
00:56:05,750 --> 00:56:05,760
and then to ask people to do something
 

3239
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,950
and then to ask people to do something
so

3240
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:06,960
so
 

3241
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,630
so
that's the sort of pedagogy of the

3242
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:08,640
that's the sort of pedagogy of the
 

3243
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,150
that's the sort of pedagogy of the
online classes i have there's a little

3244
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:10,160
online classes i have there's a little
 

3245
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,589
online classes i have there's a little
bit of

3246
00:56:11,589 --> 00:56:11,599
bit of
 

3247
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:13,030
bit of
presenting something and then people do

3248
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,040
presenting something and then people do
 

3249
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,030
presenting something and then people do
something and there's a little bit more

3250

something and there's a little bit more
 

3251
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,630
something and there's a little bit more
because i think if you have a half hour

3252
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:16,640
because i think if you have a half hour
 

3253
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,109
because i think if you have a half hour
video you just you know

3254
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:19,119
video you just you know
 

3255
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,789
video you just you know
switch off and start doing other things

3256
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
switch off and start doing other things
 

3257
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,349
switch off and start doing other things
so the the way udaci did it is uh like

teaching
 

3263
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,589
teaching
and then with some visual stuff perhaps

3264
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:29,599
and then with some visual stuff perhaps
 

3265
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:31,190
and then with some visual stuff perhaps
and then there's like a quiz then you

what's the mission what's the goal you
mentioned how it started but what's uh

3276
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,160
mentioned how it started but what's uh
 

3277
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,950
mentioned how it started but what's uh
um yeah where are you at now and what do

are the kind of things that people
 

3283
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,309
are the kind of things that people
should go and check out on there

3284
00:56:50,309 --> 00:56:50,319
should go and check out on there
 

3285
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:52,789
should go and check out on there
yeah we started you cubed i guess it was

3286
00:56:52,789 --> 00:56:52,799
yeah we started you cubed i guess it was
 

3287
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,710
yeah we started you cubed i guess it was
about five years ago now and we've had

3288
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:54,720
about five years ago now and we've had
 

3289
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:57,349
about five years ago now and we've had
over 52 million visitors to the site so

is to share
 

3295
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,030
is to share
good ideas for teaching with

3296
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:05,040
good ideas for teaching with
 

3297
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:07,190
good ideas for teaching with
teachers students parents

3298
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:07,200
teachers students parents
 

3299
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,190
teachers students parents
in maths and to help

3300
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:09,200
in maths and to help
 

3301
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,190
in maths and to help
we have a sort of subgoal of erasing

3302
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
we have a sort of subgoal of erasing
 

3303
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:13,349
we have a sort of subgoal of erasing
maths anxiety that's important to us but

3304
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:13,359
maths anxiety that's important to us but
 

3305
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:14,230
maths anxiety that's important to us but
also

3306
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
also
 

3307
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,910
also
to share maths as this beautiful

3308
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:15,920
to share maths as this beautiful
 

3309
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,829
to share maths as this beautiful
creative subject

3310
00:57:17,829 --> 00:57:17,839
creative subject
 

3311
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:19,829
creative subject
and um

3312
00:57:19,829 --> 00:57:19,839
and um
 

3313
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:22,390
and um
it's been really great we have lessons

3314
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:22,400
it's been really great we have lessons
 

3315
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,109
it's been really great we have lessons
on the site but one of the things one of

3316
00:57:25,109 --> 00:57:25,119
on the site but one of the things one of
 

3317
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:27,430
on the site but one of the things one of
the reasons i thought this was needed is

3318
00:57:27,430 --> 00:57:27,440
the reasons i thought this was needed is
 

3319
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,950
the reasons i thought this was needed is
there's a lot of knowledge in the

3320
00:57:28,950 --> 00:57:28,960
there's a lot of knowledge in the
 

3321
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,109
there's a lot of knowledge in the
academy about how to teach maths well

3322
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,119
academy about how to teach maths well
 

3323
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,630
academy about how to teach maths well
loads and loads of

3324
00:57:32,630 --> 00:57:32,640
loads and loads of
 

3325
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,430
loads and loads of
research and journals and lots of things

3326
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:35,440
research and journals and lots of things
 

3327
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,230
research and journals and lots of things
written up but teachers don't read it

3328
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:38,240
written up but teachers don't read it
 

3329
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,950
written up but teachers don't read it
they they don't have access to it

3330
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:40,960
they they don't have access to it
 

3331
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:43,109
they they don't have access to it
they're often behind pay walls

3332
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:43,119
they're often behind pay walls
 

3333
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,230
they're often behind pay walls
they

3334
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,240
they
 

3335
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:45,910
they
they're written in really inaccessible

they're written in really inaccessible
 

3337
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:47,589
they're written in really inaccessible
ways so people wouldn't want to read

3338
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
ways so people wouldn't want to read
 

3339
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:50,390
ways so people wouldn't want to read
them or understand them so this i see is

3340
00:57:50,390 --> 00:57:50,400
them or understand them so this i see is
 

3341
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,990
them or understand them so this i see is
a big problem you have this whole

3342
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:52,000
a big problem you have this whole
 

3343
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,670
a big problem you have this whole
industry of people

3344
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:53,680
industry of people
 

3345
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:55,670
industry of people
finding out how to teach well

3346
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:55,680
finding out how to teach well
 

3347
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,510
finding out how to teach well
not sharing it with the people who are

3348
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:57,520
not sharing it with the people who are
 

3349
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,789
not sharing it with the people who are
teaching

3350

teaching
 

3351
00:57:58,799 --> 00:57:59,510
teaching
so

3352
00:57:59,510 --> 00:57:59,520
so
 

3353
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,510
so
um that's why we made youtube and

3354
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:01,520
um that's why we made youtube and
 

3355
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,270
um that's why we made youtube and
instead of just putting articles up

3356
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:03,280
instead of just putting articles up
 

3357
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,710
instead of just putting articles up
saying here's some things to read about

3358
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
saying here's some things to read about
 

3359
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,190
saying here's some things to read about
how to teach well we translated what was

3360
00:58:07,190 --> 00:58:07,200
how to teach well we translated what was
 

3361
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,190
how to teach well we translated what was
coming from research into

3362
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:09,200
coming from research into
 

3363
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,510
coming from research into
things that teacher could use so lessons

3364
00:58:11,510 --> 00:58:11,520
things that teacher could use so lessons
 

3365
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,390
things that teacher could use so lessons
there were videos to show kids and

3366
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
there were videos to show kids and
 

3367
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,390
there were videos to show kids and
um there were tips for parents there

3368
00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:16,400
um there were tips for parents there
 

3369
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,950
um there were tips for parents there
were all sorts of things on the site and

3370
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
were all sorts of things on the site and
 

3371
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,470
were all sorts of things on the site and
it's been amazing

3372
00:58:20,470 --> 00:58:20,480
it's been amazing
 

3373
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,549
it's been amazing
as we had we

3374
00:58:22,549 --> 00:58:22,559
as we had we
 

3375
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,789
as we had we
took inspiration from the week of code

3376
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:24,799
took inspiration from the week of code
 

3377
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:26,630
took inspiration from the week of code
which

3378
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:26,640
which
 

3379
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,030
which
got teachers to focus on coding for a

3380
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:29,040
got teachers to focus on coding for a
 

3381
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:31,270
got teachers to focus on coding for a
week and um we have this thing called

3382
00:58:31,270 --> 00:58:31,280
week and um we have this thing called
 

3383
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,750
week and um we have this thing called
the week of inspirational maths

3384
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:33,760
the week of inspirational maths
 

3385
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:36,150
the week of inspirational maths
and we say just try it for a week just

3386
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:36,160
and we say just try it for a week just
 

3387
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:38,150
and we say just try it for a week just
just give us one week and try it and see

3388
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
just give us one week and try it and see
 

3389
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:39,270
just give us one week and try it and see
what happens

3390
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:39,280
what happens
 

3391
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,230
what happens
and so it's been downloaded millions of

3392
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:42,240
and so it's been downloaded millions of
 

3393
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,510
and so it's been downloaded millions of
times teachers

3394
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:43,520
times teachers
 

3395
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,349
times teachers
use it every year they start the school

3396
00:58:45,349 --> 00:58:45,359
use it every year they start the school
 

3397
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,470
use it every year they start the school
year with it

3398
00:58:46,470 --> 00:58:46,480
year with it
 

3399
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:49,430
year with it
and what they tell us is it was amazing

3400
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:49,440
and what they tell us is it was amazing
 

3401
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:50,870
and what they tell us is it was amazing
the kids lights were on they were

3402
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:50,880
the kids lights were on they were
 

3403
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:52,870
the kids lights were on they were
excited they loved it

3404
00:58:52,870 --> 00:58:52,880
excited they loved it
 

3405
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,870
excited they loved it
and then the week finished and i opened

3406
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:54,880
and then the week finished and i opened
 

3407
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,789
and then the week finished and i opened
my textbooks and the

3408
00:58:56,789 --> 00:58:56,799
my textbooks and the
 

3409
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,870
my textbooks and the

we haven't the capacity to produce these
 

3433
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,470
we haven't the capacity to produce these
creative visual math tasks for every

3434
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:24,480
creative visual math tasks for every
 

3435
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,150
creative visual math tasks for every
year group for every day but i would

3436
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:26,160
year group for every day but i would
 

3437
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,069
year group for every day but i would
love to do that how difficult is it to

3438
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079
love to do that how difficult is it to
 

3439
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,589

to come up
 

3443
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,230
to come up
with uh visual formulations of these uh

3444
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:36,240
with uh visual formulations of these uh
 

3445
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,990
with uh visual formulations of these uh
big important topics you need to think

3446
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:38,000
big important topics you need to think
 

3447
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,030
big important topics you need to think
about

3448
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:39,040
about
 

3449
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,789
about
in a way that you know

3450
00:59:40,789 --> 00:59:40,799
in a way that you know
 

3451
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,589
in a way that you know
that uh that that you could teach i mean

3452
00:59:43,589 --> 00:59:43,599
that uh that that you could teach i mean
 

3453
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:46,150
that uh that that you could teach i mean
it we can do it we actually we went from

3454
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:46,160
it we can do it we actually we went from
 

3455
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,670
it we can do it we actually we went from
the week of inspirational maths and we

3456
00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:47,680
the week of inspirational maths and we
 

3457
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:48,630
the week of inspirational maths and we
made

3458
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:48,640
made
 

3459
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:52,150
made
k-8 maths books with exactly that big

3460
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:52,160
k-8 maths books with exactly that big
 

3461
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:55,430
k-8 maths books with exactly that big
ideas rich activities visuals we just

3462
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:55,440
ideas rich activities visuals we just
 

3463
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,109
ideas rich activities visuals we just
finished the last one we've been doing

3464
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,119
finished the last one we've been doing
 

3465
00:59:57,119 --> 00:59:58,230
finished the last one we've been doing
it for

3466
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
it for
 

3467
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,789
it for
five years and it's been exhausting and

3468
01:00:00,789 --> 01:00:00,799
five years and it's been exhausting and
 

3469
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,109
five years and it's been exhausting and
we just finished so now there's a whole

3470
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:03,119
we just finished so now there's a whole
 

3471
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,510
we just finished so now there's a whole
k-8 set of books

3472
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:05,520
k-8 set of books
 

3473
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:07,270
k-8 set of books
and they're organized in that way these

3474
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
and they're organized in that way these
 

3475
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,270
and they're organized in that way these
are the big ideas here are rich deep

3476
01:00:09,270 --> 01:00:09,280
are the big ideas here are rich deep
 

3477
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,630
are the big ideas here are rich deep
activities

3478
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:10,640
activities
 

3479
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,910
activities
um

3480
01:00:11,910 --> 01:00:11,920
um
 

3481
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:14,630
um
they're not though what you can do every

3482
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
they're not though what you can do every
 

3483
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:17,589
they're not though what you can do every
day for a year that so some teachers use

3484
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:17,599
day for a year that so some teachers use
 

3485
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,589
day for a year that so some teachers use
them as a kind of supplement to their

3486
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:19,599
them as a kind of supplement to their
 

3487
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:22,630
them as a kind of supplement to their
boring textbook and some people have

3488
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:22,640
boring textbook and some people have
 

3489
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:24,950
boring textbook and some people have
said okay this is the year this book

3490
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
said okay this is the year this book
 

3491
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,109
said okay this is the year this book
tells us what the year is and then we'll

3492
01:00:27,109 --> 01:00:27,119
tells us what the year is and then we'll
 

3493
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:29,910
tells us what the year is and then we'll
supplement these big activities with

3494
01:00:29,910 --> 01:00:29,920
supplement these big activities with
 

3495
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:32,789
supplement these big activities with
um so they're being used and teachers

3496
01:00:32,789 --> 01:00:32,799
um so they're being used and teachers
 

3497
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:33,750
um so they're being used and teachers
really

3498
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:33,760
really
 

3499
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:35,270
really
like them and are really happy about

3500
01:00:35,270 --> 01:00:35,280
like them and are really happy about
 

3501
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:36,069
like them and are really happy about
them

3502
01:00:36,069 --> 01:00:36,079
them
 

3503
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,230
them
i just always want more and i guess one

3504
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:38,240
i just always want more and i guess one
 

3505
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,069
i just always want more and i guess one
of the things i would like for you cubed

3506
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:40,079
of the things i would like for you cubed
 

3507
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,630
of the things i would like for you cubed
one of my personal goals is that every

3508
01:00:42,630 --> 01:00:42,640
one of my personal goals is that every
 

3509
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,510
one of my personal goals is that every
teacher of maths knows about youtube

3510
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:45,520
teacher of maths knows about youtube
 

3511
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,990
teacher of maths knows about youtube
at the moment um a lot of teachers who

3512
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
at the moment um a lot of teachers who
 

3513
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,510
at the moment um a lot of teachers who
come to us are really happy they found

3514
01:00:49,510 --> 01:00:49,520
come to us are really happy they found
 

3515
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:51,109
come to us are really happy they found
it but there's a lot of other teachers

3516
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:51,119
it but there's a lot of other teachers
 

3517
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:52,309
it but there's a lot of other teachers
who

3518
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:52,319
who
 

3519
01:00:52,319 --> 01:00:54,069
who
don't know that it exists i hope this

3520
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:54,079
don't know that it exists i hope this
 

3521
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,910
don't know that it exists i hope this
helps yeah from a student perspective

3522
01:00:57,910 --> 01:00:57,920
helps yeah from a student perspective
 

3523
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:00,630
helps yeah from a student perspective
and not in the classroom but at home

3524
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:00,640
and not in the classroom but at home
 

3525
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,230
and not in the classroom but at home
studying

3526
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:02,240
studying
 

3527
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,750
studying
and you know

3528
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:03,760
and you know
 

3529
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,910
and you know
is there some

3530
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:05,920
is there some
 

3531
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,549
is there some
advice you can give on how to best study

3532
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:08,559
advice you can give on how to best study
 

3533
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,710
advice you can give on how to best study
mathematics so what's the role of the

3534
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:10,720
mathematics so what's the role of the
 

3535
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,670
mathematics so what's the role of the
student outside the classroom

3536
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:13,680
student outside the classroom
 

3537
01:01:13,680 --> 01:01:17,109
student outside the classroom
yeah i think one thing we know is a lot

3538
01:01:17,109 --> 01:01:17,119
yeah i think one thing we know is a lot
 

3539
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:19,510
yeah i think one thing we know is a lot
of people when they review material

3540
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:19,520
of people when they review material
 

3541
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,270
of people when they review material
whether it's maths or anything else

3542
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:21,280
whether it's maths or anything else
 

3543
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:23,510
whether it's maths or anything else
don't do it in the best way

3544
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:23,520
don't do it in the best way
 

3545
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,750
don't do it in the best way
i think a problem a lot of people have

3546
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:25,760
i think a problem a lot of people have
 

3547
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:27,829
i think a problem a lot of people have
is they read through maybe a teacher's

3548
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:27,839
is they read through maybe a teacher's
 

3549
01:01:27,839 --> 01:01:31,430
is they read through maybe a teacher's
explanation or a way of doing maths

3550
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:31,440
explanation or a way of doing maths
 

3551
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,190
explanation or a way of doing maths
and it makes sense and they think oh

3552
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,200
and it makes sense and they think oh
 

3553
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:36,230
and it makes sense and they think oh
yeah i've got that and they move on

3554
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:36,240
yeah i've got that and they move on
 

3555
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,789
yeah i've got that and they move on
but then it's not until you come to try

3556
01:01:38,789 --> 01:01:38,799
but then it's not until you come to try
 

3557
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,470
but then it's not until you come to try
and work on something and do a problem

3558
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:40,480
and work on something and do a problem
 

3559
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:41,510
and work on something and do a problem
that you actually realize you didn't

3560
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:41,520
that you actually realize you didn't
 

3561
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,270
that you actually realize you didn't
really understand it just seemed to make

3562
01:01:43,270 --> 01:01:43,280
really understand it just seemed to make
 

3563
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,789
really understand it just seemed to make
sense

3564
01:01:44,789 --> 01:01:44,799
sense
 

3565
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:47,190
sense
so i would say

3566
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:47,200
so i would say
 

3567
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,710
so i would say
this is also something that

3568
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:48,720
this is also something that
 

3569
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,549
this is also something that
neuroscientists talk about

3570
01:01:50,549 --> 01:01:50,559
neuroscientists talk about
 

3571
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,670
neuroscientists talk about
to keep giving yourself questions is a

3572
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:53,680
to keep giving yourself questions is a
 

3573
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,349
to keep giving yourself questions is a
really good way to

3574
01:01:55,349 --> 01:01:55,359
really good way to
 

3575
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:56,549
really good way to
study

3576
01:01:56,549 --> 01:01:56,559
study
 

3577
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:58,069
study
rather than looking through lots of

3578
01:01:58,069 --> 01:01:58,079
rather than looking through lots of
 

3579
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:00,309
rather than looking through lots of
material it's almost like giving

3580
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:00,319
material it's almost like giving
 

3581
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:02,549
material it's almost like giving
yourself lots of tests

3582
01:02:02,549 --> 01:02:02,559
yourself lots of tests
 

3583
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,630
yourself lots of tests
is a good way to actually deeply

3584
01:02:04,630 --> 01:02:04,640
is a good way to actually deeply
 

3585
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,069
is a good way to actually deeply
understand things and know what you do

3586
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:06,079
understand things and know what you do
 

3587
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,309
understand things and know what you do
when you don't understand so would the

3588
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:08,319
when you don't understand so would the
 

3589
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:09,750
when you don't understand so would the
questions be

3590
01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:09,760
questions be
 

3591
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,349
questions be
in the form of

3592
01:02:11,349 --> 01:02:11,359
in the form of
 

3593
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,270
in the form of
the material you're reviewing is the

3594
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:13,280
the material you're reviewing is the
 

3595
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,190
the material you're reviewing is the
answer to that question or is it almost

3596
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,200
answer to that question or is it almost
 

3597
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,190
answer to that question or is it almost
like beyond it's the polygon thing you

3598
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,200
like beyond it's the polygon thing you
 

3599
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,349
like beyond it's the polygon thing you
mentioned from a square is it almost

3600
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:19,359
mentioned from a square is it almost
 

3601
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:21,430
mentioned from a square is it almost
like i wonder

3602
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
like i wonder
 

3603
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,510
like i wonder
what is the bigger picture i was kind of

3604
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:23,520
what is the bigger picture i was kind of
 

3605
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,470
what is the bigger picture i was kind of
asking

3606
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:24,480
asking
 

3607
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:27,190
asking
like how's this extended and so on yeah

3608
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
like how's this extended and so on yeah
 

3609
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,510
like how's this extended and so on yeah
that that that would be great and it's a

3610
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
that that that would be great and it's a
 

3611
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,190
that that that would be great and it's a
similar i mean a question i get asked a

3612
01:02:31,190 --> 01:02:31,200
similar i mean a question i get asked a
 

3613
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:32,950
similar i mean a question i get asked a
lot is about homework well it's a good

3614
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:32,960
lot is about homework well it's a good
 

3615
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:34,870
lot is about homework well it's a good
thing for kids to do for homework

3616
01:02:34,870 --> 01:02:34,880
thing for kids to do for homework
 

3617
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,910
thing for kids to do for homework
and one of the recommendations i give is

3618
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:37,920
and one of the recommendations i give is
 

3619
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:38,710
and one of the recommendations i give is
to

3620
01:02:38,710 --> 01:02:38,720
to
 

3621
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,510
to
not have kids just do lots of questions

3622
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:41,520
not have kids just do lots of questions
 

3623
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:42,710
not have kids just do lots of questions
for homework

3624
01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:42,720
for homework
 

3625
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,109
for homework
but to actually ask them to reflect on

3626
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:45,119
but to actually ask them to reflect on
 

3627
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,789
but to actually ask them to reflect on
what they've learned like what was the

3628
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:46,799
what they've learned like what was the
 

3629
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,829
what they've learned like what was the
big idea you were you learned today or

3630
01:02:49,829 --> 01:02:49,839
big idea you were you learned today or
 

3631
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:51,190
big idea you were you learned today or
what did you

3632
01:02:51,190 --> 01:02:51,200
what did you
 

3633
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,630
what did you
find difficult what did you struggle

3634
01:02:52,630 --> 01:02:52,640
find difficult what did you struggle
 

3635
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,270
find difficult what did you struggle
with what was something that was

3636
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
with what was something that was
 

3637
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:56,710
with what was something that was
exciting

3638
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:56,720
exciting
 

3639
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,150
exciting
um

3640
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:58,160
um
 

3641
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:00,390
um
then kids go home and they have to kind

3642
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:00,400
then kids go home and they have to kind
 

3643
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:02,789
then kids go home and they have to kind
of reflect in a deeper way a lot of

3644
01:03:02,789 --> 01:03:02,799
of reflect in a deeper way a lot of
 

3645
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:03,990
of reflect in a deeper way a lot of
times i don't if you have this

3646
01:03:03,990 --> 01:03:04,000
times i don't if you have this
 

3647
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,510
times i don't if you have this
experience as a math student lots of

3648
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:05,520
experience as a math student lots of
 

3649
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,829
experience as a math student lots of
people do kids are going through maths

3650
01:03:07,829 --> 01:03:07,839
people do kids are going through maths
 

3651
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:09,829
people do kids are going through maths
questions they're successful they get

3652
01:03:09,829 --> 01:03:09,839
questions they're successful they get
 

3653
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:11,670
questions they're successful they get
them right but they don't even really

3654
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:11,680
them right but they don't even really
 

3655
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,630
them right but they don't even really
know what they're about they and a lot

3656
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
know what they're about they and a lot
 

3657
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,390
know what they're about they and a lot
of kids go through many years of maths

3658
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:16,400
of kids go through many years of maths
 

3659
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,230
of kids go through many years of maths
like that doing lots of questions but

3660
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:18,240
like that doing lots of questions but
 

3661
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:20,870
like that doing lots of questions but
that really knowing what even

3662
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:20,880
that really knowing what even
 

3663
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,510
that really knowing what even
the topic is or what it's about what

3664
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:23,520
the topic is or what it's about what
 

3665
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,430
the topic is or what it's about what
it's important for so

3666
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:25,440
it's important for so
 

3667
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,990
it's important for so
having students go back and think at the

3668
01:03:27,990 --> 01:03:28,000
having students go back and think at the
 

3669
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,470
having students go back and think at the
end of the day what was the big idea

3670
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:30,480
end of the day what was the big idea
 

3671
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,150
end of the day what was the big idea
from this maths lesson why is it

3672
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160
from this maths lesson why is it
 

3673
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,349
from this maths lesson why is it
important

3674
01:03:33,349 --> 01:03:33,359
important
 

3675
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:35,910
important
where would i find that in real life

3676
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:35,920
where would i find that in real life
 

3677
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:38,549
where would i find that in real life
those are really good questions for kids

3678
01:03:38,549 --> 01:03:38,559
those are really good questions for kids
 

3679
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:40,789
those are really good questions for kids
to be thinking about it's probably for

3680
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:40,799
to be thinking about it's probably for
 

3681
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:42,710
to be thinking about it's probably for
everybody to be thinking about i think

3682
01:03:42,710 --> 01:03:42,720
everybody to be thinking about i think
 

3683
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,390
everybody to be thinking about i think
most of us go through life

3684
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
most of us go through life
 

3685
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,470
most of us go through life
never asking

3686
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:46,480
never asking
 

3687
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,349
never asking
like the bigger question almost like

3688
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:49,359
like the bigger question almost like
 

3689
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,029
like the bigger question almost like
you know those like layers of why

3690
01:03:51,029 --> 01:03:51,039
you know those like layers of why
 

3691
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,710
you know those like layers of why
questions that kids ask when they're

3692
01:03:52,710 --> 01:03:52,720
questions that kids ask when they're
 

3693
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:55,109
questions that kids ask when they're
very young yeah we need to keep doing

3694
01:03:55,109 --> 01:03:55,119
very young yeah we need to keep doing
 

3695
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:55,910
very young yeah we need to keep doing
that

3696
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:55,920
that
 

3697
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,630
that
we do like what uh that's the you know

3698
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:58,640
we do like what uh that's the you know
 

3699
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,230
we do like what uh that's the you know
whatever the term is you call first

3700
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:00,240
whatever the term is you call first
 

3701
01:04:00,240 --> 01:04:02,470
whatever the term is you call first
principles thinking some people call it

3702
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:02,480
principles thinking some people call it
 

3703
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,510
principles thinking some people call it
that which is like

3704
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
that which is like
 

3705
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:06,710
that which is like
why

3706
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
why
 

3707
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:08,390
why
are we doing it this way

3708
01:04:08,390 --> 01:04:08,400
are we doing it this way
 

3709
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,029
are we doing it this way
so one nice thing

3710
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:11,039
so one nice thing
 

3711
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,470
so one nice thing
is to do that because there's usually a

3712
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:12,480
is to do that because there's usually a
 

3713
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,309
is to do that because there's usually a
good answer like the reason we did it

3714
01:04:14,309 --> 01:04:14,319
good answer like the reason we did it
 

3715
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:16,630
good answer like the reason we did it
this way is because it works for this

3716
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:16,640
this way is because it works for this
 

3717
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:17,589
this way is because it works for this
reason

3718
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:17,599
reason
 

3719
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,430
reason
but then if you want to do something

3720
01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:19,440
but then if you want to do something
 

3721
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,390
but then if you want to do something
totally novel is you'll say well

3722
01:04:22,390 --> 01:04:22,400
totally novel is you'll say well
 

3723
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,029
totally novel is you'll say well
we've been doing it this way

3724
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:25,039
we've been doing it this way
 

3725
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,710
we've been doing it this way
um because of historical reasons but

3726
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
um because of historical reasons but
 

3727
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,390
um because of historical reasons but
really this is not the best way to do it

3728
01:04:30,390 --> 01:04:30,400
really this is not the best way to do it
 

3729
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,150
really this is not the best way to do it
there might be other ways

3730
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
there might be other ways
 

3731
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,309
there might be other ways
and that's how invention happens right

3732
01:04:34,309 --> 01:04:34,319
and that's how invention happens right
 

3733
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:35,990
and that's how invention happens right
and then you get you know that's really

3734
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:36,000
and then you get you know that's really
 

3735
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,789
and then you get you know that's really
useful in every aspect of life like

3736
01:04:38,789 --> 01:04:38,799
useful in every aspect of life like
 

3737
01:04:38,799 --> 01:04:40,390
useful in every aspect of life like
choosing your career

3738
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:40,400
choosing your career
 

3739
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,230
choosing your career
choosing your um

3740
01:04:42,230 --> 01:04:42,240
choosing your um
 

3741
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,710
choosing your um
i don't know what where you live yeah

3742
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:44,720
i don't know what where you live yeah
 

3743
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:47,029
i don't know what where you live yeah
who your like romantic partner is like

3744
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:47,039
who your like romantic partner is like
 

3745
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,670
who your like romantic partner is like
everything everything yeah and i think

3746
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:49,680
everything everything yeah and i think
 

3747
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,589
everything everything yeah and i think
it probably starts

3748
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
it probably starts
 

3749
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,150
it probably starts
doing that in math class

3750
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:54,160
doing that in math class
 

3751
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,910
doing that in math class
that would be good if we started doing i

3752
01:04:55,910 --> 01:04:55,920
that would be good if we started doing i
 

3753
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:57,670
that would be good if we started doing i
want i mean i wonder

3754
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:57,680
want i mean i wonder
 

3755
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,789
want i mean i wonder
i

3756
01:04:58,789 --> 01:04:58,799
i
 

3757
01:04:58,799 --> 01:05:00,950
i
i probably didn't do very much of that

3758
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:00,960
i probably didn't do very much of that
 

3759
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,750
i probably didn't do very much of that
for most of my education asking why

3760
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:03,760
for most of my education asking why
 

3761
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,190
for most of my education asking why
except for later much later

3762
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:07,200
except for later much later
 

3763
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,069
except for later much later
in the subjects on like grad school when

3764
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:10,079
in the subjects on like grad school when
 

3765
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,150
in the subjects on like grad school when
you're doing research on them

3766
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
you're doing research on them
 

3767
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:13,670
you're doing research on them
when you're first tasked with doing

3768
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:13,680
when you're first tasked with doing
 

3769
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,109
when you're first tasked with doing
something novel

3770
01:05:15,109 --> 01:05:15,119
something novel
 

3771
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,710
something novel
using this

3772
01:05:16,710 --> 01:05:16,720
using this
 

3773
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:18,950
using this
or solving a problem really outside the

3774
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:18,960
or solving a problem really outside the
 

3775
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,029
or solving a problem really outside the
classroom they have to publish on it's

3776
01:05:21,029 --> 01:05:21,039
classroom they have to publish on it's
 

3777
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:22,549
classroom they have to publish on it's
the first time you think

3778
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:22,559
the first time you think
 

3779
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:25,190
the first time you think
wait why are these things

3780
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:25,200
wait why are these things
 

3781
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,589
wait why are these things
uh interesting useful which are the

3782
01:05:27,589 --> 01:05:27,599
uh interesting useful which are the
 

3783
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:29,349
uh interesting useful which are the
things that are useful

3784
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
things that are useful
 

3785
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,349
things that are useful
and yeah i guess that was that would be

3786
01:05:31,349 --> 01:05:31,359
and yeah i guess that was that would be
 

3787
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,670
and yeah i guess that was that would be
nice if we did that much earlier that uh

3788
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:33,680
nice if we did that much earlier that uh
 

3789
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,870
nice if we did that much earlier that uh
the quest of invention yeah yeah

3790
01:05:36,870 --> 01:05:36,880
the quest of invention yeah yeah
 

3791
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,349
the quest of invention yeah yeah
i mean one of the sad pieces of research

3792
01:05:39,349 --> 01:05:39,359
i mean one of the sad pieces of research
 

3793
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,910
i mean one of the sad pieces of research
data i think about is the questions kids

3794
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
data i think about is the questions kids
 

3795
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,349
data i think about is the questions kids
ask

3796
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:43,359
ask
 

3797
01:05:43,359 --> 01:05:47,910
ask
um in school goes down like in a linear

3798
01:05:47,910 --> 01:05:47,920
um in school goes down like in a linear
 

3799
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,549
um in school goes down like in a linear
uh you know progression from in the

3800
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:50,559
uh you know progression from in the
 

3801
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,789
uh you know progression from in the
early years you can't stop kids asking

3802
01:05:52,789 --> 01:05:52,799
early years you can't stop kids asking
 

3803
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:55,029
early years you can't stop kids asking
those questions but they learn

3804
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
those questions but they learn
 

3805
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:57,109
those questions but they learn
not to ask the questions i think you

3806
01:05:57,109 --> 01:05:57,119
not to ask the questions i think you
 

3807
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,069
not to ask the questions i think you
told

3808
01:05:58,069 --> 01:05:58,079
told
 

3809
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:00,390
told
somewhere about an early memory you had

3810
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
somewhere about an early memory you had
 

3811
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:02,390
somewhere about an early memory you had
in your own education

3812
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:02,400
in your own education
 

3813
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,549
in your own education
where you asked the question

3814
01:06:04,549 --> 01:06:04,559
where you asked the question
 

3815
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:06,150
where you asked the question
or maybe that was an example you gave

3816
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160
or maybe that was an example you gave
 

3817
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,789
or maybe that was an example you gave
but it was shut down oh yeah

3818
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
but it was shut down oh yeah
 

3819
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:12,069
but it was shut down oh yeah
you've listened to something i said yeah

because you know how there's lots of
 

3835
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,029
because you know how there's lots of
hours of school you don't remember at

3836

i was
 

3885
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,430
i was
yeah he was the chair of the maths

3886
01:07:11,430 --> 01:07:11,440
yeah he was the chair of the maths
 

3887
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:13,670
yeah he was the chair of the maths
department i remember that really well

3892
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:18,319
maybe because of that experience one of
 

3893
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,069
maybe because of that experience one of
the things we encourage when we teach

3894
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:20,079
the things we encourage when we teach
 

3895
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,150
the things we encourage when we teach
kids is asking questions and we value it

3896
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:22,160
kids is asking questions and we value it
 

3897
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,510
kids is asking questions and we value it
when they ask questions we put them up

3898
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:23,520
when they ask questions we put them up
 

3899
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:26,829
when they ask questions we put them up
on walls and celebrate and

3900
01:07:26,829 --> 01:07:26,839
on walls and celebrate and
 

3901
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:29,589
on walls and celebrate and
um it's funny because

3902
01:07:29,589 --> 01:07:29,599
um it's funny because
 

3903
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:31,349
um it's funny because
i wish there was a feedback signal

3904
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:31,359
i wish there was a feedback signal
 

3905
01:07:31,359 --> 01:07:33,349
i wish there was a feedback signal
because he probably

3906
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:33,359
because he probably
 

3907
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,589
because he probably
to put a positive spin on it he probably

3908
01:07:35,589 --> 01:07:35,599
to put a positive spin on it he probably
 

3909
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,589
to put a positive spin on it he probably
didn't realize the negative impact he's

3910
01:07:37,589 --> 01:07:37,599
didn't realize the negative impact he's
 

3911
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,309
didn't realize the negative impact he's
had in that moment right if he only knew

3912
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:40,319
had in that moment right if he only knew
 

3913
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,670
had in that moment right if he only knew
see this is probably when you're more

3914
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:41,680
see this is probably when you're more
 

3915
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,990
see this is probably when you're more
mature in grad school

3916
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,000
mature in grad school
 

3917
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,150
mature in grad school
i had an amazing professor named ali

3918
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:46,160
i had an amazing professor named ali
 

3919
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,950
i had an amazing professor named ali
shakafande in uh computer science and he

3920
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
shakafande in uh computer science and he
 

3921
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,270
shakafande in uh computer science and he
would get he encouraged questions but

3922
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:51,280
would get he encouraged questions but
 

3923
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,870
would get he encouraged questions but
then he would tell everybody how dumb

3924
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:52,880
then he would tell everybody how dumb
 

3925
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:54,230
then he would tell everybody how dumb
their questions are

3926
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:54,240
their questions are
 

3927
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:55,430
their questions are
but it was

3928
01:07:55,430 --> 01:07:55,440
but it was
 

3929
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:58,069
but it was
it was done i guess if you show if you

3930
01:07:58,069 --> 01:07:58,079
it was done i guess if you show if you
 

3931
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:00,710
it was done i guess if you show if you
say it with love and respect behind it

3932
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
say it with love and respect behind it
 

3933
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,029
say it with love and respect behind it
then it's more like a friendly humorous

3934
01:08:03,029 --> 01:08:03,039
then it's more like a friendly humorous
 

3935
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:05,190
then it's more like a friendly humorous
encouragement for more questions

3936
01:08:05,190 --> 01:08:05,200
encouragement for more questions
 

3937
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,430
encouragement for more questions
yeah it's an art right yeah to do it

3938
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:07,440
yeah it's an art right yeah to do it
 

3939
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,109
yeah it's an art right yeah to do it
you're right and then it's very hard you

3940
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
you're right and then it's very hard you
 

3941
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,190
you're right and then it's very hard you
have to time it right because that's

3942
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:11,200
have to time it right because that's
 

3943
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,710
have to time it right because that's
probably that kind of humor is probably

3944
01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
probably that kind of humor is probably
 

3945
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,309
probably that kind of humor is probably
better for when you're

3946
01:08:14,309 --> 01:08:14,319
better for when you're
 

3947
01:08:14,319 --> 01:08:16,470
better for when you're
uh in grad school versus when you're in

3948
01:08:16,470 --> 01:08:16,480
uh in grad school versus when you're in
 

3949
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:18,709
uh in grad school versus when you're in
the early education right

3950
01:08:18,709 --> 01:08:18,719
the early education right
 

3951
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,550
the early education right
well and i guess kids

3952
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:20,560
well and i guess kids
 

3953
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:24,870
well and i guess kids
or young people get whether somebody's

3954
01:08:24,870 --> 01:08:24,880
or young people get whether somebody's
 

3955
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,149
or young people get whether somebody's
doing it to be funny or you know

3956
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:28,159
doing it to be funny or you know
 

3957
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:30,070
doing it to be funny or you know
has it there's i mean this is why i

3958
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:30,080
has it there's i mean this is why i
 

3959
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,870
has it there's i mean this is why i
teach you so hard even your tone

3960
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
teach you so hard even your tone
 

3961
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:35,110
teach you so hard even your tone
can be impactful

3962
01:08:35,110 --> 01:08:35,120
can be impactful
 

3963
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:38,070
can be impactful
it's so sad because like for

3964
01:08:38,070 --> 01:08:38,080
it's so sad because like for
 

3965
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,550
it's so sad because like for
for that particular human the teacher

3966
01:08:40,550 --> 01:08:40,560
for that particular human the teacher
 

3967
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,110
for that particular human the teacher
you could just had a bad day and one

3968
01:08:43,110 --> 01:08:43,120
you could just had a bad day and one
 

3969
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:45,430
you could just had a bad day and one
statement can have a profound negative

3970
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:45,440
statement can have a profound negative
 

3971
01:08:45,440 --> 01:08:48,950
statement can have a profound negative
impact i know sadly that maths there's a

3972
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:48,960
impact i know sadly that maths there's a
 

3973
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,269
impact i know sadly that maths there's a
lot of maths teachers who have that kind

3974
01:08:51,269 --> 01:08:51,279
lot of maths teachers who have that kind
 

3975
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,990
lot of maths teachers who have that kind
of approach and they

3976
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,000
of approach and they
 

3977
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,910
of approach and they
i think they're suffering from the fact

3978
01:08:55,910 --> 01:08:55,920
i think they're suffering from the fact
 

3979
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:57,189
i think they're suffering from the fact
that they think people are math people

3980
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:57,199
that they think people are math people
 

3981
01:08:57,199 --> 01:08:58,870
that they think people are math people
are not math people and that comes

3982
01:08:58,870 --> 01:08:58,880
are not math people and that comes
 

3983
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:01,030
are not math people and that comes
across in their teaching

3984
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
across in their teaching
 

3985
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:02,950
across in their teaching
but on the flip side one positive

3986
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:02,960
but on the flip side one positive
 

3987
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:04,870
but on the flip side one positive
statement yeah keep them going that's

3988
01:09:04,870 --> 01:09:04,880
statement yeah keep them going that's
 

3989
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,189
statement yeah keep them going that's
right that is the flip side of that

3990
01:09:07,189 --> 01:09:07,199
right that is the flip side of that
 

3991
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:10,070
right that is the flip side of that
and i myself had like one teacher who

3992
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:10,080
and i myself had like one teacher who
 

3993
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,789
and i myself had like one teacher who
was really amazing for me in maths and

3994
01:09:12,789 --> 01:09:12,799
was really amazing for me in maths and
 

3995
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,709
was really amazing for me in maths and
she kept me in the subject

3996
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:14,719
she kept me in the subject
 

3997
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:16,309
she kept me in the subject
like

3998
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
like
 

3999
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,309
like
who was she she was

4000
01:09:18,309 --> 01:09:18,319
who was she she was
 

4001
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:19,189
who was she she was
um

4002
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:19,199
um
 

4003
01:09:19,199 --> 01:09:20,590
um
her name was mrs marshall

4004
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:20,600
her name was mrs marshall
 

4005
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,229
her name was mrs marshall
[Laughter]

4006
01:09:24,229 --> 01:09:24,239
[Laughter]
 

4007
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:27,910
[Laughter]
um she was my a level maths teacher so i

4008
01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
um she was my a level maths teacher so i
 

4009
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,709
um she was my a level maths teacher so i
was in i mean in england you do lots of

4010
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
was in i mean in england you do lots of
 

4011
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,829
was in i mean in england you do lots of
subjects so you're 16 and then you

4012
01:09:32,829 --> 01:09:32,839
subjects so you're 16 and then you
 

4013
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:35,669
subjects so you're 16 and then you
choose like three or four subjects so i

4014
01:09:35,669 --> 01:09:35,679
choose like three or four subjects so i
 

4015
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:37,829
choose like three or four subjects so i
chosen maths and

4016
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
chosen maths and
 

4017
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,590
chosen maths and
you go to

4018
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:39,600
you go to
 

4019
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,430
you go to
higher levels

4020
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:41,440
higher levels
 

4021
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:43,510
higher levels
probably equivalent more to a master's

4022
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
probably equivalent more to a master's
 

4023
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,349
probably equivalent more to a master's
degree in the us because you're more

4024
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
degree in the us because you're more
 

4025
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,149
degree in the us because you're more
specialized but anyways she was my

4026
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:48,159
specialized but anyways she was my
 

4027
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:50,390
specialized but anyways she was my
teacher and for the first time in my

4028
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:50,400
teacher and for the first time in my
 

4029
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:52,630
teacher and for the first time in my
whole career in maths

4030
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:52,640
whole career in maths
 

4031
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:55,430
whole career in maths
she would give us problems and tell us

4032
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
she would give us problems and tell us
 

4033
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:57,910
she would give us problems and tell us
to talk about them with each other

4034
01:09:57,910 --> 01:09:57,920
to talk about them with each other
 

4035
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,950
to talk about them with each other
and so here i was sitting there like 17

4036
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:00,960
and so here i was sitting there like 17
 

4037
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,950
and so here i was sitting there like 17
talking with friends about how to solve

4038
01:10:02,950 --> 01:10:02,960
talking with friends about how to solve
 

4039
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,950
talking with friends about how to solve
a math problem and that was it that was

4040
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:04,960
a math problem and that was it that was
 

4041
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:07,669
a math problem and that was it that was
the change that she made

4042
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
the change that she made
 

4043
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:10,790
the change that she made
but it was profound for me i because

4044
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:10,800
but it was profound for me i because
 

4045
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:11,830
but it was profound for me i because
like those

4046
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:11,840
like those
 

4047
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,229
like those
calculus students i started to hear

4048
01:10:14,229 --> 01:10:14,239
calculus students i started to hear
 

4049
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:16,229
calculus students i started to hear
other people's ways of thinking and

4050
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
other people's ways of thinking and
 

4051
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,550
other people's ways of thinking and
seeing it we would talk together and

4052
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
seeing it we would talk together and
 

4053
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,149
seeing it we would talk together and
come up with solutions and i was like

4054
01:10:20,149 --> 01:10:20,159
come up with solutions and i was like
 

4055
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,390
come up with solutions and i was like
that was it that changed maths for me

4056
01:10:22,390 --> 01:10:22,400
that was it that changed maths for me
 

4057
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:23,990
that was it that changed maths for me
and i know so it wasn't some kind of

4058
01:10:23,990 --> 01:10:24,000
and i know so it wasn't some kind of
 

4059
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,750
and i know so it wasn't some kind of
personal interaction with her it was

4060
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:25,760
personal interaction with her it was
 

4061
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,870
personal interaction with her it was
more like

4062
01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:26,880
more like
 

4063
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,229
more like
she uh

4064
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:28,239
she uh
 

4065
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:29,430
she uh
she was the catalyst for that

4066
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:29,440
she was the catalyst for that
 

4067
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:31,910
she was the catalyst for that
collaborative experience

4068
01:10:31,910 --> 01:10:31,920
collaborative experience
 

4069
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,990
collaborative experience
i mean yeah the many ways teachers can

4070
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:34,000
i mean yeah the many ways teachers can
 

4071
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,990
i mean yeah the many ways teachers can
inspire kids i mean sometimes it's a

4072
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:36,000
inspire kids i mean sometimes it's a
 

4073
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,590
inspire kids i mean sometimes it's a
personal message but

4074
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:37,600
personal message but
 

4075
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,550
personal message but
it can be your teaching approach that

4076
01:10:40,550 --> 01:10:40,560
it can be your teaching approach that
 

4077
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:42,310
it can be your teaching approach that
changes maths for kids

4078
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
changes maths for kids
 

4079
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,870
changes maths for kids
you know uh cal newport

4080
01:10:44,870 --> 01:10:44,880
you know uh cal newport
 

4081
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,470
you know uh cal newport
he uh he wrote a book called deep work

4082
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:48,480
he uh he wrote a book called deep work
 

4083
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,390
he uh he wrote a book called deep work
and he's a mathematician a theoretical

4084
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:50,400
and he's a mathematician a theoretical
 

4085
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:52,870
and he's a mathematician a theoretical
computer scientist and he talks about

4086
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:52,880
computer scientist and he talks about
 

4087
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,270
computer scientist and he talks about
the kind of the focus required

4088
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:55,280
the kind of the focus required
 

4089
01:10:55,280 --> 01:10:58,470
the kind of the focus required
yeah to do that kind of work is there

4090
01:10:58,470 --> 01:10:58,480
yeah to do that kind of work is there
 

4091
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,430
yeah to do that kind of work is there
something

4092
01:10:59,430 --> 01:10:59,440
something
 

4093
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:01,590
something
you can comment on

4094
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
you can comment on
 

4095
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,270
you can comment on
you know we live in a in a world full of

4096
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
you know we live in a in a world full of
 

4097
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,870
you know we live in a in a world full of
distractions

4098
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:04,880
distractions
 

4099
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,270
distractions
that that seems like one of the elements

4100
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:07,280
that that seems like one of the elements
 

4101
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:09,110
that that seems like one of the elements
that makes studying and especially the

4102
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,120
that makes studying and especially the
 

4103
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:10,790
that makes studying and especially the
studying of subjects that require

4104
01:11:10,790 --> 01:11:10,800
studying of subjects that require
 

4105
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,270
studying of subjects that require
thinking like math does

4106
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:13,280
thinking like math does
 

4107
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:14,390
thinking like math does
difficult

4108
01:11:14,390 --> 01:11:14,400
difficult
 

4109
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:16,790
difficult
is there something from a student

4110
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:16,800
is there something from a student
 

4111
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,550
is there something from a student
perspective from a teacher perspective

4112
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:18,560
perspective from a teacher perspective
 

4113
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,470
perspective from a teacher perspective
that encourages deep work

4114
01:11:20,470 --> 01:11:20,480
that encourages deep work
 

4115
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:23,270
that encourages deep work
that you can come up with yeah i think

4116
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:23,280
that you can come up with yeah i think
 

4117
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:24,830
that you can come up with yeah i think
giving kids

4118
01:11:24,830 --> 01:11:24,840
giving kids
 

4119
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:29,030
giving kids
really inspiring deep problems and we

4120
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
really inspiring deep problems and we
 

4121
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,430
really inspiring deep problems and we
have some on our website

4122
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:31,440
have some on our website
 

4123
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,430
have some on our website
is a really important experience for

4124
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:33,440
is a really important experience for
 

4125
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,229
is a really important experience for
them

4126
01:11:34,229 --> 01:11:34,239
them
 

4127
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:38,149
them
um even if they only do it occasionally

4128
01:11:38,149 --> 01:11:38,159
um even if they only do it occasionally
 

4129
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:39,030
um even if they only do it occasionally
but

4130
01:11:39,030 --> 01:11:39,040
but
 

4131
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:41,110
but
it's really important they actually

4132
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:41,120
it's really important they actually
 

4133
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,910
it's really important they actually
realize i i do i give a problem out

4134
01:11:43,910 --> 01:11:43,920
realize i i do i give a problem out
 

4135
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:45,590
realize i i do i give a problem out
often when i'm working with teachers and

4136
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:45,600
often when i'm working with teachers and
 

4137
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,590
often when i'm working with teachers and
i say to them all right i'm going to

4138
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:47,600
i say to them all right i'm going to
 

4139

i say to them all right i'm going to
check in with you after an hour

4140
01:11:49,669 --> 01:11:49,679
check in with you after an hour
 

4141
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:52,310
check in with you after an hour
and they're like an hour they think it's

4142
01:11:52,310 --> 01:11:52,320
and they're like an hour they think it's
 

4143
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,430
and they're like an hour they think it's
shocking

4144
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:53,440
shocking
 

4145
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:55,510
shocking
and then they work on this problem and

4146
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:55,520
and then they work on this problem and
 

4147
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,270
and then they work on this problem and
after an hour i say okay how are we

4148
01:11:57,270 --> 01:11:57,280
after an hour i say okay how are we
 

4149
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:00,470
after an hour i say okay how are we
doing like an hour's gone by

4150
01:12:00,470 --> 01:12:00,480
doing like an hour's gone by
 

4151
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:03,110
doing like an hour's gone by
how is this possible yeah and

4152
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120
how is this possible yeah and
 

4153
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:03,910
how is this possible yeah and
so

4154
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920
so
 

4155
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,870
so
everybody needs those like rich deep

4156
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:06,880
everybody needs those like rich deep
 

4157
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:09,830
everybody needs those like rich deep
problems most kids go through their

4158
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:09,840
problems most kids go through their
 

4159
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:13,030
problems most kids go through their
whole maths experience of however many

4160
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
whole maths experience of however many
 

4161
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,870
whole maths experience of however many
years never once

4162
01:12:14,870 --> 01:12:14,880
years never once
 

4163
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,630
years never once
working on a problem in that kind of

4164
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:16,640
working on a problem in that kind of
 

4165
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:17,990
working on a problem in that kind of
deep way

4166
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:18,000
deep way
 

4167
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:18,790
deep way
so

4168
01:12:18,790 --> 01:12:18,800
so
 

4169
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:21,350
so
i the the undergrad class i teach at

4170
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:21,360
i the the undergrad class i teach at
 

4171
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,350
i the the undergrad class i teach at
stanford we do that we work on these

4172
01:12:23,350 --> 01:12:23,360
stanford we do that we work on these
 

4173
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:24,709
stanford we do that we work on these
deep problems

4174
01:12:24,709 --> 01:12:24,719
deep problems
 

4175
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:26,229
deep problems
every session

4176
01:12:26,229 --> 01:12:26,239
every session
 

4177
01:12:26,239 --> 01:12:28,310
every session
and the students come away going okay i

4178
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:28,320
and the students come away going okay i
 

4179
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,470
and the students come away going okay i
never want to go back to that maths

4180
01:12:30,470 --> 01:12:30,480
never want to go back to that maths
 

4181
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:31,910
never want to go back to that maths
relationship i had where it was just all

4182
01:12:31,910 --> 01:12:31,920
relationship i had where it was just all
 

4183
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,070
relationship i had where it was just all
about quick answers i

4184
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
about quick answers i
 

4185
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,950
about quick answers i
i just don't want to go back to that and

4186
01:12:36,950 --> 01:12:36,960
i just don't want to go back to that and
 

4187
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:38,390
i just don't want to go back to that and
so

4188
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
so
 

4189
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:40,709
so
we can all all teachers can incorporate

4190
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:40,719
we can all all teachers can incorporate
 

4191
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:42,470
we can all all teachers can incorporate
those problems in their classrooms maybe

4192
01:12:42,470 --> 01:12:42,480
those problems in their classrooms maybe
 

4193
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,470
those problems in their classrooms maybe
they don't do them every day but

4194
01:12:44,470 --> 01:12:44,480
they don't do them every day but
 

4195
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,110
they don't do them every day but
they at least give kids some experience

4196
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:47,120
they at least give kids some experience
 

4197
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,070
they at least give kids some experience
of

4198
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:48,080
of
 

4199
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,870
of
being able to work slowly and deeply and

4200
01:12:50,870 --> 01:12:50,880
being able to work slowly and deeply and
 

4201
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,750
being able to work slowly and deeply and
to go to deeper places and

4202
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:53,760
to go to deeper places and
 

4203
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,270
to go to deeper places and
not

4204
01:12:55,270 --> 01:12:55,280
not
 

4205
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:56,229
not
be

4206
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
be
 

4207
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:58,149
be
told they've got five minutes to finish

4208
01:12:58,149 --> 01:12:58,159
told they've got five minutes to finish
 

4209
01:12:58,159 --> 01:13:00,390
told they've got five minutes to finish
20 questions yeah well part of it is

4210
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:00,400
20 questions yeah well part of it is
 

4211

01:13:04,390 --> 01:13:04,400
the exercise of sitting there
 

4215
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:06,070
the exercise of sitting there
maintaining focus for prolonged periods

4216
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
maintaining focus for prolonged periods
 

4217
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,030
maintaining focus for prolonged periods
of time

4218
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:07,040
of time
 

4219
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:09,350
of time
that's not often

4220
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:09,360
that's not often
 

4221
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,229
that's not often
i mean um that's a skill yeah it's a

4222
01:13:12,229 --> 01:13:12,239
i mean um that's a skill yeah it's a
 

4223
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,590
i mean um that's a skill yeah it's a
skill

4224
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:13,600
skill
 

4225
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,910
skill
that uh that also could be discouraging

4226
01:13:15,910 --> 01:13:15,920
that uh that also could be discouraging
 

4227
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:18,310
that uh that also could be discouraging
like if you don't practice it just

4228
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:18,320
like if you don't practice it just
 

4229
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,550
like if you don't practice it just
sitting down for 10 minutes straight and

4230
01:13:20,550 --> 01:13:20,560
sitting down for 10 minutes straight and
 

4231
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,910
sitting down for 10 minutes straight and
maintaining deep focus could be

4232
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:21,920
maintaining deep focus could be
 

4233
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,070
maintaining deep focus could be
exceptionally challenging like if you're

4234
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:24,080
exceptionally challenging like if you're
 

4235
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,550
exceptionally challenging like if you're
really thinking about a problem

4236
01:13:26,550 --> 01:13:26,560
really thinking about a problem
 

4237
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:28,630
really thinking about a problem
and to re i think it's really important

4238
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:28,640
and to re i think it's really important
 

4239
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,149
and to re i think it's really important
to realize that that's a skill that you

4240
01:13:30,149 --> 01:13:30,159
to realize that that's a skill that you
 

4241
01:13:30,159 --> 01:13:30,950
to realize that that's a skill that you
can

4242
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
can
 

4243
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,550
can
just like a muscle you can build you can

4244
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:32,560
just like a muscle you can build you can
 

4245
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,070
just like a muscle you can build you can
start with five minutes it goes to 10

4246
01:13:34,070 --> 01:13:34,080
start with five minutes it goes to 10
 

4247
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,709
start with five minutes it goes to 10
minutes to 30 into an hour and

4248
01:13:36,709 --> 01:13:36,719
minutes to 30 into an hour and
 

4249
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:38,470
minutes to 30 into an hour and
and to be successful i think in certain

4250
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:38,480
and to be successful i think in certain
 

4251
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,110
and to be successful i think in certain
subjects like mathematics you want to be

4252
01:13:41,110 --> 01:13:41,120
subjects like mathematics you want to be
 

4253
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,669
subjects like mathematics you want to be
able to develop that skill otherwise

4254
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:43,679
able to develop that skill otherwise
 

4255
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,910
able to develop that skill otherwise
you're not going to get to the the

4256
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
you're not going to get to the the
 

4257
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,470
you're not going to get to the the
really rewarding experience of solving

4258
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:50,480
really rewarding experience of solving
 

4259
01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:52,390
really rewarding experience of solving
these problems

4260
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:52,400
these problems
 

4261
01:13:52,400 --> 01:13:53,430
these problems
definitely

4262
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
definitely
 

4263
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,590
definitely
there was a survey done of kids in

4264
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:55,600
there was a survey done of kids in
 

4265
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:56,950
there was a survey done of kids in
school where they were asked how long

4266
01:13:56,950 --> 01:13:56,960
school where they were asked how long
 

4267
01:13:56,960 --> 01:13:58,550
school where they were asked how long
will you work on a maths problem before

4268
01:13:58,550 --> 01:13:58,560
will you work on a maths problem before
 

4269
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,709
will you work on a maths problem before
you give up and decide it's not

4270
01:14:00,709 --> 01:14:00,719
you give up and decide it's not
 

4271
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:03,430
you give up and decide it's not
possible to solve that question and the

4272
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:03,440
possible to solve that question and the
 

4273
01:14:03,440 --> 01:14:05,910
possible to solve that question and the
result on average across the kids was

4274
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:05,920
result on average across the kids was
 

4275
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,189
result on average across the kids was
two minutes

4276
01:14:09,189 --> 01:14:09,199

 

4277
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:11,270

yeah

4278
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:11,280
yeah
 

4279
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:12,709
yeah
so that's

4280
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
so that's
 

4281
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,550
so that's
a bad sign but that's that was the

4282
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:14,560
a bad sign but that's that was the
 

4283
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:17,430
a bad sign but that's that was the
powerful sign that uh they need to learn

4284
01:14:17,430 --> 01:14:17,440
powerful sign that uh they need to learn
 

4285
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,430
powerful sign that uh they need to learn
to not give up so quickly

4286
01:14:19,430 --> 01:14:19,440
to not give up so quickly
 

4287
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:20,310
to not give up so quickly
yeah

4288
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:20,320
yeah
 

4289
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,790
yeah
uh we mentioned offline

4290
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:22,800
uh we mentioned offline
 

4291
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,470
uh we mentioned offline
because we've been talking so much about

4292
01:14:24,470 --> 01:14:24,480
because we've been talking so much about
 

4293
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:26,390
because we've been talking so much about
visualization

4294
01:14:26,390 --> 01:14:26,400
visualization
 

4295
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,189
visualization
uh grant sanderson three luanne brown

4296
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:29,199
uh grant sanderson three luanne brown
 

4297
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,229
uh grant sanderson three luanne brown
so

4298
01:14:30,229 --> 01:14:30,239
so
 

4299
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:32,229
so
he's inspired millions of people with

4300
01:14:32,229 --> 01:14:32,239
he's inspired millions of people with
 

4301
01:14:32,239 --> 01:14:34,870
he's inspired millions of people with
the kind of uh exactly the kind of way

4302

the kind of uh exactly the kind of way
 

4303
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:36,229
the kind of uh exactly the kind of way
of thinking that you've been talking

4304
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:36,239
of thinking that you've been talking
 

4305

work converting sort of uh

4308
01:14:41,189 --> 01:14:41,199
work converting sort of uh
 

4309
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:44,790
work converting sort of uh
mathematical concepts into visual

4310
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:44,800
mathematical concepts into visual
 

4311
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:45,669
mathematical concepts into visual
uh

4312
01:14:45,669 --> 01:14:45,679
uh
 

4313
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,070
uh
like uh visually representing them

4314
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:48,080
like uh visually representing them
 

4315
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:50,310
like uh visually representing them
exploring them in ways that uh help you

4316
01:14:50,310 --> 01:14:50,320
exploring them in ways that uh help you
 

4317
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,709
exploring them in ways that uh help you
illuminate like the concepts

4318
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:52,719
illuminate like the concepts
 

4319
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:53,590
illuminate like the concepts
um

4320
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600
um
 

4321
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,110
um
what do you think is the role of that so

4322
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:55,120
what do you think is the role of that so
 

4323
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:57,189
what do you think is the role of that so
he uses mostly programmatic

4324
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
he uses mostly programmatic
 

4325
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,709
he uses mostly programmatic
visualization so it's the thing i

4326
01:14:58,709 --> 01:14:58,719
visualization so it's the thing i
 

4327
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:01,350
visualization so it's the thing i
mentioned where there's like animations

4328
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:01,360
mentioned where there's like animations
 

4329
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,030
mentioned where there's like animations
created by writing uh computer programs

4330
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,040
created by writing uh computer programs
 

4331
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:07,110
created by writing uh computer programs
um like what what do you think how

4332
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:07,120
um like what what do you think how
 

4333
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,189
um like what what do you think how
scalable is that approach but in general

4334
01:15:09,189 --> 01:15:09,199
scalable is that approach but in general
 

4335
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:10,390
scalable is that approach but in general
what do you think about his impression i

4336
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:10,400
what do you think about his impression i
 

4337
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,630
what do you think about his impression i
think it's amazing i should work with

4338
01:15:12,630 --> 01:15:12,640
think it's amazing i should work with
 

4339
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:14,550
think it's amazing i should work with
him

4340
01:15:14,550 --> 01:15:14,560
him
 

4341
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,189
him
i i can share some of our visuals and he

4342
01:15:17,189 --> 01:15:17,199
i i can share some of our visuals and he
 

4343
01:15:17,199 --> 01:15:20,870
i i can share some of our visuals and he
can make them in that amazing way um

4344
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:20,880
can make them in that amazing way um
 

4345
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:23,350
can make them in that amazing way um
so part of his storytelling part of it

4346
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:23,360
so part of his storytelling part of it
 

4347
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:24,870
so part of his storytelling part of it
is like

4348
01:15:24,870 --> 01:15:24,880
is like
 

4349
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:26,950
is like
it's creating the visuals and then

4350
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:26,960
it's creating the visuals and then
 

4351
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:29,350
it's creating the visuals and then
weaving a story with those visuals

4352
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:29,360
weaving a story with those visuals
 

4353
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:32,070
weaving a story with those visuals
that kind of builds like there's also i

4354
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:32,080
that kind of builds like there's also i
 

4355
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,110
that kind of builds like there's also i
mean

4356
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:33,120
mean
 

4357
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,430
mean
there's also drama in it you start with

4358
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
there's also drama in it you start with
 

4359
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,750
there's also drama in it you start with
a small example and then you kind of all

4360
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:37,760
a small example and then you kind of all
 

4361
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,630
a small example and then you kind of all
of a sudden there's a surprise yeah yeah

4362
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:40,640
of a sudden there's a surprise yeah yeah
 

4363

of a sudden there's a surprise yeah yeah
yeah and it really i mean it makes you

4364
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:42,800
yeah and it really i mean it makes you
 

4365
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,709
yeah and it really i mean it makes you
fall in love with the that's right with

4366

4367
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:48,390
fall in love with the that's right with
the concept yeah he does talk about that

4368
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:48,400
the concept yeah he does talk about that
 

4369
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,510
the concept yeah he does talk about that
his sense is like some of the stuff he

4370
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:51,520
his sense is like some of the stuff he
 

4371
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,189
his sense is like some of the stuff he
he he doesn't feel like he's teaching

4372
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,199
he he doesn't feel like he's teaching
 

4373
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:57,669
he he doesn't feel like he's teaching
like the core curriculum which is

4374
01:15:57,669 --> 01:15:57,679
like the core curriculum which is
 

4375
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,990
like the core curriculum which is

but because i think it's too difficult

4382
01:16:05,669 --> 01:16:05,679
but because i think it's too difficult
 

4383
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,990
but because i think it's too difficult
to kind of convert all of the curriculum

4384
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:08,000
to kind of convert all of the curriculum
 

4385
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,590
to kind of convert all of the curriculum
into those elements

4386
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:09,600
into those elements
 

4387
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:11,750
into those elements
and probably you don't need to i mean

4388
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:11,760
and probably you don't need to i mean
 

4389
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:12,630
and probably you don't need to i mean
you

4390

if
 

4393
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,430
if
people get to experience mathematical

4394
01:16:15,430 --> 01:16:15,440
people get to experience mathematical
 

4395
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:18,310
people get to experience mathematical
ideas in the way that he shares them

4396
01:16:18,310 --> 01:16:18,320
ideas in the way that he shares them
 

4397
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,229
ideas in the way that he shares them
um that will change them and it will

4398
01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:20,239
um that will change them and it will
 

4399
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:21,910
um that will change them and it will
change the way they they think and maybe

4400
01:16:21,910 --> 01:16:21,920
change the way they they think and maybe
 

4401
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,510
change the way they they think and maybe
they could go on to

4402
01:16:23,510 --> 01:16:23,520
they could go on to
 

4403
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:25,030
they could go on to
take some other mathematical idea and

4404
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:25,040
take some other mathematical idea and
 

4405
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:27,750
take some other mathematical idea and
make it that beautiful well he does that

4406
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:27,760
make it that beautiful well he does that
 

4407
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:28,950
make it that beautiful well he does that
uh there's a

4408
01:16:28,950 --> 01:16:28,960
uh there's a
 

4409
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:31,750
uh there's a
he created a library called manum

4410
01:16:31,750 --> 01:16:31,760
he created a library called manum
 

4411
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,149
he created a library called manum
and he open-sourced it and that library

4412
01:16:34,149 --> 01:16:34,159
and he open-sourced it and that library
 

4413
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,390
and he open-sourced it and that library
is the uh people should check it out

4414
01:16:36,390 --> 01:16:36,400
is the uh people should check it out
 

4415
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:37,669
is the uh people should check it out
it's

4416
01:16:37,669 --> 01:16:37,679
it's
 

4417
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:39,510
it's
written in python

4418
01:16:39,510 --> 01:16:39,520
written in python
 

4419
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,910
written in python
and it uses some of those same elements

4420
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:41,920
and it uses some of those same elements
 

4421
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:43,990
and it uses some of those same elements
like it allows you to animate equations

4422
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,000
like it allows you to animate equations
 

4423
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,390
like it allows you to animate equations
and animate little shapes like people

4424
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:46,400
and animate little shapes like people
 

4425
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:47,270
and animate little shapes like people
that

4426
01:16:47,270 --> 01:16:47,280
that
 

4427
01:16:47,280 --> 01:16:49,189
that
you know he has a very distinct style in

4428
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:49,199
you know he has a very distinct style in
 

4429
01:16:49,199 --> 01:16:51,669
you know he has a very distinct style in
his videos and what that resulted in

4430
01:16:51,669 --> 01:16:51,679
his videos and what that resulted in
 

4431
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:53,590
his videos and what that resulted in
even though from a software engineer

4432
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:53,600
even though from a software engineer
 

4433
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,430
even though from a software engineer
perspective the code he released is not

4434
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:55,440
perspective the code he released is not
 

4435
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:56,390
perspective the code he released is not
like

4436
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:56,400
like
 

4437
01:16:56,400 --> 01:16:58,950
like
super well documented or perfect

4438
01:16:58,950 --> 01:16:58,960
super well documented or perfect
 

4439
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:01,750
super well documented or perfect
but him releasing that

01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:01,760
but him releasing that
 

4441
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,070
but him releasing that
now there's all of these other people

4442
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:04,080
now there's all of these other people
 

4443
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:06,390
now there's all of these other people
educating it and the cool to me

4444
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:06,400
educating it and the cool to me
 

4445
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:08,070
educating it and the cool to me
personally the coolest thing is to see

4446
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:08,080
personally the coolest thing is to see
 

4447
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,830
personally the coolest thing is to see
like

4448
01:17:09,830 --> 01:17:09,840
like
 

4449
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:11,990
like
people they're not you know

4450
01:17:11,990 --> 01:17:12,000
people they're not you know
 

4451
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:13,910
people they're not you know
don't have like a million subscribers or

4452
01:17:13,910 --> 01:17:13,920
don't have like a million subscribers or
 

4453
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:16,149
don't have like a million subscribers or
something is they they they have just a

4454
01:17:16,149 --> 01:17:16,159
something is they they they have just a
 

4455
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:18,630
something is they they they have just a
few views on the video but it just seems

4456
01:17:18,630 --> 01:17:18,640
few views on the video but it just seems
 

4457
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,430
few views on the video but it just seems
like

4458
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:19,440
like
 

4459
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,550
like
the process of them creating a video

4460
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:22,560
the process of them creating a video
 

4461
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:24,310
the process of them creating a video
where they teach

4462
01:17:24,310 --> 01:17:24,320
where they teach
 

4463
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,229
where they teach
is like transformative to them yeah from

4464
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:26,239
is like transformative to them yeah from
 

4465
01:17:26,239 --> 01:17:27,590
is like transformative to them yeah from
a student perspective it's the old

4466
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:27,600
a student perspective it's the old
 

4467
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:29,270
a student perspective it's the old
feynman thing the best way to learn is

4468
01:17:29,270 --> 01:17:29,280
feynman thing the best way to learn is
 

4469
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,270
feynman thing the best way to learn is
to teach right and then him releasing

4470
01:17:31,270 --> 01:17:31,280
to teach right and then him releasing
 

4471
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,830
to teach right and then him releasing
that into the wild is yeah

4472
01:17:33,830 --> 01:17:33,840
that into the wild is yeah
 

4473
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:36,149
that into the wild is yeah
it shows that that impact yeah

4474
01:17:36,149 --> 01:17:36,159
it shows that that impact yeah
 

4475
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:37,430
it shows that that impact yeah
absolutely

4476
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:37,440
absolutely
 

4477
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:39,750
absolutely
i think just giving people that idea

4478
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:39,760
i think just giving people that idea
 

4479
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,149
i think just giving people that idea
that you can do that with maths and

4480
01:17:42,149 --> 01:17:42,159
that you can do that with maths and
 

4481
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:43,830
that you can do that with maths and
other subjects they're

4482
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:43,840
other subjects they're
 

4483
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,390
other subjects they're
bound to be people all around who can

4484
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
bound to be people all around who can
 

4485
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,110
bound to be people all around who can
create more which is cool yeah i

4486
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:49,120
create more which is cool yeah i
 

4487
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,270
create more which is cool yeah i
definitely so i recommend people do like

4488
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:51,280
definitely so i recommend people do like
 

4489
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:53,189
definitely so i recommend people do like
javascript or python you can you can

4490
01:17:53,189 --> 01:17:53,199
javascript or python you can you can
 

4491
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:55,430
javascript or python you can you can
build like visualizations of

4492
01:17:55,430 --> 01:17:55,440
build like visualizations of
 

4493
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,910
build like visualizations of
most concepts in high school math you

4494
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:57,920
most concepts in high school math you
 

4495
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:59,910
most concepts in high school math you
can do a lot of kinds of visualizations

4496
01:17:59,910 --> 01:17:59,920
can do a lot of kinds of visualizations
 

4497
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:01,430
can do a lot of kinds of visualizations
and doing that yourself

4498
01:18:01,430 --> 01:18:01,440
and doing that yourself
 

4499
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:03,189
and doing that yourself
plus if you do that yourself people

4500
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:03,199
plus if you do that yourself people
 

4501
01:18:03,199 --> 01:18:06,229
plus if you do that yourself people
really love it people actually

4502
01:18:06,229 --> 01:18:06,239
really love it people actually
 

4503
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,950
really love it people actually
people love visualizations of math

4504
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:08,960
people love visualizations of math
 

4505
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,709
people love visualizations of math
yeah because they i mean it's something

4506
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
yeah because they i mean it's something
 

4507
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,950
yeah because they i mean it's something
in us that loves patterns loves figuring

4508
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:12,960
in us that loves patterns loves figuring
 

4509
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,390
in us that loves patterns loves figuring
out difficult things and the patterns in

4510
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,400
out difficult things and the patterns in
 

4511
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,950
out difficult things and the patterns in
that are then are unexpected in some way

4512
01:18:18,950 --> 01:18:18,960
that are then are unexpected in some way
 

4513
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,910
that are then are unexpected in some way
yeah have you ever noticed that hotels

4514
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:21,920
yeah have you ever noticed that hotels
 

4515
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:24,070
yeah have you ever noticed that hotels
are always filled with patterns

4516
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
are always filled with patterns
 

4517
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,590
are always filled with patterns
i was just noticing at the hotel i mean

4518
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:25,600
i was just noticing at the hotel i mean
 

4519
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,070
i was just noticing at the hotel i mean
now all of their carpets are patent

4520
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:28,080
now all of their carpets are patent
 

4521
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:29,750
now all of their carpets are patent
carpets and then they have patterns on

4522
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:29,760
carpets and then they have patterns on
 

4523
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:30,790
carpets and then they have patterns on
the walls

4524
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:30,800
the walls
 

4525
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:32,470
the walls
yeah so

4526
01:18:32,470 --> 01:18:32,480
yeah so
 

4527
01:18:32,480 --> 01:18:34,790
yeah so
yeah we humans love

4528
01:18:34,790 --> 01:18:34,800
yeah we humans love
 

4529
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,870
yeah we humans love
the symmetry and patterns the breaking

4530
01:18:36,870 --> 01:18:36,880
the symmetry and patterns the breaking
 

4531
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,830
the symmetry and patterns the breaking
of symmetry patterns

4532
01:18:38,830 --> 01:18:38,840
of symmetry patterns
 

4533
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:42,070
of symmetry patterns
yeah and it's funny that we don't see

4534
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:42,080
yeah and it's funny that we don't see
 

4535
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:43,910
yeah and it's funny that we don't see
mathematics is somehow intricately

4536
01:18:43,910 --> 01:18:43,920
mathematics is somehow intricately
 

4537
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,149
mathematics is somehow intricately
connected to that but it is right i mean

4538
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:46,159
connected to that but it is right i mean
 

4539
01:18:46,159 --> 01:18:47,750
connected to that but it is right i mean
that's one of the perspectives i love

4540
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:47,760
that's one of the perspectives i love
 

4541
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,669
that's one of the perspectives i love
students to take is to be a pattern

4542
01:18:49,669 --> 01:18:49,679
students to take is to be a pattern
 

4543
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:50,950
students to take is to be a pattern
seeker

4544
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:50,960
seeker
 

4545
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:52,950
seeker
in everything in in yeah certainly in

4546
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
in everything in in yeah certainly in
 

4547
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:54,790
in everything in in yeah certainly in
all of maths i mean you can think of all

4548
01:18:54,790 --> 01:18:54,800
all of maths i mean you can think of all
 

4549
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,470
all of maths i mean you can think of all
of maths as a kind of subject of

4550
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:56,480
of maths as a kind of subject of
 

4551
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:57,990
of maths as a kind of subject of
patterns and

4552
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
patterns and
 

4553
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,189
patterns and
not just visual patterns but

4554
01:19:01,189 --> 01:19:01,199
not just visual patterns but
 

4555
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:03,270
not just visual patterns but
you know when you think about

4556
01:19:03,270 --> 01:19:03,280
you know when you think about
 

4557
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,669
you know when you think about
multiplying by five

4558
01:19:05,669 --> 01:19:05,679
multiplying by five
 

4559
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:07,669
multiplying by five
and the fact you can

4560
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:07,679
and the fact you can
 

4561
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:09,830
and the fact you can
you know if you if you're multiplying 18

4562
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:09,840
you know if you if you're multiplying 18
 

4563
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,189
you know if you if you're multiplying 18
times 5

4564
01:19:11,189 --> 01:19:11,199
times 5
 

4565
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:14,630
times 5
you can instead think of 9 times 10.

4566
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
you can instead think of 9 times 10.
 

4567
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:16,630
you can instead think of 9 times 10.
that's a pattern that always works in

4568
01:19:16,630 --> 01:19:16,640
that's a pattern that always works in
 

4569
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,990
that's a pattern that always works in
mathematics you can have a number and

4570
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:18,000
mathematics you can have a number and
 

4571
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,070
mathematics you can have a number and
double number and so yeah i just think

4572
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
double number and so yeah i just think
 

4573
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,510
double number and so yeah i just think
there are patterns everywhere and if

4574
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:21,520
there are patterns everywhere and if
 

4575
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,830
there are patterns everywhere and if
kids are thinking their role is to see

4576
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:23,840
kids are thinking their role is to see
 

4577
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,630
kids are thinking their role is to see
patterns and find patterns it's

4578
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
patterns and find patterns it's
 

4579
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:28,470
patterns and find patterns it's
really exciting

4580
01:19:28,470 --> 01:19:28,480
really exciting
 

4581
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:30,630
really exciting
what do you think about like mit open

4582
01:19:30,630 --> 01:19:30,640
what do you think about like mit open

and the release of lectures by
 

4587
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:37,669
and the release of lectures by
universities i think it's good

4588
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:37,679
universities i think it's good

that is what started

4592
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
that is what started

the
 

4595
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,870
the
mooc i did was

4596
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:44,880
mooc i did was
 

4597
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:46,870
mooc i did was
using that platform so you ultimately

4598
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:46,880
using that platform so you ultimately
 

4599
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,110
using that platform so you ultimately
think like the udacity model is a little

4600
01:19:49,110 --> 01:19:49,120
think like the udacity model is a little
 

4601
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,390
think like the udacity model is a little
bit more effective

4602
01:19:50,390 --> 01:19:50,400
bit more effective
 

4603
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:52,550
bit more effective
than just a plain two-hour lecture i

4604
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:52,560
than just a plain two-hour lecture i
 

4605
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,070
than just a plain two-hour lecture i
think there's definitely you can bring

4606
01:19:54,070 --> 01:19:54,080
think there's definitely you can bring
 

4607
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:56,950
think there's definitely you can bring
in good pedagogy into online learning

4608
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:56,960
in good pedagogy into online learning
 

4609
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,110
in good pedagogy into online learning
and i think the idea of putting things

4610
01:19:59,110 --> 01:19:59,120
and i think the idea of putting things
 

4611
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:00,950
and i think the idea of putting things
online so that people all over the world

4612
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:00,960
online so that people all over the world
 

4613
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:03,110
online so that people all over the world
can access them it's great i don't think

4614
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:03,120
can access them it's great i don't think
 

4615
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,990
can access them it's great i don't think
the initial excitement around moocs

the initial excitement around moocs
sort of democratizing education and

01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:08,400
sort of democratizing education and
 

4619
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,990
sort of democratizing education and
making it more equal

4620
01:20:09,990 --> 01:20:10,000
making it more equal
 

4621
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,030
making it more equal
um

4622
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:11,040
um
 

4623

um
came about because they found that the

4624
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,040
came about because they found that the
 

4625
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:14,709

it shows maths as this visual creative

4652
01:20:43,830 --> 01:20:43,840
it shows maths as this visual creative
 

4653
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,149
it shows maths as this visual creative
subject and it shares mindset and some

kids who take it do better in maths

4660
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:50,880
kids who take it do better in maths
 

4661
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:52,629
kids who take it do better in maths
class we've studied it with like

4662
01:20:52,629 --> 01:20:52,639
class we've studied it with like
 

4663
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,189
class we've studied it with like
randomized controlled trials and

4664
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:55,199
randomized controlled trials and
 

4665
01:20:55,199 --> 01:20:58,310
randomized controlled trials and
given it to middle school kids and other

4666
01:20:58,310 --> 01:20:58,320
given it to middle school kids and other
 

4667
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,149
given it to middle school kids and other
middle school kids who don't take it but

4668
01:21:00,149 --> 01:21:00,159
middle school kids who don't take it but
 

4669
01:21:00,159 --> 01:21:01,669
middle school kids who don't take it but
are taught by the same teachers so their

4670
01:21:01,669 --> 01:21:01,679
are taught by the same teachers so their
 

4671
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:03,669
are taught by the same teachers so their
teachers are the same and the kids who

4672
01:21:03,669 --> 01:21:03,679
teachers are the same and the kids who
 

4673
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,830
teachers are the same and the kids who
take the online class end up

4674
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:05,840
take the online class end up
 

4675
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:09,350
take the online class end up
68 more engaged in their maths class and

4676
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:09,360
68 more engaged in their maths class and
 

4677
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:11,590
68 more engaged in their maths class and
do better at the end of the year so

4678
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:11,600
do better at the end of the year so
 

4679
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,629
do better at the end of the year so
that's a little six session 15 minute

4680
01:21:14,629 --> 01:21:14,639
that's a little six session 15 minute
 

4681
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:16,550
that's a little six session 15 minute
class and

4682
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:16,560
class and
 

4683
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:19,910
class and
it changes kids maths relationships so

4684
01:21:19,910 --> 01:21:19,920
it changes kids maths relationships so
 

4685
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:23,189
it changes kids maths relationships so
it is true that we can do that with some

4686
01:21:23,189 --> 01:21:23,199
it is true that we can do that with some
 

4687
01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:24,870
it is true that we can do that with some
words

4688
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:24,880
words
 

4689
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,270
words
that aren't you know not it's not a huge

4690
01:21:27,270 --> 01:21:27,280
that aren't you know not it's not a huge
 

4691
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,310
that aren't you know not it's not a huge
change to the education system

4692
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:30,320
change to the education system
 

4693
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:33,110
change to the education system
do you have advice for young people

4694
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
do you have advice for young people
 

4695
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,709
do you have advice for young people
we've been talking about mathematics

4696
01:21:34,709 --> 01:21:34,719
we've been talking about mathematics
 

4697
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:35,990
we've been talking about mathematics
quite a bit

4698
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:36,000
quite a bit
 

4699
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,470

01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,750
topic they're interested in but the
reality is the people you surround

4864
01:24:27,750 --> 01:24:27,760
reality is the people you surround
 

4865
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,950
reality is the people you surround
yourself with

4866
01:24:28,950 --> 01:24:28,960
yourself with
 

4867
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:30,629
yourself with
they're going to define

4868
01:24:30,629 --> 01:24:30,639
they're going to define
 

4869
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:34,229
they're going to define
your life yeah trajectory so select

4870
01:24:34,229 --> 01:24:34,239
your life yeah trajectory so select
 

4871
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,390
your life yeah trajectory so select
people they're really true and get away

4872
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,400
people they're really true and get away
 

4873
01:24:36,400 --> 01:24:37,910
people they're really true and get away
from people who don't believe you don't

4874
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:37,920
from people who don't believe you don't
 

4875
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:38,709
from people who don't believe you don't
yeah

4876
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:38,719
yeah
 

4877
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:40,709
yeah
sometimes parents can be that they love

4878
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:40,719
sometimes parents can be that they love
 

4879
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:44,550
sometimes parents can be that they love
you deeply but they be you know they set

4880
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:44,560
you deeply but they be you know they set
 

4881
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:46,550
you deeply but they be you know they set
it's the math thing we mentioned they

4882
01:24:46,550 --> 01:24:46,560
it's the math thing we mentioned they
 

4883
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,229
it's the math thing we mentioned they
might set certain

4884
01:24:48,229 --> 01:24:48,239
might set certain
 

4885
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:50,950
might set certain
constraints on the beliefs that you have

4886
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
constraints on the beliefs that you have
 

4887
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:51,990
constraints on the beliefs that you have
and

4888
01:24:51,990 --> 01:24:52,000
and
 

4889
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:52,870
and
so

4890
01:24:52,870 --> 01:24:52,880
so
 

4891
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:54,470
so
in that if you're interested in

4892
01:24:54,470 --> 01:24:54,480
in that if you're interested in
 

4893
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,070
in that if you're interested in
mathematics and your parents are not

4894
01:24:56,070 --> 01:24:56,080
mathematics and your parents are not
 

4895
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:57,350
mathematics and your parents are not
that interested in it don't listen to

4896
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:57,360
that interested in it don't listen to
 

4897
01:24:57,360 --> 01:24:59,669
that interested in it don't listen to
your parents on that one dimension

4898
01:24:59,669 --> 01:24:59,679
your parents on that one dimension
 

4899
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:00,870
your parents on that one dimension
exactly

4900
01:25:00,870 --> 01:25:00,880
exactly
 

4901
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,550
exactly
yeah and if people tell you you can't do

4902
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:02,560
yeah and if people tell you you can't do
 

4903
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:04,229
yeah and if people tell you you can't do
things you have to

4904
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:04,239
things you have to
 

4905
01:25:04,239 --> 01:25:06,470
things you have to
hear from other people who who believe

4906
01:25:06,470 --> 01:25:06,480
hear from other people who who believe
 

4907
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:08,310
hear from other people who who believe
you i think you're absolutely right

4908
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:08,320
you i think you're absolutely right
 

4909
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:09,350
you i think you're absolutely right
about that

4910
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:09,360
about that
 

4911
01:25:09,360 --> 01:25:11,270
about that
so sad the number of people who've had

4912
01:25:11,270 --> 01:25:11,280
so sad the number of people who've had
 

4913
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,070
so sad the number of people who've had
those negative messages from parents

4914
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:14,080
those negative messages from parents
 

4915
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:16,070
those negative messages from parents
in my limitless mind book i interviewed

4916
01:25:16,070 --> 01:25:16,080
in my limitless mind book i interviewed
 

4917
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,750
in my limitless mind book i interviewed
quite a few people who'd been told they

4918
01:25:17,750 --> 01:25:17,760
quite a few people who'd been told they
 

4919
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:19,990
quite a few people who'd been told they
couldn't do math sometimes by parents

4920
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,000
couldn't do math sometimes by parents
 

4921
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,750
couldn't do math sometimes by parents
sometimes by teachers

4922
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:21,760
sometimes by teachers
 

4923
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:22,629
sometimes by teachers
and

4924
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
and
 

4925
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,950
and
fortunately they had got other ideas at

4926
01:25:24,950 --> 01:25:24,960
fortunately they had got other ideas at
 

4927
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,790
fortunately they had got other ideas at
some point in their life and

4928
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:26,800
some point in their life and
 

4929
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,350
some point in their life and
realized there was this whole world of

4930
01:25:29,350 --> 01:25:29,360
realized there was this whole world of
 

4931
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:31,350
realized there was this whole world of
mathematical thinking that was open to

4932
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:31,360
mathematical thinking that was open to
 

4933
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:32,390
mathematical thinking that was open to
them

4934
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:32,400
them
 

4935
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:33,350
them
so

4936
01:25:33,350 --> 01:25:33,360
so
 

4937
01:25:33,360 --> 01:25:35,830
so
it's really important that people

4938
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:35,840
it's really important that people
 

4939
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:36,950
it's really important that people
do

4940
01:25:36,950 --> 01:25:36,960
do
 

4941
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,110
do
connect with people who believe in them

4942
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:39,120
connect with people who believe in them
 

4943
01:25:39,120 --> 01:25:40,950
connect with people who believe in them
however hard that might be to find those

4944
01:25:40,950 --> 01:25:40,960
however hard that might be to find those
 

4945
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:42,070
however hard that might be to find those
people

4946
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:42,080
people
 

4947
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:44,870
people
what do you hope the education system

4948
01:25:44,870 --> 01:25:44,880
what do you hope the education system
 

4949
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,990
what do you hope the education system
education in general looks like 10 20 50

4950
01:25:47,990 --> 01:25:48,000
education in general looks like 10 20 50
 

4951
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,510
education in general looks like 10 20 50
100 years from now

4952
01:25:49,510 --> 01:25:49,520
100 years from now
 

4953
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,669
100 years from now
are you optimistic about this future

4954
01:25:51,669 --> 01:25:51,679
are you optimistic about this future
 

4955
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:53,910
are you optimistic about this future
yeah i definitely have hope there is

4956
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:53,920
yeah i definitely have hope there is
 

4957
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:55,750
yeah i definitely have hope there is
change can happen in the education

4958
01:25:55,750 --> 01:25:55,760
change can happen in the education
 

4959
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:58,590
change can happen in the education
system in recent years it's been

4960
01:25:58,590 --> 01:25:58,600
system in recent years it's been
 

4961
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,030
system in recent years it's been
microscopically slow

4962
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
microscopically slow
 

4963
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:01,830
microscopically slow
and

4964
01:26:01,830 --> 01:26:01,840
and
 

4965
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:03,350
and
um

4966
01:26:03,350 --> 01:26:03,360
um
 

4967
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,790
um
but

4968
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:04,800
but
 

4969
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:07,270
but
i do actually see change happening like

4970
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:07,280
i do actually see change happening like
 

4971
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,350
i do actually see change happening like
we were talking earlier that

4972
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
we were talking earlier that
 

4973
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:11,430
we were talking earlier that
data science is now a course you can

4974
01:26:11,430 --> 01:26:11,440
data science is now a course you can
 

4975
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,310
data science is now a course you can
take in high school instead of algebra 2

4976
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:14,320
take in high school instead of algebra 2
 

4977
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,629
take in high school instead of algebra 2
and that's pretty amazing because

4978
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:16,639
and that's pretty amazing because
 

4979
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,070
and that's pretty amazing because
that content was set out in 1892 and

4980
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:20,080
that content was set out in 1892 and
 

4981
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:23,270
that content was set out in 1892 and
hasn't changed since then and so now

4982
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,280
hasn't changed since then and so now
 

4983
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,510
hasn't changed since then and so now
we're actually seeing a change in the

4984
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:25,520
we're actually seeing a change in the
 

4985
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:27,830
we're actually seeing a change in the
content of high school so

4986
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
content of high school so
 

4987
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,669
content of high school so
i'm amazed that that's happening and

4988
01:26:29,669 --> 01:26:29,679
i'm amazed that that's happening and
 

4989
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:31,270
i'm amazed that that's happening and
very happy it's happening but

4990
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:31,280
very happy it's happening but
 

4991
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,590
very happy it's happening but
so change is very slow in education

4992
01:26:33,590 --> 01:26:33,600
so change is very slow in education
 

4993
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,350
so change is very slow in education
usually but

4994
01:26:35,350 --> 01:26:35,360
usually but
 

4995
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:37,590
usually but
when you look ahead

4996
01:26:37,590 --> 01:26:37,600
when you look ahead
 

4997
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:40,709
when you look ahead
and think about all that we know

4998
01:26:40,709 --> 01:26:40,719
and think about all that we know
 

4999
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:42,709
and think about all that we know
and all that we can offer kids in terms

5000
01:26:42,709 --> 01:26:42,719
and all that we can offer kids in terms
 

5001
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,270
and all that we can offer kids in terms
of technology

5002
01:26:45,270 --> 01:26:45,280
of technology
 

5003
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:47,750
of technology
you've got to think that 100 years from

5004
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
you've got to think that 100 years from
 

5005
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:48,550
you've got to think that 100 years from
now

5006
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
now
 

5007
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:51,350
now
education will be totally different to

5008
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:51,360
education will be totally different to
 

5009
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:53,510
education will be totally different to
the way it is now maybe we won't have

5010
01:26:53,510 --> 01:26:53,520
the way it is now maybe we won't have
 

5011
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:55,990
the way it is now maybe we won't have
subject boundaries anymore

5012
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:56,000
subject boundaries anymore
 

5013
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,149
subject boundaries anymore
because those don't really make much

5014
01:26:58,149 --> 01:26:58,159
because those don't really make much
 

5015
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,189
because those don't really make much
sense it's interesting to think

5016
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:01,199
sense it's interesting to think
 

5017
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,390
sense it's interesting to think
how certain tools like programming maybe

5018
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:04,400
how certain tools like programming maybe
 

5019
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:05,669
how certain tools like programming maybe
they'll be deeply integrated and

5020
01:27:05,669 --> 01:27:05,679
they'll be deeply integrated and
 

5021
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:07,270
they'll be deeply integrated and
everything you think yeah you would

5022
01:27:07,270 --> 01:27:07,280
everything you think yeah you would
 

5023
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:08,870
everything you think yeah you would
think that all kids are growing up

5024
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:08,880
think that all kids are growing up
 

5025
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,470
think that all kids are growing up
learning to program

5026
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:10,480
learning to program
 

5027
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:11,350
learning to program
and

5028
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:11,360
and
 

5029
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,790
and
create

5030
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:12,800
create
 

5031
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,350
create
so um i just think i mean the system of

5032
01:27:15,350 --> 01:27:15,360
so um i just think i mean the system of
 

5033
01:27:15,360 --> 01:27:17,270
so um i just think i mean the system of
schooling we have now people call it a

5034
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:17,280
schooling we have now people call it a
 

5035
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:18,870
schooling we have now people call it a
factory model

5036
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:18,880
factory model
 

5037
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:19,750
factory model
it's

5038
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:19,760
it's
 

5039
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,950
it's
not designed to inspire creativity and

5040
01:27:24,950 --> 01:27:24,960
not designed to inspire creativity and
 

5041
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:27,590
not designed to inspire creativity and
i feel like that will also change people

5042
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:27,600
i feel like that will also change people
 

5043
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:29,270
i feel like that will also change people
might look back on these days and think

5044
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:29,280
might look back on these days and think
 

5045
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,350
might look back on these days and think
they were hilarious but

5046
01:27:31,350 --> 01:27:31,360
they were hilarious but
 

5047
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:34,229
they were hilarious but
um maybe we'll in the future kids will

5048
01:27:34,229 --> 01:27:34,239
um maybe we'll in the future kids will
 

5049
01:27:34,239 --> 01:27:35,270
um maybe we'll in the future kids will
be doing their own programming and

5050
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
be doing their own programming and
 

5051
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,030
be doing their own programming and
they'll be able to learn things and find

5052
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
they'll be able to learn things and find
 

5053
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,870
they'll be able to learn things and find
out things and create things even as

5054
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:38,880
out things and create things even as
 

5055
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,590
out things and create things even as
they're learning and

5056
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:41,600
they're learning and
 

5057
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:44,790
they're learning and
maybe the individual subjects boundaries

5058
01:27:44,790 --> 01:27:44,800
maybe the individual subjects boundaries
 

5059
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,830
maybe the individual subjects boundaries
will go

5060
01:27:45,830 --> 01:27:45,840
will go
 

5061
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:47,910
will go
data science itself coming into the

5062
01:27:47,910 --> 01:27:47,920
data science itself coming into the
 

5063
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,750
data science itself coming into the
education system kind of illustrates

5064
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:49,760
education system kind of illustrates
 

5065
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,110
education system kind of illustrates
that because

5066
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:51,120
that because
 

5067
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:53,430
that because
people realize it doesn't really fit

5068
01:27:53,430 --> 01:27:53,440
people realize it doesn't really fit
 

5069
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,470
people realize it doesn't really fit
inside any of the subjects

5070
01:27:56,470 --> 01:27:56,480
inside any of the subjects
 

5071
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,310
inside any of the subjects
so what do we do with it where does it

5072
01:27:58,310 --> 01:27:58,320
so what do we do with it where does it
 

5073
01:27:58,320 --> 01:28:02,470
so what do we do with it where does it
go and who teaches it so it's already

5074
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:02,480
go and who teaches it so it's already
 

5075
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:05,030
go and who teaches it so it's already
raising those kind of questions and

5076
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,040
raising those kind of questions and
 

5077
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:07,030
raising those kind of questions and
questioning how we have these different

5078
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:07,040
questioning how we have these different
 

5079
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,950
questioning how we have these different
subject boundaries

5080
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:08,960
subject boundaries
 

5081
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:10,229
subject boundaries
so you've seen data science be

5082
01:28:10,229 --> 01:28:10,239
so you've seen data science be
 

5083
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:12,149
so you've seen data science be
integrated into the curriculum

5084
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
integrated into the curriculum
 

5085
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:14,390
integrated into the curriculum
yes it's happening across the united

5086
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:14,400
yes it's happening across the united
 

5087
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,310
yes it's happening across the united
states as we speak i wonder how that got

5088
01:28:16,310 --> 01:28:16,320
states as we speak i wonder how that got
 

5089
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,310
states as we speak i wonder how that got
initiated like how does change happen in

5090
01:28:18,310 --> 01:28:18,320
initiated like how does change happen in
 

5091
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,550
initiated like how does change happen in
the education system is it just a few

5092
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:20,560
the education system is it just a few
 

5093
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:22,790
the education system is it just a few
revolutionary like it does

5094
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:22,800
revolutionary like it does
 

5095
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,110
revolutionary like it does
i think so i think so it's been an

5096
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:25,120
i think so i think so it's been an
 

5097
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:26,790
i think so i think so it's been an
interesting journey seeing data science

5098
01:28:26,790 --> 01:28:26,800
interesting journey seeing data science
 

5099
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:29,270
interesting journey seeing data science
take off actually it um

5100
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
take off actually it um
 

5101
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,350
take off actually it um
there was a

5102
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:31,360
there was a
 

5103
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:34,790
there was a
course that was developed in 2014

5104
01:28:34,790 --> 01:28:34,800
course that was developed in 2014
 

5105
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:36,950
course that was developed in 2014
by some people who thought data science

5106
01:28:36,950 --> 01:28:36,960
by some people who thought data science
 

5107
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:39,350
by some people who thought data science
was a good idea for high schoolers

5108
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:39,360
was a good idea for high schoolers
 

5109
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,149
was a good idea for high schoolers
and then after some kids took the course

5110
01:28:42,149 --> 01:28:42,159
and then after some kids took the course
 

5111
01:28:42,159 --> 01:28:44,229
and then after some kids took the course
and nothing bad happened to them

5112
01:28:44,229 --> 01:28:44,239
and nothing bad happened to them
 

5113
01:28:44,239 --> 01:28:46,390
and nothing bad happened to them
they went to college and

5114
01:28:46,390 --> 01:28:46,400
they went to college and
 

5115
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:49,189
they went to college and
people started to accept it more

5116
01:28:49,189 --> 01:28:49,199
people started to accept it more
 

5117
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:51,110
people started to accept it more
and then this was a big piece of the

5118
01:28:51,110 --> 01:28:51,120
and then this was a big piece of the
 

5119
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,350
and then this was a big piece of the
change in california the uc system

5120
01:28:53,350 --> 01:28:53,360
change in california the uc system
 

5121
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:55,990
change in california the uc system
communicated they sent out an email last

5122
01:28:55,990 --> 01:28:56,000
communicated they sent out an email last
 

5123
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,149
communicated they sent out an email last
year to 50 000 high schools saying we

5124
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,159
year to 50 000 high schools saying we
 

5125
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:00,310
year to 50 000 high schools saying we
now accept data science kids can take it

5126
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:00,320
now accept data science kids can take it
 

5127
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,149
now accept data science kids can take it
instead of algebra two that's a

5128
01:29:02,149 --> 01:29:02,159
instead of algebra two that's a
 

5129
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:04,870
instead of algebra two that's a
perfectly legitimate college pathway so

5130
01:29:04,870 --> 01:29:04,880
perfectly legitimate college pathway so
 

5131
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,270
perfectly legitimate college pathway so
that was like a big green light for a

5132
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:07,280
that was like a big green light for a
 

5133
01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:09,430
that was like a big green light for a
lot of schools who are like wondering

5134
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:09,440
lot of schools who are like wondering
 

5135
01:29:09,440 --> 01:29:11,430
lot of schools who are like wondering
about whether they could teach it so i

5136
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:11,440
about whether they could teach it so i
 

5137
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:13,910
about whether they could teach it so i
think it happens in small spaces and

5138
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
think it happens in small spaces and
 

5139
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:16,629
think it happens in small spaces and
expands so now it goes viral yeah in

5140
01:29:16,629 --> 01:29:16,639
expands so now it goes viral yeah in
 

5141
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:18,629
expands so now it goes viral yeah in
this latter age then it goes viral

5142
01:29:18,629 --> 01:29:18,639
this latter age then it goes viral
 

5143
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:20,950
this latter age then it goes viral
california's ahead

5144
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:20,960
california's ahead
 

5145
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,830
california's ahead
um i think in creating courses and

5146
01:29:23,830 --> 01:29:23,840
um i think in creating courses and
 

5147
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:27,669
um i think in creating courses and
having kids go through it but it's

5148
01:29:27,669 --> 01:29:27,679
having kids go through it but it's
 

5149
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,270
having kids go through it but it's
suddenly when i last looked there were

5150
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:29,280
suddenly when i last looked there were
 

5151
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:31,350
suddenly when i last looked there were
12 states that were allowing data

5152
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,360
12 states that were allowing data
 

5153
01:29:31,360 --> 01:29:32,709
12 states that were allowing data
science as a high school course and i

5154
01:29:32,709 --> 01:29:32,719
science as a high school course and i
 

5155
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:33,430
science as a high school course and i
think

5156
01:29:33,430 --> 01:29:33,440
think
 

5157
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,790
think
by next year

5158
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:34,800
by next year
 

5159
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:36,629
by next year
that will have doubled

5160
01:29:36,629 --> 01:29:36,639
that will have doubled
 

5161
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:39,430
that will have doubled
or more so

5162
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
or more so
 

5163
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:41,030
or more so
change is happening

5164
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:41,040
change is happening
 

5165
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:44,070
change is happening
joe i as i said i think

5166
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
joe i as i said i think
 

5167
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,229
joe i as i said i think
mathematics is uh

5168
01:29:46,229 --> 01:29:46,239
mathematics is uh
 

5169
01:29:46,239 --> 01:29:48,950
mathematics is uh
is truly a beautiful subject and
