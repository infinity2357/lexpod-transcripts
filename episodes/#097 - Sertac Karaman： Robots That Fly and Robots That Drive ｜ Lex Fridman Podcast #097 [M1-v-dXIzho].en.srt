both what is the more difficult task

90
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:48,520
both what is the more difficult task

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,830
both what is the more difficult task
autonomous flying or autonomous driving

92
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:50,840
autonomous flying or autonomous driving
 

93
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,660
autonomous flying or autonomous driving
that's a good question

94
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:52,670
that's a good question
 

95
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:56,410
that's a good question
I think that autonomous flying just kind

96
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,420
I think that autonomous flying just kind
 

97
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,300
I think that autonomous flying just kind
of doing it for consumer drones and so

98
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:58,310
of doing it for consumer drones and so
 

99
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,770
of doing it for consumer drones and so
on the kinds of applications that we're

100
00:01:59,770 --> 00:01:59,780
on the kinds of applications that we're
 

101
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,320
on the kinds of applications that we're
looking at right now is probably easier

102
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:02,330
looking at right now is probably easier
 

103
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,789
looking at right now is probably easier
and so I think that that's maybe one of

104
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:03,799
and so I think that that's maybe one of
 

105
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,620
and so I think that that's maybe one of
the reasons why it took off like

106
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:05,630
the reasons why it took off like
 

107
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,779
the reasons why it took off like
literally a little earlier than the

108
00:02:07,779 --> 00:02:07,789
literally a little earlier than the
 

109
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:09,609
literally a little earlier than the
autonomous cars but I think if we look

110
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:09,619
autonomous cars but I think if we look
 

111
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:11,800
autonomous cars but I think if we look
ahead I would think that you know the

112
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:11,810
ahead I would think that you know the
 

113
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,920
ahead I would think that you know the
real benefits of autonomous flying

114
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:13,930
real benefits of autonomous flying
 

115
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,699
real benefits of autonomous flying
unleashing them in like transportation

116
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:15,709
unleashing them in like transportation
 

117
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:18,160
unleashing them in like transportation
logistics and so on I think it's a lot

118
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,170
logistics and so on I think it's a lot
 

119
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:19,539
logistics and so on I think it's a lot
harder than autonomous driving so I

120
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:19,549
harder than autonomous driving so I
 

121
00:02:19,549 --> 00:02:21,550
harder than autonomous driving so I
think my guess is that you know we've

122
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:21,560
think my guess is that you know we've
 

123
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:23,590
think my guess is that you know we've
seen a few kind of machines fly here and

124
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:23,600
seen a few kind of machines fly here and
 

125
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,020
seen a few kind of machines fly here and
there but we really haven't yet seen any

126
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,030
there but we really haven't yet seen any
 

127
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,380
there but we really haven't yet seen any
kind of you know machine like like at

128
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:29,390
kind of you know machine like like at
 

129
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,809
kind of you know machine like like at
massive scale large-scale being deployed

130
00:02:31,809 --> 00:02:31,819
massive scale large-scale being deployed
 

131
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,490
massive scale large-scale being deployed
and flown and so on and I think that's

132
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,500
and flown and so on and I think that's
 

133
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,550
and flown and so on and I think that's
gonna be after we kind of resolve some

134
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,560
gonna be after we kind of resolve some
 

135
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,199
gonna be after we kind of resolve some
of the large scale deployments of

136
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,209
of the large scale deployments of
 

137
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,089
of the large scale deployments of
autonomous driving it was the hard part

138
00:02:40,089 --> 00:02:40,099
autonomous driving it was the hard part
 

139
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,789
autonomous driving it was the hard part
what's your intuition behind why at

140
00:02:42,789 --> 00:02:42,799
what's your intuition behind why at
 

141
00:02:42,799 --> 00:02:46,420
what's your intuition behind why at
scale when consumer-facing drones are

142
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:46,430
scale when consumer-facing drones are
 

143
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,979
scale when consumer-facing drones are
tough so I think in general its scale is

144
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:50,989
tough so I think in general its scale is
 

145
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:52,840
tough so I think in general its scale is
tough like for example I mean you think

146
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:52,850
tough like for example I mean you think
 

147
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:56,020
tough like for example I mean you think
about it we have actually deployed a lot

148
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,030
about it we have actually deployed a lot
 

149
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,020
about it we have actually deployed a lot
of robots in the let's say the past 50

150
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,030
of robots in the let's say the past 50
 

151
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,500
of robots in the let's say the past 50
years we academics or we business I

152
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:02,510
years we academics or we business I
 

153
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:08,800
years we academics or we business I
think we as humanity deployed a lot of

154
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:08,810
think we as humanity deployed a lot of
 

155
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,710
think we as humanity deployed a lot of
robots and I think that when you think

156
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,720
robots and I think that when you think
 

157
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,569
robots and I think that when you think
about it you know robots they're

158
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:13,579
about it you know robots they're
 

159
00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:15,940
about it you know robots they're
autonomous they work and they work on

160
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:15,950
autonomous they work and they work on
 

161
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:18,099
autonomous they work and they work on
their own but they are either like in

162
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:18,109
their own but they are either like in
 

163
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:20,979
their own but they are either like in
isolated environments or they are in

164
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:20,989
isolated environments or they are in
 

165
00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,660
isolated environments or they are in
sort of you know they may be at scale

166
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:25,670
sort of you know they may be at scale
 

167
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,879
sort of you know they may be at scale
but they're really confined to a certain

168
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:27,889
but they're really confined to a certain
 

169
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,379
but they're really confined to a certain
environment that they don't interact so

170
00:03:29,379 --> 00:03:29,389
environment that they don't interact so
 

171
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,180
environment that they don't interact so
much with humans and so you know they

172
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,190
much with humans and so you know they
 

173
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:31,900
much with humans and so you know they
work in

174
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:31,910
work in
 

175
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,610
work in
I don't know factory floors their houses

176
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:33,620
I don't know factory floors their houses
 

177
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,039
I don't know factory floors their houses
they work on Mars you know they are

178
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:36,049
they work on Mars you know they are
 

179
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,500
they work on Mars you know they are
fully autonomous over there but I think

180
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:38,510
fully autonomous over there but I think
 

181
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,440
fully autonomous over there but I think
that the real challenge of our time is

182
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:41,450
that the real challenge of our time is
 

183
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,349
that the real challenge of our time is
to take these vehicles and put them into

184
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:44,359
to take these vehicles and put them into
 

185
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,680
to take these vehicles and put them into
places where humans are present so now I

186
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:47,690
places where humans are present so now I
 

187
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:49,030
places where humans are present so now I
know that there's a lot of like human

188
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,040
know that there's a lot of like human
 

189
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
know that there's a lot of like human
robot interaction type of things that

190
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,290
robot interaction type of things that
 

191
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,050
robot interaction type of things that
need to be done and so on that's that's

192
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,060
need to be done and so on that's that's
 

193
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,850
need to be done and so on that's that's
one thing but even just from the

194
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:54,860
one thing but even just from the
 

195
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,700
one thing but even just from the
fundamental algorithms and systems and

196
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:57,710
fundamental algorithms and systems and
 

197
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,710
fundamental algorithms and systems and
and the business cases or maybe the

198
00:03:59,710 --> 00:03:59,720
and the business cases or maybe the
 

199
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,350
and the business cases or maybe the
business models even like architecture

200
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,360
business models even like architecture
 

201
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,720
business models even like architecture
planning societal issues legally there's

202
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:04,730
planning societal issues legally there's
 

203
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,000
planning societal issues legally there's
a whole bunch of pack of things that are

204
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,010
a whole bunch of pack of things that are
 

205
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,970
a whole bunch of pack of things that are
related to us putting robotic vehicles

206
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:09,980
related to us putting robotic vehicles
 

207
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,010
related to us putting robotic vehicles
into human present environments and

208
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,020
into human present environments and
 

209
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,830
into human present environments and
these humans you know they will not

210
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:14,840
these humans you know they will not
 

211
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,560
these humans you know they will not
potentially be even trained to interact

212
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,570
potentially be even trained to interact
 

213
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:19,750
potentially be even trained to interact
with them they may not even be using the

214
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:19,760
with them they may not even be using the
 

215
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,400
with them they may not even be using the
services that are provided by these

216
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:21,410
services that are provided by these
 

217
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,840
services that are provided by these
vehicles they may not even know that

218
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:22,850
vehicles they may not even know that
 

219
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:24,340
vehicles they may not even know that
they're autonomous they're just doing

220
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,350
they're autonomous they're just doing
 

221
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,530
they're autonomous they're just doing
their thing living in environments that

222
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:26,540
their thing living in environments that
 

223
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,240
their thing living in environments that
are designed for humans not for robots

224
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:28,250
are designed for humans not for robots
 

225
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,750
are designed for humans not for robots
and that I think is one of the biggest

226
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:31,760
and that I think is one of the biggest
 

227
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,000
and that I think is one of the biggest
challenges I think over our time to put

228
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,010
challenges I think over our time to put
 

229
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:36,100
challenges I think over our time to put
vehicles there and you know to go back

230
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,110
vehicles there and you know to go back
 

231
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,520
vehicles there and you know to go back
to your question I think doing that at

232
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:39,530
to your question I think doing that at
 

233
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,350
to your question I think doing that at
scale meaning you know you go out in a

234
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,360
scale meaning you know you go out in a
 

235
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,890
scale meaning you know you go out in a
city and you have you know like

236
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:44,900
city and you have you know like
 

237
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,660
city and you have you know like
thousands or tens of thousands of

238
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,670
thousands or tens of thousands of
 

239
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,040
thousands or tens of thousands of
autonomous vehicles that are going

240
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,050
autonomous vehicles that are going
 

241
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,680
autonomous vehicles that are going
around it is so dance to the point where

242
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:50,690
around it is so dance to the point where
 

243
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,840
around it is so dance to the point where
if you see one of them you look around

244
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:52,850
if you see one of them you look around
 

245
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:55,090
if you see one of them you look around
you see another one it is that dance and

246
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:55,100
you see another one it is that dance and
 

247
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,910
you see another one it is that dance and
that density we've never done anything

248
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:57,920
that density we've never done anything
 

249
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,580
that density we've never done anything
like that before and I would I would bet

250
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:00,590
like that before and I would I would bet
 

251
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,410
like that before and I would I would bet
that that kind of density will first

252
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:02,420
that that kind of density will first
 

253
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,500
that that kind of density will first
happen with autonomous cars because I

254
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:05,510
happen with autonomous cars because I
 

255
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:07,030
happen with autonomous cars because I
think you know we can ban the

256
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,040
think you know we can ban the
 

257
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,410
think you know we can ban the
environment a little bit we can

258
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:08,420
environment a little bit we can
 

259
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:12,040
environment a little bit we can
especially kind of making them safe is a

260
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:12,050
especially kind of making them safe is a
 

261
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:14,350
especially kind of making them safe is a
lot easier when they're like on the

262
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:14,360
lot easier when they're like on the
 

263
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,140
lot easier when they're like on the
ground when they're in the air it's a

264
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,150
ground when they're in the air it's a
 

265
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,810
ground when they're in the air it's a
little bit more complicated but I don't

266
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:19,820
little bit more complicated but I don't
 

267
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,830
little bit more complicated but I don't
see that there's gonna be a big

268
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:20,840
see that there's gonna be a big
 

269
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,420
see that there's gonna be a big
separation I think that you know there

270
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,430
separation I think that you know there
 

271
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,560
separation I think that you know there
will come a time that we're gonna

272
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,570
will come a time that we're gonna
 

273
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,900
will come a time that we're gonna
quickly see these things unfold do you

274
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:25,910
quickly see these things unfold do you
 

275
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,820
quickly see these things unfold do you
think there will be a time where there's

276
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:27,830
think there will be a time where there's
 

277
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,980
think there will be a time where there's
tens of thousands of delivery drones

278
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:29,990
tens of thousands of delivery drones
 

279
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:32,590
tens of thousands of delivery drones
they fill this guy you know I think I

280
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:32,600
they fill this guy you know I think I
 

281
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,730
they fill this guy you know I think I
think it's possible to be honest

282
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:33,740
think it's possible to be honest
 

283
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,200
think it's possible to be honest
delivery drones is one thing but you

284
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:35,210
delivery drones is one thing but you
 

285
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,050
delivery drones is one thing but you
know you can imagine for transportation

286
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:38,060
know you can imagine for transportation
 

287
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,510
know you can imagine for transportation
like a like an important use cases but

288
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,520
like a like an important use cases but
 

289
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,860
like a like an important use cases but
you know we're in Boston you want to go

290
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:41,870
you know we're in Boston you want to go
 

291
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,960
you know we're in Boston you want to go
from Boston to New York and you want to

292
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:43,970
from Boston to New York and you want to
 

293
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,330
from Boston to New York and you want to
do it from the top of this building to

294
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:46,340
do it from the top of this building to
 

295
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,920
do it from the top of this building to
the top of another building in Manhattan

296
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:47,930
the top of another building in Manhattan
 

297
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,750
the top of another building in Manhattan
and you're gonna do it in one and a half

298
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:49,760
and you're gonna do it in one and a half
 

299
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,850
and you're gonna do it in one and a half
hours and that's that's a big

300
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:51,860
hours and that's that's a big
 

301
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,370
hours and that's that's a big
opportunity I think personal transport

302
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:54,380
opportunity I think personal transport
 

303
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,620
opportunity I think personal transport
so like you and your friend like oh yeah

304
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:56,630
so like you and your friend like oh yeah
 

305
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,720
so like you and your friend like oh yeah
or almost like I like like an uber so

306
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:58,730
or almost like I like like an uber so
 

307
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,720
or almost like I like like an uber so
like four people six people a people in

308
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:01,730
like four people six people a people in
 

309
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,640
like four people six people a people in
our work in autonomous vehicles I see

310
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:03,650
our work in autonomous vehicles I see
 

311
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,900
our work in autonomous vehicles I see
that so there's kind of like a bit of a

312
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:04,910
that so there's kind of like a bit of a
 

313
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,090
that so there's kind of like a bit of a
need for you know one person transport

314
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:07,100
need for you know one person transport
 

315
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,280
need for you know one person transport
but also like like a few people so you

316
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:09,290
but also like like a few people so you
 

317
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,930
but also like like a few people so you
and I could take the trip together we

318
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:10,940
and I could take the trip together we
 

319
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,459
and I could take the trip together we
could have lunch

320
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:12,469
could have lunch
 

321
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:14,739
could have lunch
that you know I think kind of sounds

322
00:06:14,739 --> 00:06:14,749
that you know I think kind of sounds
 

323
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,629
that you know I think kind of sounds
crazy maybe even sounds a bit cheesy but

324
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:16,639
crazy maybe even sounds a bit cheesy but
 

325
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,999
crazy maybe even sounds a bit cheesy but
I think that those kinds of things are

326
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:19,009
I think that those kinds of things are
 

327
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:20,529
I think that those kinds of things are
some of the real opportunities and I

328
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:20,539
some of the real opportunities and I
 

329
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:23,619
some of the real opportunities and I
think you know it's not like the typical

330
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:23,629
think you know it's not like the typical
 

331
00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:25,600
think you know it's not like the typical
airplane and the airport would disappear

332
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:25,610
airplane and the airport would disappear
 

333
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,669
airplane and the airport would disappear
very quickly but I would think that you

334
00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:27,679
very quickly but I would think that you
 

335
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,969
very quickly but I would think that you
know many people would feel like they

336
00:06:30,969 --> 00:06:30,979
know many people would feel like they
 

337
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:32,769
know many people would feel like they
would spend an extra hundred dollars on

338
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:32,779
would spend an extra hundred dollars on
 

339
00:06:32,779 --> 00:06:35,129
would spend an extra hundred dollars on
doing that and cutting that for our

340
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:35,139
doing that and cutting that for our
 

341
00:06:35,139 --> 00:06:37,929
doing that and cutting that for our
travel down to one and a half hours so

342
00:06:37,929 --> 00:06:37,939
travel down to one and a half hours so
 

343
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,059
travel down to one and a half hours so
how feasible are flying cars it's been

344
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:40,069
how feasible are flying cars it's been
 

345
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:41,889
how feasible are flying cars it's been
the dream that's like when people

346
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:41,899
the dream that's like when people
 

347
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:44,049
the dream that's like when people
imagine the future for 50 plus years

348
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:44,059
imagine the future for 50 plus years
 

349
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:47,889
imagine the future for 50 plus years
they think fine cars it's a it's like

350
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:47,899
they think fine cars it's a it's like
 

351
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:49,929
they think fine cars it's a it's like
all technology is just cheesy to think

352
00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:49,939
all technology is just cheesy to think
 

353
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,879
all technology is just cheesy to think
about now because it seems so far away

354
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:51,889
about now because it seems so far away
 

355
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:55,329
about now because it seems so far away
but overnight it can change but just

356
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:55,339
but overnight it can change but just
 

357
00:06:55,339 --> 00:06:57,010
but overnight it can change but just
technically speaking in your view how

358
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:57,020
technically speaking in your view how
 

359
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,529
technically speaking in your view how
feasible is it to make that happen I'll

360
00:06:59,529 --> 00:06:59,539
feasible is it to make that happen I'll
 

361
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:01,209
feasible is it to make that happen I'll
get to that question but just one thing

362
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:01,219
get to that question but just one thing
 

363
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:03,459
get to that question but just one thing
is that I think you know sometimes we

364
00:07:03,459 --> 00:07:03,469
is that I think you know sometimes we
 

365
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,070
is that I think you know sometimes we
think about what's gonna happen in the

366
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,080
think about what's gonna happen in the
 

367
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,139
think about what's gonna happen in the
next 50 years it's just really hard to

368
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:08,149
next 50 years it's just really hard to
 

369
00:07:08,149 --> 00:07:09,730
next 50 years it's just really hard to
guess right next 50 years I don't know I

370
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:09,740
guess right next 50 years I don't know I
 

371
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:11,559
guess right next 50 years I don't know I
mean we could yet what's gonna happen in

372
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:11,569
mean we could yet what's gonna happen in
 

373
00:07:11,569 --> 00:07:13,119
mean we could yet what's gonna happen in
transportation in the next 50 we could

374
00:07:13,119 --> 00:07:13,129
transportation in the next 50 we could
 

375
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,429
transportation in the next 50 we could
get flying saucers I I could bet on that

376
00:07:15,429 --> 00:07:15,439
get flying saucers I I could bet on that
 

377
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:17,709
get flying saucers I I could bet on that
I think there's a 50/50 chance that you

378
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:17,719
I think there's a 50/50 chance that you
 

379
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:18,999
I think there's a 50/50 chance that you
know like you can build machines that

380
00:07:18,999 --> 00:07:19,009
know like you can build machines that
 

381
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,949
know like you can build machines that
can ionize the air around them and push

382
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:20,959
can ionize the air around them and push
 

383
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,809
can ionize the air around them and push
it down with magnets and they would fly

384
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:22,819
it down with magnets and they would fly
 

385
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,139
it down with magnets and they would fly
like a flying saucer that is possible

386
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:25,149
like a flying saucer that is possible
 

387
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:27,670
like a flying saucer that is possible
and it might happen in the next 50 years

388
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,680
and it might happen in the next 50 years
 

389
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,769
and it might happen in the next 50 years
so it's a bit hard to guess like when

390
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:29,779
so it's a bit hard to guess like when
 

391
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,170
so it's a bit hard to guess like when
you think about 50 years before but I

392
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:32,180
you think about 50 years before but I
 

393
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,509
you think about 50 years before but I
would think that you know there's this

394
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:34,519
would think that you know there's this
 

395
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:38,079
would think that you know there's this
this kind of notion where there's a

396
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:38,089
this kind of notion where there's a
 

397
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:39,759
this kind of notion where there's a
certain type of air space that we call

398
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:39,769
certain type of air space that we call
 

399
00:07:39,769 --> 00:07:42,069
certain type of air space that we call
the agile airspace and there is there's

400
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:42,079
the agile airspace and there is there's
 

401
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,480
the agile airspace and there is there's
good amount of opportunities in that

402
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:43,490
good amount of opportunities in that
 

403
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:43,899
good amount of opportunities in that
airspace

404
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:43,909
airspace
 

405
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:46,540
airspace
so that would be the space that is kind

406
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:46,550
so that would be the space that is kind
 

407
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,059
so that would be the space that is kind
of a little bit higher than the place

408
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:49,069
of a little bit higher than the place
 

409
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,609
of a little bit higher than the place
where you can throw a stone because

410
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:51,619
where you can throw a stone because
 

411
00:07:51,619 --> 00:07:52,629
where you can throw a stone because
that's a tough thing when you think

412
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
that's a tough thing when you think
 

413
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,889
that's a tough thing when you think
about it you know it takes a kid on a

414
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:53,899
about it you know it takes a kid on a
 

415
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:56,549
about it you know it takes a kid on a
stone to take an aircraft down and then

416
00:07:56,549 --> 00:07:56,559
stone to take an aircraft down and then
 

417
00:07:56,559 --> 00:08:00,670
stone to take an aircraft down and then
what happens but you know imagine the

418
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:00,680
what happens but you know imagine the
 

419
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,309
what happens but you know imagine the
airspace that's high enough so that you

420
00:08:03,309 --> 00:08:03,319
airspace that's high enough so that you
 

421
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,980
airspace that's high enough so that you
cannot throw a stone but it is low

422
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:05,990
cannot throw a stone but it is low
 

423
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,659
cannot throw a stone but it is low
enough that you're not interacting with

424
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:07,669
enough that you're not interacting with
 

425
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:11,529
enough that you're not interacting with
the with the very large aircraft that

426
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:11,539
the with the very large aircraft that
 

427
00:08:11,539 --> 00:08:14,319
the with the very large aircraft that
are you know flying several thousand

428
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,329
are you know flying several thousand
 

429
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,420
are you know flying several thousand
feet above and that airspace is

430
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:16,430
feet above and that airspace is
 

431
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,149
feet above and that airspace is
underutilized or it's actually kind of

432
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:19,159
underutilized or it's actually kind of
 

433
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,949
underutilized or it's actually kind of
not utilized at all yeah that's right so

434
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:20,959
not utilized at all yeah that's right so
 

435
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:21,879
not utilized at all yeah that's right so
there's you know there's like

436
00:08:21,879 --> 00:08:21,889
there's you know there's like
 

437
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,860
there's you know there's like
recreational people kind of fly every

438
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,870
recreational people kind of fly every
 

439
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,300
recreational people kind of fly every
now and then but it's very few

440
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,310
now and then but it's very few
 

441
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,250
now and then but it's very few
if you look up in the sky you may not

442
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:27,260
if you look up in the sky you may not
 

443
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:30,160
if you look up in the sky you may not
see any of them at any given time every

444
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,170
see any of them at any given time every
 

445
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,530
see any of them at any given time every
night now you'll see one airplane

446
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:31,540
night now you'll see one airplane
 

447
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,310
night now you'll see one airplane
utilizing that space and you'll be

448
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:33,320
utilizing that space and you'll be
 

449
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,800
utilizing that space and you'll be
surprised and the moment you're outside

450
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:35,810
surprised and the moment you're outside
 

451
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,210
surprised and the moment you're outside
of an airport a little bit like it's

452
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:37,220
of an airport a little bit like it's
 

453
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,040
of an airport a little bit like it's
just kind of flies off and it goes out

454
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,050
just kind of flies off and it goes out
 

455
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,130
just kind of flies off and it goes out
and I think utilizing that airspace the

456
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:42,140
and I think utilizing that airspace the
 

457
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,080
and I think utilizing that airspace the
technical challenge is there is you know

458
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,090
technical challenge is there is you know
 

459
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:49,090
technical challenge is there is you know
building an autonomy and ensuring that

460
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,100
building an autonomy and ensuring that
 

461
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,120
building an autonomy and ensuring that
that kind of autonomy is safe ultimately

462
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:52,130
that kind of autonomy is safe ultimately
 

463
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,960
that kind of autonomy is safe ultimately
I think it is going to be building in

464
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:55,970
I think it is going to be building in
 

465
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,870
I think it is going to be building in
complex software are complicated so that

466
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
complex software are complicated so that
 

467
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,690
complex software are complicated so that
it's maybe a few orders of magnitude

468
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:01,700
it's maybe a few orders of magnitude
 

469
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,250
it's maybe a few orders of magnitude
more complicated than what we have on

470
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:03,260
more complicated than what we have on
 

471
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,160
more complicated than what we have on
aircraft today and at the same time

472
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,170
aircraft today and at the same time
 

473
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,500
aircraft today and at the same time
ensuring just like we ensure on aircraft

474
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,510
ensuring just like we ensure on aircraft
 

475
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,840
ensuring just like we ensure on aircraft
ensuring that it's safe and so that

476
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:10,850
ensuring that it's safe and so that
 

477
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,150
ensuring that it's safe and so that
becomes like building that kind of

478
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,160
becomes like building that kind of
 

479
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,340
becomes like building that kind of
complicated hardware and a software

480
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,350
complicated hardware and a software
 

481
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,770
complicated hardware and a software
becomes a challenge especially when you

482
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:17,780
becomes a challenge especially when you
 

483
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,330
becomes a challenge especially when you
know you build that hardware

484
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:19,340
know you build that hardware
 

485
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,340
know you build that hardware
I mean you build that software with data

486
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,350
I mean you build that software with data
 

487
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:26,620
I mean you build that software with data
and so you know it's it's of course

488
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:26,630
and so you know it's it's of course
 

489
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,240
and so you know it's it's of course
there's some rule by software in there

490
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:28,250
there's some rule by software in there
 

491
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,740
there's some rule by software in there
that kind of do a certain set of things

492
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:29,750
that kind of do a certain set of things
 

493
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,690
that kind of do a certain set of things
but but then you know there's a lot of

494
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:31,700
but but then you know there's a lot of
 

495
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,910
but but then you know there's a lot of
training merit machine learning will be

496
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:33,920
training merit machine learning will be
 

497
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,270
training merit machine learning will be
key to these guys to delivering safe

498
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:37,280
key to these guys to delivering safe
 

499
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,960
key to these guys to delivering safe
vehicles in the future especially not

500
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:40,970
vehicles in the future especially not
 

501
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,790
vehicles in the future especially not
maybe the safe part but I think the

502
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
maybe the safe part but I think the
 

503
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,920
maybe the safe part but I think the
intelligent part um I mean there are

504
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:44,930
intelligent part um I mean there are
 

505
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,600
intelligent part um I mean there are
certain things that we do it with

506
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:46,610
certain things that we do it with
 

507
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,130
certain things that we do it with
machine learning and it's just there's

508
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:48,140
machine learning and it's just there's
 

509
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,770
machine learning and it's just there's
like right now all the way and and I

510
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:50,780
like right now all the way and and I
 

511
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,300
like right now all the way and and I
don't I don't know how else they could

512
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:52,310
don't I don't know how else they could
 

513
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:55,180
don't I don't know how else they could
be done and you know there's there's

514
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,190
be done and you know there's there's
 

515
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,280
be done and you know there's there's
always this conundrum I mean we could I

516
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:57,290
always this conundrum I mean we could I
 

517
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:00,900
always this conundrum I mean we could I
could be like we could maybe gather

518
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:00,910
could be like we could maybe gather
 

519
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:05,080
could be like we could maybe gather
billions of programmers humans who

00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:13,310
you know we I don't know we maybe even
 

527
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,400
you know we I don't know we maybe even
have robots like learning a simulation

528
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,410
have robots like learning a simulation
 

529
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,560
have robots like learning a simulation
environment and transfer and they might

530
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:17,570
environment and transfer and they might
 

531
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,780
environment and transfer and they might
be learning a lot better in a simulation

532
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:19,790
be learning a lot better in a simulation
 

533
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:23,140
be learning a lot better in a simulation

00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:28,640
humans pretty limited what's uh what's

the role of simulations withdrawals if

540
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:30,380
the role of simulations withdrawals if
 

541
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,720
the role of simulations withdrawals if
you've done quite a bit of work there

542
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:31,730
you've done quite a bit of work there
 

543
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:33,850
you've done quite a bit of work there
how promising just the very thing you

544
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:33,860
how promising just the very thing you
 

545
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,980
how promising just the very thing you
said just now how promising is the

546
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:35,990
said just now how promising is the
 

547
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,639
said just now how promising is the
possibility of training

548
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:38,649
possibility of training
 

549
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:42,780
possibility of training
and developing a safe flying robot in

550
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:42,790
and developing a safe flying robot in
 

551
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:45,480
and developing a safe flying robot in
simulation and deploying it and having

552
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:45,490
simulation and deploying it and having
 

553
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,489
simulation and deploying it and having
that work pretty well in the real world

554
00:10:47,489 --> 00:10:47,499
that work pretty well in the real world
 

555
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:49,859
that work pretty well in the real world
I think that you know a lot of people

556
00:10:49,859 --> 00:10:49,869
I think that you know a lot of people
 

557
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:52,019
I think that you know a lot of people
when they hear simulation they will

558
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:52,029
when they hear simulation they will
 

559
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:53,790
when they hear simulation they will
focus on training immediately but I

560
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:53,800
focus on training immediately but I
 

561
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,619
focus on training immediately but I
think one thing that you said which was

562
00:10:55,619 --> 00:10:55,629
think one thing that you said which was
 

563
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:57,030
think one thing that you said which was
interesting it's developing

564
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
interesting it's developing
 

565
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,889
interesting it's developing
I think simulation environments are

566
00:10:58,889 --> 00:10:58,899
I think simulation environments are
 

567
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:00,840
I think simulation environments are
actually could be key and great for

568
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:00,850
actually could be key and great for
 

569
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:03,569
actually could be key and great for
development and that's not new like for

570
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:03,579
development and that's not new like for
 

571
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,989
development and that's not new like for
example you know there's people in the

572
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:06,999
example you know there's people in the
 

573
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,629
example you know there's people in the
automotive industry have been using

574
00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:08,639
automotive industry have been using
 

575
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,220
automotive industry have been using
dynamic simulation for like decades now

576
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,230
dynamic simulation for like decades now
 

577
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,980
dynamic simulation for like decades now
and and it's pretty standard that you

578
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:13,990
and and it's pretty standard that you
 

579
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:15,210
and and it's pretty standard that you
know you would build and you would

580
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:15,220
know you would build and you would
 

581
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,859
know you would build and you would
simulate if you want to build an

582
00:11:16,859 --> 00:11:16,869
simulate if you want to build an
 

583
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,410
simulate if you want to build an
embedded controller you plug that kind

584
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:19,420
embedded controller you plug that kind
 

585
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,030
embedded controller you plug that kind
of embedded computer into another

586
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
of embedded computer into another
 

587
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,859
of embedded computer into another
computer that other computer would

588
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:22,869
computer that other computer would
 

589
00:11:22,869 --> 00:11:24,960
computer that other computer would
simulate tiny and so on and I think you

590
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:24,970
simulate tiny and so on and I think you
 

591
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,549
simulate tiny and so on and I think you
know fast forward these things you can

592
00:11:26,549 --> 00:11:26,559
know fast forward these things you can
 

593
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,079
know fast forward these things you can
create pretty crazy simulation

594
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:28,089
create pretty crazy simulation
 

595
00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:29,460
create pretty crazy simulation
environments

596
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:29,470
environments
 

597
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,189
environments
like for instance one of the things that

598
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:32,199
like for instance one of the things that
 

599
00:11:32,199 --> 00:11:34,829
like for instance one of the things that
has happened recently and that you know

600
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:34,839
has happened recently and that you know
 

601
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,480
has happened recently and that you know
we can do now is that we can simulate

602
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,490
we can do now is that we can simulate
 

603
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,759
we can do now is that we can simulate
cameras a lot better than we used to

604
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:38,769
cameras a lot better than we used to
 

605
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:40,470
cameras a lot better than we used to
simulate them we were able to simulate

606
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:40,480
simulate them we were able to simulate
 

607
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,660
simulate them we were able to simulate
them before and that's I think we just

608
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:42,670
them before and that's I think we just
 

609
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,429
them before and that's I think we just
hit the elbow on that kind of

610
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:44,439
hit the elbow on that kind of
 

611
00:11:44,439 --> 00:11:47,519
hit the elbow on that kind of
improvement I would imagine that really

612
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:47,529
improvement I would imagine that really
 

613
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:50,129
improvement I would imagine that really
improvements in hardware especially and

614
00:11:50,129 --> 00:11:50,139
improvements in hardware especially and
 

615
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:51,900
improvements in hardware especially and
with improvements and machine learning I

616
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:51,910
with improvements and machine learning I
 

617
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,299
with improvements and machine learning I
think that we would get to a point where

618
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:54,309
think that we would get to a point where
 

619
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:56,669
think that we would get to a point where
we can simulate cameras very very much

620
00:11:56,669 --> 00:11:56,679
we can simulate cameras very very much
 

621
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:00,360
we can simulate cameras very very much
similar cameras means simulate how a

622
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:00,370
similar cameras means simulate how a
 

623
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:02,730
similar cameras means simulate how a
real camera would see the real world

624
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:02,740
real camera would see the real world
 

625
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,850
real camera would see the real world
therefore you can explore the

626
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:05,860
therefore you can explore the
 

627
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:08,360
therefore you can explore the
limitations of that you can train

628
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,370
limitations of that you can train
 

629
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,439
limitations of that you can train
perception algorithms on the in

630
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:10,449
perception algorithms on the in
 

631
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:12,150
perception algorithms on the in
simulation all that kind of stuff

632
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
simulation all that kind of stuff
 

633
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,019
simulation all that kind of stuff
exactly so you know it's it has been

634
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:16,029
exactly so you know it's it has been
 

635
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:18,030
exactly so you know it's it has been
easier to simulate what we will called

636
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,040
easier to simulate what we will called
 

637
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,040
easier to simulate what we will called
interoceptive sensors like internal

638
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,050
interoceptive sensors like internal
 

639
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:22,110
interoceptive sensors like internal
sensors so for example inertial sensing

640
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:22,120
sensors so for example inertial sensing
 

641
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,329
sensors so for example inertial sensing
has been easy to simulate it has also

642
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:24,339
has been easy to simulate it has also
 

643
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:27,329
has been easy to simulate it has also
been easily simulate dynamics like like

644
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:27,339
been easily simulate dynamics like like
 

645
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,069
been easily simulate dynamics like like
physics that are governed by ordinary

646
00:12:29,069 --> 00:12:29,079
physics that are governed by ordinary
 

647
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:31,230
physics that are governed by ordinary
differential equations I mean like how a

648
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:31,240
differential equations I mean like how a
 

649
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,360
differential equations I mean like how a
car goes around maybe have it rolls on

650
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:33,370
car goes around maybe have it rolls on
 

651
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:35,100
car goes around maybe have it rolls on
the road how they interact with it

652
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:35,110
the road how they interact with it
 

653
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:37,049
the road how they interact with it
interacts with the road or even an

654
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:37,059
interacts with the road or even an
 

655
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,850
interacts with the road or even an
aircraft flying around like the dynamic

656
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:38,860
aircraft flying around like the dynamic
 

657
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,369
aircraft flying around like the dynamic
the physics of that what has been really

658
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:41,379
the physics of that what has been really
 

659
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,069
the physics of that what has been really
hard has been to simulate extra Sept of

660
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:44,079
hard has been to simulate extra Sept of
 

661
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,439
hard has been to simulate extra Sept of
sensors sensors that kind of like look

662
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:46,449
sensors sensors that kind of like look
 

663
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,259
sensors sensors that kind of like look
out from the vehicle and that's a new

664
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:49,269
out from the vehicle and that's a new
 

665
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,030
out from the vehicle and that's a new
thing that's coming like laser

666
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,040
thing that's coming like laser
 

667
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,440
thing that's coming like laser
rangefinders they're a little bit

668
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:52,450
rangefinders they're a little bit
 

669
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,140
rangefinders they're a little bit
easier cameras radars are a little bit

670
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:55,150
easier cameras radars are a little bit
 

671
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,630
easier cameras radars are a little bit
tougher I think once we nail that down

672
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:57,640
tougher I think once we nail that down
 

673
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,690
tougher I think once we nail that down
the the next challenge I think in

674
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:00,700
the the next challenge I think in
 

675
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,190
the the next challenge I think in
simulation will be to simulate human

676
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:02,200
simulation will be to simulate human
 

677
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:05,340
simulation will be to simulate human
behavior that's also extremely hard even

678
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:05,350
behavior that's also extremely hard even
 

679
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:08,670
behavior that's also extremely hard even
when you imagine like how a human driven

680
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:08,680
when you imagine like how a human driven
 

681
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,910
when you imagine like how a human driven
car would act around even that is hard

682
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:11,920
car would act around even that is hard
 

683
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,160
car would act around even that is hard
but imagine trying to simulate you know

684
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,170
but imagine trying to simulate you know
 

685
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:16,980
but imagine trying to simulate you know
a a model of a human just doing a bunch

686
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:16,990
a a model of a human just doing a bunch
 

687
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,840
a a model of a human just doing a bunch
of gestures and so on and and you know

688
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:18,850
of gestures and so on and and you know
 

689
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,550
of gestures and so on and and you know
it's it's actually simulated it's not

690
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:20,560
it's it's actually simulated it's not
 

691
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,950
it's it's actually simulated it's not
captured like with a motion capture but

692
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:22,960
captured like with a motion capture but
 

693
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,480
captured like with a motion capture but
it is similarly that's that's very in

694
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:24,490
it is similarly that's that's very in
 

695
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,600
it is similarly that's that's very in
fact today I get involved a lot with

696
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:27,610
fact today I get involved a lot with
 

697
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,160
fact today I get involved a lot with
like sort of this kind of very high-end

698
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,170
like sort of this kind of very high-end
 

699
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,650
like sort of this kind of very high-end
rendering projects and I have like this

700
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:31,660
rendering projects and I have like this
 

701
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,390
rendering projects and I have like this
test that I've pass it to my friends or

702
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:33,400
test that I've pass it to my friends or
 

703
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,280
test that I've pass it to my friends or
my mom you know ice and like two photos

704
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:35,290
my mom you know ice and like two photos
 

705
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,950
my mom you know ice and like two photos
two kind of pictures and I say rendered

706
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:37,960
two kind of pictures and I say rendered
 

707
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,600
two kind of pictures and I say rendered
which one is rendered which one is real

708
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:39,610
which one is rendered which one is real
 

709
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,400
which one is rendered which one is real
and it's pretty hard to distinguish

710
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:41,410
and it's pretty hard to distinguish
 

711
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,920
and it's pretty hard to distinguish
except I realized except when we put

712
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:43,930
except I realized except when we put
 

713
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,960
except I realized except when we put
humans in there it's possible that our

714
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:45,970
humans in there it's possible that our
 

715
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,420
humans in there it's possible that our
brains are trained in a way that we

716
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:48,430
brains are trained in a way that we
 

717
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,940
brains are trained in a way that we
recognize humans extremely well but we

718
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:50,950
recognize humans extremely well but we
 

719
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,500
recognize humans extremely well but we
don't so much recognize the built

720
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:52,510
don't so much recognize the built
 

721
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,090
don't so much recognize the built
environments because built an alarm sort

722
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:54,100
environments because built an alarm sort
 

723
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,460
environments because built an alarm sort
of came after per se we evolved into

724
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:56,470
of came after per se we evolved into
 

725
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,860
of came after per se we evolved into
sort of being humans but but humans were

726
00:13:58,860 --> 00:13:58,870
sort of being humans but but humans were
 

727
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,780
sort of being humans but but humans were
always there same thing happens for

728
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:00,790
always there same thing happens for
 

729
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,210
always there same thing happens for
example you look at like monkeys and you

730
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:03,220
example you look at like monkeys and you
 

731
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,490
example you look at like monkeys and you
can't distinguish one from another but

732
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:05,500
can't distinguish one from another but
 

733
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,530
can't distinguish one from another but
they sort of do and it's very possible

734
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:07,540
they sort of do and it's very possible
 

735
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,030
they sort of do and it's very possible
that they look at humans it's kind of

736
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,040
that they look at humans it's kind of
 

737
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,290
that they look at humans it's kind of
pretty hard to distinguish one from

738
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:10,300
pretty hard to distinguish one from
 

739
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,900
pretty hard to distinguish one from
another but we do and so our eyes are

740
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:12,910
another but we do and so our eyes are
 

741
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,610
another but we do and so our eyes are
pretty well trained to look at humans

742
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:14,620
pretty well trained to look at humans
 

743
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,250
pretty well trained to look at humans
and understand if something is off we

744
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:17,260
and understand if something is off we
 

745
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,930
and understand if something is off we
will get it we may not be able to

746
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:18,940
will get it we may not be able to
 

747
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,270
will get it we may not be able to
pinpoint it so in my typical friend test

748
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:21,280
pinpoint it so in my typical friend test
 

749
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,130
pinpoint it so in my typical friend test
or mom test what would happen is that we

750
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,140
or mom test what would happen is that we
 

751
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,530
or mom test what would happen is that we
put like a human walking in you know

752
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:25,540
put like a human walking in you know
 

753
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,930
put like a human walking in you know
anything and they they say you know this

754
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:27,940
anything and they they say you know this
 

755
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,420
anything and they they say you know this
is not right something is off in this

756
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:30,430
is not right something is off in this
 

757
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,450
is not right something is off in this
video I don't know what but I can tell

758
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:33,460
video I don't know what but I can tell
 

759
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,010
video I don't know what but I can tell
you it's too human I can take the human

760
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:35,020
you it's too human I can take the human
 

761
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,660
you it's too human I can take the human
and I can show you like inside of a

762
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:36,670
and I can show you like inside of a
 

763
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,030
and I can show you like inside of a
building or like an apartment and it

764
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,040
building or like an apartment and it
 

765
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,860
building or like an apartment and it
will look like if we had time to render

766
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:40,870
will look like if we had time to render
 

767
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,200
will look like if we had time to render
it it will look great and this should be

768
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,210
it it will look great and this should be
 

769
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:44,580
it it will look great and this should be
no surprise a lot of movies that people

770
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:44,590
no surprise a lot of movies that people
 

771
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,490
no surprise a lot of movies that people
are watching it's all computer-generated

772
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:46,500
are watching it's all computer-generated
 

773
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,110
are watching it's all computer-generated
you know even nowadays when you watch a

774
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:49,120
you know even nowadays when you watch a
 

775
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,420
you know even nowadays when you watch a
drama movie and like there's nothing

776
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,430
drama movie and like there's nothing
 

777
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,070
drama movie and like there's nothing
going on action wise but it turns out

778
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,080
going on action wise but it turns out
 

779
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,630
going on action wise but it turns out
it's kinda like cheaper I guess to

780
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:54,640
it's kinda like cheaper I guess to
 

781
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:56,510
it's kinda like cheaper I guess to
render the background and so they would

782
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:56,520
render the background and so they would
 

783
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,770
render the background and so they would
but how do we get there how do we get a

784
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:00,780
but how do we get there how do we get a
 

785
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,460
but how do we get there how do we get a
human

786
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:03,470
human
 

787
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,070
human
would pass the mom / friend test a

788
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:07,080
would pass the mom / friend test a
 

789
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,700
would pass the mom / friend test a
simulation of a human walking do you

790
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:10,710
simulation of a human walking do you
 

791
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:12,110
simulation of a human walking do you
think that's something we can creep up

792
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:12,120
think that's something we can creep up
 

793
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,010
think that's something we can creep up
do by just doing kind of a comparison

794
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,020
do by just doing kind of a comparison
 

795
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,890
do by just doing kind of a comparison
learning or you have humans annotate

796
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:18,900
learning or you have humans annotate
 

797
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,160
learning or you have humans annotate
what's more realistic and not just by

798
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,170
what's more realistic and not just by
 

799
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,290
what's more realistic and not just by
watching they go what what's the path is

800
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
watching they go what what's the path is
 

801
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,080
watching they go what what's the path is
it seems totally mysterious how we thing

802
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,090
it seems totally mysterious how we thing
 

803
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:29,090
it seems totally mysterious how we thing
right simulate human behavior

804
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,100
right simulate human behavior
 

805
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,670
right simulate human behavior
it's it's hard because a lot of the

806
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:31,680
it's it's hard because a lot of the
 

807
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,900
it's it's hard because a lot of the
other things that I mentioned to you

808
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:32,910
other things that I mentioned to you
 

809
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,310
other things that I mentioned to you
including simulating cameras right it is

810
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:36,320
including simulating cameras right it is
 

811
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,170
including simulating cameras right it is
the the thing there is that you know we

812
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:39,180
the the thing there is that you know we
 

813
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,300
the the thing there is that you know we
know the physics we know how it works

814
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,310
know the physics we know how it works
 

815
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,480
know the physics we know how it works
like in the real world and we can write

816
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,490
like in the real world and we can write
 

817
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,820
like in the real world and we can write
some rules and we can do that like for

818
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:46,830
some rules and we can do that like for
 

819
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,410
some rules and we can do that like for
example simulating cameras there's this

820
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:48,420
example simulating cameras there's this
 

821
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,300
example simulating cameras there's this
thing called ray tracing I mean you

822
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:50,310
thing called ray tracing I mean you
 

823
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:53,090
thing called ray tracing I mean you
literally just kind of imagine it's very

824
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:53,100
literally just kind of imagine it's very
 

825
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,980
literally just kind of imagine it's very
similar to it's not exactly the same but

826
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:54,990
similar to it's not exactly the same but
 

827
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:57,140
similar to it's not exactly the same but
it's very similar to tracing photon by

828
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:57,150
it's very similar to tracing photon by
 

829
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,120
it's very similar to tracing photon by
photon they're going around bouncing on

behavior developing a dynamic like like

834
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:05,100
behavior developing a dynamic like like
 

835
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,330
behavior developing a dynamic like like
like a model of that that is

836
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:07,340
like a model of that that is
 

837
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,470
like a model of that that is
mathematical so that you can put it into

838
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:09,480
mathematical so that you can put it into
 

839
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,290
mathematical so that you can put it into
a processor that would go through that

840
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:12,300
a processor that would go through that
 

841
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,810
a processor that would go through that
that's gonna be hard and so so what else

842
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:14,820
that's gonna be hard and so so what else
 

843
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,780
that's gonna be hard and so so what else
do you got you can collect data right

844
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:17,790
do you got you can collect data right
 

845
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,940
do you got you can collect data right
and you can try to match the data or

846
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:19,950
and you can try to match the data or
 

847
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,290
and you can try to match the data or
another thing that you can do is that

848
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:21,300
another thing that you can do is that
 

849
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,510
another thing that you can do is that
you know you can show the Frant test you

850
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:23,520
you know you can show the Frant test you
 

851
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,920
you know you can show the Frant test you
know you can say this or that and this

852
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:24,930
know you can say this or that and this
 

853
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,380
know you can say this or that and this
or that and that will be labeling

854
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:26,390
or that and that will be labeling
 

855
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,640
or that and that will be labeling
anything that requires human labeling

856
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,650
anything that requires human labeling
 

857
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,470
anything that requires human labeling
ultimately we're limited by the number

858
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
ultimately we're limited by the number
 

859
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,880
ultimately we're limited by the number
of humans that you know we have

860
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:31,890
of humans that you know we have
 

861
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,920
of humans that you know we have
available at a heart disposal and the

862
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:33,930
available at a heart disposal and the
 

863
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,270
available at a heart disposal and the
things that they can do you know they

864
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,280
things that they can do you know they
 

865
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,500
things that they can do you know they
have to do a lot of other things than

866
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:36,510
have to do a lot of other things than
 

867
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,670
have to do a lot of other things than
also labeling this data so so that

868
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:39,680
also labeling this data so so that
 

869
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,770
also labeling this data so so that
modeling human behavior part is is I

think going we're gonna realize it's
 

873
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:47,150
think going we're gonna realize it's
very tough and I think that also effects

00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
very tough and I think that also effects

00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,090
very tough and I think that also effects
you know our development of autonomous

building self-driving you know it the

882
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:57,330
building self-driving you know it the
 

883
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,820
building self-driving you know it the
first time like right after urban

884
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:58,830
first time like right after urban
 

885
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:01,100

challenge I think everybody focused on

886
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:01,110
challenge I think everybody focused on
 

887
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:03,380
challenge I think everybody focused on
localization mapping and localization

888
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,390
localization mapping and localization
 

889
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,880
localization mapping and localization
you know as slam algorithms came in

890
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:04,890
you know as slam algorithms came in
 

891
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,130
you know as slam algorithms came in
Google was just doing that and so

892
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
Google was just doing that and so
 

893
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,290
Google was just doing that and so
building these HD maps basically that's

894
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:09,300
building these HD maps basically that's
 

895
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,840
building these HD maps basically that's
about knowing where you are and then

896
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:11,850
about knowing where you are and then
 

897
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:14,420
about knowing where you are and then
five years later in 2012-2013 came the

898
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:14,430
five years later in 2012-2013 came the
 

899
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,309
five years later in 2012-2013 came the
kind of coding code AI revolution and

900
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:16,319
kind of coding code AI revolution and
 

901
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,809
kind of coding code AI revolution and
that started telling us about everybody

902
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:17,819
that started telling us about everybody
 

903
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,899
that started telling us about everybody
else's but we're still missing what

904
00:17:20,899 --> 00:17:20,909
else's but we're still missing what
 

905
00:17:20,909 --> 00:17:23,360
else's but we're still missing what
everybody else is gonna do next and so

906
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:23,370
everybody else is gonna do next and so
 

907
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:24,769
everybody else is gonna do next and so
you want to know where you are you want

908
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:24,779
you want to know where you are you want
 

909
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,600
you want to know where you are you want
to know what everybody else is hopefully

910
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:26,610
to know what everybody else is hopefully
 

911
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:27,889
to know what everybody else is hopefully
you know about what you're gonna do next

912
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:27,899
you know about what you're gonna do next
 

913
00:17:27,899 --> 00:17:29,810
you know about what you're gonna do next
and then you want to predict what other

914
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:29,820
and then you want to predict what other
 

915
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,690
and then you want to predict what other
people are going to do and that last bit

916
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:31,700
people are going to do and that last bit
 

917
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:35,960
people are going to do and that last bit
has been a real real challenge what do

918
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:35,970
has been a real real challenge what do
 

919
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:38,720
has been a real real challenge what do
you think is the role your own of you of

920
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:38,730
you think is the role your own of you of
 

921
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:42,919
you think is the role your own of you of
your the ego vehicle the robot you the

922
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:42,929
your the ego vehicle the robot you the
 

923
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,129
your the ego vehicle the robot you the
the you the robotic you in controlling

924
00:17:46,129 --> 00:17:46,139
the you the robotic you in controlling
 

925
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:48,529
the you the robotic you in controlling
and having some control of how the

926
00:17:48,529 --> 00:17:48,539
and having some control of how the
 

927
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,240
and having some control of how the
future on roles of what's going to

928
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,250
future on roles of what's going to
 

929
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,310
future on roles of what's going to
happen in the future that seems to be a

930
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:52,320
happen in the future that seems to be a
 

931
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,560
happen in the future that seems to be a
little bit ignored in trying to predict

932
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:54,570
little bit ignored in trying to predict
 

933
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,830
little bit ignored in trying to predict
the future is how you yourself can

934
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:57,840
the future is how you yourself can
 

935
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,549
the future is how you yourself can
affect that future by being either

936
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:00,559
affect that future by being either
 

937
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,669
affect that future by being either
aggressive or less aggressive or

938
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,679
aggressive or less aggressive or
 

939
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,649
aggressive or less aggressive or
signaling in some kind of way so this

940
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:06,659
signaling in some kind of way so this
 

941
00:18:06,659 --> 00:18:09,230
signaling in some kind of way so this
kind of game theoretic dance seems to be

942
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:09,240
kind of game theoretic dance seems to be
 

943
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,450
kind of game theoretic dance seems to be
ignored for the moment it's yeah it's

944
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:11,460
ignored for the moment it's yeah it's
 

945
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,759
ignored for the moment it's yeah it's
it's totally ignored I mean it's it's

946
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:13,769
it's totally ignored I mean it's it's
 

947
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,480
it's totally ignored I mean it's it's
quite interesting actually like how we

948
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:16,490
quite interesting actually like how we
 

949
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:19,759
quite interesting actually like how we
how we interact with things versus we

950
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:19,769
how we interact with things versus we
 

951
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:22,970
how we interact with things versus we
interact with humans like so if if you

952
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:22,980
interact with humans like so if if you
 

953
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,519
interact with humans like so if if you
see a vehicle that's completely empty

954
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:25,529
see a vehicle that's completely empty
 

955
00:18:25,529 --> 00:18:27,740
see a vehicle that's completely empty
and it's trying to do something all of a

956
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:27,750
and it's trying to do something all of a
 

957
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,119
and it's trying to do something all of a
sudden it becomes a thing

958
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:29,129
sudden it becomes a thing
 

959
00:18:29,129 --> 00:18:31,340
sudden it becomes a thing
so interacted with like you interact

960
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,350
so interacted with like you interact
 

961
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,230
so interacted with like you interact
with this table and so you can throw

962
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:33,240
with this table and so you can throw
 

963
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,539
with this table and so you can throw
your backpack or you can kick your kick

964
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:35,549
your backpack or you can kick your kick
 

965
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,549
your backpack or you can kick your kick
it put your feet on it and things like

966
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:37,559
it put your feet on it and things like
 

967
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,159
it put your feet on it and things like
that but when it's a human there's all

968
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:40,169
that but when it's a human there's all
 

969
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:41,749
that but when it's a human there's all
kinds of ways of interacting with a

970
00:18:41,749 --> 00:18:41,759
kinds of ways of interacting with a
 

971
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:43,279
kinds of ways of interacting with a
human so if you know like you and I are

972
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:43,289
human so if you know like you and I are
 

973
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,590
human so if you know like you and I are
face to face we're very civil you know

974
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:45,600
face to face we're very civil you know
 

975
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,629
face to face we're very civil you know
we talk understand each other for the

976
00:18:47,629 --> 00:18:47,639
we talk understand each other for the
 

977
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,850
we talk understand each other for the
most part you'll see you just but but

978
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:52,860
most part you'll see you just but but
 

979
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,860
most part you'll see you just but but
the thing is that like for example you

980
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:54,870
the thing is that like for example you
 

981
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,509
the thing is that like for example you
and I might interact through YouTube

982
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:56,519
and I might interact through YouTube
 

983
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,730
and I might interact through YouTube
comments and you know the conversation

984
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:58,740
comments and you know the conversation
 

985
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,279
comments and you know the conversation
may go a totally different angle and so

986
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:01,289
may go a totally different angle and so
 

987
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:04,820
may go a totally different angle and so
I think people kind of abusing these

988
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:04,830
I think people kind of abusing these
 

989
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,980
I think people kind of abusing these
autonomous vehicles is a real issue in

990
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:06,990
autonomous vehicles is a real issue in
 

991
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,350
autonomous vehicles is a real issue in
some sense and so when you're an ego

992
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:09,360
some sense and so when you're an ego
 

993
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,999
some sense and so when you're an ego
vehicle you're trying to you know

994
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:11,009
vehicle you're trying to you know
 

995
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:13,159
vehicle you're trying to you know
coordinate your way make your way it's

996
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:13,169
coordinate your way make your way it's
 

997
00:19:13,169 --> 00:19:14,899
coordinate your way make your way it's
actually kind of harder than being a

998
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:14,909
actually kind of harder than being a
 

999
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:17,930
actually kind of harder than being a
human you know it's like it's you you

1000
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:17,940
human you know it's like it's you you
 

1001
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,210
human you know it's like it's you you
you not only need to be as smart as kind

1002
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:20,220
you not only need to be as smart as kind
 

1003
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,649
you not only need to be as smart as kind
of humans are but you also you're a

1004
00:19:21,649 --> 00:19:21,659
of humans are but you also you're a
 

1005
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,360
of humans are but you also you're a
thing so they're gonna abuse you a

1006
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:23,370
thing so they're gonna abuse you a
 

1007
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,430
thing so they're gonna abuse you a
little bit so you need to make sure that

1008
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:25,440
little bit so you need to make sure that
 

1009
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,430
little bit so you need to make sure that
you can get around and do something so

1010
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
you can get around and do something so
 

1011
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,150
you can get around and do something so
yeah III in general believe in that sort

1012
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:33,160
yeah III in general believe in that sort
 

1013
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,830
yeah III in general believe in that sort
of game theoretic aspects I've actually

1014
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:34,840
of game theoretic aspects I've actually
 

1015
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,080
of game theoretic aspects I've actually
personally have done you know quite a

1016
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,090
personally have done you know quite a
 

1017
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,480
personally have done you know quite a
few papers both on that kind of game

1018
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:39,490
few papers both on that kind of game
 

1019
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:41,570
few papers both on that kind of game
theory and also like this this kind of

1020
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:41,580
theory and also like this this kind of
 

1021
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,560
theory and also like this this kind of
understanding people's social value

1022
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:43,570
understanding people's social value
 

1023
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,290
understanding people's social value
orientation for example you know some

1024
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:46,300
orientation for example you know some
 

1025
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,210
orientation for example you know some
people are aggressive some people not so

1026
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:48,220
people are aggressive some people not so
 

1027
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,820
people are aggressive some people not so
much and and you know like you robot

1028
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:50,830
much and and you know like you robot
 

1029
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,010
much and and you know like you robot
could understand that by just looking at

1030
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,020
could understand that by just looking at
 

1031
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,290
could understand that by just looking at
how people drive and as they kind of

1032
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,300
how people drive and as they kind of
 

1033
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,670
how people drive and as they kind of
come and approach you can actually

1034
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:56,680
come and approach you can actually
 

1035
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,410
come and approach you can actually
understand like if someone is gonna be

1036
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:58,420
understand like if someone is gonna be
 

1037
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,620
understand like if someone is gonna be
aggressive or or not as a robot and you

1038
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:01,630
aggressive or or not as a robot and you
 

1039
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,660
aggressive or or not as a robot and you
can make certain decisions well in terms

1040
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:03,670
can make certain decisions well in terms
 

1041
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,070
can make certain decisions well in terms
of predicting what they're going to do

1042
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:05,080
of predicting what they're going to do
 

1043
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,100
of predicting what they're going to do
the hard question is you as a robot

1044
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,110
the hard question is you as a robot
 

1045
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:11,250
the hard question is you as a robot
should you be aggressive or not when

1046
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:11,260
should you be aggressive or not when
 

1047
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,900
should you be aggressive or not when
faced with it was an aggressive role but

1048
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:12,910
faced with it was an aggressive role but
 

1049
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,520
faced with it was an aggressive role but
right now it seems like aggressive is a

1050
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:14,530
right now it seems like aggressive is a
 

1051
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,210
right now it seems like aggressive is a
very dangerous thing to do because it's

1052
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:18,220
very dangerous thing to do because it's
 

1053
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,060
very dangerous thing to do because it's
costly from a societal perspective how

1054
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,070
costly from a societal perspective how
 

1055
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,490
costly from a societal perspective how
you're perceived people are not very

1056
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:23,500
you're perceived people are not very
 

1057
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,680
you're perceived people are not very
accepting of aggressive robots emotive

1058
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:25,690
accepting of aggressive robots emotive
 

1059
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:28,920
accepting of aggressive robots emotive
Society I think that's accurate so that

1060
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:28,930
Society I think that's accurate so that
 

1061
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:32,430
Society I think that's accurate so that
is really is and so I'm not entirely

1062
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:32,440
is really is and so I'm not entirely
 

1063
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,920
is really is and so I'm not entirely
sure like how to have to go about but it

1064
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:34,930
sure like how to have to go about but it
 

1065
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:36,780
sure like how to have to go about but it
I know I know for a fact that how these

1066
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:36,790
I know I know for a fact that how these
 

1067
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:38,580
I know I know for a fact that how these
robots interact with other people in

1068
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:38,590
robots interact with other people in
 

1069
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,890
robots interact with other people in
there is going to be and then

1070
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:40,900
there is going to be and then
 

1071
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,450
there is going to be and then
interaction is always gonna be there I

1072
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:42,460
interaction is always gonna be there I
 

1073
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,740
interaction is always gonna be there I
mean you could be interacting with other

1074
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:43,750
mean you could be interacting with other
 

1075
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,990
mean you could be interacting with other
vehicles or other just people kind of

1076
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,000
vehicles or other just people kind of
 

1077
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,990
vehicles or other just people kind of
like walking around and like I said the

1078
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:49,000
like walking around and like I said the
 

1079
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,030
like walking around and like I said the
moment there's like nobody in the seat

1080
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:51,040
moment there's like nobody in the seat
 

1081
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,340
moment there's like nobody in the seat
it's like an empty thing just rolling

1082
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:53,350
it's like an empty thing just rolling
 

1083
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,590
it's like an empty thing just rolling
off the street it becomes like no

1084
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:55,600
off the street it becomes like no
 

1085
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,320
off the street it becomes like no
different than like any other thing

1086
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:58,330
different than like any other thing
 

1087
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,530
different than like any other thing
that's not human and so so people and

1088
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:01,540
that's not human and so so people and
 

1089
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,300
that's not human and so so people and
maybe abuse is the wrong word but you

1090
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:03,310
maybe abuse is the wrong word but you
 

1091
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:05,160
maybe abuse is the wrong word but you
know people may be rightfully even they

1092
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:05,170
know people may be rightfully even they
 

1093
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:07,350
know people may be rightfully even they
feel like you know this is a human

1094
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:07,360
feel like you know this is a human
 

1095
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,270
feel like you know this is a human
present environments designed for humans

1096
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:09,280
present environments designed for humans
 

1097
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,430
present environments designed for humans
to be and and they they kind of they

1098
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:11,440
to be and and they they kind of they
 

1099
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,830
to be and and they they kind of they
want to own it and then you know the

1100
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:13,840
want to own it and then you know the
 

1101
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,390
want to own it and then you know the
robots they would they would need to

1102
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:15,400
robots they would they would need to
 

1103
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,410
robots they would they would need to
understand and they would need to

1104
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:16,420
understand and they would need to
 

1105
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,930
understand and they would need to
respond in a certain way and I think

1106
00:21:18,930 --> 00:21:18,940
respond in a certain way and I think
 

1107
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,400
respond in a certain way and I think
that you know this actually opens up

1108
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:20,410
that you know this actually opens up
 

1109
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,650
that you know this actually opens up
like quite a few interesting societal

1110
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:22,660
like quite a few interesting societal
 

1111
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,420
like quite a few interesting societal
questions for us as we deploy like we

1112
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:24,430
questions for us as we deploy like we
 

1113
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,300
questions for us as we deploy like we
talk robots at large scale so what would

1114
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,310
talk robots at large scale so what would
 

1115
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,370
talk robots at large scale so what would
happen when we try to deploy robots at

1116
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:29,380
happen when we try to deploy robots at
 

1117
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,900
happen when we try to deploy robots at
large scale I think is that we can

1118
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:30,910
large scale I think is that we can
 

1119
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,640
large scale I think is that we can
design systems in a way that they're

1120
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,650
design systems in a way that they're
 

1121
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,460
design systems in a way that they're
very efficient or we can design them

1122
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:35,470
very efficient or we can design them
 

1123
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:37,260
very efficient or we can design them
that they're very sustainable but

1124
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:37,270
that they're very sustainable but
 

1125
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,790
that they're very sustainable but
ultimately the sustainability efficiency

1126
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:38,800
ultimately the sustainability efficiency
 

1127
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,610
ultimately the sustainability efficiency
trade-offs like they're gonna be right

1128
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:41,620
trade-offs like they're gonna be right
 

1129
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,620
trade-offs like they're gonna be right
in there

1130
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:42,630
in there
 

1131
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:43,730
in there
we're gonna have to make some choices

1132
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:43,740
we're gonna have to make some choices
 

1133
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,920
we're gonna have to make some choices
like we're not going to be able to just

1134
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,930
like we're not going to be able to just
 

1135
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,230
like we're not going to be able to just
kind of put it aside so for example we

1136
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,240
kind of put it aside so for example we
 

1137
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,870
kind of put it aside so for example we
can be very aggressive and we can reduce

1138
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:50,880
can be very aggressive and we can reduce
 

1139
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,270
can be very aggressive and we can reduce
transportation delays increase capacity

1140
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:53,280
transportation delays increase capacity
 

1141
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,820
transportation delays increase capacity
of transportation or you know we can we

1142
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:55,830
of transportation or you know we can we
 

1143
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,010
of transportation or you know we can we
can be a lot nicer and other people to

1144
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,020
can be a lot nicer and other people to
 

1145
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,720
can be a lot nicer and other people to
kind of coding code on the environment

1146
00:21:59,720 --> 00:21:59,730
kind of coding code on the environment
 

1147
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,600
kind of coding code on the environment
and live in a nice place and then

1148
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:02,610
and live in a nice place and then
 

1149
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,820
and live in a nice place and then
efficiency will drop so when you think

1150
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:04,830
efficiency will drop so when you think
 

1151
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,890
efficiency will drop so when you think
about it I think sustainability gets

1152
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:06,900
about it I think sustainability gets
 

1153
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,560
about it I think sustainability gets
attached to energy consumption or I

1154
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:09,570
attached to energy consumption or I
 

1155
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,300
attached to energy consumption or I
wanna have the impact immediately and

1156
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,310
wanna have the impact immediately and
 

1157
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,100
wanna have the impact immediately and
those are those are there but like

1158
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,110
those are those are there but like
 

1159
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:15,140
those are those are there but like
livability is another sustainability

1160
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:15,150
livability is another sustainability
 

1161
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:17,540
livability is another sustainability
impact so you create an environment that

1162
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,550
impact so you create an environment that
 

1163
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,420
impact so you create an environment that
people want to live in and if robots are

1164
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,430
people want to live in and if robots are
 

1165
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,250
people want to live in and if robots are
going around being aggressive and you

1166
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,260
going around being aggressive and you
 

1167
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,240
going around being aggressive and you
don't want to live in that environment

1168
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,250
don't want to live in that environment
 

1169
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,940
don't want to live in that environment
maybe however you should note that if

1170
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:25,950
maybe however you should note that if
 

1171
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,320
maybe however you should note that if
you're not being aggressive then you

1172
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:27,330
you're not being aggressive then you
 

1173
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,120
you're not being aggressive then you
know you're probably taking up some some

1174
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,130
know you're probably taking up some some
 

1175
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:31,520
know you're probably taking up some some
delays in transportation and listen that

1176
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:31,530
delays in transportation and listen that
 

1177
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,970
delays in transportation and listen that
so you're always balancing that and I

1178
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:34,980
so you're always balancing that and I
 

1179
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,680
so you're always balancing that and I
think this this choice has always been

1180
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:36,690
think this this choice has always been
 

1181
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,450
think this this choice has always been
there in transportation but I think the

1182
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:38,460
there in transportation but I think the
 

1183
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,760
there in transportation but I think the
more autonomy comes in the more explicit

1184
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:40,770
more autonomy comes in the more explicit
 

1185
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:44,660
more autonomy comes in the more explicit
the choice becomes yeah when it becomes

1186
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:44,670
the choice becomes yeah when it becomes
 

1187
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,160
the choice becomes yeah when it becomes
explicit that we can start to optimize

1188
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,170
explicit that we can start to optimize
 

1189
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,530
explicit that we can start to optimize
it and I will get to ask the very

1190
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:48,540
it and I will get to ask the very
 

1191
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,900
it and I will get to ask the very
difficult societal questions of what do

1192
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:50,910
difficult societal questions of what do
 

1193
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,280
difficult societal questions of what do
we value more efficiency or

1194
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,290
we value more efficiency or
 

1195
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,710
we value more efficiency or
sustainability it's kind of interesting

1196
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:54,720
sustainability it's kind of interesting
 

1197
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,840
sustainability it's kind of interesting
there will happen like I think we're

1198
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:56,850
there will happen like I think we're
 

1199
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,970
there will happen like I think we're
gonna have to like I think that the the

1200
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:58,980
gonna have to like I think that the the
 

1201
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,470
gonna have to like I think that the the
interesting thing about like the whole

1202
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
interesting thing about like the whole
 

1203
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,840
interesting thing about like the whole
autonomous vehicles question I think is

1204
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:02,850
autonomous vehicles question I think is
 

1205
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,350
autonomous vehicles question I think is
also kind of I think a lot of times you

1206
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:06,360
also kind of I think a lot of times you
 

1207
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,880
also kind of I think a lot of times you
know we have we have focused on

1208
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:07,890
know we have we have focused on
 

1209
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,850
know we have we have focused on
technology development like hundreds of

1210
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:10,860
technology development like hundreds of
 

1211
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,160
technology development like hundreds of
years and you know the products somehow

1212
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,170
years and you know the products somehow
 

1213
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,960
years and you know the products somehow
followed and and then you know we got to

1214
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:14,970
followed and and then you know we got to
 

1215
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,400
followed and and then you know we got to
make these choices and things like that

1216
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,410
make these choices and things like that
 

1217
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,560
make these choices and things like that
but this is this is a good time that you

1218
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:18,570
but this is this is a good time that you
 

1219
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:20,150
but this is this is a good time that you
know we even think about you know

1220
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:20,160
know we even think about you know
 

1221
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,760
know we even think about you know
autonomous taxi type of deployments and

1222
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:22,770
autonomous taxi type of deployments and
 

1223
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,220
autonomous taxi type of deployments and
the systems that would evolve from there

1224
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:25,230
the systems that would evolve from there
 

1225
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,560
the systems that would evolve from there
and you realize the business models are

1226
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:27,570
and you realize the business models are
 

1227
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:29,600
and you realize the business models are
different the impact on architecture is

1228
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:29,610
different the impact on architecture is
 

1229
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:32,150
different the impact on architecture is
different urban planning you get into

1230
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:32,160
different urban planning you get into
 

1231
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,080
different urban planning you get into
like regulations and then you get into

1232
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:36,090
like regulations and then you get into
 

1233
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,490
like regulations and then you get into
like these issues that you didn't think

1234
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:37,500
like these issues that you didn't think
 

1235
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,290
like these issues that you didn't think
about before but like sustainability and

1236
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:39,300
about before but like sustainability and
 

1237
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,330
about before but like sustainability and
ethics is like right in the middle of it

1238
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:41,340
ethics is like right in the middle of it
 

1239
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,760
ethics is like right in the middle of it
I mean even testing autonomous vehicles

1240
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:43,770
I mean even testing autonomous vehicles
 

1241
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:44,930
I mean even testing autonomous vehicles
like think about it you're testing

1242
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:44,940
like think about it you're testing
 

1243
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,490
like think about it you're testing
autonomous vehicles in human present

1244
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:46,500
autonomous vehicles in human present
 

1245
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,160
autonomous vehicles in human present
environments I mean the risk may be very

1246
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:49,170
environments I mean the risk may be very
 

1247
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,870
environments I mean the risk may be very
small but still you know it's it's a

1248
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:50,880
small but still you know it's it's a
 

1249
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,240
small but still you know it's it's a
it's a it's it's a you know strictly

1250
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,250
it's a it's it's a you know strictly
 

1251
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:54,620
it's a it's it's a you know strictly
greater than zero risk that you're

1252
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:54,630
greater than zero risk that you're
 

1253
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,670
greater than zero risk that you're
putting peep

1254
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:55,680
putting peep
 

1255
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:59,300
putting peep
and so then you have that innovation you

1256
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,310
and so then you have that innovation you
 

1257
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,940
and so then you have that innovation you
know risk trade-off that you're in that

1258
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:01,950
know risk trade-off that you're in that
 

1259
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,930
know risk trade-off that you're in that
somewhere and we understand that pretty

1260
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:05,940
somewhere and we understand that pretty
 

1261
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,760
somewhere and we understand that pretty
now they pretty well now is that if we

1262
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:07,770
now they pretty well now is that if we
 

1263
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:11,390
now they pretty well now is that if we
don't test the beast day the development

1264
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:11,400
don't test the beast day the development
 

1265
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,760
don't test the beast day the development
will be slower I mean it it doesn't mean

1266
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:13,770
will be slower I mean it it doesn't mean
 

1267
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:14,780
will be slower I mean it it doesn't mean
that we're not gonna be able to develop

1268
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:14,790
that we're not gonna be able to develop
 

1269
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,040
that we're not gonna be able to develop
I think it's gonna be pretty hard

1270
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,050
I think it's gonna be pretty hard
 

1271
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:16,640
I think it's gonna be pretty hard
actually

1272
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:16,650
actually
 

1273
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,650
actually
maybe we can we don't real I don't know

1274
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:18,660
maybe we can we don't real I don't know
 

1275
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,690
maybe we can we don't real I don't know
but well the thing is that those kinds

1276
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:20,700
but well the thing is that those kinds
 

1277
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,670
but well the thing is that those kinds
of trade-offs we already are making and

1278
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:22,680
of trade-offs we already are making and
 

1279
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,070
of trade-offs we already are making and
as these systems become more ubiquitous

1280
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,080
as these systems become more ubiquitous
 

1281
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,950
as these systems become more ubiquitous
I think those trade-offs will just

1282
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:27,960
I think those trade-offs will just
 

1283
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,640
I think those trade-offs will just
really hit so you are one of the

1284
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:31,650
really hit so you are one of the
 

1285
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,350
really hit so you are one of the

well let me and that point ask maybe

1290
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,210
well let me and that point ask maybe
 

1291
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:41,740
well let me and that point ask maybe
good examples

represents maybe a more cautious

1304
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:02,610
represents maybe a more cautious
 

1305
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:05,540
represents maybe a more cautious
approach and then you have Tesla on the

1306
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:05,550
approach and then you have Tesla on the
 

1307
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:08,300
approach and then you have Tesla on the
other side added by Elon Musk that

1308
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,310
other side added by Elon Musk that
 

1309
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,970
other side added by Elon Musk that
represents some more however which

1310

represents some more however which

adjectives you want to use aggressive

1312
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:12,650
adjectives you want to use aggressive
 

1313
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:17,330
adjectives you want to use aggressive
innovative I don't know but what what do

1314
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:17,340
innovative I don't know but what what do
 

1315
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,320
innovative I don't know but what what do
you think about the difference between

1316
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,330
you think about the difference between
 

1317
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:21,650
you think about the difference between
its two strategies in your view what's

1318
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:21,660
its two strategies in your view what's
 

1319
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,590
its two strategies in your view what's
more likely what's needed and is more

1320
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:24,600
more likely what's needed and is more
 

1321
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,170
more likely what's needed and is more
likely to succeed in the short term in

1322
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:27,180
likely to succeed in the short term in
 

1323
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:30,710
likely to succeed in the short term in
the long term definitely some sort of

1324
00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:30,720
the long term definitely some sort of
 

1325
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,930
the long term definitely some sort of
balance is is kind of the right way to

1326
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:32,940
balance is is kind of the right way to
 

1327
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,480
balance is is kind of the right way to
go but I do think that the thing that is

1328
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:35,490
go but I do think that the thing that is
 

1329
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,490
go but I do think that the thing that is
the most important is actually like an

1330
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:37,500
the most important is actually like an
 

1331
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,790
the most important is actually like an
informed public so I don't I don't mind

1332
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:40,800
informed public so I don't I don't mind
 

1333
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,420
informed public so I don't I don't mind
you know I personally like if I were in

1334
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,430
you know I personally like if I were in
 

1335
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:47,060
you know I personally like if I were in
some place I wouldn't mind so much like

1336
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,070
some place I wouldn't mind so much like
 

1337
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,600
some place I wouldn't mind so much like
taking a certain amount of risk some

1338
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:50,610
taking a certain amount of risk some
 

1339
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,880
taking a certain amount of risk some
other people might and so I think the

1340
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:52,890
other people might and so I think the
 

1341
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,060
other people might and so I think the
key is for people to be informed and so

1342
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,070
key is for people to be informed and so
 

1343
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,160
key is for people to be informed and so
that they can ideally they can make a

1344
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,170
that they can ideally they can make a
 

1345
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,020
that they can ideally they can make a
choice in some cases that kind of choice

1346
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,030
choice in some cases that kind of choice
 

1347
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,820
choice in some cases that kind of choice
making that anonymously is of course

1348
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:04,830
making that anonymously is of course
 

1349
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:07,070
making that anonymously is of course
very hard but I don't think it's

1350
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:07,080
very hard but I don't think it's
 

1351
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,960
very hard but I don't think it's
actually that hard to inform people

1352
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:09,970
actually that hard to inform people
 

1353
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,980
actually that hard to inform people
so I think in in in one case like for

1354
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:13,990
so I think in in in one case like for
 

1355
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,310
so I think in in in one case like for
example even the Tesla approach I don't

1356
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:17,320
example even the Tesla approach I don't
 

1357
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,779
example even the Tesla approach I don't
know it's hard to judge how he informed

1358
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:18,789
know it's hard to judge how he informed
 

1359
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,639
know it's hard to judge how he informed
it is but it is somewhat informed I mean

1360
00:26:20,639 --> 00:26:20,649
it is but it is somewhat informed I mean
 

1361
00:26:20,649 --> 00:26:22,049
it is but it is somewhat informed I mean
you know things kind of come out I think

1362
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:22,059
you know things kind of come out I think
 

1363
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:23,669
you know things kind of come out I think
people know what they're taking and

1364
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:23,679
people know what they're taking and
 

1365
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,159
people know what they're taking and
things like that and so on but I think

1366
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:26,169
things like that and so on but I think
 

1367
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,519
things like that and so on but I think
the underlying I do think that these two

1368
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:29,529
the underlying I do think that these two
 

1369
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:30,960
the underlying I do think that these two
companies are a little bit kind of

1370
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:30,970
companies are a little bit kind of
 

1371
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,680
companies are a little bit kind of
representing like babe of course that

1372
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:34,690
representing like babe of course that
 

1373
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,269
representing like babe of course that
you know one of them seems a bit safer

1374
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:36,279
you know one of them seems a bit safer
 

1375
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:38,820
you know one of them seems a bit safer
the other one or you know whatever the

1376
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:38,830
the other one or you know whatever the
 

1377
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,529
the other one or you know whatever the
objective for that is and the other one

1378
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:40,539
objective for that is and the other one
 

1379
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,149
objective for that is and the other one
seems more aggressive or whatever the

1380
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
seems more aggressive or whatever the
 

1381
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,399
seems more aggressive or whatever the
ejector for that is but but I think you

1382
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:44,409
ejector for that is but but I think you
 

1383
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,049
ejector for that is but but I think you
know when you turn the tables they're

1384
00:26:46,049 --> 00:26:46,059
know when you turn the tables they're
 

1385
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:47,549
know when you turn the tables they're
actually they're two other orthogonal

1386
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:47,559
actually they're two other orthogonal
 

1387
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,289
actually they're two other orthogonal
dimensions that these two are focusing

1388
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:49,299
dimensions that these two are focusing
 

1389
00:26:49,299 --> 00:26:51,899
dimensions that these two are focusing
on on the one hand for remo I can see

1390
00:26:51,899 --> 00:26:51,909
on on the one hand for remo I can see
 

1391
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,690
on on the one hand for remo I can see
that you know they're I mean they I

1392
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:54,700
that you know they're I mean they I
 

1393
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,039
that you know they're I mean they I
think they're a little bit see it as

1394
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:56,049
think they're a little bit see it as
 

1395
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:58,019
think they're a little bit see it as
research as well so they kind of they

1396
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:58,029
research as well so they kind of they
 

1397
00:26:58,029 --> 00:26:59,039
research as well so they kind of they
don't I'm not sure if they're like

1398
00:26:59,039 --> 00:26:59,049
don't I'm not sure if they're like
 

1399
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:01,159
don't I'm not sure if they're like
really interested in like an immediate

1400
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:01,169
really interested in like an immediate
 

1401
00:27:01,169 --> 00:27:05,570
really interested in like an immediate
product you know they talk about it

1402
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:05,580
product you know they talk about it
 

1403
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,740
product you know they talk about it
sometimes there's some pressure to talk

1404
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:07,750
sometimes there's some pressure to talk
 

1405
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,779
sometimes there's some pressure to talk
about it so they kind of go for it but I

1406
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:09,789
about it so they kind of go for it but I
 

1407
00:27:09,789 --> 00:27:12,799
about it so they kind of go for it but I
think I think that they're thinking

1408
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:12,809
think I think that they're thinking
 

1409
00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:14,850
think I think that they're thinking
maybe in the back of their minds maybe

1410
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:14,860
maybe in the back of their minds maybe
 

1411
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,289
maybe in the back of their minds maybe
they don't put it this way but I think

1412
00:27:16,289 --> 00:27:16,299
they don't put it this way but I think
 

1413
00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:18,419
they don't put it this way but I think
they they realize that we're building

1414
00:27:18,419 --> 00:27:18,429
they they realize that we're building
 

1415
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,820
they they realize that we're building
like a new engine it's kind of like call

1416
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:20,830
like a new engine it's kind of like call
 

1417
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,919
like a new engine it's kind of like call
it the AI engine or whatever that is and

1418
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:22,929
it the AI engine or whatever that is and
 

1419
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,350
it the AI engine or whatever that is and
you know an autonomous vehicles is a

1420
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,360
you know an autonomous vehicles is a
 

1421
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,909
you know an autonomous vehicles is a
very interesting embodiment of that

1422
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:26,919
very interesting embodiment of that
 

1423
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:29,070
very interesting embodiment of that
engine that allows you to understand

1424
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:29,080
engine that allows you to understand
 

1425
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,049
engine that allows you to understand
where the ego vehicle is the ego thing

1426
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:31,059
where the ego vehicle is the ego thing
 

1427
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,000
where the ego vehicle is the ego thing
is where everything else is what

1428
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,010
is where everything else is what
 

1429
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:34,830
is where everything else is what
everything else is gonna do and how do

1430
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:34,840
everything else is gonna do and how do
 

1431
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,930
everything else is gonna do and how do
you react how do you actually you know

1432
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:36,940
you react how do you actually you know
 

1433
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,730
you react how do you actually you know
interact with humans the right way how

1434
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:38,740
interact with humans the right way how
 

1435
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,169
interact with humans the right way how
do you build these systems and I think

1436
00:27:40,169 --> 00:27:40,179
do you build these systems and I think
 

1437
00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:42,240
do you build these systems and I think
they want to know that they want to

1438
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:42,250
they want to know that they want to
 

1439
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,039
they want to know that they want to
understand that and so they keep going

1440
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:44,049
understand that and so they keep going
 

1441
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:46,259
understand that and so they keep going
and doing that and so on the other

1442
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:46,269
and doing that and so on the other
 

1443
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,820
and doing that and so on the other
dimension Tesla is doing something

1444
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:47,830
dimension Tesla is doing something
 

1445
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,200
dimension Tesla is doing something
interesting I mean I think that they

1446
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:49,210
interesting I mean I think that they
 

1447
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:51,480
interesting I mean I think that they
have a good product people use it think

1448
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:51,490
have a good product people use it think
 

1449
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,009
have a good product people use it think
that you know like it's not for me

1450
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:53,019
that you know like it's not for me
 

1451
00:27:53,019 --> 00:27:55,620
that you know like it's not for me
but I can totally see people people like

1452
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:55,630
but I can totally see people people like
 

1453
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,750
but I can totally see people people like
it and and people I think they have a

1454
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:57,760
it and and people I think they have a
 

1455
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,399
it and and people I think they have a
good product outside of automation but I

1456
00:27:59,399 --> 00:27:59,409
good product outside of automation but I
 

1457
00:27:59,409 --> 00:28:01,710
good product outside of automation but I
was just referring to the the automation

1458
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:01,720
was just referring to the the automation
 

1459
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,769
was just referring to the the automation
itself I mean you know like it kind of

1460
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:04,779
itself I mean you know like it kind of
 

1461
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:06,629
itself I mean you know like it kind of
drives itself you still have to be kind

1462
00:28:06,629 --> 00:28:06,639
drives itself you still have to be kind
 

1463
00:28:06,639 --> 00:28:09,210
drives itself you still have to be kind
of you still have to pay attention to it

1464
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:09,220
of you still have to pay attention to it
 

1465
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:12,600
of you still have to pay attention to it
right you know people seem to use it so

1466
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:12,610
right you know people seem to use it so
 

1467
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,060
right you know people seem to use it so
it works for something and so people I

1468
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,070
it works for something and so people I
 

1469
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:16,379
it works for something and so people I
think people are willing to pay for it

1470
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:16,389
think people are willing to pay for it
 

1471
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:18,149
think people are willing to pay for it
people are willing to buy it I think it

1472
00:28:18,149 --> 00:28:18,159
people are willing to buy it I think it
 

1473
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,700
people are willing to buy it I think it
it's it's one of the other reasons why

1474
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:20,710
it's it's one of the other reasons why
 

1475
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:22,320
it's it's one of the other reasons why
people buy a Tesla car

1476
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,330
people buy a Tesla car
 

1477
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,330
people buy a Tesla car
maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk

1478
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:24,340
maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk
 

1479
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,279
maybe one of those reasons is Elon Musk
is the CEO and you know he seems like a

1480
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:26,289
is the CEO and you know he seems like a
 

1481
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:27,450
is the CEO and you know he seems like a
visionary person that's what people

1482
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:27,460
visionary person that's what people
 

1483
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,740
visionary person that's what people
think you know it seems like a visionary

1484
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:28,750
think you know it seems like a visionary
 

1485
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,930
think you know it seems like a visionary
person and so it adds like 5k to the

1486
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:30,940
person and so it adds like 5k to the
 

1487
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,730
person and so it adds like 5k to the
value of the car and then maybe another

1488
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:32,740
value of the car and then maybe another
 

1489
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,740
value of the car and then maybe another
5k is the autopilot and and you know

1490
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:34,750
5k is the autopilot and and you know
 

1491
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,759
5k is the autopilot and and you know
it's it's useful

1492
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:35,769
it's it's useful
 

1493
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:39,480
it's it's useful
I mean it's useful in the sense that

1494
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,490
I mean it's useful in the sense that
 

1495
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,240
I mean it's useful in the sense that
like people are using it and so III can

1496
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:42,250
like people are using it and so III can
 

1497
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:44,730
like people are using it and so III can
see Tesla and sure of course they want

1498
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:44,740
see Tesla and sure of course they want
 

1499
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,200
see Tesla and sure of course they want
to be visionary they want to kind of put

1500
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:46,210
to be visionary they want to kind of put
 

1501
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,279
to be visionary they want to kind of put
out a certain approach and they may

1502
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:47,289
out a certain approach and they may
 

1503
00:28:47,289 --> 00:28:50,009
out a certain approach and they may
actually get there but I think that

1504
00:28:50,009 --> 00:28:50,019
actually get there but I think that
 

1505
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:53,669
actually get there but I think that
there's also a primary benefit of doing

1506
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:53,679
there's also a primary benefit of doing
 

1507
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,110
there's also a primary benefit of doing
all these updates and rolling it out

1508
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,120
all these updates and rolling it out
 

1509
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,149
all these updates and rolling it out
because you know people pay for it and

1510
00:28:57,149 --> 00:28:57,159
because you know people pay for it and
 

1511
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,940
because you know people pay for it and
it's it's your home it's basic you know

1512
00:28:59,940 --> 00:28:59,950
it's it's your home it's basic you know
 

1513
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:03,509
it's it's your home it's basic you know
demand supply market and people like it

1514
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:03,519
demand supply market and people like it
 

1515
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:05,909
demand supply market and people like it
they're happy to pay another 5k 10k for

1516
00:29:05,909 --> 00:29:05,919
they're happy to pay another 5k 10k for
 

1517
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,690
they're happy to pay another 5k 10k for
that novelty or whatever that is they

1518
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:09,700
that novelty or whatever that is they
 

1519
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,399
that novelty or whatever that is they
and they use it it's not like they get

1520
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:11,409
and they use it it's not like they get
 

1521
00:29:11,409 --> 00:29:12,899
and they use it it's not like they get
it and they try it a couple times it's a

1522
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:12,909
it and they try it a couple times it's a
 

1523
00:29:12,909 --> 00:29:14,789
it and they try it a couple times it's a
novelty but they use it a lot of the

1524
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:14,799
novelty but they use it a lot of the
 

1525
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,519
novelty but they use it a lot of the
time and so I think that's what Tesla is

1526
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:17,529
time and so I think that's what Tesla is
 

1527
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,450
time and so I think that's what Tesla is
doing it's actually pretty different

1528
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:18,460
doing it's actually pretty different
 

1529
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,039
doing it's actually pretty different
like they are on pretty orthogonal

1530
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:20,049
like they are on pretty orthogonal
 

1531
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,080
like they are on pretty orthogonal
dimensions of what kind of things that

1532
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,090
dimensions of what kind of things that
 

1533
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,879
dimensions of what kind of things that
they're building they are using the same

1534
00:29:23,879 --> 00:29:23,889
they're building they are using the same
 

1535
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,370
they're building they are using the same
AI engine so it's very possible that you

1536
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:26,380
AI engine so it's very possible that you
 

1537
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,490
AI engine so it's very possible that you
know they're both gonna be sort of one

1538
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:29,500
know they're both gonna be sort of one
 

1539
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,029
know they're both gonna be sort of one
day kind of using a similar almost like

1540
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:33,039
day kind of using a similar almost like
 

1541
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,860
day kind of using a similar almost like
an internal internal combustion engine

1542
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:34,870
an internal internal combustion engine
 

1543
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:37,620
an internal internal combustion engine
it's a very bad metaphor but similar

1544
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:37,630
it's a very bad metaphor but similar
 

1545
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,480
it's a very bad metaphor but similar
internal combustion engine and maybe one

1546
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,490
internal combustion engine and maybe one
 

1547
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,340
internal combustion engine and maybe one
of them is building like a car the other

1548
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:41,350
of them is building like a car the other
 

1549
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:43,019
of them is building like a car the other
one is building a truck or something so

1550
00:29:43,019 --> 00:29:43,029
one is building a truck or something so
 

1551
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:44,279
one is building a truck or something so
ultimately the use case is very

1552
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:44,289
ultimately the use case is very
 

1553
00:29:44,289 --> 00:29:47,310
ultimately the use case is very
different so you like I said or one of

1554
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:47,320
different so you like I said or one of
 

1555
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,779
different so you like I said or one of
the founders of Optimus rad let's take a

1556
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:48,789
the founders of Optimus rad let's take a
 

1557
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,330
the founders of Optimus rad let's take a
step back it's one of the success

1558
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:51,340
step back it's one of the success
 

1559
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,279
step back it's one of the success
stories in the autonomous vehicle space

1560
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:53,289
stories in the autonomous vehicle space
 

1561
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:55,710
stories in the autonomous vehicle space
it's a great attack vehicle company

1562
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:55,720
it's a great attack vehicle company
 

1563
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,529
it's a great attack vehicle company
let's go from the very beginning what

1564
00:29:58,529 --> 00:29:58,539
let's go from the very beginning what
 

1565
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:00,720
let's go from the very beginning what
does it take to start autonomous vehicle

1566
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:00,730
does it take to start autonomous vehicle
 

1567
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:03,269
does it take to start autonomous vehicle
company how do you go from idea to

1568
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:03,279
company how do you go from idea to
 

1569
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,220
company how do you go from idea to
deploying vehicles like you are and a

1570
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:05,230
deploying vehicles like you are and a
 

1571
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,230
deploying vehicles like you are and a
few a bunch of places including New York

1572
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:07,240
few a bunch of places including New York
 

1573
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,019
few a bunch of places including New York
I would say that I think that you know

1574
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:10,029
I would say that I think that you know
 

1575
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:11,879
I would say that I think that you know
what happened to us is it was was the

1576
00:30:11,879 --> 00:30:11,889
what happened to us is it was was the
 

1577
00:30:11,889 --> 00:30:15,419
what happened to us is it was was the
following I think we've realized a lot

1578
00:30:15,419 --> 00:30:15,429
following I think we've realized a lot
 

1579
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:17,279
following I think we've realized a lot
of kind of talk in the autonomous

1580
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:17,289
of kind of talk in the autonomous
 

1581
00:30:17,289 --> 00:30:19,950
of kind of talk in the autonomous
vehicle industry back in like 2014 even

1582
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:19,960
vehicle industry back in like 2014 even
 

1583
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,730
vehicle industry back in like 2014 even
when we wanted to kind of get started

1584
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:22,740
when we wanted to kind of get started
 

1585
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,360
when we wanted to kind of get started
and I don't know like I kind of I would

1586
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:27,370
and I don't know like I kind of I would
 

1587
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:29,039
and I don't know like I kind of I would
hear things like fully autonomous

1588
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:29,049
hear things like fully autonomous
 

1589
00:30:29,049 --> 00:30:30,659
hear things like fully autonomous
vehicles two years from now three years

1590
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:30,669
vehicles two years from now three years
 

1591
00:30:30,669 --> 00:30:33,870
vehicles two years from now three years
from now I kind of never bought it you

1592
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:33,880
from now I kind of never bought it you
 

1593
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,150
from now I kind of never bought it you
know I was a part of MIT zorbing Channel

1594
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:36,160
know I was a part of MIT zorbing Channel
 

1595
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,060
know I was a part of MIT zorbing Channel
Gentry it kind of like it has an

1596
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,070
Gentry it kind of like it has an
 

1597
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:42,480
Gentry it kind of like it has an
interesting history so I did in college

1598
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:42,490
interesting history so I did in college
 

1599
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:44,700
interesting history so I did in college
and in high school sort of a lot of

1600
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:44,710
and in high school sort of a lot of
 

1601
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,250
and in high school sort of a lot of
mathematically oriented work and I think

1602
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:47,260
mathematically oriented work and I think
 

1603
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,580
mathematically oriented work and I think
I kind of you know at some point it kind

1604
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:50,590
I kind of you know at some point it kind
 

1605
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,630
I kind of you know at some point it kind
of hit me I wanted to build something

1606
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:51,640
of hit me I wanted to build something
 

1607
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,720
of hit me I wanted to build something
and so I came to MIT mechanical

1608
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:54,730
and so I came to MIT mechanical
 

1609
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,640
and so I came to MIT mechanical
engineering program and I now realize I

1610
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:56,650
engineering program and I now realize I
 

1611
00:30:56,650 --> 00:30:58,710
engineering program and I now realize I
think my advisor hired me because I

1612
00:30:58,710 --> 00:30:58,720
think my advisor hired me because I
 

1613
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,660
think my advisor hired me because I
could do like really good math but I

1614
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,670
could do like really good math but I
 

1615
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,580
could do like really good math but I
told him that no no no I want to work on

1616
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:02,590
told him that no no no I want to work on
 

1617
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,890
told him that no no no I want to work on
that urban challenge car I want to build

1618
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:04,900
that urban challenge car I want to build
 

1619
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,200
that urban challenge car I want to build
the autonomous car and I think that was

1620
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:07,210
the autonomous car and I think that was
 

1621
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:08,730
the autonomous car and I think that was
that was kind of like a process why we

1622
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:08,740
that was kind of like a process why we
 

1623
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,560
that was kind of like a process why we
really learned I mean what the

1624
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:10,570
really learned I mean what the
 

1625
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:12,300
really learned I mean what the
challenges are and and what kind of

1626
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:12,310
challenges are and and what kind of
 

1627
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,550
challenges are and and what kind of
limitations are we up against you know

1628
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:14,560
limitations are we up against you know
 

1629
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,700
limitations are we up against you know
like having the limitations of computers

1630
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:17,710
like having the limitations of computers
 

1631
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,800
like having the limitations of computers
or understanding human behavior there's

1632
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:19,810
or understanding human behavior there's
 

1633
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:22,500
or understanding human behavior there's
so many of these things and I think it's

1634
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:22,510
so many of these things and I think it's
 

1635
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,140
so many of these things and I think it's
just kind of didn't and so so we said

1636
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:25,150
just kind of didn't and so so we said
 

1637
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,750
just kind of didn't and so so we said
hey you know like why don't we take a

1638
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:27,760
hey you know like why don't we take a
 

1639
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,580
hey you know like why don't we take a
more like a market-based approach so we

1640
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:29,590
more like a market-based approach so we
 

1641
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:32,670
more like a market-based approach so we
focus on a certain kind of market and we

1642
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:32,680
focus on a certain kind of market and we
 

1643
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,160
focus on a certain kind of market and we
build a system for that what we're

1644
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:35,170
build a system for that what we're
 

1645
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,600
build a system for that what we're
building is not so much of like an

1646
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:36,610
building is not so much of like an
 

1647
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,850
building is not so much of like an
autonomous vehicle only I would say so

1648
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:38,860
autonomous vehicle only I would say so
 

1649
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,000
autonomous vehicle only I would say so
we build full autonomy into the vehicles

1650
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,010
we build full autonomy into the vehicles
 

1651
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,260
we build full autonomy into the vehicles
but you know the way we kind of see it

1652
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:43,270
but you know the way we kind of see it
 

1653
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,260
but you know the way we kind of see it
is that we think that the approach

1654
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:46,270
is that we think that the approach
 

1655
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,650
is that we think that the approach
should actually involve humans operating

1656
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:49,660
should actually involve humans operating
 

1657
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,840
should actually involve humans operating
that not just just not sitting in the

1658
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:51,850
that not just just not sitting in the
 

1659
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,360
that not just just not sitting in the
vehicle and I think today what we have

1660
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:54,370
vehicle and I think today what we have
 

1661
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,720
vehicle and I think today what we have
is today we have one person operate one

1662
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:57,730
is today we have one person operate one
 

1663
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,030
is today we have one person operate one
vehicle no matter what that vehicle it

1664
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,040
vehicle no matter what that vehicle it
 

1665
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,100
vehicle no matter what that vehicle it
could be a forklift it could be a truck

1666
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,110
could be a forklift it could be a truck
 

1667
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,990
could be a forklift it could be a truck
it could be a car whatever that is and

1668
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:04,000
it could be a car whatever that is and
 

1669
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,470
it could be a car whatever that is and
we want to go from that to ten people

1670
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:07,480
we want to go from that to ten people
 

1671
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,040
we want to go from that to ten people
operate 50 vehicles how do we do that

1672
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:10,050
operate 50 vehicles how do we do that
 

1673
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,990
operate 50 vehicles how do we do that
you're referring to a world of maybe

1674
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,000
you're referring to a world of maybe
 

1675
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,230
you're referring to a world of maybe
perhaps teleoperation so can you just

1676
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:16,240
perhaps teleoperation so can you just
 

1677
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,210
perhaps teleoperation so can you just
say what it means for 10 might be

1678
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:18,220
say what it means for 10 might be
 

1679
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,830
say what it means for 10 might be
confusing for people listening what does

1680
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:19,840
confusing for people listening what does
 

1681
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,600
confusing for people listening what does
it mean for ten people to control 50

1682
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:21,610
it mean for ten people to control 50
 

1683
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:24,060
it mean for ten people to control 50
vehicles that's a good point so I think

1684
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:24,070
vehicles that's a good point so I think
 

1685
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,120
vehicles that's a good point so I think
it's am I very deliberately didn't call

1686
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:27,130
it's am I very deliberately didn't call
 

1687
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,440
it's am I very deliberately didn't call
it a law operation because people what

1688
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,450
it a law operation because people what
 

1689
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,190
it a law operation because people what
people think then is that people think

1690
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:31,200
people think then is that people think
 

1691
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,680
people think then is that people think
away from the vehicle sits a person sees

1692
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:34,690
away from the vehicle sits a person sees
 

1693
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,720
away from the vehicle sits a person sees
like maybe put some goggles or something

1694
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:36,730
like maybe put some goggles or something
 

1695
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,270
like maybe put some goggles or something
ER and drives the car so that's not at

1696
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:39,280
ER and drives the car so that's not at
 

1697
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,280
ER and drives the car so that's not at
all what we need but we mean the kind of

1698
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:41,290
all what we need but we mean the kind of
 

1699
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,780
all what we need but we mean the kind of
intelligence bye-bye

1700
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:42,790
intelligence bye-bye
 

1701
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:46,320
intelligence bye-bye
humans are in control except in certain

1702
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,330
humans are in control except in certain
 

1703
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:48,450
humans are in control except in certain
places the vehicles can execute on their

1704
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:48,460
places the vehicles can execute on their
 

1705
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,440
places the vehicles can execute on their
own and so imagine

1706
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:50,450
own and so imagine
 

1707
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,050
own and so imagine
like like a room where people can see

1708
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:53,060
like like a room where people can see
 

1709
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,030
like like a room where people can see
what the other vehicles are doing and

1710
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,040
what the other vehicles are doing and
 

1711
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,610
what the other vehicles are doing and
everything and you know there will be

1712
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:57,620
everything and you know there will be
 

1713
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,980
everything and you know there will be
some people who are more like more like

1714
00:32:59,980 --> 00:32:59,990
some people who are more like more like
 

1715
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,020
some people who are more like more like
air traffic controllers call them like

1716
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:02,030
air traffic controllers call them like
 

1717
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,270
air traffic controllers call them like
AV controllers yeah

1718
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:04,280
AV controllers yeah
 

1719
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:05,800
AV controllers yeah
and so these AV controllers would

1720
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:05,810
and so these AV controllers would
 

1721
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,870
and so these AV controllers would
actually see kind of like like a whole

1722
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:07,880
actually see kind of like like a whole
 

1723
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,940
actually see kind of like like a whole
map and they would understand where

1724
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:09,950
map and they would understand where
 

1725
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,760
map and they would understand where
vehicles are really confident and where

1726
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:12,770
vehicles are really confident and where
 

1727
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,280
vehicles are really confident and where
they kind of you know need a little bit

1728
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:15,290
they kind of you know need a little bit
 

1729
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:18,160
they kind of you know need a little bit
more help and the help shouldn't be for

1730
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,170
more help and the help shouldn't be for
 

1731
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,230
more help and the help shouldn't be for
safety how it should be for efficiency

1732
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:20,240
safety how it should be for efficiency
 

1733
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,690
safety how it should be for efficiency
vehicles should be safe no matter what

1734
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:22,700
vehicles should be safe no matter what
 

1735
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,700
vehicles should be safe no matter what
if you had zero people they could be

1736
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:24,710
if you had zero people they could be
 

1737
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:26,470
if you had zero people they could be
very safe but they be going five miles

1738
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:26,480
very safe but they be going five miles
 

1739
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,780
very safe but they be going five miles
an hour and so if you want them to go

1740
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:28,790
an hour and so if you want them to go
 

1741
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,670
an hour and so if you want them to go
around 25 miles an hour then you need

1742
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:30,680
around 25 miles an hour then you need
 

1743
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,160
around 25 miles an hour then you need
people to come in and and for example

1744
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,170
people to come in and and for example
 

1745
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,750
people to come in and and for example
you know the vehicle come to an

1746
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:34,760
you know the vehicle come to an
 

1747
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:38,650
you know the vehicle come to an
intersection and the vehicle can say you

1748
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:38,660
intersection and the vehicle can say you
 

1749
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,610
intersection and the vehicle can say you
know I can wait

1750
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:39,620
know I can wait
 

1751
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,920
know I can wait
I can inch forward a little bit show my

1752
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:41,930
I can inch forward a little bit show my
 

1753
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,490
I can inch forward a little bit show my
intent or I can turn left and right now

1754
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:45,500
intent or I can turn left and right now
 

1755
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,830
intent or I can turn left and right now
it's clear I can turn I know that but

1756
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:47,840
it's clear I can turn I know that but
 

1757
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,440
it's clear I can turn I know that but
before you give me the go I won't and so

1758
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,450
before you give me the go I won't and so
 

1759
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,420
before you give me the go I won't and so
that's one example this doesn't mean

1760
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:52,430
that's one example this doesn't mean
 

1761
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:53,920
that's one example this doesn't mean
necessarily we're doing that actually I

1762
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:53,930
necessarily we're doing that actually I
 

1763
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,900
necessarily we're doing that actually I
think I think if you go down all them

1764
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:55,910
think I think if you go down all them
 

1765
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:58,630
think I think if you go down all them
all that much detail that every

1766
00:33:58,630 --> 00:33:58,640
all that much detail that every
 

1767
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,000
all that much detail that every
intersection you're kind of expecting a

1768
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:01,010
intersection you're kind of expecting a
 

1769
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,920
intersection you're kind of expecting a
person to press a button then I don't

1770
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:02,930
person to press a button then I don't
 

1771
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:04,330
person to press a button then I don't
think you'll get the efficiency benefits

1772
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:04,340
think you'll get the efficiency benefits
 

1773
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,190
think you'll get the efficiency benefits
you want you need to be able to kind of

1774
00:34:06,190 --> 00:34:06,200
you want you need to be able to kind of
 

1775
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,690
you want you need to be able to kind of
go around and be able to do these things

1776
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:07,700
go around and be able to do these things
 

1777
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,580
go around and be able to do these things
but but I think you need people to be

1778
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:09,590
but but I think you need people to be
 

1779
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,890
but but I think you need people to be
able to set high level behavior to

1780
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:11,900
able to set high level behavior to
 

1781
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,150
able to set high level behavior to
vehicles that's the other thing with

1782
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:13,160
vehicles that's the other thing with
 

1783
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:14,410
vehicles that's the other thing with
autonomous vehicles you know I think a

1784
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:14,420
autonomous vehicles you know I think a
 

1785
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,730
autonomous vehicles you know I think a
lot of people kind of think about it as

1786
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:15,740
lot of people kind of think about it as
 

1787
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,260
lot of people kind of think about it as
follows I mean this happens with

1788
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:17,270
follows I mean this happens with
 

1789
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:18,670
follows I mean this happens with
technology a lot you know you think

1790
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:18,680
technology a lot you know you think
 

1791
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,360
technology a lot you know you think
alright so I know about cars and I heard

1792
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:22,370
alright so I know about cars and I heard
 

1793
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,970
alright so I know about cars and I heard
robots so I think how this is gonna work

1794
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:24,980
robots so I think how this is gonna work
 

1795
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,700
robots so I think how this is gonna work
out is that I'm gonna buy a car press a

1796
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:27,710
out is that I'm gonna buy a car press a
 

1797
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,710
out is that I'm gonna buy a car press a
button and it's gonna drive itself and

1798
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:29,720
button and it's gonna drive itself and
 

1799
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,630
button and it's gonna drive itself and
when is that gonna happen you know and

1800
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:31,640
when is that gonna happen you know and
 

1801
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,340
when is that gonna happen you know and
people kind of tend to think about it

1802
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,350
people kind of tend to think about it
 

1803
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,450
people kind of tend to think about it
that way but when you think about what

1804
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:34,460
that way but when you think about what
 

1805
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,730
that way but when you think about what
really happens is that something comes

1806
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:36,740
really happens is that something comes
 

1807
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:39,000
really happens is that something comes
in in a way that you didn't even expect

1808
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,010
in in a way that you didn't even expect
 

1809
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,010
in in a way that you didn't even expect
if asked you might have said I don't

1810
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,020
if asked you might have said I don't
 

1811
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,630
if asked you might have said I don't
think I need that or I don't think it

1812
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:43,640
think I need that or I don't think it
 

1813
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,820
think I need that or I don't think it
should be that and so on and then and

1814
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:45,830
should be that and so on and then and
 

1815
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,740
should be that and so on and then and
then that that becomes the next big

1816
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:47,750
then that that becomes the next big
 

1817
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:49,990
then that that becomes the next big
thing coding code and so I think that

1818
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:50,000
thing coding code and so I think that
 

1819
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,930
thing coding code and so I think that
this kind of different ways of humans

1820
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:52,940
this kind of different ways of humans
 

1821
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,670
this kind of different ways of humans
operating vehicles could be really

1822
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:54,680
operating vehicles could be really
 

1823
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:57,730
operating vehicles could be really
powerful I think that sooner than then

1824
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:57,740
powerful I think that sooner than then
 

1825
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:00,100
powerful I think that sooner than then
later we might open our eyes up to a

1826
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,110
later we might open our eyes up to a
 

1827
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:02,380
later we might open our eyes up to a
world in which you go around walk in a

1828
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:02,390
world in which you go around walk in a
 

1829
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:04,380
world in which you go around walk in a
mall and there's a bunch of security

1830
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:04,390
mall and there's a bunch of security
 

1831
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,660
mall and there's a bunch of security
they're exactly operated in this way you

1832
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:06,670
they're exactly operated in this way you
 

1833
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,519
they're exactly operated in this way you
go into a factory or a warehouse there's

1834
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:08,529
go into a factory or a warehouse there's
 

1835
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:09,930
go into a factory or a warehouse there's
a whole bunch of robots they're pretty

1836
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:09,940
a whole bunch of robots they're pretty
 

1837
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,799
a whole bunch of robots they're pretty
exactly in this way you go to a you go

1838
00:35:13,799 --> 00:35:13,809
exactly in this way you go to a you go
 

1839
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,660
exactly in this way you go to a you go
to the Brooklyn Navy Yard you see a

1840
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:15,670
to the Brooklyn Navy Yard you see a
 

1841
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,859
to the Brooklyn Navy Yard you see a
whole bunch of autonomous vehicles

1842
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:16,869
whole bunch of autonomous vehicles
 

1843
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:19,230
whole bunch of autonomous vehicles
Optimus right and they're operated maybe

1844
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,240
Optimus right and they're operated maybe
 

1845
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,779
Optimus right and they're operated maybe
in this way yes but I think people kind

1846
00:35:21,779 --> 00:35:21,789
in this way yes but I think people kind
 

1847
00:35:21,789 --> 00:35:23,700
in this way yes but I think people kind
of don't see that III sincerely think

1848
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:23,710
of don't see that III sincerely think
 

1849
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:24,920
of don't see that III sincerely think
that it's it's there's a possibility

1850
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:24,930
that it's it's there's a possibility
 

1851
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,809
that it's it's there's a possibility
that we may almost see like like a whole

1852
00:35:27,809 --> 00:35:27,819
that we may almost see like like a whole
 

1853
00:35:27,819 --> 00:35:30,599
that we may almost see like like a whole
mushrooming of this technology in all

1854
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:30,609
mushrooming of this technology in all
 

1855
00:35:30,609 --> 00:35:32,490
mushrooming of this technology in all
kinds of places that we didn't expect

1856
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:32,500
kinds of places that we didn't expect
 

1857
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,759
kinds of places that we didn't expect
before and then maybe the real surprise

1858
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:34,769
before and then maybe the real surprise
 

1859
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:37,829
before and then maybe the real surprise
and then one day when your car actually

1860
00:35:37,829 --> 00:35:37,839
and then one day when your car actually
 

1861
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,660
and then one day when your car actually
drives itself it may not be all that

1862
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:39,670
drives itself it may not be all that
 

1863
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,829
drives itself it may not be all that
much of a surprise at all

1864
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:40,839
much of a surprise at all
 

1865
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,420
much of a surprise at all
because you see it all the time you

1866
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:42,430
because you see it all the time you
 

1867
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,579
because you see it all the time you
interact with them you take the Optimus

1868
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:44,589
interact with them you take the Optimus
 

1869
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,490
interact with them you take the Optimus
ride hopefully that's your choice and

1870
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:47,500
ride hopefully that's your choice and
 

1871
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,950
ride hopefully that's your choice and
then you know you you hear a bunch of

1872
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:49,960
then you know you you hear a bunch of
 

1873
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,539
then you know you you hear a bunch of
things you go around you in your act

1874
00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:51,549
things you go around you in your act
 

1875
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,039
things you go around you in your act
with them I don't know like you have a

1876
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:53,049
with them I don't know like you have a
 

1877
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,779
with them I don't know like you have a
little delivery vehicle that goes around

1878
00:35:54,779 --> 00:35:54,789
little delivery vehicle that goes around
 

1879
00:35:54,789 --> 00:35:56,670
little delivery vehicle that goes around
the sidewalks and delivers you things

1880
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:56,680
the sidewalks and delivers you things
 

1881
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,170
the sidewalks and delivers you things
and then you take it it says thank you

1882
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,180
and then you take it it says thank you
 

1883
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:01,349
and then you take it it says thank you
and then you get used to that and one

1884
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:01,359
and then you get used to that and one
 

1885
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,779
and then you get used to that and one
day your car actually drives itself and

1886
00:36:03,779 --> 00:36:03,789
day your car actually drives itself and
 

1887
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:05,670
day your car actually drives itself and
the regulation goes by and you know you

1888
00:36:05,670 --> 00:36:05,680
the regulation goes by and you know you
 

1889
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,620
the regulation goes by and you know you
can hit the button asleep and it

1890
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:07,630
can hit the button asleep and it
 

1891
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,789
can hit the button asleep and it
wouldn't be a surprise at all I think

1892
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:08,799
wouldn't be a surprise at all I think
 

1893
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,039
wouldn't be a surprise at all I think
that maybe the real reality so there's

1894
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:11,049
that maybe the real reality so there's
 

1895
00:36:11,049 --> 00:36:12,870
that maybe the real reality so there's
gonna be a bunch of applications that

1896
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:12,880
gonna be a bunch of applications that
 

1897
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,490
gonna be a bunch of applications that
pop up around autonomous vehicles some

1898
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:17,500
pop up around autonomous vehicles some
 

1899
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,140
pop up around autonomous vehicles some
some of which maybe many of which we

1900
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,150
some of which maybe many of which we
 

1901
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:21,089
some of which maybe many of which we
don't expect at all so if we look at

1902
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:21,099
don't expect at all so if we look at
 

1903
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:24,150
don't expect at all so if we look at
Optimus ride what do you think you know

1904
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,160
Optimus ride what do you think you know
 

1905
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,660
Optimus ride what do you think you know
the viral application that the one that

1906
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:27,670
the viral application that the one that
 

1907
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:30,470
the viral application that the one that
like really works for people in mobility

1908
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:30,480
like really works for people in mobility
 

1909
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,059
like really works for people in mobility
what do you think optimus ride will

1910
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:33,069
what do you think optimus ride will
 

1911
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:35,579
what do you think optimus ride will
connect with in in in near future first

1912
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:35,589
connect with in in in near future first
 

1913
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,740
connect with in in in near future first
um I think that the first place is that

1914
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:37,750
um I think that the first place is that
 

1915
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:39,870
um I think that the first place is that
that I like the target honestly is like

1916
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:39,880
that I like the target honestly is like
 

1917
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:43,140
that I like the target honestly is like
these places where transportation is

1918
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:43,150
these places where transportation is
 

1919
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,999
these places where transportation is
required within an environment like

1920
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:45,009
required within an environment like
 

1921
00:36:45,009 --> 00:36:46,920
required within an environment like
people typically call a geofence so you

1922
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:46,930
people typically call a geofence so you
 

1923
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:49,049
people typically call a geofence so you
can imagine like a roughly two mile by

1924
00:36:49,049 --> 00:36:49,059
can imagine like a roughly two mile by
 

1925
00:36:49,059 --> 00:36:50,700
can imagine like a roughly two mile by
two mile could be bigger could be

1926
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:50,710
two mile could be bigger could be
 

1927
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,829
two mile could be bigger could be
smaller type of an environment and

1928
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:52,839
smaller type of an environment and
 

1929
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,269
smaller type of an environment and
there's a lot of these kinds of

1930
00:36:54,269 --> 00:36:54,279
there's a lot of these kinds of
 

1931
00:36:54,279 --> 00:36:55,170
there's a lot of these kinds of
environments they're typically

1932
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:55,180
environments they're typically
 

1933
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,690
environments they're typically
transportation deprived the Brooklyn

1934
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:57,700
transportation deprived the Brooklyn
 

1935
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,460
transportation deprived the Brooklyn
Navy Yard that you know we're in today

1936
00:36:59,460 --> 00:36:59,470
Navy Yard that you know we're in today
 

1937
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,230
Navy Yard that you know we're in today
we're in a few different places but

1938
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:01,240
we're in a few different places but
 

1939
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,599
we're in a few different places but
that's that was the one that was less

1940
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:03,609
that's that was the one that was less
 

1941
00:37:03,609 --> 00:37:06,269
that's that was the one that was less
publicized that's a good example so

1942
00:37:06,269 --> 00:37:06,279
publicized that's a good example so
 

1943
00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:07,799
publicized that's a good example so
there's not a lot of transportation

1944
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:07,809
there's not a lot of transportation
 

1945
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:10,170
there's not a lot of transportation
there and you wouldn't expect like I

1946
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:10,180
there and you wouldn't expect like I
 

1947
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,539
there and you wouldn't expect like I
don't know I think maybe operating an

1948
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:12,549
don't know I think maybe operating an
 

1949
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:14,849
don't know I think maybe operating an
uber there ends up being sort of a

1950
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:14,859
uber there ends up being sort of a
 

1951
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,009
uber there ends up being sort of a
little too expensive or when you compare

1952
00:37:17,009 --> 00:37:17,019
little too expensive or when you compare
 

1953
00:37:17,019 --> 00:37:19,590
little too expensive or when you compare
it with operating uber

1954
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:19,600
it with operating uber
 

1955
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,540
it with operating uber
that becomes the elsewhere becomes the

1956
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:21,550
that becomes the elsewhere becomes the
 

1957
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,190
that becomes the elsewhere becomes the
priority and these people whose place

1958
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:23,200
priority and these people whose place
 

1959
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,960
priority and these people whose place
has become totally transportation

1960
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:24,970
has become totally transportation
 

1961
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,120
has become totally transportation
deprived and then what happens is that

1962
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,130
deprived and then what happens is that
 

1963
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:28,500
deprived and then what happens is that
you know people drive into these places

1964
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:28,510
you know people drive into these places
 

1965
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:31,830
you know people drive into these places
and to go from point A to point B inside

1966
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:31,840
and to go from point A to point B inside
 

1967
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,780
and to go from point A to point B inside
this place within that day they use

1968
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:33,790
this place within that day they use
 

1969
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,150
this place within that day they use
their cars and so we end up building

1970
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:36,160
their cars and so we end up building
 

1971
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,970
their cars and so we end up building
more parking for them to for example

1972
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:38,980
more parking for them to for example
 

1973
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,590
more parking for them to for example
take their cars and go to the lunch

1974
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:40,600
take their cars and go to the lunch
 

1975
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,130
take their cars and go to the lunch
place and I think that one of the things

1976
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:44,140
place and I think that one of the things
 

1977
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,350
place and I think that one of the things
that can be done is that you know you

1978
00:37:46,350 --> 00:37:46,360
that can be done is that you know you
 

1979
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:50,250
that can be done is that you know you
can put in efficient safe sustainable

1980
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:50,260
can put in efficient safe sustainable
 

1981
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,200
can put in efficient safe sustainable
transportation systems into these types

1982
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:52,210
transportation systems into these types
 

1983
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,540
transportation systems into these types
of places first and I think that you

1984
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:54,550
of places first and I think that you
 

1985
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:56,670
of places first and I think that you
know you could deliver mobility in an

1986
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:56,680
know you could deliver mobility in an
 

1987
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,660
know you could deliver mobility in an
affordable way affordable accessible you

1988
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:00,670
affordable way affordable accessible you
 

1989
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:04,470
affordable way affordable accessible you
know sustainable way but I think what

1990
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
know sustainable way but I think what
 

1991
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,200
know sustainable way but I think what
also enables is that this kind of effort

1992
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,210
also enables is that this kind of effort
 

1993
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:10,350
also enables is that this kind of effort
money area land that we spend on parking

1994
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:10,360
money area land that we spend on parking
 

1995
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,110
money area land that we spend on parking
we could reclaim some of that and that

1996
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,120
we could reclaim some of that and that
 

1997
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,390
we could reclaim some of that and that
is on the order of like even for a small

1998
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:15,400
is on the order of like even for a small
 

1999
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,640
is on the order of like even for a small
environment like two mile by two mile it

2000
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:17,650
environment like two mile by two mile it
 

2001
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,900
environment like two mile by two mile it
doesn't have to be smack in the middle

2002
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:18,910
doesn't have to be smack in the middle
 

2003
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:22,050
doesn't have to be smack in the middle
of New York I mean anywhere else you're

2004
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,060
of New York I mean anywhere else you're
 

2005
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,730
of New York I mean anywhere else you're
talking tens of millions of dollars if

2006
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:23,740
talking tens of millions of dollars if
 

2007
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,780
talking tens of millions of dollars if
you're smack in the middle of New York

2008
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:24,790
you're smack in the middle of New York
 

2009
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:26,490
you're smack in the middle of New York
you're looking at billions of dollars of

2010
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:26,500
you're looking at billions of dollars of
 

2011
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,830
you're looking at billions of dollars of
savings just by doing that and that's

2012
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:28,840
savings just by doing that and that's
 

2013
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,210
savings just by doing that and that's
the economic part of it and there's a

2014
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:30,220
the economic part of it and there's a
 

2015
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,950
the economic part of it and there's a
societal part right I mean just look

2016
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:31,960
societal part right I mean just look
 

2017
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,520
societal part right I mean just look
around I mean the places that we live

2018
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:35,530
around I mean the places that we live
 

2019
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:38,910
around I mean the places that we live
are like built for cars it didn't look

2020
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:38,920
are like built for cars it didn't look
 

2021
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,800
are like built for cars it didn't look
like this just like a hundred years ago

2022
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:40,810
like this just like a hundred years ago
 

2023
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,140
like this just like a hundred years ago
like today no one walks in the middle of

2024
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,150
like today no one walks in the middle of
 

2025
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,080
like today no one walks in the middle of
the street it's four cars we no one

2026
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:46,090
the street it's four cars we no one
 

2027
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,060
the street it's four cars we no one
tells you that growing up but you grow

2028
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,070
tells you that growing up but you grow
 

2029
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:50,280
tells you that growing up but you grow
into that reality and so sometimes they

2030
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,290
into that reality and so sometimes they
 

2031
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:51,180
into that reality and so sometimes they
close the road

2032
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:51,190
close the road
 

2033
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,710
close the road
it happens here you know like the

2034
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:52,720
it happens here you know like the
 

2035
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,600
it happens here you know like the
celebration they close the road still

2036
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:54,610
celebration they close the road still
 

2037
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,040
celebration they close the road still
people don't walk in the middle of the

2038
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,050
people don't walk in the middle of the
 

2039
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,870
people don't walk in the middle of the
road like just walk in and people don't

2040
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:57,880
road like just walk in and people don't
 

2041
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,710
road like just walk in and people don't
but I think it has so much impact the

2042
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:01,720
but I think it has so much impact the
 

2043
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:04,050
but I think it has so much impact the
the car in in the space that we have and

2044
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:04,060
the car in in the space that we have and
 

2045
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,940
the car in in the space that we have and
and I think we talked about

2046
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:05,950
and I think we talked about
 

2047
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,710
and I think we talked about
sustainability livability I mean

2048
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:07,720
sustainability livability I mean
 

2049
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,900
sustainability livability I mean
ultimately these kinds of places that

2050
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:09,910
ultimately these kinds of places that
 

2051
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:11,850
ultimately these kinds of places that
parking spots at the very least could

2052
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:11,860
parking spots at the very least could
 

2053
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,530
parking spots at the very least could
change into something more useful or

2054
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:13,540
change into something more useful or
 

2055
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,720
change into something more useful or
maybe just like park areas recreational

2056
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:15,730
maybe just like park areas recreational
 

2057
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,280
maybe just like park areas recreational
and so I think that's the first thing

2058
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:17,290
and so I think that's the first thing
 

2059
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:19,860
and so I think that's the first thing
that that we're targeting and I think

2060
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:19,870
that that we're targeting and I think
 

2061
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,300
that that we're targeting and I think
that we're getting like a really good

2062
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:21,310
that we're getting like a really good
 

2063
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,640
that we're getting like a really good

point of view especially places that are

00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:25,900
point of view especially places that are
 

2067
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,030
point of view especially places that are
a little bit forward-looking

2068
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:27,040
a little bit forward-looking
 

2069
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,550
a little bit forward-looking
and like for example Brooklyn Navy Yard

2070
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:29,560
and like for example Brooklyn Navy Yard
 

2071
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,069
and like for example Brooklyn Navy Yard
they have tenants there

2072
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:31,079
they have tenants there

of like an Innovation Center there's a
 

2077
00:39:35,579 --> 00:39:37,370
of like an Innovation Center there's a
bunch of startups there and so you know

2078
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:37,380
bunch of startups there and so you know
 

2079
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:38,959
bunch of startups there and so you know
you get those kinds of people and you

00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:38,969
you get those kinds of people and you
 

2081
00:39:38,969 --> 00:39:40,359
you get those kinds of people and you
know that they're really interested in

2082
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:40,369
know that they're really interested in
 

2083
00:39:40,369 --> 00:39:43,069
know that they're really interested in
sort of making that environment more

2084
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:43,079
sort of making that environment more
 

2085
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,920
sort of making that environment more
livable and these kinds of solutions

00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:45,930
livable and these kinds of solutions

transportation deprived you know they

2094
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:53,969
transportation deprived you know they
 

2095
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:58,099
transportation deprived you know they
have they actually ran shuttles and so

2096
00:39:58,099 --> 00:39:58,109
have they actually ran shuttles and so
 

2097
00:39:58,109 --> 00:40:01,430
have they actually ran shuttles and so
you know you can ask anybody the shuttle

2098
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:01,440
you know you can ask anybody the shuttle

experience is like terrible people hate
 

2101
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,930
experience is like terrible people hate
shuttles and I can tell you why it's

2102
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:05,940
shuttles and I can tell you why it's
 

2103
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,049
shuttles and I can tell you why it's
because you know like the driver is very

2104
00:40:09,049 --> 00:40:09,059
because you know like the driver is very
 

2105
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,690
because you know like the driver is very
expensive in a shuttle business so what

2106
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:11,700
expensive in a shuttle business so what
 

2107
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,390
expensive in a shuttle business so what
makes sense is to attach 2030 seats to a

00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:14,400
makes sense is to attach 2030 seats to a
 

2109
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,489
makes sense is to attach 2030 seats to a
driver and a lot of people have this

00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:16,499
driver and a lot of people have this
 

2111
00:40:16,499 --> 00:40:17,989

give you like four seater six Cedars and

2118
00:40:22,819 --> 00:40:22,829
give you like four seater six Cedars and
 

2119
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,589
give you like four seater six Cedars and
we get asked like how about like twenty

2120
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:24,599
we get asked like how about like twenty
 

2121
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:26,180
we get asked like how about like twenty
Cedars like you know you don't need

2122
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,190
Cedars like you know you don't need
 

2123
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,519
Cedars like you know you don't need
twenty Cedars you want to split up those

2124
00:40:28,519 --> 00:40:28,529
twenty Cedars you want to split up those
 

2125
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:30,799
twenty Cedars you want to split up those
seeds so that they can travel faster and

2126
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:30,809
seeds so that they can travel faster and
 

2127
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:32,749
seeds so that they can travel faster and
the transportation delays would go down

2128
00:40:32,749 --> 00:40:32,759
the transportation delays would go down
 

2129
00:40:32,759 --> 00:40:34,999
the transportation delays would go down
that's what you want if you make it big

2130
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:35,009
that's what you want if you make it big
 

2131
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:37,370
that's what you want if you make it big
not only you will get delays in

2132
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:37,380
not only you will get delays in
 

2133
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,319
not only you will get delays in
transportation but you won't have an

2134
00:40:39,319 --> 00:40:39,329
transportation but you won't have an
 

2135
00:40:39,329 --> 00:40:41,449
transportation but you won't have an
agile vehicle it will take a long time

2136
00:40:41,449 --> 00:40:41,459
agile vehicle it will take a long time
 

2137
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:43,579
agile vehicle it will take a long time
to speed up slow down and so on

2138
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:43,589
to speed up slow down and so on
 

2139
00:40:43,589 --> 00:40:45,680
to speed up slow down and so on
it'll you need to climb up to the thing

2140
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:45,690
it'll you need to climb up to the thing
 

2141
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,209
it'll you need to climb up to the thing
so it's kind of like really hard to

2142
00:40:47,209 --> 00:40:47,219
so it's kind of like really hard to
 

2143
00:40:47,219 --> 00:40:49,819
so it's kind of like really hard to
interact with and scheduling too perhaps

2144
00:40:49,819 --> 00:40:49,829
interact with and scheduling too perhaps
 

2145
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:51,829
interact with and scheduling too perhaps
when you have more smaller vehicles

2146
00:40:51,829 --> 00:40:51,839
when you have more smaller vehicles
 

2147
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:54,709
when you have more smaller vehicles
because closer to BER where you can

2148

because closer to BER where you can
actually get a personal I mean just the

actually get a personal I mean just the
 

2151
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:59,269
actually get a personal I mean just the
logistics of getting the vehicle to you

2152

logistics of getting the vehicle to you
 

2153

it becomes easier when you have a giant

2154
00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:02,069
it becomes easier when you have a giant
 

2155
00:41:02,069 --> 00:41:04,430
it becomes easier when you have a giant
shadow there's fewer of them and it

the route you can still have but you can
 

2169
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,279
the route you can still have but you can
imagine you split up the seats and

imagine you split up the seats and
 

2171
00:41:19,289 --> 00:41:21,319

mean that your delays when you go out

2180
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:31,949
mean that your delays when you go out
 

2181
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:34,489

00:41:34,499 --> 00:41:35,660
you want wait for them for a long time
and that's one of the main reasons or

2184
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:35,670
and that's one of the main reasons or
 

2185
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,339
and that's one of the main reasons or
you don't have to climb up the other

2186
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:37,349
you don't have to climb up the other
 

2187
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:38,900
you don't have to climb up the other
thing is that I think if you split them

2188
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:38,910
thing is that I think if you split them
 

2189
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,989
thing is that I think if you split them
up in a nice way and if you can actually

2190
00:41:40,989 --> 00:41:40,999
up in a nice way and if you can actually
 

2191
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,309
up in a nice way and if you can actually
know where people are going to be

2192
00:41:43,309 --> 00:41:43,319
know where people are going to be
 

2193
00:41:43,319 --> 00:41:44,710
know where people are going to be
somehow

2194
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:44,720
somehow
 

2195
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,359
somehow
you don't even need the app a lot of

2196
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:46,369
you don't even need the app a lot of
 

2197
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:48,220
you don't even need the app a lot of
people ask us the app we say why don't

2198
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,230
people ask us the app we say why don't
 

2199
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:51,010
people ask us the app we say why don't
you just walk into the vehicle how about

2200
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:51,020
you just walk into the vehicle how about
 

2201
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:52,300
you just walk into the vehicle how about
you just walk into the vehicle it

2202
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:52,310
you just walk into the vehicle it
 

2203
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,470
you just walk into the vehicle it
recognizes who you are

2204
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:53,480
recognizes who you are
 

2205
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,060
recognizes who you are
and it gives you a bunch of options of

2206
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:55,070
and it gives you a bunch of options of
 

2207
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:56,620
and it gives you a bunch of options of
places that you go and you just kind of

2208
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,630
places that you go and you just kind of
 

2209
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,190
places that you go and you just kind of
go there

2210
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:57,200
go there
 

2211
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,589
go there
I mean people kind of also internalize

2212
00:41:59,589 --> 00:41:59,599
I mean people kind of also internalize
 

2213
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,260
I mean people kind of also internalize
the apps everybody needs a nap it's like

2214
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:02,270
the apps everybody needs a nap it's like
 

2215
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,000
the apps everybody needs a nap it's like
you don't need an app you just walk into

2216
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:04,010
you don't need an app you just walk into
 

2217
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,220
you don't need an app you just walk into
the place walk up but I think I think

2218
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:06,230
the place walk up but I think I think
 

2219
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,420
the place walk up but I think I think
one of the things that you know we

2220
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,430
one of the things that you know we
 

2221
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:10,150
one of the things that you know we
really try to do is to take that shuttle

2222
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:10,160
really try to do is to take that shuttle
 

2223
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,490
really try to do is to take that shuttle
experience that no one likes and tilt it

2224
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:12,500
experience that no one likes and tilt it
 

2225
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,620
experience that no one likes and tilt it
into something that everybody loves and

2226
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:14,630
into something that everybody loves and
 

2227
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,839
into something that everybody loves and
so I think that's another important

2228
00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:16,849
so I think that's another important
 

2229
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,820
so I think that's another important
thing I would like to say that carefully

2230
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:18,830
thing I would like to say that carefully
 

2231
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,349
thing I would like to say that carefully
just like today operationally we don't

2232
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:20,359
just like today operationally we don't
 

2233
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,570
just like today operationally we don't
do shuttles you know we're really kind

2234
00:42:22,570 --> 00:42:22,580
do shuttles you know we're really kind
 

2235
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,609
do shuttles you know we're really kind
of thinking of this as a system or a

2236
00:42:24,609 --> 00:42:24,619
of thinking of this as a system or a
 

2237
00:42:24,619 --> 00:42:28,570
of thinking of this as a system or a
network that we're designing but but

2238
00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:28,580
network that we're designing but but
 

2239
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,339
network that we're designing but but
ultimately we go to places that would

2240
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:30,349
ultimately we go to places that would
 

2241
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,710
ultimately we go to places that would
normally rent the shuttle service that

2242
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:32,720
normally rent the shuttle service that
 

2243
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,599
normally rent the shuttle service that
people wouldn't like as much and we want

2244
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:34,609
people wouldn't like as much and we want
 

2245
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:36,040
people wouldn't like as much and we want
to tilt it into something that people

2246
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:36,050
to tilt it into something that people
 

2247
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:39,220
to tilt it into something that people
love so you virtually the second earlier

2248
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:39,230
love so you virtually the second earlier
 

2249
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,490
love so you virtually the second earlier
but how many optimist ride vehicles do

2250
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:42,500
but how many optimist ride vehicles do
 

2251
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,890
but how many optimist ride vehicles do
you think would be needed for any person

2252
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:44,900
you think would be needed for any person
 

2253
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,500
you think would be needed for any person
in Boston or New York if they step

2254
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:47,510
in Boston or New York if they step
 

2255
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:51,130
in Boston or New York if they step
outside there will be this this is like

2256
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:51,140
outside there will be this this is like
 

2257
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:53,349
outside there will be this this is like
a mathematical question there'll be two

2258
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:53,359
a mathematical question there'll be two
 

2259
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,210
a mathematical question there'll be two
optimist ride vehicles within line of

2260
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:55,220
optimist ride vehicles within line of
 

2261
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,680
optimist ride vehicles within line of
sight

2262
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:55,690
sight
 

2263
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:58,510
sight
is that the right number - well these

2264
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:58,520
is that the right number - well these
 

2265
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,660
is that the right number - well these
for example um that's that's the density

2266
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:01,670
for example um that's that's the density
 

2267
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,060
for example um that's that's the density
so meaning that if you see one vehicle

2268
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:04,070
so meaning that if you see one vehicle
 

2269
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:06,329
so meaning that if you see one vehicle
you look around you see another one -

2270
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:06,339
you look around you see another one -
 

2271
00:43:06,339 --> 00:43:10,180
you look around you see another one -
imagine like you know Tesla will tell

2272
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:10,190
imagine like you know Tesla will tell
 

2273
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:11,890
imagine like you know Tesla will tell
you they collect a lot of data do you

2274
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:11,900
you they collect a lot of data do you
 

2275
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,420
you they collect a lot of data do you
see that with Tesla like you just walk

2276
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:13,430
see that with Tesla like you just walk
 

2277
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,550
see that with Tesla like you just walk
around and you look on you see Tesla

2278
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:15,560
around and you look on you see Tesla
 

2279
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,829
around and you look on you see Tesla
probably not very specific areas of

2280
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:17,839
probably not very specific areas of
 

2281
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,339
probably not very specific areas of
California maybe maybe you're right like

2282
00:43:21,339 --> 00:43:21,349
California maybe maybe you're right like
 

2283
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:23,079
California maybe maybe you're right like
there's a couple zip codes that you know

2284
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:23,089
there's a couple zip codes that you know
 

2285
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:25,210
there's a couple zip codes that you know
just but I think but I think that's kind

2286
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:25,220
just but I think but I think that's kind
 

2287
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:26,620
just but I think but I think that's kind
of important because you know like maybe

2288
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:26,630
of important because you know like maybe
 

2289
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:28,599
of important because you know like maybe
the couple zip codes um the one thing

2290
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:28,609
the couple zip codes um the one thing
 

2291
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:30,430
the couple zip codes um the one thing
that we kind of depend on I'll get to

2292
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:30,440
that we kind of depend on I'll get to
 

2293
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,050
that we kind of depend on I'll get to
your question in a second but now like

2294
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:32,060
your question in a second but now like
 

2295
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,820
your question in a second but now like
we're taking a lot of tangents today oh

2296
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:33,830
we're taking a lot of tangents today oh
 

2297
00:43:33,830 --> 00:43:37,300
we're taking a lot of tangents today oh
yeah so so so I think that this is

2298
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,310
yeah so so so I think that this is
 

2299
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:39,010
yeah so so so I think that this is
actually important people call this data

2300
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:39,020
actually important people call this data
 

2301
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:41,640
actually important people call this data
density or data velocity so it's very

2302
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:41,650
density or data velocity so it's very
 

2303
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:44,349
density or data velocity so it's very
good to collect data in a way that you

2304
00:43:44,349 --> 00:43:44,359
good to collect data in a way that you
 

2305
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:46,510
good to collect data in a way that you
know you see the same place so many

2306
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:46,520
know you see the same place so many
 

2307
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,240
know you see the same place so many
times like you can drive 10,000 miles

2308
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:49,250
times like you can drive 10,000 miles
 

2309
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:52,089
times like you can drive 10,000 miles
around the country or you drive 10,000

2310
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:52,099
around the country or you drive 10,000
 

2311
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,339
around the country or you drive 10,000
miles in a confined environment you'll

2312
00:43:54,339 --> 00:43:54,349
miles in a confined environment you'll
 

2313
00:43:54,349 --> 00:43:56,079
miles in a confined environment you'll
see the same intersection hundreds of

2314
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:56,089
see the same intersection hundreds of
 

2315
00:43:56,089 --> 00:43:57,730
see the same intersection hundreds of
times and when it comes to

2316
00:43:57,730 --> 00:43:57,740
times and when it comes to
 

2317
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,080
times and when it comes to
dick ting what people are gonna do in

2318
00:43:59,080 --> 00:43:59,090
dick ting what people are gonna do in
 

2319
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:01,300
dick ting what people are gonna do in
that specific intersection we become

2320
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,310
that specific intersection we become
 

2321
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:03,640
that specific intersection we become
really good at it versus if you draw in

2322
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:03,650
really good at it versus if you draw in
 

2323
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:04,990
really good at it versus if you draw in
like ten thousand miles around the

2324
00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:05,000
like ten thousand miles around the
 

2325
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,060
like ten thousand miles around the
country you sing that only once and so

2326
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:07,070
country you sing that only once and so
 

2327
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:08,740
country you sing that only once and so
trying to predict what people do become

2328
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:08,750
trying to predict what people do become
 

2329
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,950
trying to predict what people do become
sorry and I think that you know you said

2330
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:11,960
sorry and I think that you know you said
 

2331
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,810
sorry and I think that you know you said
what is needed it's tens of thousands of

2332
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:13,820
what is needed it's tens of thousands of
 

2333
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,430
what is needed it's tens of thousands of
vehicles you know you really need to be

2334
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:15,440
vehicles you know you really need to be
 

2335
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,920
vehicles you know you really need to be
like a specific fraction or vehicle like

2336
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:17,930
like a specific fraction or vehicle like
 

2337
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:20,380
like a specific fraction or vehicle like
for example in good times in Singapore

2338
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:20,390
for example in good times in Singapore
 

2339
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,510
for example in good times in Singapore
you can go and you can just grab a cab

2340
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:22,520
you can go and you can just grab a cab
 

2341
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,960
you can go and you can just grab a cab
and they are like you know 10% 20% of

2342
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:25,970
and they are like you know 10% 20% of
 

2343
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:29,560
and they are like you know 10% 20% of
traffic those taxis ultimately that's

2344
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:29,570
traffic those taxis ultimately that's
 

2345
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,440
traffic those taxis ultimately that's
why you need to get to so that you know

2346
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:32,450
why you need to get to so that you know
 

2347
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,240
why you need to get to so that you know
you you get to a certain place where you

2348
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:34,250
you you get to a certain place where you
 

2349
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:37,090
you you get to a certain place where you
really the benefits really kick off and

2350
00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:37,100
really the benefits really kick off and
 

2351
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,840
really the benefits really kick off and
like orders of magnitude type of a point

2352
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:39,850
like orders of magnitude type of a point
 

2353
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,280
like orders of magnitude type of a point
but once you get there you actually get

2354
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:42,290
but once you get there you actually get
 

2355
00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:44,440
but once you get there you actually get
the benefits and you can certainly carry

2356
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:44,450
the benefits and you can certainly carry
 

2357
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:45,760
the benefits and you can certainly carry
people I think that's one of the things

2358
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:45,770
people I think that's one of the things
 

2359
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:49,690
people I think that's one of the things
people really don't like to wait for

2360
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:49,700
people really don't like to wait for
 

2361
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,210
people really don't like to wait for
themselves but for example they can wait

2362
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:52,220
themselves but for example they can wait
 

2363
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:55,030
themselves but for example they can wait
a lot more for the goods if they order

2364
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:55,040
a lot more for the goods if they order
 

2365
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,500
a lot more for the goods if they order
something like there you were sitting at

2366
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:56,510
something like there you were sitting at
 

2367
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:57,850
something like there you were sitting at
home and you want to wait half an hour

2368
00:44:57,850 --> 00:44:57,860
home and you want to wait half an hour
 

2369
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,500
home and you want to wait half an hour
that sounds great people say it's great

2370
00:44:59,500 --> 00:44:59,510
that sounds great people say it's great
 

2371
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:01,300
that sounds great people say it's great
you want to you're gonna take a cab

2372
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:01,310
you want to you're gonna take a cab
 

2373
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,890
you want to you're gonna take a cab
you're waiting half an hour like that's

2374
00:45:02,890 --> 00:45:02,900
you're waiting half an hour like that's
 

2375
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:05,170
you're waiting half an hour like that's
crazy you don't want to wait that much

2376
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:05,180
crazy you don't want to wait that much
 

2377
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:07,990
crazy you don't want to wait that much
but I think you know you you can I think

2378
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:08,000
but I think you know you you can I think
 

2379
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,880
but I think you know you you can I think
really get to a point where the system

2380
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:09,890
really get to a point where the system
 

2381
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:12,849
really get to a point where the system
at peak times really focuses on kind of

2382
00:45:12,849 --> 00:45:12,859
at peak times really focuses on kind of
 

2383
00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:15,370
at peak times really focuses on kind of
transporting humans around and then it's

2384
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:15,380
transporting humans around and then it's
 

2385
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,380
transporting humans around and then it's
it's really it's a good fraction of

2386
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:17,390
it's really it's a good fraction of
 

2387
00:45:17,390 --> 00:45:18,730
it's really it's a good fraction of
traffic to the point where you know you

2388
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:18,740
traffic to the point where you know you
 

2389
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,560
traffic to the point where you know you
go you look around there's something

2390
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:20,570
go you look around there's something
 

2391
00:45:20,570 --> 00:45:22,990
go you look around there's something
there and you just kind of basically get

2392
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:23,000
there and you just kind of basically get
 

2393
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,120
there and you just kind of basically get
in there and it's already waiting for

2394
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,130
in there and it's already waiting for
 

2395
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:27,580
in there and it's already waiting for
you or something like that and then you

2396
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:27,590
you or something like that and then you
 

2397
00:45:27,590 --> 00:45:31,210
you or something like that and then you
take it if you do it at that scale like

2398
00:45:31,210 --> 00:45:31,220
take it if you do it at that scale like
 

2399
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,750
take it if you do it at that scale like
today for instance uber if you talk to a

2400
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:34,760
today for instance uber if you talk to a
 

2401
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:36,940
today for instance uber if you talk to a
driver right I mean uber takes a certain

2402
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:36,950
driver right I mean uber takes a certain
 

2403
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,359
driver right I mean uber takes a certain
cut it's a small cut or drivers would

2404
00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:40,369
cut it's a small cut or drivers would
 

2405
00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:41,980
cut it's a small cut or drivers would
argue that it's a large cut but you know

2406
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:41,990
argue that it's a large cut but you know
 

2407
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,290
argue that it's a large cut but you know
it's it's it's when you look at the

2408
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:44,300
it's it's it's when you look at the
 

2409
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,920
it's it's it's when you look at the
grand scheme of things most of that

2410
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:46,930
grand scheme of things most of that
 

2411
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,030
grand scheme of things most of that
money that you pay Hueber

2412
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
money that you pay Hueber
 

2413
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,590
money that you pay Hueber
kind of goes to the driver and if you

2414
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:50,600
kind of goes to the driver and if you
 

2415
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,060
kind of goes to the driver and if you
talk to the driver the driver will claim

2416
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:52,070
talk to the driver the driver will claim
 

2417
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:54,790
talk to the driver the driver will claim
that most of it is their time you know

2418
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:54,800
that most of it is their time you know
 

2419
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,010
that most of it is their time you know
they it's not spent on gas they think

2420
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:57,020
they it's not spent on gas they think
 

2421
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,849
they it's not spent on gas they think
it's not spent on the the car per se as

2422
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:00,859
it's not spent on the the car per se as
 

2423
00:46:00,859 --> 00:46:03,220
it's not spent on the the car per se as
much it's like their time and if you

2424
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:03,230
much it's like their time and if you
 

2425
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:05,440
much it's like their time and if you
didn't have a have a person driving or

2426
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:05,450
didn't have a have a person driving or
 

2427
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,970
didn't have a have a person driving or
if you're in a scenario where you know

2428
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:06,980
if you're in a scenario where you know
 

2429
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,960
if you're in a scenario where you know
like point one person is driving the car

2430
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:10,970
like point one person is driving the car
 

2431
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:13,240
like point one person is driving the car
a fraction of a person is kind of

2432
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,250
a fraction of a person is kind of
 

2433
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:14,890
a fraction of a person is kind of
operating the car because you know your

2434
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:14,900
operating the car because you know your
 

2435
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,560
operating the car because you know your
one operates several if you're in that

2436
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:17,570
one operates several if you're in that
 

2437
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,230
one operates several if you're in that
situation you realize that the internal

2438
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,240
situation you realize that the internal
 

2439
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,760
situation you realize that the internal
combustion engine type of cars are very

2440
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:21,770
combustion engine type of cars are very
 

2441
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:24,280
combustion engine type of cars are very
inefficient you know we built them to go

2442
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,290
inefficient you know we built them to go
 

2443
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,230
inefficient you know we built them to go
on highways they pass crash tests

2444
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:26,240
on highways they pass crash tests
 

2445
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,240
on highways they pass crash tests
they're like really heavy they really

2446
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:28,250
they're like really heavy they really
 

2447
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,070
they're like really heavy they really
don't need to be like 25 times the

2448
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:30,080
don't need to be like 25 times the
 

2449
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:32,440
don't need to be like 25 times the
weight of its passengers or or you know

like area wise and so on and but if you

2452
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:36,290
like area wise and so on and but if you
 

2453
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,230
like area wise and so on and but if you
get through those inefficiencies and if

2454
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
get through those inefficiencies and if
 

2455
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,970
get through those inefficiencies and if
you really build like urban cars and

2456
00:46:39,970 --> 00:46:39,980
you really build like urban cars and
 

2457
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:41,920
you really build like urban cars and
things like that I think the economics

2458
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:41,930
things like that I think the economics
 

2459
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:43,690
things like that I think the economics
really starts to check out like to the

2460
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:43,700
really starts to check out like to the
 

2461
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,060
really starts to check out like to the
point where I mean I don't know you may

2462
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,070
point where I mean I don't know you may
 

2463
00:46:46,070 --> 00:46:48,130
point where I mean I don't know you may
be able to get into a car and it may be

2464
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:48,140
be able to get into a car and it may be
 

2465
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,350
be able to get into a car and it may be
less than a dollar to go from A to B as

you know these kinds of things at least

2476
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:02,810
you know these kinds of things at least

I think it's really exciting what

any order at any time and there's a
 

2619
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:12,309
any order at any time and there's a
whole bunch of things in that people

2620
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:12,319
whole bunch of things in that people
 

2621
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:14,920

take it clamp it and put it into the

2622
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:14,930
take it clamp it and put it into the
 

2623
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:18,640
take it clamp it and put it into the
next three years and so then what

2624
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:18,650
next three years and so then what
 

2625
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,109
next three years and so then what
happens is that there's some things that

2626
00:50:20,109 --> 00:50:20,119
happens is that there's some things that
 

2627
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:21,789
happens is that there's some things that
maybe can happen by the end of the year

2628
00:50:21,789 --> 00:50:21,799
maybe can happen by the end of the year
 

2629
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:23,950
maybe can happen by the end of the year
or next year and so on and they push

2630
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:23,960
or next year and so on and they push
 

2631
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,749
or next year and so on and they push
that into like few years ahead because

2632
00:50:25,749 --> 00:50:25,759
that into like few years ahead because
 

2633
00:50:25,759 --> 00:50:28,299
that into like few years ahead because
it's just hard to explain and there are

2634

it's just hard to explain and there are
 

2635
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:30,009
it's just hard to explain and there are
things that are like we were looking at

2636
00:50:30,009 --> 00:50:30,019
things that are like we were looking at
 

2637
00:50:30,019 --> 00:50:33,880
things that are like we were looking at
20 years more maybe you know hopefully

2638
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:33,890
20 years more maybe you know hopefully
 

2639
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,769
20 years more maybe you know hopefully
in my lifetime type of things and cuz

00:50:35,779 --> 00:50:38,200
in my lifetime type of things and cuz
you know we don't know I mean we don't

2642
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:38,210
you know we don't know I mean we don't
 

2643
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:41,079
you know we don't know I mean we don't
know how hard it is even like that's a

2644
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:41,089
know how hard it is even like that's a
 

2645
00:50:41,089 --> 00:50:42,579
know how hard it is even like that's a
problem we don't know like if some of

2646
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:42,589
problem we don't know like if some of
 

2647
00:50:42,589 --> 00:50:44,530
problem we don't know like if some of
these problems are actually AI complete

2648
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:44,540
these problems are actually AI complete
 

2649
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,170
these problems are actually AI complete
like we have no idea what's going on and

2650
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:47,180
like we have no idea what's going on and
 

2651
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,660
like we have no idea what's going on and
and you know we we take all of that and

2652
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:49,670
and you know we we take all of that and
 

2653
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:53,230
and you know we we take all of that and
then we clump it and then we say three

2654
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:53,240
then we clump it and then we say three
 

2655
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,260
then we clump it and then we say three
years from now and then some of us are

2656
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:56,270
years from now and then some of us are
 

2657
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:57,849
years from now and then some of us are
more optimistic so they're shooting at

2658
00:50:57,849 --> 00:50:57,859
more optimistic so they're shooting at
 

2659
00:50:57,859 --> 00:50:59,650
more optimistic so they're shooting at
the at the end of the year and some of

2660
00:50:59,650 --> 00:50:59,660
the at the end of the year and some of
 

2661
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:01,480
the at the end of the year and some of
us are more realistic they say like five

2662
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:01,490
us are more realistic they say like five
 

2663
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,120
us are more realistic they say like five
years but you know we all I think it's

2664
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:04,130
years but you know we all I think it's
 

2665
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:08,349
years but you know we all I think it's
just hard to know and and I think trying

2666
00:51:08,349 --> 00:51:08,359
just hard to know and and I think trying
 

2667
00:51:08,359 --> 00:51:11,440
just hard to know and and I think trying
to predict like products ahead to three

2668
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:11,450
to predict like products ahead to three
 

2669
00:51:11,450 --> 00:51:13,210
to predict like products ahead to three
years it's it's hard to know in the

2670
00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:13,220
years it's it's hard to know in the
 

2671
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:14,470
years it's it's hard to know in the
following sense you know like we

2672
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
following sense you know like we
 

2673
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,930
following sense you know like we
typically say okay this is a technology

2674
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:16,940
typically say okay this is a technology
 

2675
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,510
typically say okay this is a technology
company but sometimes sometimes really

2676
00:51:19,510 --> 00:51:19,520
company but sometimes sometimes really
 

2677
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,680
company but sometimes sometimes really
you're trying to build something where

2678
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:20,690
you're trying to build something where
 

2679
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:21,940
you're trying to build something where
technology does like there's a

2680
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:21,950
technology does like there's a
 

2681
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:25,900
technology does like there's a
technology gap you know like and Tesla

2682
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:25,910
technology gap you know like and Tesla
 

2683
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:27,910
technology gap you know like and Tesla
had that with electric vehicles you know

2684
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:27,920
had that with electric vehicles you know
 

2685
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,760
had that with electric vehicles you know
like when they first started they would

2686
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:30,770
like when they first started they would
 

2687
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:32,740
like when they first started they would
look at a chart much like a moose law

2688
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:32,750
look at a chart much like a moose law
 

2689
00:51:32,750 --> 00:51:34,120
look at a chart much like a moose law
type of chart and they would just kind

2690
00:51:34,120 --> 00:51:34,130
type of chart and they would just kind
 

2691
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,589
type of chart and they would just kind
of extrapolate that out and they'd say

2692
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
of extrapolate that out and they'd say
 

2693
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:37,810
of extrapolate that out and they'd say
we want to be here what's the technology

2694
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:37,820
we want to be here what's the technology
 

2695
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:40,210
we want to be here what's the technology
to get that we don't know it goes like

2696
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,220
to get that we don't know it goes like
 

2697
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,890
to get that we don't know it goes like
this so it's probably just gonna you

2698
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:41,900
this so it's probably just gonna you
 

2699
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:45,520
this so it's probably just gonna you
know keep going yeah um with bit AI that

2700
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:45,530
know keep going yeah um with bit AI that
 

2701
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:47,079
know keep going yeah um with bit AI that
goes into the cars we don't even have

2702
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:47,089
goes into the cars we don't even have
 

2703
00:51:47,089 --> 00:51:49,450
goes into the cars we don't even have
that like we can't I mean what can you

2704
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:49,460
that like we can't I mean what can you
 

2705
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,220
that like we can't I mean what can you
quantify yeah like what kind of chart

2706
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,230
quantify yeah like what kind of chart
 

2707
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:54,790
quantify yeah like what kind of chart
are you looking at you know but so but

2708
00:51:54,790 --> 00:51:54,800
are you looking at you know but so but
 

2709
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,200
are you looking at you know but so but
so I think when there's the technology

2710
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,210
so I think when there's the technology
 

2711
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:57,730
so I think when there's the technology
gap it's just kind of really hard to

2712
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:57,740
gap it's just kind of really hard to
 

2713
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:00,280
gap it's just kind of really hard to
predict so now I realize I talk like

2714
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:00,290
predict so now I realize I talk like
 

2715
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,870
predict so now I realize I talk like
five minutes and avoid your question I

2716
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:01,880
five minutes and avoid your question I
 

2717
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:07,300
five minutes and avoid your question I
didn't tell you anything about and I

2718
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:07,310
didn't tell you anything about and I
 

2719
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:08,710
didn't tell you anything about and I
don't think you I think you've actually

2720
00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:08,720
don't think you I think you've actually
 

2721
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,870
don't think you I think you've actually
argued that it's not used even NES you

2722
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:10,880
argued that it's not used even NES you
 

2723
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,000
argued that it's not used even NES you
provide now is not that used to be very

2724
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,010
provide now is not that used to be very
 

2725
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,950
provide now is not that used to be very
hard there's one thing that I really

2726
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:14,960
hard there's one thing that I really
 

2727
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,440
hard there's one thing that I really
believe in and and you know this is not

2728
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:17,450
believe in and and you know this is not
 

2729
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:19,180
believe in and and you know this is not
my idea and it's been you know discussed

2730
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:19,190
my idea and it's been you know discussed
 

2731
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:22,300
my idea and it's been you know discussed
several times but but this this this

2732
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:22,310
several times but but this this this
 

2733
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:25,180
several times but but this this this
kind of like something like a startup or

2734
00:52:25,180 --> 00:52:25,190
kind of like something like a startup or
 

2735
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:27,930
kind of like something like a startup or
a kind of an innovative company

2736
00:52:27,930 --> 00:52:27,940
a kind of an innovative company
 

2737
00:52:27,940 --> 00:52:30,579
a kind of an innovative company
including definitely may want may vary

2738
00:52:30,579 --> 00:52:30,589
including definitely may want may vary
 

2739
00:52:30,589 --> 00:52:32,140
including definitely may want may vary
more Tesla maybe even some of the other

2740
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:32,150
more Tesla maybe even some of the other
 

2741
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,730
more Tesla maybe even some of the other
big companies that are kind of trying

2742
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:33,740
big companies that are kind of trying
 

2743
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,920
big companies that are kind of trying
things this kind of like iterated

2744
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:35,930
things this kind of like iterated
 

2745
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:38,890
things this kind of like iterated
learning is very important the fact that

2746
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:38,900
learning is very important the fact that
 

2747
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:40,720
learning is very important the fact that
we're over there and we're trying things

2748
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:40,730
we're over there and we're trying things
 

2749
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:43,570
we're over there and we're trying things
and so on I think that's that's

2750
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:43,580
and so on I think that's that's
 

2751
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:46,000
and so on I think that's that's
important we try to understand and and I

2752
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:46,010
important we try to understand and and I
 

2753
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:47,890
important we try to understand and and I
think that you know the coding code

2754
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:47,900
think that you know the coding code
 

2755
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,410
think that you know the coding code
Silicon Valley has done that with

2756
00:52:49,410 --> 00:52:49,420
Silicon Valley has done that with
 

2757
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,880
Silicon Valley has done that with
business models pretty well

2758
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:51,890
business models pretty well
 

2759
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,859
business models pretty well
and now I think we're trying to get to

2760
00:52:53,859 --> 00:52:53,869
and now I think we're trying to get to
 

2761
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:55,900
and now I think we're trying to get to
do it well there's a little technology

2762
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:55,910
do it well there's a little technology
 

2763
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,620
do it well there's a little technology
gap

2764
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:56,630
gap
 

2765
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:58,299
gap
I mean before like you know you're

2766
00:52:58,299 --> 00:52:58,309
I mean before like you know you're
 

2767
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,190
I mean before like you know you're
trying to build I'm not trying to you

2768
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:00,200
trying to build I'm not trying to you
 

2769
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,809
trying to build I'm not trying to you
know I think these companies are

2770
00:53:01,809 --> 00:53:01,819
know I think these companies are
 

2771
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:03,849
know I think these companies are
building great technology to for example

2772
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:03,859
building great technology to for example
 

2773
00:53:03,859 --> 00:53:06,970
building great technology to for example
enable internet search to do it so

2774
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:06,980
enable internet search to do it so
 

2775
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,130
enable internet search to do it so
quickly and that kind of didn't what

2776
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:09,140
quickly and that kind of didn't what
 

2777
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:11,289
quickly and that kind of didn't what
wasn't there so much but at least like

2778
00:53:11,289 --> 00:53:11,299
wasn't there so much but at least like
 

2779
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:12,849
wasn't there so much but at least like
it was a kind of a technology that you

2780
00:53:12,849 --> 00:53:12,859
it was a kind of a technology that you
 

2781
00:53:12,859 --> 00:53:14,470
it was a kind of a technology that you
could predict to some degree and so on

2782
00:53:14,470 --> 00:53:14,480
could predict to some degree and so on
 

2783
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,789
could predict to some degree and so on
and now we're just kind of trying to

2784
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:15,799
and now we're just kind of trying to
 

2785
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:18,039
and now we're just kind of trying to
build you know things that it's kind of

2786
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:18,049
build you know things that it's kind of
 

2787
00:53:18,049 --> 00:53:19,750
build you know things that it's kind of
hard to quantify what kind of a metric

2788
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:19,760
hard to quantify what kind of a metric
 

2789
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,859
hard to quantify what kind of a metric
are we looking at so psychologically is

2790
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:23,869
are we looking at so psychologically is
 

2791
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:25,809
are we looking at so psychologically is
a sort of as a leader of graduate

2792
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:25,819
a sort of as a leader of graduate
 

2793
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:29,230
a sort of as a leader of graduate
students and an optimist ride a bunch of

2794
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:29,240
students and an optimist ride a bunch of
 

2795
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,910
students and an optimist ride a bunch of
brilliant engineers just curiosity

2796
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:32,920
brilliant engineers just curiosity
 

2797
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,900
brilliant engineers just curiosity
psychologically do you think it's good

2798
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:34,910
psychologically do you think it's good
 

2799
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:39,430
psychologically do you think it's good
to think that you know whatever

2800
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
to think that you know whatever
 

2801
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,170
to think that you know whatever
technology gap we're talking about can

2802
00:53:41,170 --> 00:53:41,180
technology gap we're talking about can
 

2803
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:44,019
technology gap we're talking about can
be closed by the end of the year or do

2804
00:53:44,019 --> 00:53:44,029
be closed by the end of the year or do
 

2805
00:53:44,029 --> 00:53:46,269
be closed by the end of the year or do
you you know because we don't know so

2806
00:53:46,269 --> 00:53:46,279
you you know because we don't know so
 

2807
00:53:46,279 --> 00:53:50,470
you you know because we don't know so
the way do you want to say that

2808
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
the way do you want to say that
 

2809
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,170
the way do you want to say that
everything is going to improve

2810
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:52,180
everything is going to improve
 

2811
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:54,789
everything is going to improve
exponentially to yourself and to others

2812
00:53:54,789 --> 00:53:54,799
exponentially to yourself and to others
 

2813
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:57,999
exponentially to yourself and to others
around you as a leader or do you want to

2814
00:53:57,999 --> 00:53:58,009
around you as a leader or do you want to
 

2815
00:53:58,009 --> 00:54:01,900
around you as a leader or do you want to
be more sort of maybe not cynical but I

2816
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:01,910
be more sort of maybe not cynical but I
 

2817
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:03,880
be more sort of maybe not cynical but I
don't want to use realistic because it's

2818
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:03,890
don't want to use realistic because it's
 

2819
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:06,339
don't want to use realistic because it's
hard to predict but yeah maybe more

2820
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:06,349
hard to predict but yeah maybe more
 

2821
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:10,059
hard to predict but yeah maybe more
cynical pessimistic about the ability to

2822
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:10,069
cynical pessimistic about the ability to
 

2823
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:12,640
cynical pessimistic about the ability to
close again yeah I I think that you know

2824
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:12,650
close again yeah I I think that you know
 

2825
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:14,259
close again yeah I I think that you know
going back I think that iterated

2826
00:54:14,259 --> 00:54:14,269
going back I think that iterated
 

2827
00:54:14,269 --> 00:54:16,240
going back I think that iterated
learning is like key that you know

2828
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:16,250
learning is like key that you know
 

2829
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:17,650
learning is like key that you know
you're out there you're running

2830
00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:17,660
you're out there you're running
 

2831
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:19,870
you're out there you're running
experiments to learn and that doesn't

2832
00:54:19,870 --> 00:54:19,880
experiments to learn and that doesn't
 

2833
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,819
experiments to learn and that doesn't
mean sort of like you know you like like

2834
00:54:21,819 --> 00:54:21,829
mean sort of like you know you like like
 

2835
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:23,109
mean sort of like you know you like like
your optimist right you're kind of doing

2836
00:54:23,109 --> 00:54:23,119
your optimist right you're kind of doing
 

2837
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:25,599
your optimist right you're kind of doing
something but I like in an environment

2838
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:25,609
something but I like in an environment
 

2839
00:54:25,609 --> 00:54:27,789
something but I like in an environment
but like what Tesla is doing I think is

2840
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:27,799
but like what Tesla is doing I think is
 

2841
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:29,710
but like what Tesla is doing I think is
also kind of like this this kind of

2842
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:29,720
also kind of like this this kind of
 

2843
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:31,900
also kind of like this this kind of
notion and and you know people can go

2844
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:31,910
notion and and you know people can go
 

2845
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:33,609
notion and and you know people can go
around and say like you know this year

2846
00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:33,619
around and say like you know this year
 

2847
00:54:33,619 --> 00:54:35,380
around and say like you know this year
next year the other year and so on but

2848
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:35,390
next year the other year and so on but
 

2849
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:37,509
next year the other year and so on but
but I think that the nice thing about it

2850
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:37,519
but I think that the nice thing about it
 

2851
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:39,039
but I think that the nice thing about it
is that they're out there they're

2852
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:39,049
is that they're out there they're
 

2853
00:54:39,049 --> 00:54:41,620
is that they're out there they're
pushing this technology in I think what

2854
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:41,630
pushing this technology in I think what
 

2855
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,049
pushing this technology in I think what
they should do more of I think that kind

2856
00:54:44,049 --> 00:54:44,059
they should do more of I think that kind
 

2857
00:54:44,059 --> 00:54:46,029
they should do more of I think that kind
of informed people about what kind of

2858
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:46,039
of informed people about what kind of
 

2859
00:54:46,039 --> 00:54:47,289
of informed people about what kind of
technology that they're providing you

2860
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:47,299
technology that they're providing you
 

2861
00:54:47,299 --> 00:54:48,940
technology that they're providing you
know the good and the bad and then you

2862
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:48,950
know the good and the bad and then you
 

2863
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,490
know the good and the bad and then you
know not just sort of you know if it

2864
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:51,500
know not just sort of you know if it
 

2865
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,259
know not just sort of you know if it
works very well but I think you know I'm

2866
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:53,269
works very well but I think you know I'm
 

2867
00:54:53,269 --> 00:54:54,579
works very well but I think you know I'm
not saying they're not doing bad and

2868
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:54,589
not saying they're not doing bad and
 

2869
00:54:54,589 --> 00:54:56,920
not saying they're not doing bad and
informing I think they're kind of trying

2870
00:54:56,920 --> 00:54:56,930
informing I think they're kind of trying
 

2871
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,089
informing I think they're kind of trying
they you know they put up certain things

2872
00:54:58,089 --> 00:54:58,099
they you know they put up certain things
 

2873
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:00,249
they you know they put up certain things
or at the very least YouTube videos

2874
00:55:00,249 --> 00:55:00,259
or at the very least YouTube videos
 

2875
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,710
or at the very least YouTube videos
comes out on on how the summon function

2876
00:55:02,710 --> 00:55:02,720
comes out on on how the summon function
 

2877
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,089
comes out on on how the summon function
works every now and then and and you

2878
00:55:04,089 --> 00:55:04,099
works every now and then and and you
 

2879
00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:05,530
works every now and then and and you
know people get informed

2880
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:05,540
know people get informed
 

2881
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,330
know people get informed
and so that that kind of cycle continues

2882
00:55:07,330 --> 00:55:07,340
and so that that kind of cycle continues
 

2883
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,600
and so that that kind of cycle continues
but you know I I admired I think they're

2884
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:10,610
but you know I I admired I think they're
 

2885
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:12,640
but you know I I admired I think they're
kind of go out there and they do great

2886
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:12,650
kind of go out there and they do great
 

2887
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:14,020
kind of go out there and they do great
things they do their own kind of

2888
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:14,030
things they do their own kind of
 

2889
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,810
things they do their own kind of
experiment I think we do our own and I

2890
00:55:16,810 --> 00:55:16,820
experiment I think we do our own and I
 

2891
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,030
experiment I think we do our own and I
think we're closing some similar

2892
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
think we're closing some similar
 

2893
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,040
think we're closing some similar
technology gaps but some also some are

2894
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:21,050
technology gaps but some also some are
 

2895
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:23,200
technology gaps but some also some are
orthogonal as well you know I think like

2896
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:23,210
orthogonal as well you know I think like
 

2897
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:25,000
orthogonal as well you know I think like
like we talked about you know people

2898
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:25,010
like we talked about you know people
 

2899
00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:27,160
like we talked about you know people
being remote like it's something or in

2900
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,170
being remote like it's something or in
 

2901
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:28,420
being remote like it's something or in
the kind of environments that we're in

2902
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:28,430
the kind of environments that we're in
 

2903
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,940
the kind of environments that we're in
or think about a test the car maybe

2904
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:30,950
or think about a test the car maybe
 

2905
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,800
or think about a test the car maybe
maybe you can enable it one day like

2906
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:32,810
maybe you can enable it one day like
 

2907
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,810
maybe you can enable it one day like
there's you know low traffic like you're

2908
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:34,820
there's you know low traffic like you're
 

2909
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,640
there's you know low traffic like you're
kind of the stuff on go emotion you just

2910
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:36,650
kind of the stuff on go emotion you just
 

2911
00:55:36,650 --> 00:55:38,740
kind of the stuff on go emotion you just
hit the button and the you can really

2912
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:38,750
hit the button and the you can really
 

2913
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,180
hit the button and the you can really
say or maybe there's another you know

2914
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:40,190
say or maybe there's another you know
 

2915
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:41,950
say or maybe there's another you know
Lane that you can pass into you going

2916
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:41,960
Lane that you can pass into you going
 

2917
00:55:41,960 --> 00:55:43,750
Lane that you can pass into you going
that I think they can enable these kinds

2918
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
that I think they can enable these kinds
 

2919
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,570
that I think they can enable these kinds
of pride believe it and so I think that

2920
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:46,580
of pride believe it and so I think that
 

2921
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:49,600
of pride believe it and so I think that
that part that is really important and

2922
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:49,610
that part that is really important and
 

2923
00:55:49,610 --> 00:55:52,240
that part that is really important and
that is really key and and beyond that I

2924
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,250
that is really key and and beyond that I
 

2925
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:55,390
that is really key and and beyond that I
think you know when is it exactly gonna

2926
00:55:55,390 --> 00:55:55,400
think you know when is it exactly gonna
 

2927
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:59,050
think you know when is it exactly gonna
happen and and and so on I mean it's

2928
00:55:59,050 --> 00:55:59,060
happen and and and so on I mean it's
 

2929
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,020
happen and and and so on I mean it's
like I said it's very hard to predict

2930
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:01,030
like I said it's very hard to predict
 

2931
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:05,350
like I said it's very hard to predict
and I would I would imagine that it

2932
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:05,360
and I would I would imagine that it
 

2933
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,210
and I would I would imagine that it
would be good to do some sort of like a

2934
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:07,220
would be good to do some sort of like a
 

2935
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,010
would be good to do some sort of like a
like a one or two year plan when it's a

2936
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:09,020
like a one or two year plan when it's a
 

2937
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:11,110
like a one or two year plan when it's a
little bit more predictable that you

2938
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:11,120
little bit more predictable that you
 

2939
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,760
little bit more predictable that you
know you the technology gaps you close

2940
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:12,770
know you the technology gaps you close
 

2941
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:16,420
know you the technology gaps you close
and and there and the kind of sort of

2942
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:16,430
and and there and the kind of sort of
 

2943
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,630
and and there and the kind of sort of
product that would answer so I know that

2944
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:19,640
product that would answer so I know that
 

2945
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,040
product that would answer so I know that

3025
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,460
quite a bit on kind of sort of doing
this in kind of coding called stealth

3026
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:51,470
this in kind of coding called stealth
 

3027
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:54,430
this in kind of coding called stealth
mode for a bit but I think that you know

3028
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:54,440
mode for a bit but I think that you know
 

3029
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,680
mode for a bit but I think that you know
we will open it up quite a lot more and

3030
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:56,690
we will open it up quite a lot more and
 

3031

you know some of the deployments that we
 

3041
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:11,170
you know some of the deployments that we
kind of announced were some of the first

3042

kind of announced were some of the first
 

3043
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,770
kind of announced were some of the first
bits bits of information that we kind of

3044
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:14,780
bits bits of information that we kind of
 

3045
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:16,780
bits bits of information that we kind of
put out into the world we'll also put

uh camera based systems first things

3100
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:21,590
uh camera based systems first things
 

3101
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:23,440
uh camera based systems first things
first I think you know I'm a big

3102
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:23,450
first I think you know I'm a big
 

3103
00:59:23,450 --> 00:59:26,950
first I think you know I'm a big
believer in just camera based autonomous

3104
00:59:26,950 --> 00:59:26,960
believer in just camera based autonomous
 

3105
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,560
believer in just camera based autonomous
vehicle systems like I think that you

3106
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:29,570
vehicle systems like I think that you
 

3107
00:59:29,570 --> 00:59:30,970
vehicle systems like I think that you
know you can put in a lot of autonomy

3108
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:30,980
know you can put in a lot of autonomy
 

3109
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:32,260
know you can put in a lot of autonomy
and

3110
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:32,270
and
 

3111
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:33,820
and
and you can do great things and and it's

3112
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:33,830
and you can do great things and and it's
 

3113
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,220
and you can do great things and and it's
it's it's very possible that at the time

3114
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:36,230
it's it's very possible that at the time
 

3115
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,490
it's it's very possible that at the time
scales like we said we can't predict

3116
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:38,500
scales like we said we can't predict
 

3117
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,230
scales like we said we can't predict
twenty years from now like you may be

3118
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:41,240
twenty years from now like you may be
 

3119
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:43,600
twenty years from now like you may be
able to do do things that we're doing

3120
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:43,610
able to do do things that we're doing
 

3121
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,580
able to do do things that we're doing
today only what lidar and you may be

3122
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:45,590
today only what lidar and you may be
 

3123
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:48,190
today only what lidar and you may be
will do them just with cameras and I

3124
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:48,200
will do them just with cameras and I
 

3125
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:52,180
will do them just with cameras and I
think that you know you can just I I

3126
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:52,190
think that you know you can just I I
 

3127
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,400
think that you know you can just I I
think that I will put my name on it to

3128
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:54,410
think that I will put my name on it to
 

3129
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,830
think that I will put my name on it to
like you know there will be a time when

3130
00:59:56,830 --> 00:59:56,840
like you know there will be a time when
 

3131
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,260
like you know there will be a time when
you can only use cameras and you'll be

3132
00:59:59,260 --> 00:59:59,270
you can only use cameras and you'll be
 

3133
00:59:59,270 --> 01:00:02,800
you can only use cameras and you'll be
fine at that time though it's very

3134
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:02,810
fine at that time though it's very
 

3135
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:05,080
fine at that time though it's very
possible that you know you find the

3136
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,090
possible that you know you find the
 

3137
01:00:05,090 --> 01:00:08,590
possible that you know you find the
lidar system as another robusta fire or

3138
01:00:08,590 --> 01:00:08,600
lidar system as another robusta fire or
 

3139
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,630
lidar system as another robusta fire or
or it's so affordable that it's stupid

3140
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:10,640
or it's so affordable that it's stupid
 

3141
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,660
or it's so affordable that it's stupid
not to you know just kind of put it

3142
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:13,670
not to you know just kind of put it
 

3143
01:00:13,670 --> 01:00:17,920
not to you know just kind of put it
there and I think and I think we may be

3144
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:17,930
there and I think and I think we may be
 

3145
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,140
there and I think and I think we may be
looking at a future like that do you

3146
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,150
looking at a future like that do you
 

3147
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:22,150
looking at a future like that do you
think we're over relying on lidar

3148
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:22,160
think we're over relying on lidar
 

3149
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,120
think we're over relying on lidar
right now because we understand it

3150
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,130
right now because we understand it
 

3151
01:00:25,130 --> 01:00:26,880
right now because we understand it
better it's more reliable anyways

3152
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:26,890
better it's more reliable anyways
 

3153
01:00:26,890 --> 01:00:29,080
better it's more reliable anyways
internment from a safety easier to build

01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:29,090
internment from a safety easier to build
 

3155
01:00:29,090 --> 01:00:30,820
internment from a safety easier to build
with that's the other that's the other

3156
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:30,830
with that's the other that's the other
 

3157
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,460
with that's the other that's the other
thing I think to be very frank with you

3158
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:33,470
thing I think to be very frank with you
 

3159
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:36,430
thing I think to be very frank with you
I mean you know we've seen a lot of sort

3160
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:36,440
I mean you know we've seen a lot of sort
 

3161
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,590
I mean you know we've seen a lot of sort
of autonomous vehicles companies come

3162
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:38,600
of autonomous vehicles companies come
 

3163
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,810
of autonomous vehicles companies come
and go and the approach has been you

3164
01:00:40,810 --> 01:00:40,820
and go and the approach has been you
 

3165
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:43,720
and go and the approach has been you
know you slap a lidar on a car and it's

3166
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:43,730
know you slap a lidar on a car and it's
 

3167
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:45,430
know you slap a lidar on a car and it's
kind of easy to build with when you have

3168
01:00:45,430 --> 01:00:45,440
kind of easy to build with when you have
 

3169
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,290
kind of easy to build with when you have
a lighter are you know you just kind of

3170
01:00:47,290 --> 01:00:47,300
a lighter are you know you just kind of
 

3171
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,210
a lighter are you know you just kind of
coat it up and and you hit the button

3172
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:49,220
coat it up and and you hit the button
 

3173
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:52,660
coat it up and and you hit the button
and you do a demo so I think there's

3174
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:52,670
and you do a demo so I think there's
 

3175
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,400
and you do a demo so I think there's
admittedly there's a lot of people they

3176
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:54,410
admittedly there's a lot of people they
 

3177
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:56,170
admittedly there's a lot of people they
focus on the lidar because it's easier

3178
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:56,180
focus on the lidar because it's easier
 

3179
01:00:56,180 --> 01:00:58,870
focus on the lidar because it's easier
to build with that doesn't mean that you

3180
01:00:58,870 --> 01:00:58,880
to build with that doesn't mean that you
 

3181
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,970
to build with that doesn't mean that you
know without the cameras just cameras

3182
01:01:00,970 --> 01:01:00,980
know without the cameras just cameras
 

3183
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,400
know without the cameras just cameras
you can you cannot do what they're doing

3184
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:03,410
you can you cannot do what they're doing
 

3185
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:04,810
you can you cannot do what they're doing
but it's just kind of a lot harder and

3186
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:04,820
but it's just kind of a lot harder and
 

3187
01:01:04,820 --> 01:01:06,190
but it's just kind of a lot harder and
so you need to have certain kind of

3188
01:01:06,190 --> 01:01:06,200
so you need to have certain kind of
 

3189
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,950
so you need to have certain kind of
expertise to exploit that what we

3190
01:01:08,950 --> 01:01:08,960
expertise to exploit that what we
 

3191
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,300
expertise to exploit that what we
believe in and you know you may be

3192
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:10,310
believe in and you know you may be
 

3193
01:01:10,310 --> 01:01:13,360
believe in and you know you may be
seeing some of it is that we believe in

3194
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:13,370
seeing some of it is that we believe in
 

3195
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:15,130
seeing some of it is that we believe in
computer vision we certainly work on

3196
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:15,140
computer vision we certainly work on
 

3197
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,470
computer vision we certainly work on
computer vision and optimist ride by a

3198
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:17,480
computer vision and optimist ride by a
 

3199
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,900
computer vision and optimist ride by a
lot like um and and we've been doing

3200
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:19,910
lot like um and and we've been doing
 

3201
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,330
lot like um and and we've been doing
that from day one and we also believe in

3202
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:22,340
that from day one and we also believe in
 

3203
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:24,850
that from day one and we also believe in
sensor fusion so you know we do we have

3204
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:24,860
sensor fusion so you know we do we have
 

3205
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,010
sensor fusion so you know we do we have
a relatively minimal use of light ours

3206
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:27,020
a relatively minimal use of light ours
 

3207
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,100
a relatively minimal use of light ours
but but we do use them and I think you

3208
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:30,110
but but we do use them and I think you
 

3209
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,540
but but we do use them and I think you
know in the future I really believe that

3210
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:31,550
know in the future I really believe that
 

3211
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,640
know in the future I really believe that
the following sequence of events may

3212
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:33,650
the following sequence of events may
 

3213
01:01:33,650 --> 01:01:36,790
the following sequence of events may
happen first things first number one

3214
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:36,800
happen first things first number one
 

3215
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,100
happen first things first number one
there may be a future in which you know

3216
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:39,110
there may be a future in which you know
 

3217
01:01:39,110 --> 01:01:40,840
there may be a future in which you know
there's like cars with light hours and

3218
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:40,850
there's like cars with light hours and
 

3219
01:01:40,850 --> 01:01:43,060
there's like cars with light hours and
everything and the cameras but you know

3220
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:43,070
everything and the cameras but you know
 

3221
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,340
everything and the cameras but you know
this in this 50 year ahead future they

3222
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:45,350
this in this 50 year ahead future they
 

3223
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:45,710
this in this 50 year ahead future they
can

3224
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:45,720
can
 

3225
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:48,050
can
drive with cameras as well especially in

3226
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:48,060
drive with cameras as well especially in
 

3227
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:50,060
drive with cameras as well especially in
some isolated environments and cameras

3228
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:50,070
some isolated environments and cameras
 

3229
01:01:50,070 --> 01:01:52,190
some isolated environments and cameras
they go and they do the thing in the

3230
01:01:52,190 --> 01:01:52,200
they go and they do the thing in the
 

3231
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:53,930
they go and they do the thing in the
same future it's very possible that you

3232
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:53,940
same future it's very possible that you
 

3233
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:56,359
same future it's very possible that you
know the white ARS are so cheap and

3234
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:56,369
know the white ARS are so cheap and
 

3235
01:01:56,369 --> 01:01:59,150
know the white ARS are so cheap and
frankly make the software may be a

3236
01:01:59,150 --> 01:01:59,160
frankly make the software may be a
 

3237
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:00,950
frankly make the software may be a
little less compute-intensive

3238
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
little less compute-intensive
 

3239
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,680
little less compute-intensive
at the very least or maybe less

3240
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:03,690
at the very least or maybe less
 

3241
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,089
at the very least or maybe less
complicated so that they can be

3242
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:05,099
complicated so that they can be
 

3243
01:02:05,099 --> 01:02:07,670
complicated so that they can be
certified or or insured there of their

3244
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:07,680
certified or or insured there of their
 

3245
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:09,950
certified or or insured there of their
safety and things like that that it's

3246
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:09,960
safety and things like that that it's
 

3247
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:12,140
safety and things like that that it's
kind of stupid not to put the lidar like

3248
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:12,150
kind of stupid not to put the lidar like
 

3249
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:15,260
kind of stupid not to put the lidar like
imagine this you either put pay money

3250
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:15,270
imagine this you either put pay money
 

3251
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:17,120
imagine this you either put pay money
for the lidar or you pay money for the

3252
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:17,130
for the lidar or you pay money for the
 

3253
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:19,849
for the lidar or you pay money for the
compute and if you don't put the lidar

3254
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:19,859
compute and if you don't put the lidar
 

3255
01:02:19,859 --> 01:02:22,280
compute and if you don't put the lidar
it's a more expensive system because you

3256
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:22,290
it's a more expensive system because you
 

3257
01:02:22,290 --> 01:02:23,839
it's a more expensive system because you
have to put in a lot of compute like

3258
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:23,849
have to put in a lot of compute like
 

3259
01:02:23,849 --> 01:02:26,750
have to put in a lot of compute like
this is another possibility I do think

3260
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:26,760
this is another possibility I do think
 

3261
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,910
this is another possibility I do think
that a lot of the sort of initial

3262
01:02:28,910 --> 01:02:28,920
that a lot of the sort of initial
 

3263
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,890
that a lot of the sort of initial
deployments of self-driving vehicles I

3264
01:02:30,890 --> 01:02:30,900
deployments of self-driving vehicles I
 

3265
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:32,920
deployments of self-driving vehicles I
think they will involve light ARS and

3266
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:32,930
think they will involve light ARS and
 

3267
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:35,770
think they will involve light ARS and
especially either low range or short

3268
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:35,780
especially either low range or short
 

3269
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:38,660
especially either low range or short
either short range or low resolution

3270
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:38,670
either short range or low resolution
 

3271
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,490
either short range or low resolution
light ARS are actually not that hard to

3272
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:40,500
light ARS are actually not that hard to
 

3273
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:43,310
light ARS are actually not that hard to
build in solid state they're still

3274
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:43,320
build in solid state they're still
 

3275
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,589
build in solid state they're still
scanning but like MEMS type of scanning

3276
01:02:45,589 --> 01:02:45,599
scanning but like MEMS type of scanning
 

3277
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:47,089
scanning but like MEMS type of scanning
light ours and things like that they're

3278
01:02:47,089 --> 01:02:47,099
light ours and things like that they're
 

3279
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:48,740
light ours and things like that they're
like they're actually not that hard I

3280
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:48,750
like they're actually not that hard I
 

3281
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:50,540
like they're actually not that hard I
think they will may be kind of playing

3282
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:50,550
think they will may be kind of playing
 

3283
01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:52,220
think they will may be kind of playing
with the spectrum and the phaser eyes

3284
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:52,230
with the spectrum and the phaser eyes
 

3285
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:54,320
with the spectrum and the phaser eyes
they're a little bit harder but but I

3286
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:54,330
they're a little bit harder but but I
 

3287
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:56,780
they're a little bit harder but but I
think like you know putting your mom's

3288
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:56,790
think like you know putting your mom's
 

3289
01:02:56,790 --> 01:02:58,430
think like you know putting your mom's
mirror in there that kind of scans the

3290
01:02:58,430 --> 01:02:58,440
mirror in there that kind of scans the
 

3291
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:00,829
mirror in there that kind of scans the
environment it's not hard the only thing

3292
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:00,839
environment it's not hard the only thing
 

3293
01:03:00,839 --> 01:03:03,170
environment it's not hard the only thing
is that you know you just like with a

3294
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:03,180
is that you know you just like with a
 

3295
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:04,760
is that you know you just like with a
lot of the things that we do nowadays in

3296
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:04,770
lot of the things that we do nowadays in
 

3297
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:06,140
lot of the things that we do nowadays in
developing technology you hit

3298
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:06,150
developing technology you hit
 

3299
01:03:06,150 --> 01:03:08,630
developing technology you hit
fundamental limits of the universe the

3300
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
fundamental limits of the universe the
 

3301
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:11,120
fundamental limits of the universe the
speed of light becomes a problem in when

3302
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:11,130
speed of light becomes a problem in when
 

3303
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:12,650
speed of light becomes a problem in when
you're trying to scan the environment so

3304
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:12,660
you're trying to scan the environment so
 

3305
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,359
you're trying to scan the environment so
you don't get either good resolution or

3306
01:03:14,359 --> 01:03:14,369
you don't get either good resolution or
 

3307
01:03:14,369 --> 01:03:17,420
you don't get either good resolution or
you don't get range but but you know

3308
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:17,430
you don't get range but but you know
 

3309
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,190
you don't get range but but you know
it's still it's something that you can

3310
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:19,200
it's still it's something that you can
 

3311
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:21,800
it's still it's something that you can
put in that affordably so let me jump

3312
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:21,810
put in that affordably so let me jump
 

3313
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:26,750
put in that affordably so let me jump
back to drones you've uh you have a role

3314
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:26,760
back to drones you've uh you have a role
 

3315
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,370
back to drones you've uh you have a role
in the Lockheed Martin alpha pilot

intense interesting application of AI so

3322
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:39,230
intense interesting application of AI so
 

3323
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,750
intense interesting application of AI so
can you tell me about the very basics of

3324
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:41,760
can you tell me about the very basics of
 

3325
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,940
can you tell me about the very basics of
the challenge and where you fit in well

3326
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:43,950
the challenge and where you fit in well
 

3327
01:03:43,950 --> 01:03:45,530
the challenge and where you fit in well
your thoughts are on this problem and

3328
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:45,540
your thoughts are on this problem and
 

3329
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:48,980
your thoughts are on this problem and
it's sort of echoes of the early DARPA

3330
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:48,990
it's sort of echoes of the early DARPA
 

3331
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:51,200
it's sort of echoes of the early DARPA
challenge in the through the desert that

3332
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:51,210
challenge in the through the desert that
 

3333
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:53,530
challenge in the through the desert that
we're seeing now now with drone racing

3334
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:53,540
we're seeing now now with drone racing
 

3335
01:03:53,540 --> 01:03:56,089
we're seeing now now with drone racing
yeah I mean one interesting thing about

3336
01:03:56,089 --> 01:03:56,099
yeah I mean one interesting thing about
 

3337
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:58,640
yeah I mean one interesting thing about
it is that you know people drone racing

3338
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:58,650
it is that you know people drone racing
 

3339
01:03:58,650 --> 01:03:59,410
it is that you know people drone racing
a

3340
01:03:59,410 --> 01:03:59,420
a
 

3341
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,289
a
this is an eSport and so it's much like

3342
01:04:02,289 --> 01:04:02,299
this is an eSport and so it's much like
 

3343
01:04:02,299 --> 01:04:03,849
this is an eSport and so it's much like
you're playing a game but there's a real

3344
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:03,859
you're playing a game but there's a real
 

3345
01:04:03,859 --> 01:04:06,549
you're playing a game but there's a real
drone going in an environment the human

3346
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:06,559
drone going in an environment the human
 

3347
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:08,500
drone going in an environment the human
being is controlling it with goggles on

3348
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:08,510
being is controlling it with goggles on
 

3349
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:11,589
being is controlling it with goggles on
so there's no it is a robot but there's

3350
01:04:11,589 --> 01:04:11,599
so there's no it is a robot but there's
 

3351
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,010
so there's no it is a robot but there's
no AI there's no way I am human being is

3352
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:15,020
no AI there's no way I am human being is
 

3353
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,390
no AI there's no way I am human being is
controlling it and so that's already

3354
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,400
controlling it and so that's already
 

3355
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,030
controlling it and so that's already
there and and I've been interested in

3356
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:19,040
there and and I've been interested in
 

3357
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,030
there and and I've been interested in
this problem for quite a while actually

3358
01:04:21,030 --> 01:04:21,040
this problem for quite a while actually
 

3359
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:23,589
this problem for quite a while actually
from a robot assist point of view and

3360
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:23,599
from a robot assist point of view and
 

3361
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,030
from a robot assist point of view and
that's what's happening in alpha pilot

3362
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:25,040
that's what's happening in alpha pilot
 

3363
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,770
that's what's happening in alpha pilot
which which probably of aggressive

3364
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:26,780
which which probably of aggressive

autonomous aggressive flight the problem

3368
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:31,940
autonomous aggressive flight the problem
 

3369
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,370
autonomous aggressive flight the problem
that I'm interested in you asked about

3370
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:33,380
that I'm interested in you asked about
 

3371
01:04:33,380 --> 01:04:35,260
that I'm interested in you asked about
alpha pod and I'll get there in a second

3372
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:35,270
alpha pod and I'll get there in a second
 

3373
01:04:35,270 --> 01:04:36,579
alpha pod and I'll get there in a second
but the problem that I'm interested in

3374
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:36,589
but the problem that I'm interested in
 

3375
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:39,430
but the problem that I'm interested in
I'd love to build autonomous vehicles

3376
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,440
I'd love to build autonomous vehicles
 

3377
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,190
I'd love to build autonomous vehicles
like like drones that can go far faster

3378
01:04:42,190 --> 01:04:42,200
like like drones that can go far faster
 

3379
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,609
like like drones that can go far faster
than any human possibly can I think we

3380
01:04:45,609 --> 01:04:45,619
than any human possibly can I think we
 

3381
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:47,500
than any human possibly can I think we
should recognize that we as humans have

3382
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:47,510
should recognize that we as humans have
 

3383
01:04:47,510 --> 01:04:50,500
should recognize that we as humans have
you know limitations in how fast we can

3384
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:50,510
you know limitations in how fast we can
 

3385
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:53,349
you know limitations in how fast we can
process information and those are some

3386
01:04:53,349 --> 01:04:53,359
process information and those are some
 

3387
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,420
process information and those are some
biological limitations like we think

3388
01:04:55,420 --> 01:04:55,430
biological limitations like we think
 

3389
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:57,190
biological limitations like we think
about this AI this way too I mean this

3390
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:57,200
about this AI this way too I mean this
 

3391
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,559
about this AI this way too I mean this
has been discussed a lot and this is not

3392
01:04:59,559 --> 01:04:59,569
has been discussed a lot and this is not
 

3393
01:04:59,569 --> 01:05:01,180
has been discussed a lot and this is not
sort of my idea per se but a lot of

3394
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:01,190
sort of my idea per se but a lot of
 

3395
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,160
sort of my idea per se but a lot of
people kind of think about human level

3396
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:03,170
people kind of think about human level
 

3397
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,170
people kind of think about human level
III and they think that you know AI is

3398
01:05:05,170 --> 01:05:05,180
III and they think that you know AI is
 

3399
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:07,000
III and they think that you know AI is
not human level one day it'll be human

3400
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:07,010
not human level one day it'll be human
 

3401
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:08,890
not human level one day it'll be human
level and humans in the eyes they kind

3402
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:08,900
level and humans in the eyes they kind
 

3403
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:11,410
level and humans in the eyes they kind
of interact versus I think that the

3404
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:11,420
of interact versus I think that the
 

3405
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:13,359
of interact versus I think that the
situation really is that humans are at a

3406
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:13,369
situation really is that humans are at a
 

3407
01:05:13,369 --> 01:05:16,180
situation really is that humans are at a
certain place and AI keeps improving and

3408
01:05:16,180 --> 01:05:16,190
certain place and AI keeps improving and
 

3409
01:05:16,190 --> 01:05:18,099
certain place and AI keeps improving and
at some point just crosses off and then

3410
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:18,109
at some point just crosses off and then
 

3411
01:05:18,109 --> 01:05:19,780
at some point just crosses off and then
you know it gets smarter and smarter and

3412
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:19,790
you know it gets smarter and smarter and
 

3413
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:22,900
you know it gets smarter and smarter and
smarter and so drone releasing the same

3414
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:22,910
smarter and so drone releasing the same
 

3415
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:26,589
smarter and so drone releasing the same
issue humans play this game and you know

3416
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:26,599
issue humans play this game and you know
 

3417
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:29,020
issue humans play this game and you know
you have to like react in milliseconds

3418
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:29,030
you have to like react in milliseconds
 

3419
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:31,120
you have to like react in milliseconds
and there's really you know you see

3420
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:31,130
and there's really you know you see
 

3421
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:33,339
and there's really you know you see
something with your eyes and then that

3422
01:05:33,339 --> 01:05:33,349
something with your eyes and then that
 

3423
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:34,780
something with your eyes and then that
information just flows through your

3424
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:34,790
information just flows through your
 

3425
01:05:34,790 --> 01:05:36,789
information just flows through your
brain into your hands so that you can

3426
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:36,799
brain into your hands so that you can
 

3427
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,770
brain into your hands so that you can
command it and there's some also delays

3428
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:38,780
command it and there's some also delays
 

3429
01:05:38,780 --> 01:05:40,089
command it and there's some also delays
and you know getting information back

3430
01:05:40,089 --> 01:05:40,099
and you know getting information back
 

3431
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:41,620
and you know getting information back
and forth but suppose a laser don't

01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:48,460
exist you just just a delay between your
eye and your fingers please delay that a

eye and your fingers please delay that a
 

3437
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:53,020

01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:54,799
building in my research group like
 

3441
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,549
building in my research group like
systems that you know see things at a

01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:11,250
we talked a lot about autonomous car so
 

3453
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:14,270
we talked a lot about autonomous car so
you know we don't get to see it but the

you know like the you're coming through
 

3463
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:26,240
you know like the you're coming through
like like a ramp going into a highway

3464
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:26,250
like like a ramp going into a highway
 

3465
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:29,120
like like a ramp going into a highway
you hit somebody and you're off or you

whatever and I'm I think if you had
 

3475
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:39,640
whatever and I'm I think if you had
enough computer in a car and a very fast

you could shut down the infotainment
 

3483
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,880
you could shut down the infotainment
system and use that kind of computing

3484
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:49,890
system and use that kind of computing
 

3485
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,950
system and use that kind of computing
resources instead of rendering you use

01:06:58,130 --> 01:06:58,140
autonomy and you can you can either take
 

3493
01:06:58,140 --> 01:06:59,660
autonomy and you can you can either take
control of the car and bring it to a

control of the car and bring it to a
 

3495
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:01,610
control of the car and bring it to a
full stop but even even if you can't do

full stop but even even if you can't do
 

3497

full stop but even even if you can't do
that you can deliver what the human is

01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:09,960
able to do that with motor skills and
 

3505
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,720
able to do that with motor skills and
the eyes and you know you can get in

01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:32,310
need to build those computers from the
 

3523
01:07:32,310 --> 01:07:34,070
need to build those computers from the
ground up so that they can ingest all

just on that point really quick is the
 

3529
01:07:39,380 --> 01:07:41,450
just on that point really quick is the
currently what's the bottom like you

3530
01:07:41,450 --> 01:07:41,460
currently what's the bottom like you

mentioned the delays in humans is it the

3532
01:07:44,660 --> 01:07:44,670
mentioned the delays in humans is it the
 

3533
01:07:44,670 --> 01:07:46,730
mentioned the delays in humans is it the
hardware so you work a lot with NVIDIA

3534
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:46,740
hardware so you work a lot with NVIDIA
 

3535
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,040
hardware so you work a lot with NVIDIA
hardware is it the hardware is it the

hardware is it the hardware is it the
 

3537
01:07:49,050 --> 01:07:51,950
hardware is it the hardware is it the
software I think it's both I think it's

3538
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:51,960
software I think it's both I think it's
 

3539
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,360
software I think it's both I think it's
both in fact they need to be

3540
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:53,370
both in fact they need to be
 

3541
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:54,980
both in fact they need to be
co-developed I think in the future I

3542
01:07:54,980 --> 01:07:54,990
co-developed I think in the future I
 

3543
01:07:54,990 --> 01:07:56,210
co-developed I think in the future I
mean that's a little bit what Nvidia

3544
01:07:56,210 --> 01:07:56,220
mean that's a little bit what Nvidia
 

3545
01:07:56,220 --> 01:07:58,760
mean that's a little bit what Nvidia
does sort of like they almost like build

3546
01:07:58,760 --> 01:07:58,770
does sort of like they almost like build
 

3547
01:07:58,770 --> 01:08:00,320
does sort of like they almost like build
the hardware and then they build the

3548
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:00,330
the hardware and then they build the
 

3549
01:08:00,330 --> 01:08:01,730
the hardware and then they build the
neural networks and then they build the

3550
01:08:01,730 --> 01:08:01,740
neural networks and then they build the
 

3551
01:08:01,740 --> 01:08:03,170
neural networks and then they build the
hardware back and the neural networks

3552
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:03,180
hardware back and the neural networks
 

3553
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:05,030
hardware back and the neural networks
back and it goes back and forth but it's

3554
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:05,040
back and it goes back and forth but it's
 

3555
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,190
back and it goes back and forth but it's
that Co design and I think that you know

3556
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:07,200
that Co design and I think that you know
 

3557
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,430
that Co design and I think that you know
like we try to way back we try to build

3558

like we try to way back we try to build
 

3559
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,530
like we try to way back we try to build
a faster own that could use a camera

3560
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:12,540
a faster own that could use a camera
 

3561
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,960
a faster own that could use a camera
image to like track what's moving in

inertial state estimation problems that

3568
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:20,910
inertial state estimation problems that
 

3569
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,910
inertial state estimation problems that
we would solve and you know we just kind

3570
01:08:22,910 --> 01:08:22,920
we would solve and you know we just kind
 

3571
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:24,499
we would solve and you know we just kind
of realize that we're at the limit

3572
01:08:24,499 --> 01:08:24,509
of realize that we're at the limit
 

3573
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:26,660
of realize that we're at the limit
sometimes of you know doing simple tasks

sometimes of you know doing simple tasks
we're at the limit of the camera frame

3576
01:08:28,309 --> 01:08:28,319
we're at the limit of the camera frame
 

3577
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,470
we're at the limit of the camera frame
rate because you know you really want to

3578
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:30,480
rate because you know you really want to
 

3579
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,569

track things you want the camera image

3580
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:32,579
track things you want the camera image
 

3581
01:08:32,579 --> 01:08:35,569
track things you want the camera image
to be 90% kind of like or or some

3582
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:35,579
to be 90% kind of like or or some
 

3583
01:08:35,579 --> 01:08:37,490
to be 90% kind of like or or some
somewhat the same from one frame to the

01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:37,500
somewhat the same from one frame to the
 

3585
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:41,059
somewhat the same from one frame to the
next and why are we at the limit of the

3586
01:08:41,059 --> 01:08:41,069
next and why are we at the limit of the
 

3587
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:43,220
next and why are we at the limit of the
camera frame rate it's because camera

3588
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:43,230
camera frame rate it's because camera
 

3589
01:08:43,230 --> 01:08:45,649
camera frame rate it's because camera
captures data it puts it into some

captures data it puts it into some
 

3591
01:08:45,659 --> 01:08:46,879
captures data it puts it into some

serial connection
 

3593
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:49,189

it could be USB or like there's

3594
01:08:49,189 --> 01:08:49,199
it could be USB or like there's
 

3595
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:50,809
it could be USB or like there's
something called camera serial interface

something called camera serial interface
 

3597
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:53,209
something called camera serial interface
that we use a lot it puts into some

serial connection and copper wires can

3600
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:56,099
serial connection and copper wires can
 

3601
01:08:56,099 --> 01:08:58,729
serial connection and copper wires can
only transmit so much data and you hit

3602
01:08:58,729 --> 01:08:58,739
only transmit so much data and you hit
 

3603
01:08:58,739 --> 01:09:00,529
only transmit so much data and you hit
the Shannon limit on copper wires and

3604
01:09:00,529 --> 01:09:00,539
the Shannon limit on copper wires and
 

3605
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:03,669
the Shannon limit on copper wires and
you know you you hit yet another kind of

3606
01:09:03,669 --> 01:09:03,679
you know you you hit yet another kind of
 

3607
01:09:03,679 --> 01:09:06,559
you know you you hit yet another kind of
Universal limit that you can transfer

3608
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:06,569
Universal limit that you can transfer
 

3609
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:08,059
Universal limit that you can transfer
the data so you have to be much more

3610
01:09:08,059 --> 01:09:08,069
the data so you have to be much more
 

3611
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:10,759
the data so you have to be much more
intelligent on how you capture those

3612
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:10,769
intelligent on how you capture those
 

3613
01:09:10,769 --> 01:09:13,249
intelligent on how you capture those
pixels you can take compute and put it

3614
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:13,259
pixels you can take compute and put it
 

3615
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:16,459
pixels you can take compute and put it
right next to the pixels people are

3616
01:09:16,459 --> 01:09:16,469
right next to the pixels people are
 

3617
01:09:16,469 --> 01:09:19,339
right next to the pixels people are
governed all that you do how hard is to

01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:19,349
governed all that you do how hard is to
 

3619
01:09:19,349 --> 01:09:22,309
governed all that you do how hard is to
get past the bottleneck of the copper

3620
01:09:22,309 --> 01:09:22,319
get past the bottleneck of the copper
 

3621
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:24,709
get past the bottleneck of the copper
wire yeah you need to you need to do a

3622
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
wire yeah you need to you need to do a
 

3623
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,539
wire yeah you need to you need to do a
lot of parallel processing as you can

3624
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:26,549
lot of parallel processing as you can
 

3625
01:09:26,549 --> 01:09:27,950
lot of parallel processing as you can
imagine the same thing happens in the

3626
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:27,960
imagine the same thing happens in the
 

3627
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,509
imagine the same thing happens in the
GPUs you know like the data is

3628
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:29,519
GPUs you know like the data is
 

3629
01:09:29,519 --> 01:09:32,089
GPUs you know like the data is
transferred in parallel somehow it gets

3630
01:09:32,089 --> 01:09:32,099
transferred in parallel somehow it gets
 

3631
01:09:32,099 --> 01:09:34,459
transferred in parallel somehow it gets
into some parallel processing I think

3632
01:09:34,459 --> 01:09:34,469
into some parallel processing I think
 

3633
01:09:34,469 --> 01:09:36,589
into some parallel processing I think
that you know like now we're really kind

3634
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:36,599
that you know like now we're really kind
 

3635
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:38,149
that you know like now we're really kind
of diverted off into so many different

3636
01:09:38,149 --> 01:09:38,159
of diverted off into so many different
 

3637
01:09:38,159 --> 01:09:40,099
of diverted off into so many different
dimensions but great so its aggressive

3638
01:09:40,099 --> 01:09:40,109
dimensions but great so its aggressive
 

3639
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,410
dimensions but great so its aggressive
light how do we make drones see many

3640
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:42,420
light how do we make drones see many
 

3641
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:44,569
light how do we make drones see many
more frame just a second

3642
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:44,579
more frame just a second
 

3643
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:46,700
more frame just a second
in order to enable aggressive fight

3644
01:09:46,700 --> 01:09:46,710
in order to enable aggressive fight
 

3645
01:09:46,710 --> 01:09:48,019
in order to enable aggressive fight
that's a super interesting problem

3646
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:48,029
that's a super interesting problem
 

3647
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:49,339
that's a super interesting problem
that's an interesting problem so but

3648
01:09:49,339 --> 01:09:49,349
that's an interesting problem so but
 

3649
01:09:49,349 --> 01:09:51,349
that's an interesting problem so but
like think about it you have you have

3650
01:09:51,349 --> 01:09:51,359
like think about it you have you have
 

3651
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,350
like think about it you have you have
CPUs you clock them at you know several

3652
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:54,360
CPUs you clock them at you know several
 

3653
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:58,790
CPUs you clock them at you know several
gigahertz we don't clock them faster

3654
01:09:58,790 --> 01:09:58,800
gigahertz we don't clock them faster
 

3655
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,259
gigahertz we don't clock them faster
largely because you know we run into

3656
01:10:00,259 --> 01:10:00,269
largely because you know we run into
 

3657
01:10:00,269 --> 01:10:01,580
largely because you know we run into
some heating issues and things like that

3658
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:01,590
some heating issues and things like that
 

3659
01:10:01,590 --> 01:10:03,919
some heating issues and things like that
but another thing is that 3 gigahertz

3660
01:10:03,919 --> 01:10:03,929
but another thing is that 3 gigahertz
 

3661
01:10:03,929 --> 01:10:07,310
but another thing is that 3 gigahertz
clock light travels kind of like on the

3662
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:07,320
clock light travels kind of like on the
 

3663
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:09,919
clock light travels kind of like on the
order of a few inches or an inch that's

3664
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:09,929
order of a few inches or an inch that's
 

3665
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:12,740
order of a few inches or an inch that's
the size of a chip and so you pass a

3666
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:12,750
the size of a chip and so you pass a
 

3667
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:16,220
the size of a chip and so you pass a
clock cycle and as the clock signal is

3668
01:10:16,220 --> 01:10:16,230
clock cycle and as the clock signal is
 

3669
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:17,870
clock cycle and as the clock signal is
going around in the chip you pass

3670
01:10:17,870 --> 01:10:17,880
going around in the chip you pass
 

3671
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:20,689
going around in the chip you pass
another one and so trying to coordinate

3672
01:10:20,689 --> 01:10:20,699
another one and so trying to coordinate
 

3673
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:22,759
another one and so trying to coordinate
that the design of the complexity of the

3674
01:10:22,759 --> 01:10:22,769
that the design of the complexity of the
 

3675
01:10:22,769 --> 01:10:25,100
that the design of the complexity of the
chip becomes so hard I mean we have hit

3676
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:25,110
chip becomes so hard I mean we have hit
 

3677
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:27,290
chip becomes so hard I mean we have hit
the fundamental limits of the universe

3678
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:27,300
the fundamental limits of the universe
 

3679
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,450
the fundamental limits of the universe
in so many things that we're designing I

3680
01:10:29,450 --> 01:10:29,460
in so many things that we're designing I
 

3681
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:31,250
in so many things that we're designing I
don't know I realize that it's great but

3682
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:31,260
don't know I realize that it's great but
 

3683
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,439
don't know I realize that it's great but
like we can't make transistors smaller

3684
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:33,449
like we can't make transistors smaller
 

3685
01:10:33,449 --> 01:10:34,819
like we can't make transistors smaller
because like quantum effects that

3686
01:10:34,819 --> 01:10:34,829
because like quantum effects that
 

3687
01:10:34,829 --> 01:10:36,470
because like quantum effects that
electrons start to tunnel around

3688
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:36,480
electrons start to tunnel around
 

3689
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:38,300
electrons start to tunnel around
we can't clock it faster

3690
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:38,310
we can't clock it faster
 

3691
01:10:38,310 --> 01:10:40,640
we can't clock it faster
one of the reasons why is because like

3692
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:40,650
one of the reasons why is because like
 

3693
01:10:40,650 --> 01:10:43,640
one of the reasons why is because like
the information doesn't travel faster in

3694
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:43,650
the information doesn't travel faster in
 

3695
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:44,270
the information doesn't travel faster in
the universe

3696
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:44,280
the universe
 

3697
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:46,160
the universe
yeah and we're limited by that same

3698
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:46,170
yeah and we're limited by that same
 

3699
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,710
yeah and we're limited by that same
thing with the laser scanner but so then

3700
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:48,720
thing with the laser scanner but so then
 

3701
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:52,490
thing with the laser scanner but so then
it becomes clear that you know the way

3702
01:10:52,490 --> 01:10:52,500
it becomes clear that you know the way
 

3703
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:55,130
it becomes clear that you know the way
you organize the chip into a CPU or even

3704
01:10:55,130 --> 01:10:55,140
you organize the chip into a CPU or even
 

3705
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,280
you organize the chip into a CPU or even
a GPU you now need to look at how to

3706
01:10:58,280 --> 01:10:58,290
a GPU you now need to look at how to
 

3707
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:00,350
a GPU you now need to look at how to
redesign that if you're gonna stick with

3708
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:00,360
redesign that if you're gonna stick with
 

3709
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,750
redesign that if you're gonna stick with
silicon yes you could go do other things

3710
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:02,760
silicon yes you could go do other things
 

3711
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,430
silicon yes you could go do other things
too I mean there's that too but you

3712
01:11:04,430 --> 01:11:04,440
too I mean there's that too but you
 

3713
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:05,960
too I mean there's that too but you
really almost need to take those

3714
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:05,970
really almost need to take those
 

3715
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,520
really almost need to take those
transistors put them in a different way

3716
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:07,530
transistors put them in a different way
 

3717
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:09,320
transistors put them in a different way
so that the information travels on those

3718
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:09,330
so that the information travels on those
 

3719
01:11:09,330 --> 01:11:12,530
so that the information travels on those
transistors in a different way in a much

3720
01:11:12,530 --> 01:11:12,540
transistors in a different way in a much
 

3721
01:11:12,540 --> 01:11:15,320
transistors in a different way in a much
more way that is specific to the

3722
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:15,330
more way that is specific to the
 

3723
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,090
more way that is specific to the
high-speed cameras coming in and so

3724
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:17,100
high-speed cameras coming in and so
 

3725
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:19,070
high-speed cameras coming in and so
that's one of the things that that we

3726
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,080
that's one of the things that that we
 

3727
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,200
that's one of the things that that we
talk about quite a bit so drone racing

3728
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:21,210
talk about quite a bit so drone racing
 

3729
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:24,440
talk about quite a bit so drone racing
kind of really makes that embodies that

3730
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:24,450
kind of really makes that embodies that
 

3731
01:11:24,450 --> 01:11:26,540
kind of really makes that embodies that
he embodies that and that's what is

3732
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:26,550
he embodies that and that's what is
 

3733
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,030
he embodies that and that's what is
exciting it's exciting for people you

3734
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
exciting it's exciting for people you
 

3735
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:30,860
exciting it's exciting for people you
know students like it it embodies all

3736
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:30,870
know students like it it embodies all
 

3737
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,410
know students like it it embodies all
those problems but going back we're

3738
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:33,420
those problems but going back we're
 

3739
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,480
those problems but going back we're
building coding code and other engine

3740
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:35,490
building coding code and other engine
 

3741
01:11:35,490 --> 01:11:38,530
building coding code and other engine
and that engine I hope one day we'll be

3742
01:11:38,530 --> 01:11:38,540
and that engine I hope one day we'll be
 

3743
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:41,300
and that engine I hope one day we'll be
just like how impactful seatbelts were

3744
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:41,310
just like how impactful seatbelts were
 

3745
01:11:41,310 --> 01:11:46,130
just like how impactful seatbelts were
in in driving I hope so Wow or it could

3746
01:11:46,130 --> 01:11:46,140
in in driving I hope so Wow or it could
 

3747
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:47,900
in in driving I hope so Wow or it could
enable your next generation autonomous

3748
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:47,910
enable your next generation autonomous
 

3749
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,300
enable your next generation autonomous
air taxis and things like that I mean it

3750
01:11:50,300 --> 01:11:50,310
air taxis and things like that I mean it
 

3751
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,220
air taxis and things like that I mean it
sounds crazy but one day we may need to

3752
01:11:52,220 --> 01:11:52,230
sounds crazy but one day we may need to
 

3753
01:11:52,230 --> 01:11:54,170
sounds crazy but one day we may need to
purge that these things if you really

3754
01:11:54,170 --> 01:11:54,180
purge that these things if you really
 

3755
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,690
purge that these things if you really
want to go from Boston to New York in

3756
01:11:56,690 --> 01:11:56,700
want to go from Boston to New York in
 

3757
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:58,430
want to go from Boston to New York in
more than a half hours you may want to

3758
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:58,440
more than a half hours you may want to
 

3759

more than a half hours you may want to
fixed-wing aircraft most of these

3760
01:12:00,350 --> 01:12:00,360
fixed-wing aircraft most of these
 

3761
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,700
fixed-wing aircraft most of these
companies that are kind of doing

3762
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:01,710
companies that are kind of doing
 

3763
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:03,710

Concorde flying cars they're focusing on

3764
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:03,720
Concorde flying cars they're focusing on
 

3765
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:05,600
Concorde flying cars they're focusing on
that but then how do you land it on top

3766
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:05,610
that but then how do you land it on top
 

3767
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:07,400
that but then how do you land it on top
of a building you may need to pull off

3768
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:07,410
of a building you may need to pull off
 

3769
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,980
of a building you may need to pull off
like kind of fast maneuvers for a robot

3770
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:09,990
like kind of fast maneuvers for a robot
 

3771
01:12:09,990 --> 01:12:13,190

so drone racing you know it's being able

3778
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:21,450
so drone racing you know it's being able
 

3779
01:12:21,450 --> 01:12:24,140
so drone racing you know it's being able
to go very faster than anything we can't

3780
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:24,150
to go very faster than anything we can't
 

3781

quadcopter we take your fixed-wing while

3784
01:12:29,960 --> 01:12:29,970
quadcopter we take your fixed-wing while
 

3785
01:12:29,970 --> 01:12:31,400
quadcopter we take your fixed-wing while
you're at it you might as well put some

3786
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:31,410
you're at it you might as well put some
 

3787
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:33,050
you're at it you might as well put some
like rocket engines in the back you just

3788
01:12:33,050 --> 01:12:33,060
like rocket engines in the back you just
 

3789
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:35,060
like rocket engines in the back you just
light it you go through the gate and

3790
01:12:35,060 --> 01:12:35,070
light it you go through the gate and
 

3791
01:12:35,070 --> 01:12:37,280
light it you go through the gate and
everyone looks at it and just said what

3792
01:12:37,280 --> 01:12:37,290
everyone looks at it and just said what
 

3793
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:39,830
everyone looks at it and just said what
just happened yeah and they would say

3794
01:12:39,830 --> 01:12:39,840
just happened yeah and they would say
 

3795
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,390
just happened yeah and they would say
it's impossible for me to do that and

3796
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:41,400
it's impossible for me to do that and
 

3797
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,280
it's impossible for me to do that and
that's closing the same technology gap

3798
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:43,290
that's closing the same technology gap
 

3799
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:47,060
that's closing the same technology gap
that would you know one day steer cars

3800
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:47,070
that would you know one day steer cars
 

3801
01:12:47,070 --> 01:12:49,879
that would you know one day steer cars
out of accidents so but

3802
01:12:49,879 --> 01:12:49,889
out of accidents so but
 

3803
01:12:49,889 --> 01:12:52,689
out of accidents so but
let's get back to the practical which is

3804
01:12:52,689 --> 01:12:52,699
let's get back to the practical which is
 

3805
01:12:52,699 --> 01:12:55,669
let's get back to the practical which is
sort of just getting the thing to work

3806
01:12:55,669 --> 01:12:55,679
sort of just getting the thing to work
 

3807
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:58,040
sort of just getting the thing to work
in a race environment which is kind of

3808
01:12:58,040 --> 01:12:58,050
in a race environment which is kind of
 

3809
01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:00,560
in a race environment which is kind of
what the is another kind of exciting

3810
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:00,570
what the is another kind of exciting
 

3811
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:02,449
what the is another kind of exciting
thing which the DARPA challenge to the

3812
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:02,459
thing which the DARPA challenge to the
 

3813
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:04,879
thing which the DARPA challenge to the
desert did you know theoretically we had

3814
01:13:04,879 --> 01:13:04,889
desert did you know theoretically we had
 

3815
01:13:04,889 --> 01:13:07,520
desert did you know theoretically we had
autonomous vehicles but making them

3816
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:07,530
autonomous vehicles but making them
 

3817
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:10,069
autonomous vehicles but making them
successfully finish a race first of all

3818
01:13:10,069 --> 01:13:10,079
successfully finish a race first of all
 

3819
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:11,929
successfully finish a race first of all
which nobody finished the first year and

3820
01:13:11,929 --> 01:13:11,939
which nobody finished the first year and
 

3821
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:14,870
which nobody finished the first year and
then the second year just to get you

3822
01:13:14,870 --> 01:13:14,880
then the second year just to get you
 

3823
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:16,639
then the second year just to get you
know to finish and really go at a

3824
01:13:16,639 --> 01:13:16,649
know to finish and really go at a
 

3825
01:13:16,649 --> 01:13:18,469
know to finish and really go at a
reasonable time is really difficult

3826
01:13:18,469 --> 01:13:18,479
reasonable time is really difficult
 

3827
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:20,149
reasonable time is really difficult
engineering practically speaking

3828
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:20,159
engineering practically speaking
 

3829
01:13:20,159 --> 01:13:22,549
engineering practically speaking
challenge so that let me ask about the

3830
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:22,559
challenge so that let me ask about the
 

3831
01:13:22,559 --> 01:13:26,750
challenge so that let me ask about the
the Alpha pilot challenge is a I guess a

3832
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:26,760
the Alpha pilot challenge is a I guess a
 

3833
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,120
the Alpha pilot challenge is a I guess a
big prize potentially associated with it

3834
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:29,130
big prize potentially associated with it
 

3835
01:13:29,130 --> 01:13:31,669
big prize potentially associated with it
but let me ask reminiscent of the DARPA

3836
01:13:31,669 --> 01:13:31,679
but let me ask reminiscent of the DARPA
 

3837
01:13:31,679 --> 01:13:34,819
but let me ask reminiscent of the DARPA
Days predictions you think anybody will

3838
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:34,829
Days predictions you think anybody will
 

3839
01:13:34,829 --> 01:13:40,489
Days predictions you think anybody will
finish well not not soon I think that

3840
01:13:40,489 --> 01:13:40,499
finish well not not soon I think that
 

3841
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,810
finish well not not soon I think that
depends on how you set up the race

3842
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:41,820
depends on how you set up the race
 

3843
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:43,429
depends on how you set up the race
course and so if the race course is a

3844
01:13:43,429 --> 01:13:43,439
course and so if the race course is a
 

3845
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:45,290
course and so if the race course is a
slalom course I think people will kind

3846
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:45,300
slalom course I think people will kind
 

3847
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:48,770
slalom course I think people will kind
of do it but can you set up some course

3848
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:48,780
of do it but can you set up some course
 

3849
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,169
of do it but can you set up some course
like literally sunk or you get to design

3850
01:13:51,169 --> 01:13:51,179
like literally sunk or you get to design
 

3851
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:51,529
like literally sunk or you get to design
it

3852
01:13:51,529 --> 01:13:51,539
it
 

3853
01:13:51,539 --> 01:13:54,379
it
there is the algorithm developer can you

3854
01:13:54,379 --> 01:13:54,389
there is the algorithm developer can you
 

3855
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:56,600
there is the algorithm developer can you
set up some course so that you can beat

3856
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:56,610
set up some course so that you can beat
 

3857
01:13:56,610 --> 01:13:59,929
set up some course so that you can beat
the best human when is that gonna happen

3858
01:13:59,929 --> 01:13:59,939
the best human when is that gonna happen
 

3859
01:13:59,939 --> 01:14:02,330
the best human when is that gonna happen
like that's not very easy even just

3860
01:14:02,330 --> 01:14:02,340
like that's not very easy even just
 

3861
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:04,549
like that's not very easy even just
setting up some course if you let the

3862
01:14:04,549 --> 01:14:04,559
setting up some course if you let the
 

3863
01:14:04,559 --> 01:14:06,290
setting up some course if you let the
human that you're competing with set up

3864
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:06,300
human that you're competing with set up
 

3865
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,239
human that you're competing with set up
the course it becomes a worries a lot

3866
01:14:08,239 --> 01:14:08,249
the course it becomes a worries a lot
 

3867
01:14:08,249 --> 01:14:12,379
the course it becomes a worries a lot
harder hmm so how many in the space of

3868
01:14:12,379 --> 01:14:12,389
harder hmm so how many in the space of
 

3869
01:14:12,389 --> 01:14:16,279
harder hmm so how many in the space of
all possible courses are would humans

3870
01:14:16,279 --> 01:14:16,289
all possible courses are would humans
 

3871
01:14:16,289 --> 01:14:18,859
all possible courses are would humans
win and quad machines were a great

3872
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:18,869
win and quad machines were a great
 

3873
01:14:18,869 --> 01:14:20,839
win and quad machines were a great
question let's get to that I want to

3874
01:14:20,839 --> 01:14:20,849
question let's get to that I want to
 

3875
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:22,370
question let's get to that I want to
answer your other question which is like

3876
01:14:22,370 --> 01:14:22,380
answer your other question which is like
 

3877
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:24,919
answer your other question which is like
the DARPA challenge days right what was

3878
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:24,929
the DARPA challenge days right what was
 

3879
01:14:24,929 --> 01:14:26,719
the DARPA challenge days right what was
really hard I think I think we

3880
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:26,729
really hard I think I think we
 

3881
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:28,729
really hard I think I think we
understand we understood what we wanted

3882
01:14:28,729 --> 01:14:28,739
understand we understood what we wanted
 

3883
01:14:28,739 --> 01:14:31,250
understand we understood what we wanted
to build but still building things that

3884
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:31,260
to build but still building things that
 

3885
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,139
to build but still building things that
experimentation that iterated learning

3886
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:33,149
experimentation that iterated learning
 

3887
01:14:33,149 --> 01:14:35,589
experimentation that iterated learning
that takes up a lot of time actually and

3888
01:14:35,589 --> 01:14:35,599
that takes up a lot of time actually and
 

3889
01:14:35,599 --> 01:14:38,810
that takes up a lot of time actually and
and so in my group for example in order

3890
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:38,820
and so in my group for example in order
 

3891
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:41,479
and so in my group for example in order
for us to be able to develop fast we

3892
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:41,489
for us to be able to develop fast we
 

3893
01:14:41,489 --> 01:14:43,580
for us to be able to develop fast we
build like VR environments will take an

3894
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:43,590
build like VR environments will take an
 

3895
01:14:43,590 --> 01:14:45,649
build like VR environments will take an
aircraft will put it in a motion capture

3896
01:14:45,649 --> 01:14:45,659
aircraft will put it in a motion capture
 

3897
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:48,319
aircraft will put it in a motion capture
room big huge motion capture room and

3898
01:14:48,319 --> 01:14:48,329
room big huge motion capture room and
 

3899
01:14:48,329 --> 01:14:51,679
room big huge motion capture room and
we'll fly it in real time will render

3900
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:51,689
we'll fly it in real time will render
 

3901
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:53,239
we'll fly it in real time will render
other images and beam it back to the

3902
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:53,249
other images and beam it back to the
 

3903
01:14:53,249 --> 01:14:56,899
other images and beam it back to the
drone that sounds kind of notionally

3904
01:14:56,899 --> 01:14:56,909
drone that sounds kind of notionally
 

3905
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:58,189
drone that sounds kind of notionally
simple but it's actually hard because

3906
01:14:58,189 --> 01:14:58,199
simple but it's actually hard because
 

3907
01:14:58,199 --> 01:14:59,929
simple but it's actually hard because
now you're trying to fit all that data

3908
01:14:59,929 --> 01:14:59,939
now you're trying to fit all that data
 

3909
01:14:59,939 --> 01:15:02,810
now you're trying to fit all that data
through the air into the drone and so

3910
01:15:02,810 --> 01:15:02,820
through the air into the drone and so
 

3911
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:03,630
through the air into the drone and so
you need to

3912
01:15:03,630 --> 01:15:03,640
you need to
 

3913
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,550
you need to
do a few crazy things to make it happen

3914
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:05,560
do a few crazy things to make it happen
 

3915
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,490
do a few crazy things to make it happen
but once you do that then at least you

3916
01:15:08,490 --> 01:15:08,500
but once you do that then at least you
 

3917
01:15:08,500 --> 01:15:09,870
but once you do that then at least you
can try things if you crash into

3918
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:09,880
can try things if you crash into
 

3919
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,300
can try things if you crash into
something you didn't actually crash so

3920
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:12,310
something you didn't actually crash so
 

3921
01:15:12,310 --> 01:15:14,130
something you didn't actually crash so
it's like the whole drone is in VR we

3922
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:14,140
it's like the whole drone is in VR we
 

3923
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,130
it's like the whole drone is in VR we
can do augmented reality and so on

3924
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:16,140
can do augmented reality and so on
 

3925
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,320
can do augmented reality and so on
and so I think at some point testing

3926
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:19,330
and so I think at some point testing
 

3927
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:20,970
and so I think at some point testing
becomes very important one of the nice

3928
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:20,980
becomes very important one of the nice
 

3929
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:23,130
becomes very important one of the nice
things about alpha pilot is that they

3930
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:23,140
things about alpha pilot is that they
 

3931
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:25,110
things about alpha pilot is that they
built the drone and they build a lot of

3932
01:15:25,110 --> 01:15:25,120
built the drone and they build a lot of
 

3933
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,290
built the drone and they build a lot of
drones and and it's okay to crash in

3934
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:28,300
drones and and it's okay to crash in
 

3935
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:31,440
drones and and it's okay to crash in
fact I think maybe you know the viewers

3936
01:15:31,440 --> 01:15:31,450
fact I think maybe you know the viewers
 

3937
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:33,870
fact I think maybe you know the viewers
may kind of like to see things that

3938
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:33,880
may kind of like to see things that
 

3939
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:35,670
may kind of like to see things that
suppose that potentially could be the

3940
01:15:35,670 --> 01:15:35,680
suppose that potentially could be the
 

3941
01:15:35,680 --> 01:15:37,470
suppose that potentially could be the
most exciting part it could be the

3942
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:37,480
most exciting part it could be the
 

3943
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,060
most exciting part it could be the
exciting part and I think you know as an

3944
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:39,070
exciting part and I think you know as an
 

3945
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:41,250
exciting part and I think you know as an
engineer it's a very different situation

3946
01:15:41,250 --> 01:15:41,260
engineer it's a very different situation
 

3947
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:42,330
engineer it's a very different situation
to be in

3948
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:42,340
to be in
 

3949
01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:45,000
to be in
like in academia a lot of my colleagues

3950
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:45,010
like in academia a lot of my colleagues
 

3951
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:46,350
like in academia a lot of my colleagues
who are actually in this race and

3952
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:46,360
who are actually in this race and
 

3953
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:47,940
who are actually in this race and
they're really great researchers but

3954
01:15:47,940 --> 01:15:47,950
they're really great researchers but
 

3955
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:50,220
they're really great researchers but
I've seen them trying to do similar

3956
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:50,230
I've seen them trying to do similar
 

3957
01:15:50,230 --> 01:15:51,930
I've seen them trying to do similar
things whereby they built this one drone

3958
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:51,940
things whereby they built this one drone
 

3959
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:54,090
things whereby they built this one drone
and you know some somebody with like a

3960
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:54,100
and you know some somebody with like a
 

3961
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:56,760
and you know some somebody with like a
face mask and a glows are going you know

3962
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:56,770
face mask and a glows are going you know
 

3963
01:15:56,770 --> 01:15:58,830
face mask and a glows are going you know
right behind the drone is trying to hold

3964
01:15:58,830 --> 01:15:58,840
right behind the drone is trying to hold
 

3965
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:01,080
right behind the drone is trying to hold
it if it if it falls down imagine you

3966
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:01,090
it if it if it falls down imagine you
 

3967
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:02,940
it if it if it falls down imagine you
don't have to do that I think that's one

3968
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:02,950
don't have to do that I think that's one
 

3969
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:04,200
don't have to do that I think that's one
of the nice things about auto pilot

3970
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:04,210
of the nice things about auto pilot
 

3971
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,120
of the nice things about auto pilot
challenge where you know we have this

3972
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:06,130
challenge where you know we have this
 

3973
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,670
challenge where you know we have this
drones and we're going to design the

3974
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:08,680
drones and we're going to design the
 

3975
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:11,010
drones and we're going to design the
courses in a way that will keep pushing

3976
01:16:11,010 --> 01:16:11,020
courses in a way that will keep pushing
 

3977
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:12,720
courses in a way that will keep pushing
people up until the crashes start to

3978
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:12,730
people up until the crashes start to
 

3979
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:15,780
people up until the crashes start to
happen and you know we'll hopefully sort

3980
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:15,790
happen and you know we'll hopefully sort
 

3981
01:16:15,790 --> 01:16:17,970
happen and you know we'll hopefully sort
of I don't think you want to tell people

3982
01:16:17,970 --> 01:16:17,980
of I don't think you want to tell people
 

3983
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:20,280
of I don't think you want to tell people
crashing is okay if we want to be

3984
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:20,290
crashing is okay if we want to be
 

3985
01:16:20,290 --> 01:16:21,840
crashing is okay if we want to be
careful here but because you know we

3986
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:21,850
careful here but because you know we
 

3987
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:23,340
careful here but because you know we
don't people to crash a lot but

3988
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:23,350
don't people to crash a lot but
 

3989
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:24,900
don't people to crash a lot but
certainly you know we want we want them

3990
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:24,910
certainly you know we want we want them
 

3991
01:16:24,910 --> 01:16:27,060
certainly you know we want we want them
to push it so that you know everybody

3992
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:27,070
to push it so that you know everybody
 

3993
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:29,520
to push it so that you know everybody
crashes once or twice and and and you

3994
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:29,530
crashes once or twice and and and you
 

3995
01:16:29,530 --> 01:16:30,990
crashes once or twice and and and you
know they're really pushing it to their

3996
01:16:30,990 --> 01:16:31,000
know they're really pushing it to their
 

3997
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,090
know they're really pushing it to their
limits and that's where iterated

3998
01:16:33,090 --> 01:16:33,100
limits and that's where iterated
 

3999
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,430
limits and that's where iterated
learning comes in as ever every crash is

4000
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:35,440
learning comes in as ever every crash is
 

4001
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,830
learning comes in as ever every crash is
a lesson is the lesson exactly so in

4002
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:37,840
a lesson is the lesson exactly so in
 

4003
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,930
a lesson is the lesson exactly so in
terms of the space of possible courses

4004
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:39,940
terms of the space of possible courses
 

4005
01:16:39,940 --> 01:16:43,500
terms of the space of possible courses
how do you think about it in in the in

4006
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:43,510
how do you think about it in in the in
 

4007
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,740
how do you think about it in in the in
the war of the video versus machines or

4008
01:16:46,740 --> 01:16:46,750
the war of the video versus machines or
 

4009
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,690
the war of the video versus machines or
do machines when we look at that quite a

4010
01:16:48,690 --> 01:16:48,700
do machines when we look at that quite a
 

4011
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,980
do machines when we look at that quite a
bit I mean I think that you know you

4012
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:49,990
bit I mean I think that you know you
 

4013
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:52,470
bit I mean I think that you know you
will see quickly that like you can

4014
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:52,480
will see quickly that like you can
 

4015
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,440
will see quickly that like you can
design a course and you know in in in

4016
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:55,450
design a course and you know in in in
 

4017
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,240
design a course and you know in in in
certain courses like in the middle

4018
01:16:57,240 --> 01:16:57,250
certain courses like in the middle
 

4019
01:16:57,250 --> 01:17:00,570
certain courses like in the middle
somewhere if if you kind of run through

4020
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:00,580
somewhere if if you kind of run through
 

4021
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:03,120
somewhere if if you kind of run through
the course once you know the Machine

4022
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:03,130
the course once you know the Machine
 

4023
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,420
the course once you know the Machine
gets beaten pretty much consistently by

01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:06,430
gets beaten pretty much consistently by
 

4025
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:08,550
gets beaten pretty much consistently by
slightly but if you go through the

4026
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:08,560
slightly but if you go through the
 

4027
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,040
slightly but if you go through the
course like 10 times humans get beaten

course like 10 times humans get beaten
 

4029
01:17:11,050 --> 01:17:13,710
course like 10 times humans get beaten
very slightly but consistently so humans

01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:13,720
very slightly but consistently so humans

01:17:13,720 --> 01:17:14,970
very slightly but consistently so humans
at some point you know you get confused

4032
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:14,980
at some point you know you get confused
 

4033
01:17:14,980 --> 01:17:17,040
at some point you know you get confused
you get tired and things like that

01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:17,050
you get tired and things like that
 

4035
01:17:17,050 --> 01:17:17,520
you get tired and things like that

01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:28,060
exactly I think I think that kind of
 

4045
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:29,910
exactly I think I think that kind of
thing happens and I realize sort of as

01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:29,920
thing happens and I realize sort of as
 

4047
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,380

01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:33,850
there's the classical things you know
 

4051
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:37,230
there's the classical things you know
that everybody has realized like like if

01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:37,240
that everybody has realized like like if
 

4053
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,970
that everybody has realized like like if
you put in some sort of like strategic

01:17:38,970 --> 01:17:38,980
you put in some sort of like strategic
 

4055
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:40,590
you put in some sort of like strategic
thinking that's a little bit harder for

precision is easy to do so that's what
 

4061
01:17:46,690 --> 01:17:50,640
precision is easy to do so that's what
they excel in and also sort of

4062
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:50,650
they excel in and also sort of
 

4063
01:17:50,650 --> 01:17:53,100
they excel in and also sort of
repeatability is easier to do that's

4064
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:53,110
repeatability is easier to do that's
 

4065
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,380
repeatability is easier to do that's
what they excel in they can you can

4066
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:55,390
what they excel in they can you can
 

4067
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:57,420
what they excel in they can you can
build machines that excel in strategy as

4068
01:17:57,420 --> 01:17:57,430
build machines that excel in strategy as
 

4069
01:17:57,430 --> 01:17:59,100
build machines that excel in strategy as
well and beat humans that way too but

4070
01:17:59,100 --> 01:17:59,110
well and beat humans that way too but
 

4071
01:17:59,110 --> 01:18:02,040
well and beat humans that way too but
that's a lot harder to build I have a

4072
01:18:02,040 --> 01:18:02,050
that's a lot harder to build I have a
 

4073
01:18:02,050 --> 01:18:03,270
that's a lot harder to build I have a
million more questions but in the

4074
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:03,280
million more questions but in the
 

4075
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:06,690
million more questions but in the
interest of time last question yeah what

4076
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:06,700
interest of time last question yeah what
 

4077
01:18:06,700 --> 01:18:08,490
interest of time last question yeah what
is the most beautiful idea you've come

4078
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:08,500
is the most beautiful idea you've come
 

4079
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:09,720
is the most beautiful idea you've come
across in robotics

4080
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:09,730
across in robotics
 

4081
01:18:09,730 --> 01:18:12,270
across in robotics
well their simple equation experiment a

4082
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:12,280
well their simple equation experiment a
 

4083
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:15,030
well their simple equation experiment a
demo simulation piece of software what

4084
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:15,040
demo simulation piece of software what
 

4085
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:19,410
demo simulation piece of software what
just gives you pause that's an

4086
01:18:19,410 --> 01:18:19,420
just gives you pause that's an
 

4087
01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:22,110
just gives you pause that's an
interesting question I have done a lot

4088
01:18:22,110 --> 01:18:22,120
interesting question I have done a lot
 

4089
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:25,320
interesting question I have done a lot
of work myself in decision making so

4090
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:25,330
of work myself in decision making so
 

4091
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:27,360
of work myself in decision making so
I've been interested in that area so you

4092
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:27,370
I've been interested in that area so you
 

4093
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,150
I've been interested in that area so you
know in robotics you have somehow the

4094
01:18:30,150 --> 01:18:30,160
know in robotics you have somehow the
 

4095
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:31,890
know in robotics you have somehow the
field has split into like you know

4096
01:18:31,890 --> 01:18:31,900
field has split into like you know
 

4097
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:33,630
field has split into like you know
there's people who would work on like

4098
01:18:33,630 --> 01:18:33,640
there's people who would work on like
 

4099
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:35,700
there's people who would work on like
perception how robots perceive the

4100
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:35,710
perception how robots perceive the
 

4101
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:37,470
perception how robots perceive the
environment then how do you actually

4102
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:37,480
environment then how do you actually
 

4103
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:39,360
environment then how do you actually
make like decisions and there's people

4104
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:39,370
make like decisions and there's people
 

4105
01:18:39,370 --> 01:18:40,830
make like decisions and there's people
also like how do you interact people

4106
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:40,840
also like how do you interact people
 

4107
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:42,150
also like how do you interact people
interact with drove us is a whole bunch

4108
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:42,160
interact with drove us is a whole bunch
 

4109
01:18:42,160 --> 01:18:44,790
interact with drove us is a whole bunch
of different fields and and you know I I

4110
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:44,800
of different fields and and you know I I
 

4111
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:47,180
of different fields and and you know I I
have admittedly worked a lot on the more

4112
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:47,190
have admittedly worked a lot on the more
 

4113
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:49,440
have admittedly worked a lot on the more
control and decision-making

4114
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:49,450
control and decision-making
 

4115
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:52,710
control and decision-making
than the others and I think that you

4116
01:18:52,710 --> 01:18:52,720
than the others and I think that you
 

4117
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:55,320
than the others and I think that you
know the one equation that has always

4118
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:55,330
know the one equation that has always
 

4119
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:57,990
know the one equation that has always
kind of baffled me is Bellman's equation

4120
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:58,000
kind of baffled me is Bellman's equation
 

4121
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,710
kind of baffled me is Bellman's equation
and so it's it's this person who have

4122
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:01,720
and so it's it's this person who have
 

4123
01:19:01,720 --> 01:19:04,500
and so it's it's this person who have
realized like way back you know more

4124
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:04,510
realized like way back you know more
 

4125
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:08,220
realized like way back you know more
than half a century ago on like how do

4126
01:19:08,220 --> 01:19:08,230
than half a century ago on like how do
 

4127
01:19:08,230 --> 01:19:11,130
than half a century ago on like how do
you actually sit down and if you have

4128
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:11,140
you actually sit down and if you have
 

4129
01:19:11,140 --> 01:19:13,080
you actually sit down and if you have
several variables that you're kind of

4130
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:13,090
several variables that you're kind of
 

4131
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,840
several variables that you're kind of
jointly trying to determine how do you

4132
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:15,850
jointly trying to determine how do you
 

4133
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:16,530
jointly trying to determine how do you
determine that

4134
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:16,540
determine that
 

4135
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:20,280
determine that
and there is one beautiful equation that

4136
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:20,290
and there is one beautiful equation that
 

4137
01:19:20,290 --> 01:19:21,720
and there is one beautiful equation that
you know like today people do

4138
01:19:21,720 --> 01:19:21,730
you know like today people do
 

4139
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:23,460
you know like today people do
reinforcement where we still use it and

4140
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:23,470
reinforcement where we still use it and
 

4141
01:19:23,470 --> 01:19:26,790
reinforcement where we still use it and
and it's it's baffling to me because it

4142
01:19:26,790 --> 01:19:26,800
and it's it's baffling to me because it
 

4143
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,050
and it's it's baffling to me because it
both kind of

4144
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:29,060
both kind of
 

4145
01:19:29,060 --> 01:19:31,180
both kind of
tells you the simplicity because it's a

4146
01:19:31,180 --> 01:19:31,190
tells you the simplicity because it's a
 

4147
01:19:31,190 --> 01:19:33,220
tells you the simplicity because it's a
single equation that anyone can write

4148
01:19:33,220 --> 01:19:33,230
single equation that anyone can write
 

4149
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:35,530
single equation that anyone can write
now we can teach it in the first course

4150
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:35,540
now we can teach it in the first course
 

4151
01:19:35,540 --> 01:19:38,200
now we can teach it in the first course
on decision-making at the same time it

4152
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:38,210
on decision-making at the same time it
 

4153
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:40,420
on decision-making at the same time it
tells you how computation we how hard

4154
01:19:40,420 --> 01:19:40,430
tells you how computation we how hard
 

4155
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:42,940
tells you how computation we how hard
the problem is I feel like my like a lot

4156
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:42,950
the problem is I feel like my like a lot
 

4157
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,410
the problem is I feel like my like a lot
of the things that I've done at MIT for

4158
01:19:44,410 --> 01:19:44,420
of the things that I've done at MIT for
 

4159
01:19:44,420 --> 01:19:45,820
of the things that I've done at MIT for
research has been kind of just this

4160
01:19:45,820 --> 01:19:45,830
research has been kind of just this
 

4161
01:19:45,830 --> 01:19:47,890
research has been kind of just this
fight against computational efficiency

4162
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:47,900
fight against computational efficiency
 

4163
01:19:47,900 --> 01:19:50,440
fight against computational efficiency
things like how can we get it faster to

4164
01:19:50,440 --> 01:19:50,450
things like how can we get it faster to
 

4165
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:52,900
things like how can we get it faster to
the point where we now got to like let's

4166
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:52,910
the point where we now got to like let's
 

4167
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,120
the point where we now got to like let's
just redesign this chip like maybe

4168
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:55,130
just redesign this chip like maybe
 

4169
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:59,440
just redesign this chip like maybe
that's the way but I think it talks

4170
01:19:59,440 --> 01:19:59,450
that's the way but I think it talks
 

4171
01:19:59,450 --> 01:20:01,900
that's the way but I think it talks
about how computationally hard certain

4172
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:01,910
about how computationally hard certain
 

4173
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:05,410
about how computationally hard certain
problems can be by nowadays what people

4174
01:20:05,410 --> 01:20:05,420
problems can be by nowadays what people
 

4175
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:08,290
problems can be by nowadays what people
call curse of dimensionality and so as

4176
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:08,300
call curse of dimensionality and so as
 

4177
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,920
call curse of dimensionality and so as

it's just crazy and and that kind of

it's just crazy and and that kind of

challenges which is quite incredible

4206
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:47,780
challenges which is quite incredible
 

4207
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,140
challenges which is quite incredible
it's just quite incredible so you know I

4208
01:20:50,140 --> 01:20:50,150
it's just quite incredible so you know I
 

4209
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,970
it's just quite incredible so you know I
would say that it's kind of like quite

01:20:51,970 --> 01:20:51,980
would say that it's kind of like quite
 

4211

fields that we think about how little we

4214
01:20:56,590 --> 01:20:56,600
fields that we think about how little we
 

4215
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:59,890
fields that we think about how little we
know you know like and so I think here

4216
01:20:59,890 --> 01:20:59,900
know you know like and so I think here
 

4217
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:01,840
know you know like and so I think here
too you know we know that in the worst

4218
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:01,850
too you know we know that in the worst
 

4219
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:04,870
too you know we know that in the worst
case things are pretty hard but you know

4220
01:21:04,870 --> 01:21:04,880
case things are pretty hard but you know
 

4221
01:21:04,880 --> 01:21:07,510
case things are pretty hard but you know
in practice generally things work so

4222
01:21:07,510 --> 01:21:07,520
in practice generally things work so

it's just kind of its kind of baffling

4224
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:09,610
it's just kind of its kind of baffling
 

4225
01:21:09,610 --> 01:21:12,850
it's just kind of its kind of baffling
decision-making how little we know just

4226
01:21:12,850 --> 01:21:12,860
decision-making how little we know just
 

4227
01:21:12,860 --> 01:21:14,290
decision-making how little we know just
like how little we know about the

4228
01:21:14,290 --> 01:21:14,300
like how little we know about the
 

4229
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:15,970
like how little we know about the
beginning of time how little we know

4230
01:21:15,970 --> 01:21:15,980
beginning of time how little we know
 

4231
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:19,930
beginning of time how little we know
about you know our own future like if

4232
01:21:19,930 --> 01:21:19,940
about you know our own future like if
 

4233
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:21,820
about you know our own future like if
you actually go into like from balanced

4234
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:21,830
you actually go into like from balanced
 

4235
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,710
you actually go into like from balanced
equation all the way down I mean there's

4236
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:23,720
equation all the way down I mean there's
 

4237
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,360
equation all the way down I mean there's
also how little we know about like

4238
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:25,370
also how little we know about like
 

4239
01:21:25,370 --> 01:21:26,950
also how little we know about like
mathematics I mean we don't even know

4240
01:21:26,950 --> 01:21:26,960
mathematics I mean we don't even know
 

4241
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,050

the axioms are like consistent it's just

01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:29,060
the axioms are like consistent it's just
 

4243
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:31,570

crazy yeah yeah I think a good lesson

4244
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:31,580
crazy yeah yeah I think a good lesson
 

4245
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:34,090
crazy yeah yeah I think a good lesson
the lesson there just as you said we

4246
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:34,100
the lesson there just as you said we
 

4247
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,070
the lesson there just as you said we
tend to focus on the worst case or the

4248
01:21:36,070 --> 01:21:36,080
tend to focus on the worst case or the
 

4249
01:21:36,080 --> 01:21:37,450
tend to focus on the worst case or the
the boundaries of everything we're

4250
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:37,460
the boundaries of everything we're
 

4251
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,550
the boundaries of everything we're
studying and then the average case seems

4252
01:21:39,550 --> 01:21:39,560
studying and then the average case seems
 

4253
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,860
studying and then the average case seems
to somehow work out if you think about

4254
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:41,870
to somehow work out if you think about
 

4255
01:21:41,870 --> 01:21:42,930
to somehow work out if you think about
life in general

4256
01:21:42,930 --> 01:21:42,940
life in general
 

4257
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:45,360
life in general
we mess it up a bunch you know we

4258
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:45,370
we mess it up a bunch you know we
 

4259
01:21:45,370 --> 01:21:46,770
we mess it up a bunch you know we
freaked out about a bunch of the

4260
01:21:46,770 --> 01:21:46,780
freaked out about a bunch of the
 

4261
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:48,780
freaked out about a bunch of the
traumatic stuff but in the end it seems

4262
01:21:48,780 --> 01:21:48,790
traumatic stuff but in the end it seems
 

4263
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:50,850
traumatic stuff but in the end it seems
to work out ok yeah that seems like a

4264
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:50,860
to work out ok yeah that seems like a
 

4265
01:21:50,860 --> 01:21:54,240
to work out ok yeah that seems like a
