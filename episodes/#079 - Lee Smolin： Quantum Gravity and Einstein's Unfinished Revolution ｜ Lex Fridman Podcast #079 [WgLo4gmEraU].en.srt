00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:16,610
don't know you don't know this is
 

165
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,460
don't know you don't know this is
science I presume were talking about

166
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,470
science I presume were talking about
 

167
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,970
science I presume were talking about
science and we believe or I believe that

168
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:23,980
science and we believe or I believe that
 

169
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,460
science and we believe or I believe that
there is a world that is independent of

170
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:27,470
there is a world that is independent of
 

171
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,670
there is a world that is independent of
my existence in my experience about it

172
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:30,680
my existence in my experience about it
 

173
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,000
my existence in my experience about it
my knowledge of it and this I call the

174
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,010
my knowledge of it and this I call the
 

175
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,870
my knowledge of it and this I call the
real world so he said science but even

176
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:37,880
real world so he said science but even
 

177
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,210
real world so he said science but even
bigger than science what sure sure I

178
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:40,220
bigger than science what sure sure I
 

179
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,160
bigger than science what sure sure I
need not have said this is science I

180
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:42,170
need not have said this is science I
 

181
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,090
need not have said this is science I
just was you know warming up warming up

182
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,100
just was you know warming up warming up
 

183
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,370
just was you know warming up warming up
okay now that we're warmed up let's take

184
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:48,380
okay now that we're warmed up let's take
 

185
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,520
okay now that we're warmed up let's take
a brief step outside of science is it

186
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:51,530
a brief step outside of science is it
 

187
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,690
a brief step outside of science is it
completely a crazy idea to you that

188
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:54,700
completely a crazy idea to you that
 

189
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,800
completely a crazy idea to you that
everything that exists is merely

190
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:56,810
everything that exists is merely
 

191
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,250
everything that exists is merely
creation of our mind so like there's a

192
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:00,260
creation of our mind so like there's a
 

193
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:02,800
creation of our mind so like there's a
few not many this is outside of science

194
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:02,810
few not many this is outside of science
 

195
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,740
few not many this is outside of science
now people who believe sort of

196
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:05,750
now people who believe sort of
 

197
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,530
now people who believe sort of
perception is fundamentally what's in

198
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:08,540
perception is fundamentally what's in
 

199
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:10,569
perception is fundamentally what's in
our human perception the visual cortex

200
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:10,579
our human perception the visual cortex
 

201
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,960
our human perception the visual cortex
and so on the the cognitive constructs

202
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:13,970
and so on the the cognitive constructs
 

203
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,259
and so on the the cognitive constructs
that's being formed there is the reality

204
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:17,269
that's being formed there is the reality
 

205
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,320
that's being formed there is the reality
and then anything outside is something

206
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,330
and then anything outside is something
 

207
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:22,779
and then anything outside is something
that we can never really grasp that's

208
00:04:22,779 --> 00:04:22,789
that we can never really grasp that's
 

209
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:24,100
that we can never really grasp that's
the crazy idea too

210
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,110
the crazy idea too
 

211
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,020
the crazy idea too
there's a version of that that is not

212
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,030
there's a version of that that is not
 

213
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,159
there's a version of that that is not
crazy at all what we experienced is

214
00:04:30,159 --> 00:04:30,169
crazy at all what we experienced is
 

215
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,089
crazy at all what we experienced is
constructed by our brains and by our

216
00:04:34,089 --> 00:04:34,099
constructed by our brains and by our
 

217
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:40,390
constructed by our brains and by our
brains in an active mode so we don't see

218
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:40,400
brains in an active mode so we don't see
 

219
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,330
brains in an active mode so we don't see
the raw world we see a very processed

220
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:43,340
the raw world we see a very processed
 

221
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,700
the raw world we see a very processed
world we feel something was very

222
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:45,710
world we feel something was very
 

223
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:47,649
world we feel something was very
processed through our brains and our

224
00:04:47,649 --> 00:04:47,659
processed through our brains and our
 

225
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,800
processed through our brains and our
brains are incredible but I still

226
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:50,810
brains are incredible but I still
 

227
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,869
brains are incredible but I still
believe that behind that experience that

228
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:55,879
believe that behind that experience that
 

229
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:58,779
believe that behind that experience that
mirror fail or whatever you want to call

230
00:04:58,779 --> 00:04:58,789
mirror fail or whatever you want to call
 

231
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,269
mirror fail or whatever you want to call
it there is a real world and I'm curious

232
00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:01,279
it there is a real world and I'm curious
 

233
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,140
it there is a real world and I'm curious
about it can we truly how do we get a

234
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,150
about it can we truly how do we get a
 

235
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,420
about it can we truly how do we get a
sense of that real world is it through

236
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:07,430
sense of that real world is it through
 

237
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,700
sense of that real world is it through
the tools of physics from theory to the

238
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:09,710
the tools of physics from theory to the
 

239
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,119
the tools of physics from theory to the
experiments or can we actually grasp it

240
00:05:13,119 --> 00:05:13,129
experiments or can we actually grasp it
 

241
00:05:13,129 --> 00:05:16,260
experiments or can we actually grasp it
in in some intuitive way that's more

242
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,270
in in some intuitive way that's more
 

243
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:21,580
in in some intuitive way that's more
connected to our ape ancestors or is it

244
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:21,590
connected to our ape ancestors or is it
 

245
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,469
connected to our ape ancestors or is it
still fundamentally the tools of math

246
00:05:23,469 --> 00:05:23,479
still fundamentally the tools of math
 

247
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,350
still fundamentally the tools of math
and physics that really allow us to grow

248
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:26,360
and physics that really allow us to grow
 

249
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,469
and physics that really allow us to grow
so let's talk about what tools they are

250
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
so let's talk about what tools they are
 

251
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,029
so let's talk about what tools they are
what you say are the tools of math and

252
00:05:31,029 --> 00:05:31,039
what you say are the tools of math and
 

253
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,610
what you say are the tools of math and
physics I mean I think we're in the same

254
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:33,620
physics I mean I think we're in the same
 

255
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,600
physics I mean I think we're in the same
position as our ancestors in the caves

256
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:37,610
position as our ancestors in the caves
 

257
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:40,689
position as our ancestors in the caves
or before the caves or whatever we find

258
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:40,699
or before the caves or whatever we find
 

259
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:42,399
or before the caves or whatever we find
ourselves in this world and we're

260
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:42,409
ourselves in this world and we're
 

261
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:46,570
ourselves in this world and we're
curious we also it's important to be

262
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:46,580
curious we also it's important to be
 

263
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,089
curious we also it's important to be
able to explain what happens when there

264
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:49,099
able to explain what happens when there
 

265
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,980
able to explain what happens when there
are fires when they're not fighters what

266
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:50,990
are fires when they're not fighters what
 

267
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,040
are fires when they're not fighters what
animals and plants are good to eat and

268
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,050
animals and plants are good to eat and
 

269
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:57,189
animals and plants are good to eat and
all that stuff and but we're also just

270
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:57,199
all that stuff and but we're also just
 

271
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,320
all that stuff and but we're also just
curious we look up in the sky and we see

272
00:05:59,320 --> 00:05:59,330
curious we look up in the sky and we see
 

273
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,499
curious we look up in the sky and we see
the Sun and the moon and the stars and

274
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:02,509
the Sun and the moon and the stars and
 

275
00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:05,290
the Sun and the moon and the stars and
we see some of those move in we're good

276
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,300
we see some of those move in we're good
 

277
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,540
we see some of those move in we're good
we're very curious about that I think

278
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:07,550
we're very curious about that I think
 

279
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,490
we're very curious about that I think
we're just naturally curious so we make

280
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:12,500
we're just naturally curious so we make
 

281
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,240
we're just naturally curious so we make
up this is my version of what I were we

282
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:16,250
up this is my version of what I were we
 

283
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,879
up this is my version of what I were we
make up stories and explanations and

284
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:20,889
make up stories and explanations and
 

285
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,700
make up stories and explanations and
where there are two things which I think

286
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:24,710
where there are two things which I think
 

287
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:28,119
where there are two things which I think
are just true of being human we make

288
00:06:28,119 --> 00:06:28,129
are just true of being human we make
 

289
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:31,329
are just true of being human we make
judgments fast because we have to we're

290
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:31,339
judgments fast because we have to we're
 

291
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:34,809
judgments fast because we have to we're
to survive we is that a tiger is that

292
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:34,819
to survive we is that a tiger is that
 

293
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:36,129
to survive we is that a tiger is that
not a tiger

294
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:36,139
not a tiger
 

295
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:39,909
not a tiger
and we go act we have to act fast on

296
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:39,919
and we go act we have to act fast on
 

297
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,029
and we go act we have to act fast on
incomplete information so we we judge

298
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:43,039
incomplete information so we we judge
 

299
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,240
incomplete information so we we judge
quickly and we're off and wrong but at

300
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,250
quickly and we're off and wrong but at
 

301
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,770
quickly and we're off and wrong but at
least sometimes wrong which is all I

302
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:47,780
least sometimes wrong which is all I
 

303
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,950
least sometimes wrong which is all I
need for this we're off in Iran so we

304
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:50,960
need for this we're off in Iran so we
 

305
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,020
need for this we're off in Iran so we
fool ourselves and we fool other people

306
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,030
fool ourselves and we fool other people
 

307
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:58,689
fool ourselves and we fool other people
readily and so there's lots of stories

308
00:06:58,689 --> 00:06:58,699
readily and so there's lots of stories
 

309
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:02,890
readily and so there's lots of stories
that get told and some of them result in

310
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:02,900
that get told and some of them result in
 

311
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,869
that get told and some of them result in
a concrete benefit and some of them

312
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:04,879
a concrete benefit and some of them
 

313
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,740
a concrete benefit and some of them
don't and so he said we're often wrong

314
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:08,750
don't and so he said we're often wrong
 

315
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,700
don't and so he said we're often wrong
but what does it mean to be right right

316
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:12,710
but what does it mean to be right right
 

317
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,249
but what does it mean to be right right
that's that's the that's a that's an

318
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:15,259
that's that's the that's a that's an
 

319
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:17,339
that's that's the that's a that's an

this is the observer our human mind

this is the observer our human mind
 

803
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,490
this is the observer our human mind
consciousness have a role in this

realism view of the physical universe
 

807
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,370

there's two ways there's two questions

808
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:29,380
there's two ways there's two questions
 

809
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:33,810
there's two ways there's two questions
you can be asking it does our conscious

810
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:33,820
you can be asking it does our conscious
 

811
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,480
you can be asking it does our conscious
mind you are perceptions play a role in

812
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:36,490
mind you are perceptions play a role in
 

813
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:39,540
mind you are perceptions play a role in
making things become in making things

814
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:39,550
making things become in making things
 

815
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,510
making things become in making things
real or if things becoming that's

816
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:42,520
real or if things becoming that's
 

817
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,890
real or if things becoming that's
question one question two is does this

818
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:45,900
question one question two is does this
 

819
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,260
question one question two is does this
we can call it a naturalist view of the

820
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:49,270
we can call it a naturalist view of the
 

821
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:55,500
we can call it a naturalist view of the
world that is based on realism allow a

822
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:55,510
world that is based on realism allow a
 

823
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,230
world that is based on realism allow a
place to understand the existence of and

824
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,240
place to understand the existence of and
 

825
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,060
place to understand the existence of and
the nature of perceptions and

826
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:00,070
the nature of perceptions and
 

827
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,040
the nature of perceptions and
consciousness in mind and that's

828
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,050
consciousness in mind and that's
 

829
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,520
consciousness in mind and that's
question two

830
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:03,530
question two
 

831
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,710
question two
question two I do think a lot about and

832
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:06,720
question two I do think a lot about and
 

833
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,250
question two I do think a lot about and
my answer which is nine answers I hope

834
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,260
my answer which is nine answers I hope
 

835
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:14,360
my answer which is nine answers I hope
so but it certainly doesn't yet so what

836
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:14,370
so but it certainly doesn't yet so what
 

837
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,270
so but it certainly doesn't yet so what
question one I don't think so but of

838
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:17,280
question one I don't think so but of
 

839
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,650
question one I don't think so but of
course the answer to question one

840
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:18,660
course the answer to question one
 

841
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,280
course the answer to question one
depends on question two right so I'm not

842
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:22,290
depends on question two right so I'm not
 

843
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:24,680
depends on question two right so I'm not
up to question one yeah the question two

844
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:24,690
up to question one yeah the question two
 

845
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,090
up to question one yeah the question two
is the thing that you can kind of

846
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:26,100
is the thing that you can kind of
 

847
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,660
is the thing that you can kind of
struggle with at this time as what about

848
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:29,670
struggle with at this time as what about
 

849
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:35,330
struggle with at this time as what about
the anti-realists so what flavour what

850
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,340
the anti-realists so what flavour what
 

851
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,860
the anti-realists so what flavour what
are the different camps of anti-realist

852
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:36,870
are the different camps of anti-realist
 

853
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,870
are the different camps of anti-realist
that you've talked about I think it'd be

854
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:38,880
that you've talked about I think it'd be
 

855
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,710
that you've talked about I think it'd be
nice if you can articulate for the

856
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:42,720
nice if you can articulate for the
 

857
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,510
nice if you can articulate for the
people for whom there is not a very

00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:44,520
people for whom there is not a very
 

859
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:47,390
people for whom there is not a very
concrete real world as there's divisions

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:03,540
oh well that's you mean will we ever get
 

955
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,330
oh well that's you mean will we ever get
there and know that we're there yeah

956
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,340
there and know that we're there yeah
 

957
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,790
there and know that we're there yeah
exactly that's not mine that's for

958
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:07,800
exactly that's not mine that's for
 

959
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,950
exactly that's not mine that's for
people 5,000 years in the future we're

960
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:09,960
people 5,000 years in the future we're
 

961
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:14,480
people 5,000 years in the future we're
certainly nowhere near there yeah do you

962
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,490
certainly nowhere near there yeah do you
 

963
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:17,810
certainly nowhere near there yeah do you
think reality that exists our sight

964
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:17,820
think reality that exists our sight
 

965
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,380
think reality that exists our sight
outside of our mind do you think there's

966
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:21,390
outside of our mind do you think there's
 

967
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:24,710
outside of our mind do you think there's
a limit to our cognitive abilities is

968
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:24,720
a limit to our cognitive abilities is
 

969
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,230
a limit to our cognitive abilities is
again descendants of apes for just

970
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:27,240
again descendants of apes for just
 

971
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,720
again descendants of apes for just
biological systems is there a limit to

972
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:29,730
biological systems is there a limit to
 

973
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:32,030
biological systems is there a limit to
our minds capability to actually

974
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,040
our minds capability to actually
 

975
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:37,700
our minds capability to actually
understand reality sort of there comes a

976
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:37,710
understand reality sort of there comes a
 

977
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,120

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:41,130
point even with the help of the tools of
 

979
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,320
point even with the help of the tools of
physics that we just cannot grasp some

980
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,330
physics that we just cannot grasp some
 

981
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,060
physics that we just cannot grasp some
fundamental aspects of that again I

982
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:47,070
fundamental aspects of that again I
 

983
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,070
fundamental aspects of that again I
think that's a question for 5,000 years

984
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,080
think that's a question for 5,000 years
 

985
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,670
think that's a question for 5,000 years
in the future element I think there is a

986
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:52,680
in the future element I think there is a
 

987
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,160
in the future element I think there is a
universality here I don't agree with

988
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:55,170
universality here I don't agree with
 

989
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:57,050
universality here I don't agree with

David Deutsch about everything but I

David Deutsch about everything but I
admire the way he put things in his last

992
00:23:59,930 --> 00:23:59,940
admire the way he put things in his last
 

993
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,720
admire the way he put things in his last
book and he talked about the role of

994
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:02,730
book and he talked about the role of
 

995
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,750
book and he talked about the role of
explanation and he talked about the

996
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:05,760
explanation and he talked about the
 

997
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,020
explanation and he talked about the
universality of certain languages of the

universality of certain languages of the
 

999
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:12,590
universality of certain languages of the

universality of mathematics or of
 

1001
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,550
universality of mathematics or of

00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:16,560
computing and so forth and he believed
 

1003
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,010
computing and so forth and he believed
that universality which is something

1004
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,020
that universality which is something
 

1005
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,310
that universality which is something
real which is it somehow comes out of

00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:22,320
real which is it somehow comes out of
 

1007
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,110
real which is it somehow comes out of
the fact that the symbolic system in a

the fact that the symbolic system in a

00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,350
the fact that the symbolic system in a
mathematical system can refer to itself

00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
mathematical system can refer to itself
 

1011
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,050
mathematical system can refer to itself
and in every I forget what that's called

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:30,060
and in every I forget what that's called
 

1013
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:30,830

1018
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:38,280
argued for a universality of possibility
 

1019
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,030
argued for a universality of possibility
for our understanding whatever is out

for our understanding whatever is out

there but I'm I admire that argument but

1022
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:45,420
there but I'm I admire that argument but
 

1023
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,690
there but I'm I admire that argument but
I it seems to me we're doing okay so far

1024
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:50,700
I it seems to me we're doing okay so far
 

1025
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,410
I it seems to me we're doing okay so far
but we'll have to see whether there is a

1026
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:54,420
but we'll have to see whether there is a
 

1027
00:24:54,420 --> 00:24:56,240
but we'll have to see whether there is a
limit or not for now we got we got

1028
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:56,250
limit or not for now we got we got
 

1029
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,880
limit or not for now we got we got
plenty to play with yeah there are

1030
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:58,890
plenty to play with yeah there are
 

1031
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,830
plenty to play with yeah there are
things which are right there in front of

1032
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:00,840
things which are right there in front of
 

1033
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,460
things which are right there in front of
us which we miss and I'll quote my

1034
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:04,470
us which we miss and I'll quote my
 

1035
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,060

recently did it occur to anybody to put

1050
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:27,090
recently did it occur to anybody to put
 

1051
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:30,740
recently did it occur to anybody to put
a wheel on luggage and pull it and it

1052
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:30,750
a wheel on luggage and pull it and it
 

1053
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,900
a wheel on luggage and pull it and it
was right there waiting to be invented

yeah what do the wheels represent are

1058
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:40,590
yeah what do the wheels represent are
 

1059
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,080
yeah what do the wheels represent are
you basically saying that there's stuff

1060
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,090
you basically saying that there's stuff
 

1061
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,510
you basically saying that there's stuff
right in front of our eyes that once we

1062
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:44,520
right in front of our eyes that once we
 

1063
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,060
right in front of our eyes that once we
it just clicks we put the wheels in the

1064
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,070
it just clicks we put the wheels in the
 

1065
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,550
it just clicks we put the wheels in the
luggage a lot of things will fall into

1066
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:49,560

place yes that I do I do and every day I

1068
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:53,880
place yes that I do I do and every day I
 

1069
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,330
place yes that I do I do and every day I
wake up and think why can't I be that

1070
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:56,340
wake up and think why can't I be that
 

1071

guy who was walking through the airport
 

1073
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,880
guy who was walking through the airport
what do you think it takes to be that

1074
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:01,890
what do you think it takes to be that
 

1075
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,400
what do you think it takes to be that
guy

1076
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:03,410
guy
 

1077
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:06,290
guy
because link you said a lot of really

1078
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:06,300
because link you said a lot of really
 

1079
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,260
because link you said a lot of really
smart people carried their luggage

1080
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:08,270
smart people carried their luggage
 

1081
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,840
smart people carried their luggage
mm-hmm what just psychologically

1082
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:11,850
mm-hmm what just psychologically
 

1083
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,580
mm-hmm what just psychologically
speaking so Erik wants that is a good

1084
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:13,590
speaking so Erik wants that is a good
 

1085
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,050
speaking so Erik wants that is a good
example of a person who thinks outside

the box yes who resists almost

1088
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:18,830
the box yes who resists almost
 

1089
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,860

conventional thinking you're an example

1090
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:21,870
conventional thinking you're an example
 

1091
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,480
conventional thinking you're an example
of a person who by habit by psychology

1092
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:26,490
of a person who by habit by psychology
 

1093
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:29,630

by upbringing I don't know but resists

1094
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:29,640
by upbringing I don't know but resists
 

1095
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,460

Nature that's that's a compliment

1098
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:33,870

1099
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:36,980
Nature that's that's a compliment
good so what do you think it takes to do

1100
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:36,990
good so what do you think it takes to do
 

1101
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,300
good so what do you think it takes to do
that is that something you were just

1102
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:38,310
that is that something you were just
 

1103
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:44,640
that is that something you were just
born with I doubt it well from my

studying some cases because I'm curious

1106
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
studying some cases because I'm curious
 

1107
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,830
studying some cases because I'm curious
about that obviously and just in a more

1108
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:50,840
about that obviously and just in a more
 

1109
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,100
about that obviously and just in a more
concrete way when I start out in physics

1110
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,110
concrete way when I start out in physics
 

1111
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:56,790
concrete way when I start out in physics
because I started a long way from

1112
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:56,800
because I started a long way from
 

1113
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,310
because I started a long way from
physics so it took me a long not a long

1114
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,320
physics so it took me a long not a long
 

1115
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,310
physics so it took me a long not a long
time but a lot of work to get to study

1116
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:03,320
time but a lot of work to get to study
 

1117
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,110
time but a lot of work to get to study
it and get into so I did wonder about

1118
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
it and get into so I did wonder about
 

1119
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,510
it and get into so I did wonder about
that and so I read the biographies and

1120
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:10,520
that and so I read the biographies and
 

1121
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,130
that and so I read the biographies and
in fact I started with the autobiography

1122
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,140
in fact I started with the autobiography
 

1123
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,850
in fact I started with the autobiography
of Einstein and Newton in Galileo and

1124
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:14,860
of Einstein and Newton in Galileo and
 

1125
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,890
of Einstein and Newton in Galileo and
all those all those people and I think

1126
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:19,900
all those all those people and I think
 

1127
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,320
all those all those people and I think
there's a couple of things some of it is

1128
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,330
there's a couple of things some of it is
 

1129
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:25,030
there's a couple of things some of it is
luck being in the right place the right

1130
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:25,040
luck being in the right place the right

some of it is stubbornness and arrogance

1134
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:28,700
some of it is stubbornness and arrogance
 

1135
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,370
some of it is stubbornness and arrogance
which can easily go wrong

1136
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:30,380
which can easily go wrong
 

1137
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,770
which can easily go wrong
yes and I know I know all of these are

1138
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:34,780
yes and I know I know all of these are
 

1139

they're their ways to fail but if you
 

1145
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,820
they're their ways to fail but if you
somehow have the right look the right

1155
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,000
exceeded other people of his time so he
asked more stubborn questions he asked

1156

asked more stubborn questions he asked
 

1157
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:13,000

deeper questions I think and there's a

1158
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,010
deeper questions I think and there's a
 

1159
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:16,920
deeper questions I think and there's a
level of ability and whether ability is

what's the role of ego in that process

00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:38,080
quantum mechanics gives you two ways to
 

1301
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,879
quantum mechanics gives you two ways to
evolve situations in time one of them is

1302
00:31:41,879 --> 00:31:41,889
evolve situations in time one of them is
 

1303
00:31:41,889 --> 00:31:44,850
evolve situations in time one of them is
explicitly when no observer is observing

1304
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:44,860
explicitly when no observer is observing
 

1305
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,009
explicitly when no observer is observing
or no measurement is taking place and

1306
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:47,019
or no measurement is taking place and
 

1307
00:31:47,019 --> 00:31:48,810
or no measurement is taking place and
the other is when a measurement or

1308
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:48,820
the other is when a measurement or
 

1309
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,940
the other is when a measurement or
observation is taking place and they can

1310
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:50,950
observation is taking place and they can
 

1311
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,159
observation is taking place and they can
treat they basically contradict each

1312
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:53,169
treat they basically contradict each
 

1313
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:55,950
treat they basically contradict each
other but there's another reason why the

1314
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:55,960
other but there's another reason why the
 

1315
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,990
other but there's another reason why the
revolution wasn't completed which is we

1316
00:31:57,990 --> 00:31:58,000
revolution wasn't completed which is we
 

1317
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,369
revolution wasn't completed which is we
don't understand the relationship

1318
00:31:59,369 --> 00:31:59,379
don't understand the relationship
 

1319
00:31:59,379 --> 00:32:01,560
don't understand the relationship

most part general relativity describes
 

1329

big things

big things

big things
quantum theory describes little things

1332
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:17,470
quantum theory describes little things
 

1333
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,129
quantum theory describes little things
and that's the revolution that we found

1334
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:20,139
and that's the revolution that we found
 

1335
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:22,649
and that's the revolution that we found
really powerful tools to describe big

1336
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:22,659
really powerful tools to describe big
 

1337
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:24,330
really powerful tools to describe big
things and little things and it's

1338
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:24,340
things and little things and it's
 

1339
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,570
things and little things and it's
unfinished because you wouldn't have two

1340
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:27,580
unfinished because you wouldn't have two
 

1341
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,369
unfinished because you wouldn't have two
totally separate things and we need to

1342
00:32:29,369 --> 00:32:29,379
totally separate things and we need to
 

1343
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:31,259
totally separate things and we need to
figure out how to connect them so it can

1344
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:31,269
figure out how to connect them so it can
 

1345
00:32:31,269 --> 00:32:33,389
figure out how to connect them so it can
describe everything right and we either

1346
00:32:33,389 --> 00:32:33,399
describe everything right and we either
 

1347
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:36,690
describe everything right and we either
do that if we believe quantum mechanics

1348
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:36,700
do that if we believe quantum mechanics
 

1349
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,889
do that if we believe quantum mechanics

1359
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,570
domain that's called quantize the theory
of gravity or if you believe with

1360
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:54,580
of gravity or if you believe with
 

1361
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,299
of gravity or if you believe with
Einstein that quantum mechanics needs to

1362
00:32:57,299 --> 00:32:57,309
Einstein that quantum mechanics needs to
 

1363
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,560
Einstein that quantum mechanics needs to
be completed and this is my view then

1364
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,570
be completed and this is my view then
 

1365
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,960
be completed and this is my view then
part of the job of finding the right

1366
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:03,970
part of the job of finding the right
 

1367
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:06,090

completion or extension of quantum

1368
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:06,100
completion or extension of quantum
 

1369
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,519
completion or extension of quantum
mechanics would be one that incorporated

1370
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:08,529
mechanics would be one that incorporated
 

1371
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:14,460
mechanics would be one that incorporated
space-time in gravity so where do we

1372
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:14,470
space-time in gravity so where do we
 

1373
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,509
space-time in gravity so where do we
begin so first let me ask perhaps you

1374
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:18,519
begin so first let me ask perhaps you
 

1375
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:20,310
begin so first let me ask perhaps you
can give me a chance if I could ask you

1376
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
can give me a chance if I could ask you
 

1377
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,230
can give me a chance if I could ask you
some just really basic questions well

1378
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:22,240
some just really basic questions well
 

1379
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:22,770
some just really basic questions well
there

1380
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:22,780
there
 

1381
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:24,480
there
at all the basic questions and the

1382
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,490
at all the basic questions and the
 

1383
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:26,490
at all the basic questions and the
hardest but you mentioned space-time

1384
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:26,500
hardest but you mentioned space-time
 

1385
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,270
hardest but you mentioned space-time
what is space-time space-time you talked

1386
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:30,280
what is space-time space-time you talked
 

1387
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:33,150
what is space-time space-time you talked
about a construction so I believe the

1388
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:33,160
about a construction so I believe the
 

1389
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,700
about a construction so I believe the
space-time is a intellectual

1390
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:35,710
space-time is a intellectual
 

1391
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,580
space-time is a intellectual
construction that we make of the events

1392
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:38,590
construction that we make of the events
 

1393
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,200
construction that we make of the events
in the universe I believe the events are

1394
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:40,210
in the universe I believe the events are
 

1395
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:43,170
in the universe I believe the events are
real and the relationships between the

1396
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,180
real and the relationships between the
 

1397
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:45,810
real and the relationships between the
events which cause which are real but

1398
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:45,820
events which cause which are real but
 

1399
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:49,940
events which cause which are real but
the idea that here is a four-dimensional

1400
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:49,950
the idea that here is a four-dimensional
 

1401
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:53,160
the idea that here is a four-dimensional
smooth geometry which has a metric in

1402
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,170
smooth geometry which has a metric in
 

1403
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,920
smooth geometry which has a metric in
the connection and satisfies the

1404
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:55,930
the connection and satisfies the
 

1405
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:57,630
the connection and satisfies the
equations that Einstein wrote it's a

00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:57,640
equations that Einstein wrote it's a
 

1407
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,630
equations that Einstein wrote it's a
good description to some scale it's a

1408
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:00,640
good description to some scale it's a
 

1409
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,820
good description to some scale it's a
good approximation it captures some of

1410
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:02,830
good approximation it captures some of
 

1411
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,250
good approximation it captures some of
what's really going on in nature but I

1412
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:05,260
what's really going on in nature but I
 

1413
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,500
what's really going on in nature but I
don't believe it for a minute is

1414
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:07,510
don't believe it for a minute is
 

1415
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,370
don't believe it for a minute is
fundamental so okay let's we're gonna

1416
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:10,380
fundamental so okay let's we're gonna
 

1417
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,780
fundamental so okay let's we're gonna
allow me to linger on that so the

1418
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:12,790
allow me to linger on that so the
 

1419
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,540
allow me to linger on that so the
universe has events events cause other

1420
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:15,550
universe has events events cause other
 

1421
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:18,380
universe has events events cause other
events there's this idea of causality

1422
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:18,390
events there's this idea of causality
 

1423
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:23,880
events there's this idea of causality
okay so that that's happy let's in my in

1424
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:23,890
okay so that that's happy let's in my in
 

1425
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,640
okay so that that's happy let's in my in
your view Israel or hypothesis so the

1426
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:26,650
your view Israel or hypothesis so the
 

1427
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:29,790
your view Israel or hypothesis so the
theories that I have been working to

1428
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:29,800
theories that I have been working to
 

1429
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,440
theories that I have been working to
develop make that assumption

1430
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:31,450
develop make that assumption
 

1431
00:34:31,450 --> 00:34:34,830
develop make that assumption
so space-time you said four dimensional

1432
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:34,840
so space-time you said four dimensional
 

1433
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,050
so space-time you said four dimensional
space is kind of the location of things

1434
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:37,060
space is kind of the location of things
 

1435
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,040
space is kind of the location of things
and time is whatever the heck time is

1436
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:41,050
and time is whatever the heck time is
 

1437
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:46,970
and time is whatever the heck time is
and you're saying that space-time is

1438
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:46,980
and you're saying that space-time is
 

1439
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,730
and you're saying that space-time is
both space and time are emergent and not

1440
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:50,740
both space and time are emergent and not
 

1441
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:52,800
both space and time are emergent and not
fundamental no sorry

1442
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:52,810
fundamental no sorry
 

1443
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:56,700
fundamental no sorry
before you correct me what is mean to be

1444
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:56,710
before you correct me what is mean to be
 

1445
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:59,460
before you correct me what is mean to be
fundamental or emergent fundamental

1446
00:34:59,460 --> 00:34:59,470
fundamental or emergent fundamental
 

1447
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:01,620
fundamental or emergent fundamental
means it's part of the description as

1448
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:01,630
means it's part of the description as
 

1449
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:05,190
means it's part of the description as
far down as you go we have real yes as

1450
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:05,200
far down as you go we have real yes as
 

1451
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,800
far down as you go we have real yes as
real as real it could be yeah so I think

1452
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:07,810
real as real it could be yeah so I think
 

1453
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:11,040
real as real it could be yeah so I think
the time is fundamental and quote goes

1454
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,050
the time is fundamental and quote goes
 

1455
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,100
the time is fundamental and quote goes
all the way down and space does not and

1456
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:14,110
all the way down and space does not and
 

1457
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,710
all the way down and space does not and
the combination of them we use in

1458
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
the combination of them we use in
 

1459
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,150
the combination of them we use in
general relativity that we call

1460
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
general relativity that we call
 

1461
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,530
general relativity that we call
space-time also it is not but what is

1462
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:21,540
space-time also it is not but what is
 

1463
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:28,350
space-time also it is not but what is
time then I think that time the activity

1464
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:28,360
time then I think that time the activity
 

1465
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,140
time then I think that time the activity
of time is the continual creation of

1466
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,150
of time is the continual creation of
 

1467
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,890
of time is the continual creation of
events from existing event so if there's

1468
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:34,900
events from existing event so if there's
 

1469
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,210
events from existing event so if there's
no events

1470
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:36,220
no events
 

1471
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,339
no events
there's nothing then there's not only

1472
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:38,349
there's nothing then there's not only
 

1473
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:41,940
there's nothing then there's not only
not no time there's no nothing so so I

1474
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:41,950
not no time there's no nothing so so I
 

1475
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,640
not no time there's no nothing so so I
believe that history universe has a

1476
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:44,650
believe that history universe has a
 

1477
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:48,900
believe that history universe has a
history which goes to the past I believe

1478
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:48,910
history which goes to the past I believe
 

1479
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,990
history which goes to the past I believe
that a future does not exist there's a

1480
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
that a future does not exist there's a
 

1481
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,210
that a future does not exist there's a
notion of a present and a notion of the

1482
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,220
notion of a present and a notion of the
 

1483
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,370
notion of a present and a notion of the
past and the past consists of is a story

1484
00:35:59,370 --> 00:35:59,380
past and the past consists of is a story
 

1485
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:03,180
past and the past consists of is a story
about events that took place to our past

1486
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:03,190
about events that took place to our past
 

1487
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:07,970
about events that took place to our past
she said the future doesn't exist yes

1488
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:07,980

 

1489
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:11,870

could you say that again can you try to

1490
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:11,880
could you say that again can you try to
 

1491
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,730
could you say that again can you try to
give me a chance to understand that one

1492
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:14,740
give me a chance to understand that one
 

1493
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,190
give me a chance to understand that one
more time so what the events caused

1494
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:17,200
more time so what the events caused
 

1495
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,180
more time so what the events caused
other events

1496
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,190
other events
 

1497
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:19,920
other events
what is this universe because we'll talk

1498
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:19,930
what is this universe because we'll talk
 

1499
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:22,859
what is this universe because we'll talk
about locality in nonlocality

1500
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:22,869
about locality in nonlocality
 

1501
00:36:22,869 --> 00:36:26,640
about locality in nonlocality
good because it's the crazy I mean it's

1502
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:26,650
good because it's the crazy I mean it's
 

1503
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,400
good because it's the crazy I mean it's
not crazy it's a beautiful set of ideas

1504
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,410
not crazy it's a beautiful set of ideas
 

1505
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:33,809
not crazy it's a beautiful set of ideas
that you you propose but and if because

1506
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:33,819
that you you propose but and if because
 

1507
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,370
that you you propose but and if because
all these fundamental I just like to

1508
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:35,380
all these fundamental I just like to
 

1509
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,390
all these fundamental I just like to
understand it better

1510
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:36,400
understand it better
 

1511
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,359
understand it better
what is him what is the past what is the

1512
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:39,369
what is him what is the past what is the
 

1513
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:43,109
what is him what is the past what is the
future what is the flow of time even the

1514
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:43,119
future what is the flow of time even the
 

1515
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,910
future what is the flow of time even the
era of time in our universe in your view

1516
00:36:46,910 --> 00:36:46,920
era of time in our universe in your view
 

1517
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,760
era of time in our universe in your view
and maybe it was an event right Oh an

1518
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:50,770
and maybe it was an event right Oh an
 

1519
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,450
and maybe it was an event right Oh an
event is where something changes or

1520
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:54,460
event is where something changes or
 

1521
00:36:54,460 --> 00:37:01,109
event is where something changes or
where to I it's hard to say because it's

1522
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,119
where to I it's hard to say because it's
 

1523
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,160
where to I it's hard to say because it's
a primitive concept in the event is a

1524
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,170
a primitive concept in the event is a
 

1525
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:08,460
a primitive concept in the event is a
moment of time within space this is the

1526
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:08,470
moment of time within space this is the
 

1527
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:11,670
moment of time within space this is the
the view and general relativity where

1528
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680
the view and general relativity where
 

1529
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,540
the view and general relativity where
two particles intersect in their paths

1530
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:14,550
two particles intersect in their paths
 

1531
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:18,359
two particles intersect in their paths
or something changes in the path of the

1532
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:18,369
or something changes in the path of the
 

1533
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:22,380
or something changes in the path of the
particle now we are postulating the

1534
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:22,390
particle now we are postulating the
 

1535
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,960
particle now we are postulating the
theories I have two fundamental level a

1536
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:24,970
theories I have two fundamental level a
 

1537
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:27,390
theories I have two fundamental level a
notion which is an elementary notion so

1538
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:27,400
notion which is an elementary notion so
 

1539
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,900
notion which is an elementary notion so
it doesn't have a definition in terms of

1540
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:30,910
it doesn't have a definition in terms of
 

1541
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:32,849
it doesn't have a definition in terms of
other things but it is something

1542
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:32,859
other things but it is something
 

1543
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:35,790
other things but it is something
elementary happening and it's it doesn't

1544
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:35,800
elementary happening and it's it doesn't
 

1545
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,410
elementary happening and it's it doesn't
have a connection to energy or matter or

1546
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:37,420
have a connection to energy or matter or
 

1547
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,970
have a connection to energy or matter or
exchange of any ties to have the

1548
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:38,980
exchange of any ties to have the
 

1549
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,130
exchange of any ties to have the
connection energies at that level

1550
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:41,140
connection energies at that level
 

1551
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,980
connection energies at that level
yeah it involves and that's why the

1552
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:43,990
yeah it involves and that's why the
 

1553
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:47,830
yeah it involves and that's why the
version of a theory of

1554
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:47,840
version of a theory of
 

1555
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,740
version of a theory of
that I've developed with Marina Cortez

1556
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:50,750
that I've developed with Marina Cortez
 

1557
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:51,970
that I've developed with Marina Cortez
and they say by the way I want to

1558
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:51,980
and they say by the way I want to
 

1559
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,580
and they say by the way I want to
mention my collaborators because they've

1560
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:54,590
mention my collaborators because they've
 

1561
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,410
mention my collaborators because they've
been at least as important in this work

1562
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:56,420
been at least as important in this work
 

1563
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,490
been at least as important in this work
as I have marina Cortes in all the works

1564
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:00,500
as I have marina Cortes in all the works
 

1565
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,080
as I have marina Cortes in all the works
since about 2013 2012-2013 about

00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,850
is a philosopher and a professor of law

and that's in your efforts
 

1575
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,830
and that's in your efforts
together with your collaborators to

together with your collaborators to
 

1577
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,440
together with your collaborators to
finish the unfinished revolution so yeah

1578
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:20,450
finish the unfinished revolution so yeah
 

1579
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,690
finish the unfinished revolution so yeah

thinking so in the way you describe

1590
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,140
thinking so in the way you describe
 

1591
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,720
thinking so in the way you describe
causality that's what you mean

1592
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:37,730
causality that's what you mean
 

1593
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,080
causality that's what you mean
of time being fundamental that causality

1594
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,090
of time being fundamental that causality
 

1595
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,680
of time being fundamental that causality
is from the yes and what does it mean

1596
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:44,690
is from the yes and what does it mean
 

1597
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:47,620
is from the yes and what does it mean
for space to not be fundamental to be

you know locality is a thing that you

1656
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:22,970
you know locality is a thing that you
 

1657
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,210
you know locality is a thing that you
know you can affect things close to you

1658
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:25,220
know you can affect things close to you
 

1659
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:28,000
know you can affect things close to you
and don't have an effect on things that

1660
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,010
and don't have an effect on things that
 

1661
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,490
and don't have an effect on things that
are far away mm-hmm it's the thing that

1662
00:40:30,490 --> 00:40:30,500
are far away mm-hmm it's the thing that
 

1663
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,100
are far away mm-hmm it's the thing that
bothers me about gravity in general or

00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:33,110
bothers me about gravity in general or
 

1665
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,680
bothers me about gravity in general or
action in a distance the same thing that

1666
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:35,690

1667
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:38,830

probably bothered Newton or at least he

probably bothered Newton or at least he
 

1669
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:44,530
probably bothered Newton or at least he
said a little bit about it okay so what

1670
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:44,540
said a little bit about it okay so what
 

1671
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,970
said a little bit about it okay so what
do you think about localities it's just

1672
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:45,980
do you think about localities it's just
 

1673
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:50,860
do you think about localities it's just
a construct is it us humans just like

1674
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:50,870
a construct is it us humans just like
 

1675
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,690
a construct is it us humans just like
this idea and are connected to it

1676
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:52,700
this idea and are connected to it
 

1677
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,790
this idea and are connected to it
because we exist in it we need it for

1678
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:54,800
because we exist in it we need it for
 

1679
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,160
because we exist in it we need it for
our survival but it's not fundamental I

1680
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:57,170
our survival but it's not fundamental I
 

1681
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:58,930
our survival but it's not fundamental I
mean it seems crazy for it not to be a

00:40:58,930 --> 00:40:58,940
mean it seems crazy for it not to be a
 

1683
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,020

1687
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,380

a therapist like how do i I'm not a good
therapist okay there are several

1690
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,120
therapist okay there are several
 

1691
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,960

different definitions of locality when
 

1693
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,790
different definitions of locality when
you come to talk about locality in

1694
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:18,800
you come to talk about locality in
 

1695
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,070
you come to talk about locality in
physics in quantum field theory which is

1696
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:24,080
physics in quantum field theory which is
 

1697
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,370
physics in quantum field theory which is
a mixture of special relativity and

1698
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:27,380
a mixture of special relativity and
 

1699
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,460
a mixture of special relativity and
quantum mechanics there is a precise

00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,470
quantum mechanics there is a precise
 

1701
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,000
quantum mechanics there is a precise
definition of locality operative field

1702

operators corresponding to events in
 

1705
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,380
operators corresponding to events in

you think about the nature realities

1712
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,140
you think about the nature realities

you have an impact on each other more
 

1717
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,550
you have an impact on each other more
than farther away that's yes that's very

00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
than farther away that's yes that's very
 

1719
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,710

comforting that makes sense so that's a
 

1721
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,510
comforting that makes sense so that's a

property of quantum field theory and
 

1723

00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:54,579
realist aspect to it I think you called
it magical realism yeah it's just a

2048
00:49:54,579 --> 00:49:54,589
it magical realism yeah it's just a
 

2049
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:57,910
it magical realism yeah it's just a
beautiful line but at the same time it's

2050
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:57,920
beautiful line but at the same time it's
 

2051
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,339
beautiful line but at the same time it's
very difficult to far eliminate human

2052
00:50:00,339 --> 00:50:00,349
very difficult to far eliminate human
 

2053
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:02,290
very difficult to far eliminate human
minds to comprehend so what it what are

2054
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:02,300
minds to comprehend so what it what are
 

2055
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:06,819
minds to comprehend so what it what are
your thoughts about it let me start with

2056
00:50:06,819 --> 00:50:06,829
your thoughts about it let me start with
 

2057
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:09,400
your thoughts about it let me start with
the easy and obvious and then go to the

2058
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:09,410
the easy and obvious and then go to the
 

2059
00:50:09,410 --> 00:50:13,300
the easy and obvious and then go to the
scientific okay it doesn't appeal to me

2060
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:13,310
scientific okay it doesn't appeal to me
 

2061
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:15,609
scientific okay it doesn't appeal to me
it doesn't answer the questions that I

2062
00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:15,619
it doesn't answer the questions that I
 

2063
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:19,420
it doesn't answer the questions that I
want answered and it does so to such a

2064
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:19,430
want answered and it does so to such a
 

2065
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:21,579
want answered and it does so to such a
strong case that when Roberto mangabeira

2066
00:50:21,579 --> 00:50:21,589
strong case that when Roberto mangabeira
 

2067
00:50:21,589 --> 00:50:24,880

Unger and I began looking for principles

2068
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:24,890
Unger and I began looking for principles
 

2069
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:26,260
Unger and I began looking for principles
and I want to come back and talk about

2070
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:26,270
and I want to come back and talk about
 

2071
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:28,660
and I want to come back and talk about
the use of principles in science cuz

2072
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:28,670
the use of principles in science cuz
 

2073
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:30,130
the use of principles in science cuz
that's the other thing I was gonna say

2074
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:30,140
that's the other thing I was gonna say
 

2075
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,180
that's the other thing I was gonna say
and I don't want to lose that

2076
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:32,190
and I don't want to lose that
 

2077
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:34,130
and I don't want to lose that
when we started looking for principles

2078
00:50:34,130 --> 00:50:34,140
when we started looking for principles
 

2079
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,230
when we started looking for principles
we made our first principle there is

2080
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:36,240
we made our first principle there is
 

2081
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:41,180
we made our first principle there is
just one world that happens once but so

2082
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,190
just one world that happens once but so
 

2083
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:46,370
just one world that happens once but so
it's it's not helpful to my personal

2084
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:46,380
it's it's not helpful to my personal
 

2085
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:49,250
it's it's not helpful to my personal
approach to my personal agenda but of

2086
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:49,260
approach to my personal agenda but of
 

2087
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,859
approach to my personal agenda but of
course I'm part of a community and my

course I'm part of a community and my
 

2089
00:50:54,869 --> 00:50:56,450

sense of the many-worlds interpretation

2090
00:50:56,450 --> 00:50:56,460
sense of the many-worlds interpretation
 

2091
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,730
sense of the many-worlds interpretation
I have thought a lot about it and

2092
00:50:58,730 --> 00:50:58,740
I have thought a lot about it and
 

2093
00:50:58,740 --> 00:51:04,720
I have thought a lot about it and
struggled a lot with it is the following

2094
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:04,730

 

2095
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:07,670

first of all there's Everett himself

2096
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:07,680
first of all there's Everett himself
 

2097
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:11,480
first of all there's Everett himself
there's what's in Everett and there are

2098
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:11,490
there's what's in Everett and there are
 

2099
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:14,359
there's what's in Everett and there are
several issues they're connected with

2100
00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:14,369
several issues they're connected with
 

2101
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:17,060
several issues they're connected with
the derivation of the born rule which is

2102
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:17,070
the derivation of the born rule which is
 

2103
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:19,460
the derivation of the born rule which is
the rule that gives probabilities to

2104
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:19,470
the rule that gives probabilities to
 

2105
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,210
the rule that gives probabilities to
events and the reasons why there is a

2106
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:23,220
events and the reasons why there is a
 

2107
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:26,560
events and the reasons why there is a
problem with probability is that I

2108
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:26,570
problem with probability is that I
 

2109
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:29,450
problem with probability is that I
mentioned the two ways that physical

2110
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:29,460
mentioned the two ways that physical
 

2111
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:31,670
mentioned the two ways that physical
systems can evolve the many-worlds

2112
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:31,680
systems can evolve the many-worlds
 

2113
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:35,060
systems can evolve the many-worlds
interpretation cuts off one the one

2114
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:35,070
interpretation cuts off one the one
 

2115
00:51:35,070 --> 00:51:37,430
interpretation cuts off one the one
having to do with measurement and just

evolution which is smooth evolution of
 

2121
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:44,990
evolution which is smooth evolution of
the quantum state but the notion of

the quantum state but the notion of
 

2123
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,530
the quantum state but the notion of
probability is only in the second rule

probability is only in the second rule
 

2125
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:51,650
probability is only in the second rule
which we've thrown away so where there's

2126
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:51,660
which we've thrown away so where there's
 

2127
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:53,030
which we've thrown away so where there's
probably come from and you have to

2128
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:53,040
probably come from and you have to
 

2129
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,480
probably come from and you have to
answer the question because

2130
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:55,490
answer the question because
 

2131
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,770
answer the question because
experimentalist use probabilities to

2132
00:51:57,770 --> 00:51:57,780
experimentalist use probabilities to
 

2133
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:03,950
experimentalist use probabilities to
check the theory now at first sight you

2134
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:03,960
check the theory now at first sight you
 

2135
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,660
check the theory now at first sight you
get very confused because there seems to

2136
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:05,670
get very confused because there seems to
 

2137
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,930
get very confused because there seems to
be a real problem because in the

00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:08,940
be a real problem because in the
 

2139
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:11,359
be a real problem because in the
many-worlds interpretation the this talk

00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:11,369
many-worlds interpretation the this talk
 

2141
00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:13,550
many-worlds interpretation the this talk
about branches is not quite precise but

2142
00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:13,560
about branches is not quite precise but
 

2143
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,510
about branches is not quite precise but
I'll use it there is a branch in which

2144
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:17,520
I'll use it there is a branch in which
 

2145
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,480
I'll use it there is a branch in which
everything that might happen does happen

2146
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:19,490
everything that might happen does happen
 

2147
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,930
everything that might happen does happen
with probability one in that branch you

2148
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:23,940
with probability one in that branch you
 

2149
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,700
with probability one in that branch you
might think you could count the number

2150
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:25,710
might think you could count the number
 

2151
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,700
might think you could count the number
of branches in which things do and don't

2152
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:28,710
of branches in which things do and don't
 

2153
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:31,820
of branches in which things do and don't
happen and get numbers that you can

2154
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:31,830
happen and get numbers that you can
 

2155
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,589
happen and get numbers that you can
define as something like frequentist

2156
00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:33,599
define as something like frequentist
 

2157
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,240
define as something like frequentist
probabilities and Everett did have an

2158
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:38,250
probabilities and Everett did have an
 

2159
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,480
probabilities and Everett did have an
argument in that direction but the

2160
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:41,490
argument in that direction but the
 

2161
00:52:41,490 --> 00:52:43,700
argument in that direction but the
argument gets very subtle when there are

2162
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:43,710
argument gets very subtle when there are
 

2163
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:44,900
argument gets very subtle when there are
an infinite number of

2164
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:44,910
an infinite number of
 

2165
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:47,630
an infinite number of
abilities as is the case in most quantum

2166
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:47,640
abilities as is the case in most quantum
 

2167
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,740
abilities as is the case in most quantum
systems and my understanding although

2168
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:50,750
systems and my understanding although
 

2169
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,450
systems and my understanding although
I'm not as much of an expert as some

2170
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:53,460
I'm not as much of an expert as some
 

2171
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:55,940
I'm not as much of an expert as some
other people is that Everett's

2172
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:55,950
other people is that Everett's
 

2173
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:59,860
other people is that Everett's
own proposal it's failed did not work

2174
00:52:59,860 --> 00:52:59,870
own proposal it's failed did not work
 

2175
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:05,570
own proposal it's failed did not work
there then it doesn't stop there there

2176
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:05,580
there then it doesn't stop there there
 

2177
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,970
there then it doesn't stop there there
is an important idea that Everett didn't

2178
00:53:07,970 --> 00:53:07,980
is an important idea that Everett didn't
 

2179
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,190
is an important idea that Everett didn't
know about which is decoherence and it

2180
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:10,200
know about which is decoherence and it
 

2181
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,770
know about which is decoherence and it
is a phenomenon that might be very much

2182
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:12,780
is a phenomenon that might be very much
 

2183
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:17,570
is a phenomenon that might be very much
relevant and so a number of people post

2184
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:17,580
relevant and so a number of people post
 

2185
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:21,320
relevant and so a number of people post
Everett have tried to make versions of

2186
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:21,330
Everett have tried to make versions of
 

2187
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,390
Everett have tried to make versions of
what you might call many worlds quantum

2188
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:23,400
what you might call many worlds quantum
 

2189
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:28,820
what you might call many worlds quantum
mechanics and this is a big area and

2190
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:28,830
mechanics and this is a big area and
 

2191
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,070
mechanics and this is a big area and
it's subtle and it's not the kind of

2192
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,080
it's subtle and it's not the kind of
 

2193
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:34,340
it's subtle and it's not the kind of
thing that I do well so I consulted

2194
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:34,350
thing that I do well so I consulted
 

2195
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,140
thing that I do well so I consulted
that's why there's two chapters on this

2196
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:36,150
that's why there's two chapters on this
 

2197
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:38,600
that's why there's two chapters on this
in the book I wrote chapter 10 which is

2198
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:38,610
in the book I wrote chapter 10 which is
 

2199
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,990
in the book I wrote chapter 10 which is
about Everett's version in Chapter 11

2200
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:41,000
about Everett's version in Chapter 11
 

2201
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,820
about Everett's version in Chapter 11

00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:23,630
I just tried to read it and it didn't
make sense to me but I didn't study it

principles in science what does it mean
to have a principle and why is that

down those principles so that's the

down those principles so that's the

00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:39,710
or whatever you would call it but what's
 

2359
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:42,970
or whatever you would call it but what's
the trouble with physics today and how

2360
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:42,980
the trouble with physics today and how
 

2361
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,359
the trouble with physics today and how
do we fix it can I say how I read that

2362
00:57:46,359 --> 00:57:46,369
do we fix it can I say how I read that
 

2363
00:57:46,369 --> 00:57:50,890
do we fix it can I say how I read that
book sure because I and I'm not this of

2364
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:50,900
book sure because I and I'm not this of
 

2365
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:53,220
book sure because I and I'm not this of
course has to be my fault because you

2366
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:53,230
course has to be my fault because you
 

2367
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:56,109
course has to be my fault because you
can't as an author to claim after all

2368
00:57:56,109 --> 00:57:56,119
can't as an author to claim after all
 

2369
00:57:56,119 --> 00:57:58,680
can't as an author to claim after all
the work he put in this you were misread

2370
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:58,690
the work he put in this you were misread
 

2371
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:03,220
the work he put in this you were misread
but I will I will say that many of the

2372
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:03,230
but I will I will say that many of the
 

2373
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:05,950
but I will I will say that many of the
reviewers who were not personally

2374
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:05,960
reviewers who were not personally
 

2375
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,650
reviewers who were not personally
involved in even many who were working

2376
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:08,660
involved in even many who were working
 

2377
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,359
involved in even many who were working
on string theory or some other approach

2378
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:10,369

to quantum gravity told me communicate

2380
00:58:13,539 --> 00:58:13,549
to quantum gravity told me communicate
 

2381
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:15,039
to quantum gravity told me communicate
with me and told me they thought that I

2382
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:15,049
with me and told me they thought that I
 

2383
00:58:15,049 --> 00:58:19,480
with me and told me they thought that I
was fair and balanced was though was the

was fair and balanced was though was the
 

2385
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,400
was fair and balanced was though was the
way that was usually is so let me tell

2386
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:21,410
way that was usually is so let me tell
 

2387
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:23,620
way that was usually is so let me tell
you what my purpose was in writing that

2388
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:23,630
you what my purpose was in writing that
 

2389
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:28,079
you what my purpose was in writing that
book which clearly got diverted by

2390
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:28,089
book which clearly got diverted by
 

2391
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:32,980
book which clearly got diverted by
because there was already a rather hard

2392
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:32,990
because there was already a rather hard
 

2393
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:36,010
because there was already a rather hard
argument going on and this is on which

2394
00:58:36,010 --> 00:58:36,020
argument going on and this is on which
 

2395
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,559
argument going on and this is on which
topic on string theory specifically or

2396
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:38,569
topic on string theory specifically or
 

2397
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:41,980
topic on string theory specifically or
in general and physics know more

2398
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:41,990
in general and physics know more
 

2399
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:46,150
in general and physics know more
specifically than string theory so since

2400
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:46,160
specifically than string theory so since
 

2401
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,829
specifically than string theory so since
we're in Cambridge can I say that we're

2402
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
we're in Cambridge can I say that we're
 

2403
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,799
we're in Cambridge can I say that we're
doing this yeah Cambridge just to be

00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:50,809
doing this yeah Cambridge just to be

good friend of mine and has been for
 

2411
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:07,420
good friend of mine and has been for
many many years and Andy so originally

there was this beautiful idea that there

2414
00:59:09,789 --> 00:59:09,799
there was this beautiful idea that there
 

2415
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:11,890
there was this beautiful idea that there
were five string theories and maybe they

2416
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:11,900
were five string theories and maybe they
 

2417
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:15,039
were five string theories and maybe they
would be unified into one and we would

2418
00:59:15,039 --> 00:59:15,049
would be unified into one and we would
 

2419
00:59:15,049 --> 00:59:18,309
would be unified into one and we would
discover a way to break that symmetries

2420
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:18,319
discover a way to break that symmetries
 

2421
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,400
discover a way to break that symmetries
of one of those string theories

2422
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:20,410
of one of those string theories
 

2423
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,470
of one of those string theories
and discover the standard model and

2424
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:22,480
and discover the standard model and
 

2425
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,170
and discover the standard model and
predict all the properties of standard

2426
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:25,180
predict all the properties of standard
 

2427
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:27,180
predict all the properties of standard
model particles like their masses and

2428
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:27,190
model particles like their masses and
 

2429
00:59:27,190 --> 00:59:30,680
model particles like their masses and
charges and so forth coupling constants

2430
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:30,690
charges and so forth coupling constants

and then there was a bunch of solutions

2432
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:34,980
and then there was a bunch of solutions
 

2433
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,310
and then there was a bunch of solutions
to string theory found which led each of

2434
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:38,320
to string theory found which led each of
 

2435
00:59:38,320 --> 00:59:40,230
to string theory found which led each of
them to a different version of particle

01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:04,170
thousands of different versions of
string theory and then Andy found there

2452
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:04,180
string theory and then Andy found there
 

2453
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,060
string theory and then Andy found there

01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:48,940
worked out that way but nonetheless he
 

2485
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,230
worked out that way but nonetheless he
took that worry to me he did he we spoke

2486
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:52,240
took that worry to me he did he we spoke
 

2487
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:54,720
took that worry to me he did he we spoke
at least once maybe two or three times

at least once maybe two or three times
 

2489
01:00:54,730 --> 01:00:58,140
at least once maybe two or three times
about that and I got seriously worried

2490
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:58,150
about that and I got seriously worried
 

2491
01:00:58,150 --> 01:01:01,590
about that and I got seriously worried
about that and this is just a little

about that and this is just a little
 

2493
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,450
about that and this is just a little
it's almost like an anecdote that

01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:03,460
it's almost like an anecdote that
 

2495
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:06,060
it's almost like an anecdote that
inspired you're worried about string

2496

2497
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:09,180
inspired you're worried about string
theory in general well I tried to solve

01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,190
theory in general well I tried to solve
 

2499
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:11,550
theory in general well I tried to solve
the problem and I tried to solve the

01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:11,560
the problem and I tried to solve the

01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,730
the problem and I tried to solve the

the Baris talked about a landscape a

2518
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:39,940
the Baris talked about a landscape a
 

2519
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,130
the Baris talked about a landscape a
fitness landscape of DNA sequences or

2520
01:01:44,130 --> 01:01:44,140
fitness landscape of DNA sequences or
 

2521
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:47,370
fitness landscape of DNA sequences or
protein synthesis sequences or a species

2522
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:47,380
protein synthesis sequences or a species
 

2523
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,330
protein synthesis sequences or a species
or something like that

2524
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:48,340
or something like that
 

2525
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,580
or something like that
I took their concept and the word

2526
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:50,590
I took their concept and the word
 

2527
01:01:50,590 --> 01:01:53,130
I took their concept and the word
landscape from theoretical biology and

2528
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:53,140
landscape from theoretical biology and
 

2529
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:55,590
landscape from theoretical biology and
made a scenario about how the universe

2530
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:55,600
made a scenario about how the universe
 

2531
01:01:55,600 --> 01:02:00,590
made a scenario about how the universe
as a whole could evolve to discover the

2532
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:00,600
as a whole could evolve to discover the
 

2533
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:03,810
as a whole could evolve to discover the
parameters of the standard model and I'm

2534
01:02:03,810 --> 01:02:03,820
parameters of the standard model and I'm
 

2535
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:04,980
parameters of the standard model and I'm
happy to discuss that's called

2536
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:04,990
happy to discuss that's called
 

2537
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,220
happy to discuss that's called
cosmological natural selection

2538
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:07,230
cosmological natural selection
 

2539
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:10,680
cosmological natural selection
cosmological natural selection yeah so

2540
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:10,690
cosmological natural selection yeah so
 

2541
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,450
cosmological natural selection yeah so
so the parameters of the standard model

2542
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:12,460
so the parameters of the standard model
 

2543
01:02:12,460 --> 01:02:14,280
so the parameters of the standard model
so it says the laws of physics are

2544
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:14,290
so it says the laws of physics are
 

2545
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:17,190
so it says the laws of physics are
changing it this this idea would say

2546
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:17,200
changing it this this idea would say
 

2547
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,620
changing it this this idea would say
that the laws of physics are changing in

2548
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:19,630
that the laws of physics are changing in
 

2549
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:24,090
that the laws of physics are changing in
some way that echoes that of natural

2550
01:02:24,090 --> 01:02:24,100
some way that echoes that of natural
 

2551
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:27,420
some way that echoes that of natural
selection or just it adjusts in some way

2552
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:27,430
selection or just it adjusts in some way
 

2553
01:02:27,430 --> 01:02:31,890
selection or just it adjusts in some way
towards some goal yes and I published

2554
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:31,900
towards some goal yes and I published
 

2555
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:36,210
towards some goal yes and I published
that I wrote the paper in 1880 or 1890

2556
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:36,220
that I wrote the paper in 1880 or 1890
 

2557
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:39,570
that I wrote the paper in 1880 or 1890
paper was published in 92 when I first

01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:42,190
book in 1997 the life of the cosmos was
 

2561
01:02:42,190 --> 01:02:46,230
book in 1997 the life of the cosmos was
explicitly about that and I was very

2562
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:46,240
explicitly about that and I was very
 

2563
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,030
explicitly about that and I was very
clear that what was important is that

2564
01:02:50,030 --> 01:02:50,040
clear that what was important is that
 

2565
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,930
clear that what was important is that
because you would develop an ensemble of

2566
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:53,940
because you would develop an ensemble of
 

2567
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:56,510
because you would develop an ensemble of
universes but they were related by

2568
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:56,520
universes but they were related by
 

2569
01:02:56,520 --> 01:03:01,050
universes but they were related by
descent through natural selection almost

01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:03,460
every universe would share the property
 

2573
01:03:03,460 --> 01:03:07,410
every universe would share the property
that it was its fitness was maximized to

2574
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:07,420
that it was its fitness was maximized to
 

2575
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:10,290
that it was its fitness was maximized to
some extent were these close to maximum

2576
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:10,300
some extent were these close to maximum
 

2577
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,570
some extent were these close to maximum
and I could deduce predictions that

2578
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:12,580
and I could deduce predictions that
 

2579
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:16,980
and I could deduce predictions that
could be tested from that and and I

2580
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:16,990
could be tested from that and and I
 

2581
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,990
could be tested from that and and I
worked all of that out and I compared it

2582
01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:19,000
worked all of that out and I compared it
 

2583
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,760
worked all of that out and I compared it
to the anthropic principle where you

2584
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:20,770
to the anthropic principle where you
 

2585
01:03:20,770 --> 01:03:23,550
to the anthropic principle where you
weren't able to make tests or make

01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:23,560
weren't able to make tests or make
 

2587
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:26,340
weren't able to make tests or make
falsifications all of this was in the

2588
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:26,350
falsifications all of this was in the
 

2589
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,530
falsifications all of this was in the
late eighties and early nineties that's

2590
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:28,540
late eighties and early nineties that's
 

2591
01:03:28,540 --> 01:03:30,720
late eighties and early nineties that's
a really compelling notion but how does

01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:30,730
a really compelling notion but how does

01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:37,680
whatever where the book came from yes so

what we've got me I worked on string

2598
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:42,190
what we've got me I worked on string
 

2599
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:45,950
what we've got me I worked on string
theory I also

2600
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:45,960

Don Luhan gravity and I was one of the

2602
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:48,089
Don Luhan gravity and I was one of the
 

2603
01:03:48,089 --> 01:03:50,260
Don Luhan gravity and I was one of the
inventors of the quantum gravity and

2604
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:50,270
inventors of the quantum gravity and
 

2605
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:54,500
inventors of the quantum gravity and
because of my strong belief in some

2606
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:54,510
because of my strong belief in some
 

2607
01:03:54,510 --> 01:03:56,240
because of my strong belief in some
other principles which led to this

2608
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:56,250
other principles which led to this
 

2609
01:03:56,250 --> 01:03:58,040
other principles which led to this
notion of wanting a quantum theory of

2610
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,050
notion of wanting a quantum theory of
 

2611
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:00,950
notion of wanting a quantum theory of
gravity to be what we call relational or

2612
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
gravity to be what we call relational or
 

2613
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,829
gravity to be what we call relational or
background independent I tried very hard

2614
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:03,839
background independent I tried very hard
 

2615
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,349
background independent I tried very hard
to make string theory backward

2616
01:04:06,349 --> 01:04:06,359
to make string theory backward
 

2617
01:04:06,359 --> 01:04:08,990
to make string theory backward
independent and ended up developing a

2618
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:09,000
independent and ended up developing a
 

2619
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,970
independent and ended up developing a
bunch of tools which then could apply

2620
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:10,980
bunch of tools which then could apply
 

2621
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,800
bunch of tools which then could apply
directly to general relativity and that

2622
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:12,810
directly to general relativity and that
 

2623
01:04:12,810 --> 01:04:15,380
directly to general relativity and that
became a loop quantum gravity so the

2624
01:04:15,380 --> 01:04:15,390
became a loop quantum gravity so the
 

2625
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:17,390
became a loop quantum gravity so the
things were very closely related and

2626
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:17,400
things were very closely related and
 

2627
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,980
things were very closely related and
have always been right closely related

2628
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:18,990
have always been right closely related
 

2629
01:04:18,990 --> 01:04:21,380
have always been right closely related
in my mind the idea that there were two

2630
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:21,390
in my mind the idea that there were two
 

2631
01:04:21,390 --> 01:04:23,450
in my mind the idea that there were two
communities one devoted to strings and

2632
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:23,460
communities one devoted to strings and
 

2633
01:04:23,460 --> 01:04:25,490
communities one devoted to strings and
one devoted to loops is nuts and this

2634
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:25,500
one devoted to loops is nuts and this
 

2635
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:31,130
one devoted to loops is nuts and this
always been nuts okay so so anyway

2636
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:31,140
always been nuts okay so so anyway
 

2637
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,320
always been nuts okay so so anyway
there's this nuts community of loops and

2638
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:33,330
there's this nuts community of loops and
 

2639
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:35,089
there's this nuts community of loops and
strings that are all beautiful and

2640
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:35,099
strings that are all beautiful and
 

2641
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:36,620
strings that are all beautiful and
compelling and mathematically speaking

2642
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:36,630
compelling and mathematically speaking
 

2643
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:38,900
compelling and mathematically speaking
and what's the trouble with all that why

2644
01:04:38,900 --> 01:04:38,910
and what's the trouble with all that why
 

2645
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:40,880
and what's the trouble with all that why
is that why is there such a problem so

2646
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:40,890
is that why is there such a problem so
 

2647
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,450
is that why is there such a problem so
what so I was interested in developing

2648
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:44,460
what so I was interested in developing
 

2649
01:04:44,460 --> 01:04:46,940
what so I was interested in developing
that notion of how science works based

2650
01:04:46,940 --> 01:04:46,950
that notion of how science works based
 

2651
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,890
that notion of how science works based
on a community and ethics that I told

2652
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:48,900
on a community and ethics that I told
 

2653
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:49,810
on a community and ethics that I told
you about

2654
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:49,820
you about
 

2655
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:53,980
you about
and I wrote a draft of a book about that

2656
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:53,990
and I wrote a draft of a book about that
 

2657
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:57,260
and I wrote a draft of a book about that
which had several chapters on

2658
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:57,270
which had several chapters on
 

2659
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,349
which had several chapters on
methodology of science and it was rather

2660
01:05:00,349 --> 01:05:00,359
methodology of science and it was rather
 

2661
01:05:00,359 --> 01:05:04,070
methodology of science and it was rather
academically oriented a book in those

2662
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:04,080
academically oriented a book in those
 

2663
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,470
academically oriented a book in those
chapters were the first part of the book

2664
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:06,480
chapters were the first part of the book
 

2665
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:08,839
chapters were the first part of the book
the first third of it and you even find

2666
01:05:08,839 --> 01:05:08,849
the first third of it and you even find
 

2667
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:10,849
the first third of it and you even find
their remnants in what's now the last

01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:10,859
their remnants in what's now the last

physics and then I described a number of

2672
01:05:16,099 --> 01:05:16,109
physics and then I described a number of
 

2673
01:05:16,109 --> 01:05:19,430
physics and then I described a number of
test cases case studies and one of them

2674
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:19,440
test cases case studies and one of them
 

2675
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,980
test cases case studies and one of them
which I knew was the search for quantum

2676
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:21,990
which I knew was the search for quantum
 

2677
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:24,339
which I knew was the search for quantum
gravity and string theory and so forth

2678
01:05:24,339 --> 01:05:24,349
gravity and string theory and so forth
 

2679
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:27,800
gravity and string theory and so forth
and I was unable to get that book

2680
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:27,810
and I was unable to get that book
 

2681
01:05:27,810 --> 01:05:31,640
and I was unable to get that book
published so somebody made the

2682
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:31,650
published so somebody made the
 

2683
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:34,390
published so somebody made the
suggestion of flipping it around and

2684
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:34,400
suggestion of flipping it around and
 

2685
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,710
suggestion of flipping it around and
starting with a story of string theory

2686
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:36,720
starting with a story of string theory
 

2687
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:40,240
starting with a story of string theory
which was already controversial this was

2688
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:40,250
which was already controversial this was
 

2689
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:47,390
which was already controversial this was
2004-2005 but I was very careful to be

2004-2005 but I was very careful to be
 

2691
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,370
2004-2005 but I was very careful to be

I regret is that the same critique I was

2716
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:35,230
I regret is that the same critique I was
 

2717
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:37,140
I regret is that the same critique I was
using string theory as an example and

01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:37,150
using string theory as an example and

01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:40,320
using string theory as an example and
the same critique applies to many other

the same critique applies to many other
 

2721
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:43,980
the same critique applies to many other
communities in science and all including

communities in science and all including
 

2723
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,780
communities in science and all including
and this is where I regret my own

01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:45,790
and this is where I regret my own

01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:47,520
and this is where I regret my own
community that is a community of people

community that is a community of people

working on quantum gravity outside
 

2729
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:53,790
working on quantum gravity outside
string theory but and I considered

01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:53,800
string theory but and I considered
 

2731
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,460
string theory but and I considered
saying that explicitly but I say that

2732
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:56,470
saying that explicitly but I say that
 

2733
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,470
saying that explicitly but I say that
explicitly since I'm it's a small

2737
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:05,430
intimate community I would be telling
stories and naming names of and making a

2738
01:07:05,430 --> 01:07:05,440
stories and naming names of and making a
 

2739
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:07,760
stories and naming names of and making a
kind of history that I have no right to

2740
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:07,770
kind of history that I have no right to
 

2741
01:07:07,770 --> 01:07:10,500
kind of history that I have no right to
write so I stayed away from that but was

2742
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:10,510
write so I stayed away from that but was
 

2743
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:14,340
write so I stayed away from that but was
misunderstood but if I may ask is there

2744
01:07:14,340 --> 01:07:14,350
misunderstood but if I may ask is there
 

2745
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:17,280
misunderstood but if I may ask is there
