said that proteins and the amino acid

120
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:02,479
said that proteins and the amino acid
 

121
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,429
said that proteins and the amino acid
residues that

122
00:02:03,429 --> 00:02:03,439
residues that
 

123
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,429
residues that
make them up are the building blocks of

124
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:05,439
make them up are the building blocks of
 

125
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,429
make them up are the building blocks of
life do you think of proteins in this

126
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:07,439
life do you think of proteins in this
 

127
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,469
life do you think of proteins in this
way as the

128
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:08,479
way as the
 

129
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,589
way as the
uh basic building blocks of life yes and

130
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:11,599
uh basic building blocks of life yes and
 

131
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,150
uh basic building blocks of life yes and
no

132
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:12,160
no
 

133
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,350
no
so the proteins indeed is the the basic

134
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:15,360
so the proteins indeed is the the basic
 

135
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,869
so the proteins indeed is the the basic
unit biological unit that

136
00:02:18,869 --> 00:02:18,879
unit biological unit that
 

137
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,589
unit biological unit that
carries out uh important functioning of

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,710
carries out uh important functioning of
the cell

00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:22,720
the cell
 

141
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,670

however through studying the proteins

142
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:25,680
however through studying the proteins
 

143
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,350
however through studying the proteins
and comparing the proteins

144
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:27,360
and comparing the proteins
 

145
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,990
and comparing the proteins
across different species across these

146
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,000
across different species across these
 

147
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,350
across different species across these
different kingdoms

148
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,360
different kingdoms
 

149
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,589

you realize that uh proteins are

150
00:02:33,589 --> 00:02:33,599
you realize that uh proteins are
 

151
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,470
you realize that uh proteins are
actually a more

152
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:34,480
actually a more
 

153
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,830
actually a more
much more complicated so they

154
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:37,840
much more complicated so they
 

155
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,229
much more complicated so they
have so-called modular complexity

156
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:42,239
have so-called modular complexity
 

157
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,830
have so-called modular complexity
and so what i mean by that is

158
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
and so what i mean by that is
 

159
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,270
and so what i mean by that is
an average protein consists of

160
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,280
an average protein consists of
 

161
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,550
an average protein consists of
of several structural units

162
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:54,560
of several structural units
 

163
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,670
of several structural units
so we call them protein domains and so

164
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:57,680
so we call them protein domains and so
 

165
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,509
so we call them protein domains and so
you can imagine a protein

166
00:02:59,509 --> 00:02:59,519
you can imagine a protein
 

167
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,589
you can imagine a protein
as a string of beads where each bead is

168
00:03:03,589 --> 00:03:03,599
as a string of beads where each bead is
 

169
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,670
as a string of beads where each bead is
a protein domain

170
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:05,680
a protein domain
 

171
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,790
a protein domain
and uh you know in the past

172
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:08,800
and uh you know in the past
 

173
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,309
and uh you know in the past
20 years scientists have been studying

174
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:12,319
20 years scientists have been studying
 

175
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,869
20 years scientists have been studying
uh the nature of the protein domains

176
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:14,879
uh the nature of the protein domains
 

177
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:15,509
uh the nature of the protein domains
because

178
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
because
 

179
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,350
because
we realize that it's it's it's the unit

180
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,360
we realize that it's it's it's the unit
 

181
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,750
we realize that it's it's it's the unit
because if you look at the functions

182
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:21,760
because if you look at the functions
 

183
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,550
because if you look at the functions
right so so

184
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:22,560
right so so
 

185
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,110
right so so
uh many proteins have more than one

186
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,120
uh many proteins have more than one
 

187
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,910
uh many proteins have more than one
function

188
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:25,920
function
 

189
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,710
function
and those protein functions uh are often

190
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
and those protein functions uh are often
 

191
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,430
and those protein functions uh are often
carried out by those protein domains

192
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:31,440
carried out by those protein domains
 

193
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,350
carried out by those protein domains
so we also see that

194
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:35,360
so we also see that
 

195
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,869
so we also see that
in the evolution those proteins domains

196
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:38,879
in the evolution those proteins domains
 

197
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,190
in the evolution those proteins domains
get

198
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
get
 

199
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,309
get
shuffled so so they act actually as as

200
00:03:42,309 --> 00:03:42,319
shuffled so so they act actually as as
 

201
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,350
shuffled so so they act actually as as
the unit

202
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,360
the unit
 

203
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,949
the unit
also from the structural perspective

204
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:44,959
also from the structural perspective
 

205
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,350
also from the structural perspective
right so you know

206
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:47,360
right so you know
 

207
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,430
right so you know
some people think of a protein as a sort

208
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
some people think of a protein as a sort
 

209
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,070
some people think of a protein as a sort
of a globular

210
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,080
of a globular
 

211
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,830
of a globular
molecule but as a matter of fact is is

212
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:57,840
molecule but as a matter of fact is is
 

213
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,030
molecule but as a matter of fact is is
the globular part of this protein

214
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,040
the globular part of this protein
 

215
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,589
the globular part of this protein
is the protein domain so we we often

216
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:03,599
is the protein domain so we we often
 

217
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,309
is the protein domain so we we often
have

218
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:04,319
have
 

219
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,589
have
this uh you know again the the the

220
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:07,599
this uh you know again the the the
 

221
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,390
this uh you know again the the the
collection of this protein domains align

222
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:12,400
collection of this protein domains align
 

223
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,670
collection of this protein domains align
on a string as beads and uh the protein

224
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:15,680
on a string as beads and uh the protein
 

225
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,349
on a string as beads and uh the protein
domains are made up of amino acid

226
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
domains are made up of amino acid
 

227
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,390
domains are made up of amino acid
residues so

228
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
residues so
 

229
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,629
residues so
it's it's so this is the basic build so

230
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:20,639
it's it's so this is the basic build so
 

231
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,469
it's it's so this is the basic build so
you're saying the protein domain

232
00:04:22,469 --> 00:04:22,479
you're saying the protein domain
 

233
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,629
you're saying the protein domain
is the basic building block of the

234
00:04:24,629 --> 00:04:24,639
is the basic building block of the
 

235
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,830
is the basic building block of the
function that we think about

236
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:26,840
function that we think about
 

237
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,590
function that we think about
proteins doing so of course you can

238
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:29,600
proteins doing so of course you can
 

239
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,870
proteins doing so of course you can
always talk about different building

240
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:30,880
always talk about different building
 

241
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,510
always talk about different building
blocks

242
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:31,520
blocks
 

243
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,430
blocks
turtles all the way down but it's

244
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:33,440
turtles all the way down but it's
 

245
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,070
turtles all the way down but it's
there's a point where there is

246
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,080
there's a point where there is
 

247
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,070
there's a point where there is
at the point of the hierarchy where it's

248
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
at the point of the hierarchy where it's
 

249
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,830
at the point of the hierarchy where it's
the most the cleanest

250
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:40,840
the most the cleanest
 

251
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,070
the most the cleanest
element block

252
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:44,080
element block
 

253
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,070
element block
based on which you can put them together

254
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,080
based on which you can put them together
 

255
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,430
based on which you can put them together
in different kinds of ways

256
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:47,440
in different kinds of ways
 

257
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,430
in different kinds of ways
to form complex function and you're

258
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:49,440
to form complex function and you're
 

259
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,790
to form complex function and you're
saying protein domains

260
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
saying protein domains
 

261
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,590
saying protein domains
why is that not talked about as often in

262
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,600
why is that not talked about as often in
 

263
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,310
why is that not talked about as often in
popular

264
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:54,320
popular
 

265
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,469
popular
culture well you know there are several

266
00:04:56,469 --> 00:04:56,479
culture well you know there are several
 

267
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,430
culture well you know there are several
perspectives

268
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:57,440
perspectives
 

269
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,350
perspectives
on this um and one of course is the

270
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:01,360
on this um and one of course is the
 

271
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,189
on this um and one of course is the
historical perspective right

272
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
historical perspective right
 

273
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,629
historical perspective right
so historically scientists

274
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
so historically scientists
 

275
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,990
so historically scientists
have been able to structurally resolved

276
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,000
have been able to structurally resolved
 

277
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,029
have been able to structurally resolved
to obtain the 3d coordinates of

278
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:13,039
to obtain the 3d coordinates of
 

279
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,070
to obtain the 3d coordinates of
a protein for uh you know for

280
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
a protein for uh you know for
 

281
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,629
a protein for uh you know for
smaller proteins and smaller proteins

282
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:18,639
smaller proteins and smaller proteins
 

283
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,590
smaller proteins and smaller proteins
tend to be

284
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:19,600
tend to be
 

285
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,510
tend to be
a single domain protein so we have a

286
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
a single domain protein so we have a
 

287
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,390
a single domain protein so we have a
protein equal to a protein domain and

288
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:24,400
protein equal to a protein domain and
 

289
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,390
protein equal to a protein domain and
so so because of that the initial

290
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:26,400
so so because of that the initial
 

291
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,749
so so because of that the initial
suspicion was that

292
00:05:27,749 --> 00:05:27,759
suspicion was that
 

293
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,390
suspicion was that
the the the proteins are they have

294
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:30,400
the the the proteins are they have
 

295
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,670
the the the proteins are they have
globular shapes

296
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:31,680
globular shapes
 

297
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,710
globular shapes
and the more of smaller proteins

298
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:34,720
and the more of smaller proteins
 

299
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,270
and the more of smaller proteins
you obtain structurally the more you

300
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:37,280
you obtain structurally the more you
 

301
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:37,749
you obtain structurally the more you
were

302
00:05:37,749 --> 00:05:37,759
were
 

303
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,710
were
you became convinced that that's that's

304
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:40,720
you became convinced that that's that's
 

305
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,749
you became convinced that that's that's
the the case

306
00:05:41,749 --> 00:05:41,759
the the case
 

307
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,790
the the case
and only later when uh we had

308
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:44,800
and only later when uh we had
 

309
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,990
and only later when uh we had
we started having um you know uh

310
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,000
we started having um you know uh
 

311
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,350
we started having um you know uh
alternative approaches so you know the

312
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:51,360
alternative approaches so you know the
 

313
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,909
alternative approaches so you know the
the traditional uh the traditional ones

314
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:53,919
the traditional uh the traditional ones
 

315
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:54,390
the traditional uh the traditional ones
are

316
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:54,400
are
 

317
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,390
are
x-ray crystallography and nmr

318
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:56,400
x-ray crystallography and nmr
 

319
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,550
x-ray crystallography and nmr
spectroscopy so this is sort of the

320
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:58,560
spectroscopy so this is sort of the
 

321
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,909
spectroscopy so this is sort of the
the the two main techniques uh

322
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:01,919
the the two main techniques uh
 

323
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,950
the the two main techniques uh
that uh give us the 3d coordinates but

324
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:04,960
that uh give us the 3d coordinates but
 

325
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,749
that uh give us the 3d coordinates but
nowadays uh there is huge breakthrough

326
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:07,759
nowadays uh there is huge breakthrough
 

327
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,070
nowadays uh there is huge breakthrough
in

328
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
in
 

329
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,430
in
uh cry electron microscopy so the the

330
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:11,440
uh cry electron microscopy so the the
 

331
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,070
uh cry electron microscopy so the the
more advanced methods that allow us to

332
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
more advanced methods that allow us to
 

333
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,790
more advanced methods that allow us to
uh

334
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:14,800
uh
 

335
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,110
uh
you know to get into the uh you know 3d

336
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:19,120
you know to get into the uh you know 3d
 

337
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,350
you know to get into the uh you know 3d
shapes of much larger molecules

338
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:21,360
shapes of much larger molecules
 

339
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,590
shapes of much larger molecules
molecular complexes

340
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:23,600
molecular complexes
 

341
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,469
molecular complexes
to give you uh one of the common

342
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
to give you uh one of the common
 

343
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,670
to give you uh one of the common
examples

344
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:27,680
examples
 

345
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,309
examples
uh for this year right so so the the

346
00:06:30,309 --> 00:06:30,319
uh for this year right so so the the
 

347
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:30,950
uh for this year right so so the the
first

348
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:30,960
first
 

349
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,469
first
experimental structure of a sars

350
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:34,479
experimental structure of a sars
 

351
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,510
experimental structure of a sars
cove to protein was the cribium

352
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:37,520
cove to protein was the cribium
 

353
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,230
cove to protein was the cribium
structure

354
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:38,240
structure
 

355
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,909
structure
of the s protein so the spike protein

356
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:41,919
of the s protein so the spike protein
 

357
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,189
of the s protein so the spike protein
and so it was solved

358
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:45,199
and so it was solved
 

359
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,230
and so it was solved
very quickly and the reason for that is

360
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:48,240
very quickly and the reason for that is
 

361
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:48,629
very quickly and the reason for that is
the

362
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:48,639
the
 

363
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,830
the
advancement of the uh of this technology

364
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:51,840
advancement of the uh of this technology
 

365
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,070
advancement of the uh of this technology
is is pretty spectacular how many

366
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,080
is is pretty spectacular how many
 

367
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,830
is is pretty spectacular how many
domains does the

368
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:55,840
domains does the
 

369
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,070
domains does the
uh is it more than one domain oh yes oh

370
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,080
uh is it more than one domain oh yes oh
 

371
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,430
uh is it more than one domain oh yes oh
yes i mean so so

372
00:06:59,430 --> 00:06:59,440
yes i mean so so
 

373
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,029
yes i mean so so
it's it's a very complex structure and

374
00:07:03,029 --> 00:07:03,039
it's it's a very complex structure and
 

375
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,390
it's it's a very complex structure and
we you know on top of the complexity

376
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:06,400
we you know on top of the complexity
 

377
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,070
we you know on top of the complexity
of a single protein right so this

378
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,080
of a single protein right so this
 

379
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,390
of a single protein right so this
this structure is actually is a complex

380
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,400
this structure is actually is a complex
 

381
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,670
this structure is actually is a complex
it's a trimer

382
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:13,680
it's a trimer
 

383
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,469
it's a trimer
so it needs to form a trimer in order to

384
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:16,479
so it needs to form a trimer in order to
 

385
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,629
so it needs to form a trimer in order to
function properly what's a complex

386
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:18,639
function properly what's a complex
 

387
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,189
function properly what's a complex
so a complex is agglomeration of

388
00:07:21,189 --> 00:07:21,199
so a complex is agglomeration of
 

389
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,790
so a complex is agglomeration of
multiple proteins

390
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:22,800
multiple proteins
 

391
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,390
multiple proteins
and so we can have the same

392
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:26,400
and so we can have the same
 

393
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,230
and so we can have the same
protein copied in multiple uh you know

394
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:30,240
protein copied in multiple uh you know
 

395
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,029
protein copied in multiple uh you know
made up in multiple copies and forming

396
00:07:33,029 --> 00:07:33,039
made up in multiple copies and forming
 

397
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:34,469
made up in multiple copies and forming
something that we called uh

398
00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:34,479
something that we called uh
 

399
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,350
something that we called uh
a homo oligomer homo means the same

400
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:37,360
a homo oligomer homo means the same
 

401
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,070
a homo oligomer homo means the same
right

402
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,080
right
 

403
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,510
right
so so in this case so uh uh sp the spike

404
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:41,520
so so in this case so uh uh sp the spike
 

405
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,710
so so in this case so uh uh sp the spike
protein is the

406
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:42,720
protein is the
 

407
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,350
protein is the
is an example of a homo tetramer uh

408
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,360
is an example of a homo tetramer uh
 

409
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,550
is an example of a homo tetramer uh
homotrimer sorry

410
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
homotrimer sorry
 

411
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,309
homotrimer sorry
so these three copies of the three

412
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:48,319
so these three copies of the three
 

413
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,990
so these three copies of the three
copies in order to

414
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,000
copies in order to
 

415
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,629
copies in order to
exactly we have the these three chains

416
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:52,639
exactly we have the these three chains
 

417
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,869
exactly we have the these three chains
the the three molecular chains uh

418
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:54,879
the the three molecular chains uh
 

419
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,670
the the three molecular chains uh
coupled uh together and performing the

420
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:57,680
coupled uh together and performing the
 

421
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,830
coupled uh together and performing the
the function that's what when when you

422
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
the function that's what when when you
 

423
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,230
the function that's what when when you
look at this protein from from the top

424
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
look at this protein from from the top
 

425
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,830
look at this protein from from the top
you see a perfect triangle

426
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:03,840
you see a perfect triangle
 

427
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,270
you see a perfect triangle
yeah so uh but other uh you know so

428
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:07,280
yeah so uh but other uh you know so
 

429
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,790
yeah so uh but other uh you know so
other complexes are made up

430
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:08,800
other complexes are made up
 

431
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,230
other complexes are made up
of um you know different proteins

432
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,240
of um you know different proteins
 

433
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,270
of um you know different proteins
uh some of them are completely different

434
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
uh some of them are completely different
 

435
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,270
uh some of them are completely different
some of them are similar the the

436
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:17,280
some of them are similar the the
 

437
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,350
some of them are similar the the
hemoglobin molecule right so it's

438
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:19,360
hemoglobin molecule right so it's
 

439
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,990
hemoglobin molecule right so it's
actually

440
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,000
actually
 

441
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,189
actually
it's a protein complex it's made of

442
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:23,199
it's a protein complex it's made of
 

443
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,309
it's a protein complex it's made of
four basic subunits two of them

444
00:08:26,309 --> 00:08:26,319
four basic subunits two of them
 

445
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,110
four basic subunits two of them
uh are identical to each other and two

446
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:29,120
uh are identical to each other and two
 

447
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,629
uh are identical to each other and two
other identical to each other

448
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:30,639
other identical to each other
 

449
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,790
other identical to each other
but they are also similar to each other

450
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
but they are also similar to each other
 

451
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,829
but they are also similar to each other
which sort of

452
00:08:33,829 --> 00:08:33,839
which sort of
 

453
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,230
which sort of
uh gives us some ideas about the

454
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:36,240
uh gives us some ideas about the
 

455
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,670
uh gives us some ideas about the
evolution of this

456
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:37,680
evolution of this
 

457
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,949
evolution of this
uh you know uh of this uh molecule and

458
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
uh you know uh of this uh molecule and
 

459
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,949
uh you know uh of this uh molecule and
uh perhaps so one of the hypothesis is

460
00:08:42,949 --> 00:08:42,959
uh perhaps so one of the hypothesis is
 

461
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,790
uh perhaps so one of the hypothesis is
that you know in the past

462
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:44,800
that you know in the past
 

463
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,910
that you know in the past
it was just a homo tetramer

464
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
it was just a homo tetramer
 

465
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,790
it was just a homo tetramer
right so four identical comp uh copies

466
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:50,800
right so four identical comp uh copies
 

467
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,230
right so four identical comp uh copies
and then it became

468
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:52,240
and then it became
 

469
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,590
and then it became
you know uh sort of uh modify

470
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:55,600
you know uh sort of uh modify
 

471
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,870
you know uh sort of uh modify
it became mutated over the time and and

472
00:08:58,870 --> 00:08:58,880
it became mutated over the time and and
 

473
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,550
it became mutated over the time and and
became more specialized can we

474
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:00,560
became more specialized can we
 

475
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,150
became more specialized can we
linger on the spike protein for a little

476
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
linger on the spike protein for a little
 

477
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,790
linger on the spike protein for a little
bit is is there something interesting

478
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:04,800
bit is is there something interesting
 

479
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,870
bit is is there something interesting
or like beautiful you find about it i

480
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:06,880
or like beautiful you find about it i
 

481
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,990
or like beautiful you find about it i
mean first of all it's

482
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,000
mean first of all it's
 

483
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,269
mean first of all it's
an incredibly challenging protein and so

484
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:11,279
an incredibly challenging protein and so
 

485
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,550
an incredibly challenging protein and so
we as a part of

486
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:12,560
we as a part of
 

487
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,990
we as a part of
uh our sort of research

508
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:41,760
data allows us to
 

509
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,670
data allows us to
reconstruct or to obtain the 3d

510
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
reconstruct or to obtain the 3d
 

511
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,590
reconstruct or to obtain the 3d
coordinates of roughly

512
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
coordinates of roughly
 

513
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,030
coordinates of roughly
two thirds of the protein the

514
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:49,040
two thirds of the protein the
 

515
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,910
two thirds of the protein the
rest of the one-third of this protein

516
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:51,920
rest of the one-third of this protein
 

517
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,030
rest of the one-third of this protein
it's a part that

518
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,040
it's a part that
 

519
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,110
it's a part that
uh is buried into the into the membrane

520
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:57,120
uh is buried into the into the membrane
 

521
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,230
uh is buried into the into the membrane
of the virus and uh of the of the

522
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:00,240
of the virus and uh of the of the
 

523
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,069
of the virus and uh of the of the
viral envelope and uh it also has a lot

524
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:04,079
viral envelope and uh it also has a lot
 

525
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:04,710
viral envelope and uh it also has a lot
of

526
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:04,720
of
 

527
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,030
of
unstable structures around it so it's

528
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,040
unstable structures around it so it's
 

529
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,790
unstable structures around it so it's
chemically interacting somehow with

530
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:08,800
chemically interacting somehow with
 

531
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,470
chemically interacting somehow with
whatever the heck is connecting yeah so

532
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:10,480
whatever the heck is connecting yeah so
 

533
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,069
whatever the heck is connecting yeah so
so it people are still trying to

534
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,079
so it people are still trying to
 

535
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,550
so it people are still trying to
understand so so the the nature of

536
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
understand so so the the nature of
 

537
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,949
understand so so the the nature of
and the the role of this uh you know uh

538
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
and the the role of this uh you know uh
 

539
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,870
and the the role of this uh you know uh
of this uh one third because

540
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:18,880
of this uh one third because
 

541
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,990
of this uh one third because
the the top part uh you know the the

542
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:22,000
the the top part uh you know the the
 

543
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,269
the the top part uh you know the the
primary function is to get attached to

544
00:10:25,269 --> 00:10:25,279
primary function is to get attached to
 

545
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:25,750
primary function is to get attached to
the

546
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:25,760
the
 

547
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,430
the
you know h2 receptor human receptor

548
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:29,440
you know h2 receptor human receptor
 

549
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,110
you know h2 receptor human receptor
there is also beautiful you know

550
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,120
there is also beautiful you know
 

551
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,509
there is also beautiful you know
mechanics of how this thing happens

552
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:35,519
mechanics of how this thing happens
 

553
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,310
mechanics of how this thing happens
right so

554
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:36,320
right so
 

555
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,630
right so
because there are three different copies

556
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:38,640
because there are three different copies
 

557
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,829
because there are three different copies
of this uh

558
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:39,839
of this uh
 

559
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,710
of this uh
chains or you know there are three

560
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:42,720
chains or you know there are three
 

561
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,750
chains or you know there are three
different

562
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:43,760
different
 

563
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,509
different
domains right so we're talking about

564
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:45,519
domains right so we're talking about
 

565
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,670
domains right so we're talking about
domains so this is the receptor binding

566
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:47,680
domains so this is the receptor binding
 

567
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,110
domains so this is the receptor binding
domains rpgs

568
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:49,120
domains rpgs
 

569
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,150
domains rpgs
that gets untangled and

570
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
that gets untangled and
 

571
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,949
that gets untangled and
get ready to to to atta to get attached

572
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:54,959
get ready to to to atta to get attached
 

573
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:55,430
get ready to to to atta to get attached
to

574
00:10:55,430 --> 00:10:55,440
to
 

575
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,630
to
to the receptor and now

576
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:58,640
to the receptor and now
 

577
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,990
to the receptor and now
they are not necessarily going

578
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:02,000
they are not necessarily going
 

579
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,190
they are not necessarily going
in a sync mode as a matter of fact

580
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:05,200
in a sync mode as a matter of fact
 

581
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,230
in a sync mode as a matter of fact
it's asynchronous yeah so yes so and

582
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:08,240
it's asynchronous yeah so yes so and
 

583
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,470
it's asynchronous yeah so yes so and
this is this is where you know

584
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
this is this is where you know
 

585
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,630
this is this is where you know
the another level of complexity comes

586
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
the another level of complexity comes
 

587
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,509
the another level of complexity comes
into play

588
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:13,519
into play
 

589
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,389
into play
because you know right now what we see

590
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:16,399
because you know right now what we see
 

591
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,030
because you know right now what we see
is

592
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
is
 

593
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,470
is
we typically see just one of the arms

594
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,480
we typically see just one of the arms
 

595
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,350
we typically see just one of the arms
going out and getting ready to to at a

596
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:23,360
going out and getting ready to to at a
 

597
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,030
going out and getting ready to to at a
time to be attached to the

598
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,040
time to be attached to the
 

599
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,230
time to be attached to the
uh to the ac2 receptors however

600
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:28,240
uh to the ac2 receptors however
 

601
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,509
uh to the ac2 receptors however
there was a recent mutation that uh

602
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:31,519
there was a recent mutation that uh
 

603
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,030
there was a recent mutation that uh
people studied in that spike protein

604
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,040
people studied in that spike protein
 

605
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,630
people studied in that spike protein
and a

606
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
and a
 

607
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,150
and a
very recently a group from umass medical

608
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,160
very recently a group from umass medical
 

609
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,949
very recently a group from umass medical
school

610
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
school
 

611
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,870
school
uh we happened to collaborate with

612
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:44,880
uh we happened to collaborate with
 

613
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,310
uh we happened to collaborate with
groups so this is a group of

614
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:46,320
groups so this is a group of
 

615
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,350
groups so this is a group of
jeremy lubin and a number of uh

616
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:49,360
jeremy lubin and a number of uh
 

617
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,629
jeremy lubin and a number of uh
other faculty um they uh

618
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:52,639
other faculty um they uh
 

619
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,150
other faculty um they uh
actually uh solved the uh

620
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
actually uh solved the uh
 

621
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,110
actually uh solved the uh
the mutated structure of the spike and

622
00:11:59,110 --> 00:11:59,120
the mutated structure of the spike and
 

623
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,310
the mutated structure of the spike and
they showed that

624
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:00,320
they showed that
 

625
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,110
they showed that
actually because of these mutations you

626
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,120
actually because of these mutations you
 

627
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,829
actually because of these mutations you
have

628
00:12:03,829 --> 00:12:03,839
have
 

629
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,190
have
more than one arms

630
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:07,200
more than one arms
 

631
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,389
more than one arms
opening up and so now so you so the

632
00:12:10,389 --> 00:12:10,399
opening up and so now so you so the
 

633
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,350
opening up and so now so you so the
frequency

634
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:11,360
frequency
 

635
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,949
frequency
of two arms going up

636
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:14,959
of two arms going up
 

637
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,110
of two arms going up
increa increase quite you know

638
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
increa increase quite you know
 

639
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,790
increa increase quite you know
drastically how interesting

640
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
drastically how interesting
 

641
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,389
drastically how interesting
is that does that change the dynamics

642
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:20,399
is that does that change the dynamics
 

643
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:22,629
is that does that change the dynamics
somehow it potentially

644
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
somehow it potentially
 

645
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,030
somehow it potentially
can change the dynamics of because now

646
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:25,040
can change the dynamics of because now
 

647
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:25,910
can change the dynamics of because now
you have

648
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:25,920
you have
 

649
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,710
you have
two possible opportunities to get

650
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:28,720
two possible opportunities to get
 

651
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,590
two possible opportunities to get
attached to the

652
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:29,600
attached to the
 

653
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,310
attached to the
ac2 receptor it's a very complex

654
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:32,320
ac2 receptor it's a very complex
 

655
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,430
ac2 receptor it's a very complex
molecular

656
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:33,440
molecular
 

657
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,590
molecular
process mechanistic process but the

658
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:35,600
process mechanistic process but the
 

659
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,350
process mechanistic process but the
first step of this process

660
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:37,360
first step of this process
 

661
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,350
first step of this process
is the attachment of this spike protein

662
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,360
is the attachment of this spike protein
 

663
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,550
is the attachment of this spike protein
of the spike trimer to the

664
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:44,560
of the spike trimer to the
 

665
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,670
of the spike trimer to the
human h2 receptor so this is a molecule

666
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:47,680
human h2 receptor so this is a molecule
 

667
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,790
human h2 receptor so this is a molecule
that sits

668
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:48,800
that sits
 

669
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,990
that sits
on the surface of the human cell

670
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,000
on the surface of the human cell
 

671
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,069
on the surface of the human cell
and that's essentially what initiates

672
00:12:54,069 --> 00:12:54,079
and that's essentially what initiates
 

673
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,910
and that's essentially what initiates
the what triggers the whole

674
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
the what triggers the whole
 

675
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,030
the what triggers the whole
process of in you know encapsulation if

676
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,040
process of in you know encapsulation if
 

677
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,550
process of in you know encapsulation if
this was dating this would be the first

678
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,560
this was dating this would be the first
 

679
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,269
this was dating this would be the first
date

680
00:13:01,269 --> 00:13:01,279
date
 

681
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,509
date
so this is the uh the way yes

682
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
so this is the uh the way yes
 

683
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,030
so this is the uh the way yes
so is it is it possible to have the

684
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:07,040
so is it is it possible to have the
 

685
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,350
so is it is it possible to have the
spike protein just like floating about

686
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:09,360
spike protein just like floating about
 

687
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,509
spike protein just like floating about
on its own or does it need that

688
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
on its own or does it need that
 

689
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,430
on its own or does it need that
interactive ability with the

690
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:13,440
interactive ability with the
 

691
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,670
interactive ability with the
uh with the membrane yeah so it needs to

692
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:15,680
uh with the membrane yeah so it needs to
 

693
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,790
uh with the membrane yeah so it needs to
be attached

694
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:16,800
be attached
 

695
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,910
be attached
at least as far as i know but uh you

696
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:19,920
at least as far as i know but uh you
 

697
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,030
at least as far as i know but uh you
know when you

698
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:21,040
know when you
 

699
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,949
know when you
get this thing attached on the surface

700
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:22,959
get this thing attached on the surface
 

701
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,509
get this thing attached on the surface
right there is also a lot of dynamics on

702
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
right there is also a lot of dynamics on
 

703
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,069
right there is also a lot of dynamics on
where how it sits on the surface right

704
00:13:28,069 --> 00:13:28,079
where how it sits on the surface right
 

705
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,190
where how it sits on the surface right
so for example

706
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:29,200
so for example
 

707
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,550
so for example
uh there was a recent work in uh again

708
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
uh there was a recent work in uh again
 

709
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,949
uh there was a recent work in uh again
uh where people use the cry electron

710
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:34,959
uh where people use the cry electron
 

711
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,269
uh where people use the cry electron
microscopy to get the first glimpse

712
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:37,279
microscopy to get the first glimpse
 

713
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,670
microscopy to get the first glimpse
of the overall structure it's a very low

714
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:39,680
of the overall structure it's a very low
 

715
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,550
of the overall structure it's a very low
res but

716
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,560
res but
 

717
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,750
res but
you still get some interesting details

718
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:43,760
you still get some interesting details
 

719
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,910
you still get some interesting details
about this surface about what is

720
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:45,920
about this surface about what is
 

721
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,750
about this surface about what is
happening inside because we have

722
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:47,760
happening inside because we have
 

723
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,670
happening inside because we have
literally no clue until

724
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:49,680
literally no clue until
 

725
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,110
literally no clue until
recent work about how the the capsid

726
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
recent work about how the the capsid
 

727
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,710
recent work about how the the capsid
is organized so capsid is essentially

728
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:56,720
is organized so capsid is essentially
 

729
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,990
is organized so capsid is essentially
it's the inner core of the viral

730
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:00,000
it's the inner core of the viral
 

731
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,350
it's the inner core of the viral
particle where the uh there is a the

732
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:03,360
particle where the uh there is a the
 

733
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,710
particle where the uh there is a the
rna of the virus and it's protected by

734
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:06,720
rna of the virus and it's protected by
 

735
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,310
rna of the virus and it's protected by
another protein and protein

736
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,320
another protein and protein
 

737
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,350
another protein and protein
that essentially acts as a shield

738
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:13,360
that essentially acts as a shield
 

739
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,069
that essentially acts as a shield
but you know now we are learning more

740
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:16,079
but you know now we are learning more
 

741
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:16,790
but you know now we are learning more
and more so

742
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:16,800
and more so
 

743
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,550
and more so
it's actually it's not just this shield

744
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:18,560
it's actually it's not just this shield
 

745
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,629
it's actually it's not just this shield
it's you is potentially is used

746
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:20,639
it's you is potentially is used
 

747
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,750
it's you is potentially is used
for the stability of the outer shell of

748
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,760
for the stability of the outer shell of
 

749
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,310
for the stability of the outer shell of
the

750
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
the
 

751
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,790
the
of the virus so it's it's pretty

752
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:26,800
of the virus so it's it's pretty
 

753
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,750
of the virus so it's it's pretty
complicated

754
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:27,760
complicated
 

755
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,590
complicated
and uh i mean understanding all of this

756
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:29,600
and uh i mean understanding all of this
 

757
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,269
and uh i mean understanding all of this
is really useful for trying to figure

758
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:31,279
is really useful for trying to figure
 

759
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,269
is really useful for trying to figure
out like developing a vaccine or some

760
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:33,279
out like developing a vaccine or some
 

761
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:33,670
out like developing a vaccine or some
kind of

762
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:33,680
kind of
 

763
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,990
kind of
drug to attack any aspects of this right

764
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:36,000
drug to attack any aspects of this right
 

765
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,189
drug to attack any aspects of this right
so i mean there are

766
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:37,199
so i mean there are
 

767
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,350
so i mean there are
many different implications to that i

768
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:39,360
many different implications to that i
 

769
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,310
many different implications to that i
mean first of all

770
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
mean first of all
 

771
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
mean first of all
you know it's it's important to

772
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
you know it's it's important to
 

773
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,829
you know it's it's important to
understand the virus

774
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
understand the virus
 

775
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,590
understand the virus
itself right so you know in order to uh

776
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:47,600
itself right so you know in order to uh
 

777
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,949
itself right so you know in order to uh
to understand how it

778
00:14:50,949 --> 00:14:50,959
to understand how it
 

779
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,829
to understand how it
acts what is the overall mechanism

780
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:53,839
acts what is the overall mechanism
 

781
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,269
acts what is the overall mechanism
mechanistic process

782
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:55,279
mechanistic process
 

783
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,150
mechanistic process
of this virus replication of this virus

784
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:58,160
of this virus replication of this virus
 

785
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,910
of this virus replication of this virus
proliferation to the cell

786
00:14:59,910 --> 00:14:59,920
proliferation to the cell
 

787
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,030
proliferation to the cell
right so so that's one uh aspect the the

788
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:03,040
right so so that's one uh aspect the the
 

789
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,910
right so so that's one uh aspect the the
other aspect

790
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:03,920
other aspect
 

791
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,150
other aspect
is you know designing new treatments

792
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,160
is you know designing new treatments
 

793
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,269
is you know designing new treatments
right so one of the

794
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:07,279
right so one of the
 

795
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,389
right so one of the
uh possible treatments is uh you know

796
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:10,399
uh possible treatments is uh you know
 

797
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,389
uh possible treatments is uh you know
designing nanoparticles

798
00:15:12,389 --> 00:15:12,399
designing nanoparticles
 

799
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,710
designing nanoparticles
and so some nanoparticles that will

800
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:14,720
and so some nanoparticles that will
 

801
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,829
and so some nanoparticles that will
resemble

802
00:15:15,829 --> 00:15:15,839
resemble
 

803
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,069
resemble
the viral shape that would have the

804
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:18,079
the viral shape that would have the
 

805
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,430
the viral shape that would have the
spike integrated

806
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:19,440
spike integrated
 

807
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,509
spike integrated
and essentially would act uh as a

808
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:21,519
and essentially would act uh as a
 

809
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,509
and essentially would act uh as a
competitor to the real virus

810
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:23,519
competitor to the real virus
 

811
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,550
competitor to the real virus
by blocking the ace2 receptors

812
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:26,560
by blocking the ace2 receptors
 

813
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,189
by blocking the ace2 receptors
and thus preventing the real virus

814
00:15:29,189 --> 00:15:29,199
and thus preventing the real virus
 

815
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,910
and thus preventing the real virus
entering the cell

816
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
entering the cell
 

817
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,470
entering the cell
now there are also you know there is a

818
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:34,480
now there are also you know there is a
 

819
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,590
now there are also you know there is a
very interesting

820
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:35,600
very interesting
 

821
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,269
very interesting
direction in looking at the the membrane

822
00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:39,279
direction in looking at the the membrane
 

823
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:39,670
direction in looking at the the membrane
at the

824
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:39,680
at the
 

825
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,069
at the
envelope portion of the protein and

826
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:42,079
envelope portion of the protein and
 

827
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,269
envelope portion of the protein and
attacking

828
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:43,279
attacking
 

829
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,949
attacking
its uh m protein so so there are

830
00:15:46,949 --> 00:15:46,959
its uh m protein so so there are
 

831
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,509
its uh m protein so so there are
uh you know to give you a you know sort

832
00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:49,519
uh you know to give you a you know sort
 

833
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,030
uh you know to give you a you know sort
of a brief overview

834
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
of a brief overview
 

835
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,590
of a brief overview
there are four structural proteins these

836
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
there are four structural proteins these
 

837
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,590
there are four structural proteins these
are the proteins that made up

838
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:55,600
are the proteins that made up
 

839
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,269
are the proteins that made up
a structure of the virus

840
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
a structure of the virus
 

841
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,790
a structure of the virus
so spike has protein that acts

842
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
so spike has protein that acts
 

843
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,110
so spike has protein that acts
as a trimer so it needs three copies

844
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
as a trimer so it needs three copies
 

845
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,990
as a trimer so it needs three copies
e envelope protein that acts as a

846
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,000
e envelope protein that acts as a
 

847
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,710
e envelope protein that acts as a
pantomer

848
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:10,720
pantomer
 

849
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,310
pantomer
so it needs five copies to act properly

850
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:14,320
so it needs five copies to act properly
 

851
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,749
so it needs five copies to act properly
m uh is a is a membrane protein

852
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:17,759
m uh is a is a membrane protein
 

853
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,629
m uh is a is a membrane protein
at it forms dimers and actually it forms

854
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:20,639
at it forms dimers and actually it forms
 

855
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:22,310
at it forms dimers and actually it forms
beautiful lattice and this is something

856
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:22,320
beautiful lattice and this is something
 

857
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,910
beautiful lattice and this is something
that we've been studying and we are

858
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
that we've been studying and we are
 

859
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,590
that we've been studying and we are
seeing it in simulations

860
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:25,600
seeing it in simulations
 

861
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,230
seeing it in simulations
it it actually forms a very nice grit or

862
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:28,240
it it actually forms a very nice grit or
 

863
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,590
it it actually forms a very nice grit or
you know

864
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:29,600
you know
 

865
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,790
you know

dimers

868
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:33,600
dimers
 

869
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,829
dimers
attached next to each of copies of each

00:16:34,829 --> 00:16:34,839
attached next to each of copies of each
 

871
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,509
attached next to each of copies of each
other and they naturally when you have a

872
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:37,519
other and they naturally when you have a
 

873
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,870
other and they naturally when you have a
bunch of copies of each other they form

874
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:38,880
bunch of copies of each other they form
 

875
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,150
bunch of copies of each other they form
an interesting lattice

876
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
an interesting lattice
 

877
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,470
an interesting lattice
exactly and and you know you if you

878
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
exactly and and you know you if you
 

879
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,310
exactly and and you know you if you
think about this right so so so

880
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:44,320
think about this right so so so
 

881
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,430
think about this right so so so
the this complex you know the divi

882
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:47,440
the this complex you know the divi
 

883
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,550
the this complex you know the divi
the viral shape needs to be organized

884
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:50,560
the viral shape needs to be organized
 

885
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,949
the viral shape needs to be organized
somehow self-organized somehow

886
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
somehow self-organized somehow
 

887
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,110
somehow self-organized somehow
right so it you know if it was a

888
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:55,120
right so it you know if it was a
 

889
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,150
right so it you know if it was a
completely

890
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,160

00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:58,800
random process you know you probably
 

893
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,550
random process you know you probably
wouldn't have the the

894
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:00,560
wouldn't have the the
 

895
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,350
wouldn't have the the
the envelope shell of the so ellipsoid

896
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
the envelope shell of the so ellipsoid
 

897
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,949
the envelope shell of the so ellipsoid
shape you know you would have something

898
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:04,959

you know

900
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:05,760
you know
 

901
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,069
you know
pretty random right shape so there is

902
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:08,079
pretty random right shape so there is
 

903
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,789
pretty random right shape so there is
some

904
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:08,799
some
 

905
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,309
some
you know regularity and how this uh

906
00:17:12,309 --> 00:17:12,319
you know regularity and how this uh
 

907
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,590
you know regularity and how this uh
you know uh how this uh

908
00:17:15,590 --> 00:17:15,600
you know uh how this uh

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,549
you know uh how this uh
m dimers get to attach to each other in

910
00:17:18,549 --> 00:17:18,559
m dimers get to attach to each other in
 

911
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,390
m dimers get to attach to each other in
a very specific directed way

912
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:20,400
a very specific directed way
 

913
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,510
a very specific directed way
is that understood at all uh it's not

914
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:23,520
is that understood at all uh it's not
 

915
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,309
is that understood at all uh it's not
understood

916

we are now we we've been working in the

918
00:17:27,429 --> 00:17:27,439
we are now we we've been working in the
 

919
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:28,789
we are now we we've been working in the
past six months since

920
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
past six months since
 

921
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,789
past six months since
you know we met actually this is where

922
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:30,799
you know we met actually this is where
 

923
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,789
you know we met actually this is where
we started working on on trying to

924
00:17:32,789 --> 00:17:32,799
we started working on on trying to
 

925
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,390
we started working on on trying to
understand the overall

926
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:34,400
understand the overall
 

927
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,870
understand the overall
structure of the envelope and the the

928
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:36,880
structure of the envelope and the the
 

929
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,070
structure of the envelope and the the
key components

930
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,080
key components
 

931
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,549
key components
that made up this uh you know uh

932
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:40,559
that made up this uh you know uh
 

933
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,150
that made up this uh you know uh
structure does the envelope also have

934
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:42,160
structure does the envelope also have
 

935
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,190
structure does the envelope also have
the lattice structure

936
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,200
the lattice structure
 

937
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,510
the lattice structure
no so so the envelope is essentially is

938
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:45,520
no so so the envelope is essentially is
 

939
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,190
no so so the envelope is essentially is
the outer shell

940
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:47,200
the outer shell
 

941
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,830
the outer shell
of the viral particle the n the

942
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:49,840
of the viral particle the n the
 

943
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,510
of the viral particle the n the
nucleocapsid protein

944
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:51,520
nucleocapsid protein
 

945
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,190
nucleocapsid protein
is something that is inside but

946
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,200
is something that is inside but
 

947
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,549
is something that is inside but
get that the n is likely to interact

948
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
get that the n is likely to interact
 

949
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:58,870
get that the n is likely to interact
with

950
00:17:58,870 --> 00:17:58,880
with
 

951
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,230
with
m does it go m and e like where's the e

952
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
m does it go m and e like where's the e
 

953
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:02,549
m does it go m and e like where's the e
and

954
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:02,559
and
 

955
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,590
and
so so e those different proteins

956
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:05,600
so so e those different proteins
 

957
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,029
so so e those different proteins
they occur in different copies on the

958
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:09,039
they occur in different copies on the
 

959
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,029
they occur in different copies on the
viral particle so so e this pantomimer

960
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:13,039
viral particle so so e this pantomimer
 

961
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,470
viral particle so so e this pantomimer
complex we only have two or three

962
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
complex we only have two or three
 

963
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,909
complex we only have two or three
maybe per each particle okay

964
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:19,919
maybe per each particle okay
 

965
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,110
maybe per each particle okay
we have thousand or so of

966
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,120
we have thousand or so of
 

967
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,390
we have thousand or so of
m dimers that essentially made up uh

968
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,400
m dimers that essentially made up uh
 

969
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,870
m dimers that essentially made up uh
that

970
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
that
 

971
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,990
that
makes up uh the entire you know

972
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
makes up uh the entire you know
 

973
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,470
makes up uh the entire you know
outer shell sure so most of the outer

974
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
outer shell sure so most of the outer
 

975
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,510
outer shell sure so most of the outer
shell is the m

976
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:33,520
shell is the m
 

977
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,070
shell is the m
m dimer and protein when you say

978
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:36,080
m dimer and protein when you say
 

979
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,990

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
know when you
 

995
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,510
know when you
show a per per virus particle per virus

996
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:55,520
show a per per virus particle per virus

this uh uh the the antibodies

1008
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,000
this uh uh the the antibodies
 

1009
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,110
this uh uh the the antibodies
that target you know spike proteins

1010
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,120
that target you know spike proteins
 

1011
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,029
that target you know spike proteins
certain parts of the spike protein

1012
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:15,039
certain parts of the spike protein
 

1013
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,110
certain parts of the spike protein
but there could be some or also some

1014
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:17,120
but there could be some or also some
 

1015
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,950
but there could be some or also some
treatments right so so these are

1016
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:18,960
treatments right so so these are
 

1017
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,310
treatments right so so these are
you know these are small molecules that

1018
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
you know these are small molecules that
 

1019
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,070
you know these are small molecules that
bind strategic parts of these

1020
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,080
bind strategic parts of these
 

1021
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,590
bind strategic parts of these
proteins disrupting its functioning

1022
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:29,600
proteins disrupting its functioning
 

1023
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,430
proteins disrupting its functioning
so one of the promising directions

1024
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:33,440
so one of the promising directions
 

1025
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,990
so one of the promising directions
uh it's one of the newest directions is

1026
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:36,000
uh it's one of the newest directions is
 

1027
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,190
uh it's one of the newest directions is
actually targeting

1028
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:37,200
actually targeting
 

1029
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,549
actually targeting
the m dimer of the protein

1030
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:40,559
the m dimer of the protein
 

1031
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,270
the m dimer of the protein
targeting the proteins that make up this

1032
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,280
targeting the proteins that make up this
 

1033
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,150
targeting the proteins that make up this
outer shell

1034
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:44,160
outer shell
 

1035
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,230
outer shell
because if you are able to destroy the

1036
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
because if you are able to destroy the
 

1037
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,590
because if you are able to destroy the
outer shell

1038
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
outer shell
 

1039
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,150
outer shell
you are essentially destroying the the

1040
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,160
you are essentially destroying the the
 

1041
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,230
you are essentially destroying the the
the viral particle itself

1042
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
the viral particle itself
 

1043
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,710
the viral particle itself
so preventing it from from you know

1044
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:54,720
so preventing it from from you know
 

1045
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,430
so preventing it from from you know
functioning

1046
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:55,440
functioning
 

1047
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,190
functioning
at all so that's you think is uh

1048
00:19:59,190 --> 00:19:59,200
at all so that's you think is uh
 

1049
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,789
at all so that's you think is uh
from a sort of cyber security

1050
00:20:00,789 --> 00:20:00,799
from a sort of cyber security
 

1051
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,950
from a sort of cyber security
perspective virus security perspective

1052
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:02,960
perspective virus security perspective
 

1053
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,110
perspective virus security perspective
that's the best attack vector

1054
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,120
that's the best attack vector
 

1055
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,909
that's the best attack vector
is uh or like that's a promising attack

1056
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:07,919
is uh or like that's a promising attack
 

1057
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,549
is uh or like that's a promising attack
vector

1058
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:08,559
vector
 

1059
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,630
vector
i would say yeah so i mean this is still

1060
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:10,640
i would say yeah so i mean this is still
 

1061
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,549
i would say yeah so i mean this is still
tons of research needs to be

1062
00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:12,559
tons of research needs to be
 

1063
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,590
tons of research needs to be
you know to be done but uh yes i think

1064
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:15,600
you know to be done but uh yes i think
 

1065
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,750
you know to be done but uh yes i think
you know so there's more attack surface

1066
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
you know so there's more attack surface
 

1067
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,789
you know so there's more attack surface
i guess

1068
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:18,799
i guess
 

1069
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,710
i guess
more attack surface but you know from

1070
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:20,720
more attack surface but you know from
 

1071
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,190
more attack surface but you know from
from our analysis from other evolution

1072
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:23,200
from our analysis from other evolution
 

1073
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,149
from our analysis from other evolution
analysis

1074
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
analysis
 

1075
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,830
analysis
this protein is evolutionary more stable

1076
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
this protein is evolutionary more stable
 

1077
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,110
this protein is evolutionary more stable
compared to the say to the spike protein

1078
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,120
compared to the say to the spike protein
 

1079
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,470
compared to the say to the spike protein
unstable means a more uh static

1080
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:34,480
unstable means a more uh static
 

1081
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,669
unstable means a more uh static
target well yeah so so it it it doesn't

1082
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
target well yeah so so it it it doesn't
 

1083
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,230
target well yeah so so it it it doesn't
change

1084
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:38,240
change
 

1085
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,029
change
it doesn't evolve from the evolutionary

1086
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:41,039
it doesn't evolve from the evolutionary
 

1087
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:41,990
it doesn't evolve from the evolutionary
perspective

1088
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:42,000
perspective
 

1089
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,029
perspective
so drastically as for example the spike

1090
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:45,039
so drastically as for example the spike
 

1091
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:45,909
so drastically as for example the spike
protein

1092
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:45,919
protein
 

1093
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,830

there's a bunch of stuff in the news

1094
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:47,840
there's a bunch of stuff in the news
 

1095
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,669
there's a bunch of stuff in the news
about mutations of the virus

1096
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:49,679
about mutations of the virus
 

1097
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,070
about mutations of the virus
in the united kingdom i also saw in

1098
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:52,080
in the united kingdom i also saw in
 

1099
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,510
in the united kingdom i also saw in
south africa

1100
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:53,520
south africa
 

1101
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,470
south africa
something maybe that was yesterday you

1102
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:56,480
something maybe that was yesterday you
 

1103
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:56,870
something maybe that was yesterday you
just

1104
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:56,880
just
 

1105
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,270
just
kind of mentioned about stability and so

1106
00:20:59,270 --> 00:20:59,280
kind of mentioned about stability and so
 

1107
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,149
kind of mentioned about stability and so
on

1108
00:21:00,149 --> 00:21:00,159
on
 

1109
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:02,870
on
which aspects of this are mutatable and

1110
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:02,880
which aspects of this are mutatable and
 

1111
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,230
which aspects of this are mutatable and
which

1112
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:04,240
which
 

1113
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,590
which
aspects if mutated become more dangerous

1114
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:07,600
aspects if mutated become more dangerous
 

1115
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,669
aspects if mutated become more dangerous
and maybe even zooming out what are your

1116
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:09,679
and maybe even zooming out what are your
 

1117
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,390
and maybe even zooming out what are your
thoughts and knowledge and ideas about

1118
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:12,400
thoughts and knowledge and ideas about
 

1119
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,230
thoughts and knowledge and ideas about
the way it's mutated all the news that

1120
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:14,240
the way it's mutated all the news that
 

1121
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,149
the way it's mutated all the news that
we've been hearing are you worried about

1122
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:16,159
we've been hearing are you worried about
 

1123
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,789
we've been hearing are you worried about
it

1124
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:16,799
it
 

1125
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,630
it
from a biological perspective are you

1126
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:18,640
from a biological perspective are you
 

1127
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,990
from a biological perspective are you
worried about it from a human

1128
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:20,000
worried about it from a human
 

1129
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,190
worried about it from a human
perspective

1130
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:21,200
perspective
 

1131
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,549
perspective
so i mean you know mutations are sort of

1132
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:24,559
so i mean you know mutations are sort of
 

1133
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:27,350
so i mean you know mutations are sort of
a general way for these viruses to

1134
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:27,360
a general way for these viruses to
 

1135
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,230
a general way for these viruses to
evolve

1136
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,240
evolve
 

1137
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,070
evolve
right so so it's you know it's uh

1138
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:32,080
right so so it's you know it's uh
 

1139
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,630
right so so it's you know it's uh
essentially this is the way they evolve

1140
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
essentially this is the way they evolve
 

1141
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,510
essentially this is the way they evolve
this is

1142
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:35,520
this is
 

1143
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,630
this is
the way they were able to jump

1144
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:38,640
the way they were able to jump
 

1145
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,990
the way they were able to jump
from you know one species to another

1146
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,000
from you know one species to another
 

1147
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,270
from you know one species to another
we also see uh you know some

1148
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:45,280
we also see uh you know some
 

1149
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,710
we also see uh you know some
recent jumps there were some incidents

1150
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:48,720
recent jumps there were some incidents
 

1151
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,830
recent jumps there were some incidents
of this virus jumping from human to dogs

1152
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:51,840
of this virus jumping from human to dogs
 

1153
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,710
of this virus jumping from human to dogs
so you know there is some danger in in

1154
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:54,720
so you know there is some danger in in
 

1155
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,549
so you know there is some danger in in
in in those jobs because you know every

1156
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:56,559
in in those jobs because you know every
 

1157
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:59,029
in in those jobs because you know every
time it jumps it also mutates

1158
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
time it jumps it also mutates
 

1159
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,070
time it jumps it also mutates
right so so it when it jumps to

1160
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:02,080
right so so it when it jumps to
 

1161
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,510
right so so it when it jumps to
to the uh to the species and jumps back

1162
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:05,520
to the uh to the species and jumps back
 

1163
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,470
to the uh to the species and jumps back
right so it acquires some mutations that

1164
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:08,480
right so it acquires some mutations that
 

1165
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,590
right so it acquires some mutations that
are sort of

1166
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:09,600
are sort of
 

1167
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,430
are sort of
um driven by the

1168
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:13,440
um driven by the
 

1169
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,390
um driven by the
environment of a new host yeah right and

1170
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:16,400
environment of a new host yeah right and
 

1171
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,510
environment of a new host yeah right and
it's different

1172
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:17,520
it's different
 

1173
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,669
it's different
from the human environment and so we

1174
00:22:19,669 --> 00:22:19,679
from the human environment and so we
 

1175
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,510
from the human environment and so we
don't know whether the mutations that

1176
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:21,520
don't know whether the mutations that
 

1177
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,710
don't know whether the mutations that
are required

1178
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:22,720
are required
 

1179
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,070
are required
uh in the new species are neutral

1180
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,080
uh in the new species are neutral
 

1181
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,190
uh in the new species are neutral
with respect to the human host or maybe

1182
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
with respect to the human host or maybe
 

1183
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,549
with respect to the human host or maybe
you know maybe um damaging yeah change

1184
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:32,559
you know maybe um damaging yeah change
 

1185
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,510
you know maybe um damaging yeah change
is always scary

1186
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:33,520
is always scary
 

1187
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,190
is always scary
but so you worried about i mean it seems

1188
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:37,200
but so you worried about i mean it seems
 

1189
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,870
but so you worried about i mean it seems
like because the spread is

1190
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:38,880
like because the spread is
 

1191
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,950
like because the spread is
during winter niles seems to be

1192
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:40,960
during winter niles seems to be
 

1193
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,789
during winter niles seems to be
exceptionally high

1194
00:22:42,789 --> 00:22:42,799
exceptionally high
 

1195
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:45,990
exceptionally high
uh and especially with a vaccine just

1196
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:46,000
uh and especially with a vaccine just
 

1197
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,990
uh and especially with a vaccine just
around the corner already being actually

1198
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
around the corner already being actually
 

1199
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,110
around the corner already being actually
deployed there's some worry that there's

1200
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:51,120
deployed there's some worry that there's
 

1201
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,870
deployed there's some worry that there's
this puts evolutionary pressure

1202
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:52,880
this puts evolutionary pressure
 

1203
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,750
this puts evolutionary pressure
selective pressure on the virus

1204
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:55,760
selective pressure on the virus
 

1205
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,789
selective pressure on the virus
afford to uh to mute for you to mutate

1206
00:22:58,789 --> 00:22:58,799
afford to uh to mute for you to mutate
 

1207
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,430
afford to uh to mute for you to mutate
is that us yeah well i mean there is

1208
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:01,440
is that us yeah well i mean there is
 

1209
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,870
is that us yeah well i mean there is
always this thought

1210
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:02,880
always this thought
 

1211
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,070
always this thought
you know in in in the scientists my mind

1212
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:06,080
you know in in in the scientists my mind
 

1213
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,230
you know in in in the scientists my mind
you know what happened what will happen

1214
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
you know what happened what will happen
 

1215
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,110
you know what happened what will happen
right so

1216
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,120
right so
 

1217
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,590
right so
uh i know they've been uh they've been

1218
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:11,600
uh i know they've been uh they've been
 

1219
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,350
uh i know they've been uh they've been
discussions about

1220
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:13,360
discussions about
 

1221
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,390
discussions about
sort of the arms race between the you

1222
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:16,400
sort of the arms race between the you
 

1223
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,510
sort of the arms race between the you
know the ability

1224
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:17,520
know the ability
 

1225
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,310
know the ability
of of the uh of the you know humanity to

1226
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
of of the uh of the you know humanity to
 

1227
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,750
of of the uh of the you know humanity to
uh you know to get vaccinated faster

1228
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:25,760
uh you know to get vaccinated faster
 

1229
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,590
uh you know to get vaccinated faster
then the virus you know uh essentially

1230
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:29,600
then the virus you know uh essentially
 

1231
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,549
then the virus you know uh essentially
you know becomes uh you know resistant

1232
00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:32,559
you know becomes uh you know resistant
 

1233
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,149
you know becomes uh you know resistant
to to the vaccine

1234
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:34,159
to to the vaccine
 

1235
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,830
to to the vaccine
um i i mean

1236
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
um i i mean
 

1237
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,950
um i i mean
i don't worry that much

1238
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:40,960
i don't worry that much
 

1239
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,390
i don't worry that much
uh simply because uh you know there is

1240
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:44,400
uh simply because uh you know there is
 

1241
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,590
uh simply because uh you know there is
not that much evidence to that to

1242
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:47,600
not that much evidence to that to
 

1243
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,990
not that much evidence to that to
aggressive mutation around the vaccine

1244
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:50,000
aggressive mutation around the vaccine
 

1245
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,750
aggressive mutation around the vaccine
exactly you know obviously there are

1246
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:51,760
exactly you know obviously there are
 

1247
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,909
exactly you know obviously there are
mutations around the works

1248
00:23:53,909 --> 00:23:53,919
mutations around the works
 

1249
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,950
mutations around the works
there are vaccines so the reason we get

1250
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:56,960
there are vaccines so the reason we get
 

1251
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,630
there are vaccines so the reason we get
vaccinated

1252
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:58,640
vaccinated
 

1253
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,350
vaccinated
every year against the season of

1254
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:01,360
every year against the season of
 

1255
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,990
every year against the season of
mutations

1256
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:02,000
mutations
 

1257
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,110
mutations
right um but uh

1258
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,120
right um but uh
 

1259
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,350
right um but uh
you know i think it's important to study

1260
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:07,360
you know i think it's important to study
 

1261
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,630
you know i think it's important to study
it

1262
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
it
 

1263
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,750
it
no doubts right so i think one of the

1264
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:11,760
no doubts right so i think one of the
 

1265
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,990
no doubts right so i think one of the
you know to me and again i might be

1266
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,000
you know to me and again i might be
 

1267
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:14,870
you know to me and again i might be
biased

1268
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:14,880
biased
 

1269
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,669
biased
uh because you know we we've been uh

1270
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:17,679
uh because you know we we've been uh
 

1271
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,070
uh because you know we we've been uh
trying

1272
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,080
trying
 

1273
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,950
trying
to to do that as well uh so but one of

1274
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:20,960
to to do that as well uh so but one of
 

1275
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,789
to to do that as well uh so but one of
the critical directions

1276
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
the critical directions
 

1277
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,870
the critical directions
in understanding the virus is to uh to

1278
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
in understanding the virus is to uh to
 

1279
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,470
in understanding the virus is to uh to
understand its evolution

1280
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:26,480
understand its evolution
 

1281
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,350
understand its evolution
in order to uh sort of understand the

1282
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:29,360
in order to uh sort of understand the
 

1283
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,350
in order to uh sort of understand the
mechanisms the key mechanisms that

1284
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,360
mechanisms the key mechanisms that
 

1285
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,070
mechanisms the key mechanisms that
lead the virus to jump you know the

1286
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:34,080
lead the virus to jump you know the
 

1287
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:36,070
lead the virus to jump you know the
nordic viruses to jump from

1288
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:36,080
nordic viruses to jump from
 

1289
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,269
nordic viruses to jump from
species from species to another that

1290
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:39,279
species from species to another that
 

1291
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,750
species from species to another that
the mechanisms that lead the virus to

1292
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:41,760
the mechanisms that lead the virus to
 

1293
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:42,630
the mechanisms that lead the virus to
become

1294
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:42,640
become
 

1295
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,590
become
resistant to accidents also to

1296
00:24:45,590 --> 00:24:45,600
resistant to accidents also to
 

1297
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,789
resistant to accidents also to
treatments

1298
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
treatments
 

1299
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,990
treatments
right and hopefully that knowledge was

1300
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,000
right and hopefully that knowledge was
 

1301
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,630
right and hopefully that knowledge was
uh will

1302
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:50,640
uh will
 

1303
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,750
uh will
enable us to sort of forecast the

1304
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:53,760
enable us to sort of forecast the
 

1305
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,710
enable us to sort of forecast the
evolutionary

1306
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:54,720
evolutionary
 

1307
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,950
evolutionary
uh traces the future evolutionary traces

1308
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:56,960
uh traces the future evolutionary traces
 

1309
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:57,990
uh traces the future evolutionary traces
of those virus

1310
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:58,000
of those virus
 

1311
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,990
of those virus
i mean what uh from a biological

1312
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:00,000
i mean what uh from a biological
 

1313
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,750
i mean what uh from a biological
perspective this might be a dumb

1314
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:01,760
perspective this might be a dumb
 

1315
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,789
perspective this might be a dumb
question but is there

1316
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799
question but is there
 

1317
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,230
question but is there
parts of the virus that if uh

1318
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
parts of the virus that if uh
 

1319
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,350
parts of the virus that if uh
souped up like through mutation

1320
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,360
souped up like through mutation
 

1321
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,070
souped up like through mutation
could make it more effective at doing

1322
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,080
could make it more effective at doing
 

1323
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,310
could make it more effective at doing
its job we're talking about the specific

1324
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:14,320
its job we're talking about the specific
 

1325
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,909
its job we're talking about the specific
coronavirus like yeah because we were

1326
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:15,919
coronavirus like yeah because we were
 

1327
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,029
coronavirus like yeah because we were
talking about the different like the

1328
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:17,039
talking about the different like the
 

1329
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,470
talking about the different like the
membrane

1330
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,480
membrane
 

1331
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,149

1335
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,710
and the s the spike
is there some there are 20 or so more

1336
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:28,720
is there some there are 20 or so more
 

1337
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,029
is there some there are 20 or so more
in addition to that but is that is that

1338
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:31,039
in addition to that but is that is that
 

1339
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,110
in addition to that but is that is that
a dumb way to look at it like

1340
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:33,120
a dumb way to look at it like
 

1341
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,950
a dumb way to look at it like
uh which of these if mutated

1342
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
uh which of these if mutated
 

1343
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,750
uh which of these if mutated
could have the greatest impact

1344
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:39,760
could have the greatest impact
 

1345
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,870
could have the greatest impact
potentially

1346
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:40,880
potentially
 

1347
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,789
potentially
damaging impact on the effectiveness of

1348
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:42,799
damaging impact on the effectiveness of
 

1349
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,950
damaging impact on the effectiveness of
the virus so it's actually it's it's a

1350
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
the virus so it's actually it's it's a
 

1351
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,470
the virus so it's actually it's it's a
very good question

1352
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:46,480
very good question
 

1353
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,710
very good question
because and and the short answer is we

1354
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
because and and the short answer is we
 

1355
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,070
because and and the short answer is we
don't know yet

1356
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,080
don't know yet
 

1357
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,710
don't know yet
but uh of course there is capacity of

1358
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:52,720
but uh of course there is capacity of
 

1359
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,669
but uh of course there is capacity of
this virus to

1360
00:25:53,669 --> 00:25:53,679
this virus to
 

1361
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,149
this virus to
to become more efficient the reason for

1362
00:25:56,149 --> 00:25:56,159
to become more efficient the reason for
 

1363
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:56,950
to become more efficient the reason for
that

1364
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
that
 

1365
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,830
that
is um you know so if you look at the

1366
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
is um you know so if you look at the
 

1367
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,669
is um you know so if you look at the
virus i mean it's it's a machine right

1368
00:26:01,669 --> 00:26:01,679
virus i mean it's it's a machine right
 

1369
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,789
virus i mean it's it's a machine right
so it's a machine that

1370
00:26:02,789 --> 00:26:02,799
so it's a machine that
 

1371
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,909
so it's a machine that
does a lot of different functions and

1372
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:05,919
does a lot of different functions and
 

1373
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,510
does a lot of different functions and
many of these functions are sort of

1374
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:07,520
many of these functions are sort of
 

1375
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,750
many of these functions are sort of
nearly perfect but they are not perfect

1376
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:09,760
nearly perfect but they are not perfect
 

1377
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,470
nearly perfect but they are not perfect
and

1378
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
and
 

1379
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,350
and
those mutations can make those functions

1380
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:13,360
those mutations can make those functions
 

1381
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,870
those mutations can make those functions
more perfect for example

1382
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
more perfect for example
 

1383
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,230
more perfect for example
the attachment to ace2 receptor right of

1384
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:18,240
the attachment to ace2 receptor right of
 

1385
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,029
the attachment to ace2 receptor right of
the spike

1386
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:19,039
the spike
 

1387
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,870
the spike
right so uh you know

1388
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:22,880
right so uh you know
 

1389
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,870
right so uh you know
is it has this virus reached

1390
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:26,880
is it has this virus reached
 

1391
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,990
is it has this virus reached
the efficiency in which the attachment

1392
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:30,000
the efficiency in which the attachment
 

1393
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,230
the efficiency in which the attachment
is carried out or there are some

1394
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:32,240
is carried out or there are some
 

1395
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,269
is carried out or there are some
mutations that

1396
00:26:33,269 --> 00:26:33,279
mutations that
 

1397
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,149
mutations that
uh that still to be discovered right

1398
00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:36,159
uh that still to be discovered right
 

1399
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,430
uh that still to be discovered right
that will

1400
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:37,440
that will
 

1401
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,470
that will
make this attachment uh sort of

1402
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:40,480
make this attachment uh sort of
 

1403
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,990
make this attachment uh sort of
stronger or you know

1404
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,000
stronger or you know
 

1405
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,110
stronger or you know
something uh more in a way more

1406
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:47,120
something uh more in a way more
 

1407
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,470
something uh more in a way more
efficient

1408
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,480
efficient
 

1409
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,390
efficient
from the point of view of this virus

1410
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:50,400
from the point of view of this virus
 

1411
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,750
from the point of view of this virus
functioning

1412
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
functioning
 

1413
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,149
functioning
that's that's sort of the obvious

1414
00:26:54,149 --> 00:26:54,159
that's that's sort of the obvious
 

1415
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:55,029
that's that's sort of the obvious
example but

1416
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:55,039
example but
 

1417
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,430
example but
if you look at each of these proteins i

1418
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:57,440
if you look at each of these proteins i
 

1419
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,269
if you look at each of these proteins i
mean it's there for a reason it performs

1420
00:26:59,269 --> 00:26:59,279
mean it's there for a reason it performs
 

1421
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:00,710
mean it's there for a reason it performs
certain function

1422
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:00,720
certain function
 

1423
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,230
certain function
and it could be that

1424
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:04,240
and it could be that
 

1425
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,430
and it could be that
certain mutations will you know enhance

1426
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:07,440
certain mutations will you know enhance
 

1427
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,310
certain mutations will you know enhance
this function

1428
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:08,320
this function
 

1429
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,909
this function
it could be that some mutations will

1430
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:09,919
it could be that some mutations will
 

1431
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,510
it could be that some mutations will
make this function

1432
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:11,520
make this function
 

1433
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,070
make this function
much less efficient right so that's

1434
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:14,080
much less efficient right so that's
 

1435
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,149
much less efficient right so that's
that's also the case

1436
00:27:16,149 --> 00:27:16,159
that's also the case
 

1437
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,750
that's also the case
let's uh since we're talking about the

1438
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
let's uh since we're talking about the
 

1439
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,310
let's uh since we're talking about the
evolutionary history of a virus uh

1440
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:20,320
evolutionary history of a virus uh
 

1441
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,510
evolutionary history of a virus uh
let's zoom back out and uh

1442
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:23,520
let's zoom back out and uh
 

1443
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,630
let's zoom back out and uh
look at the evolution of proteins i i

1444
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:26,640
look at the evolution of proteins i i
 

1445
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,830
look at the evolution of proteins i i
glanced at this 2010 nature paper

1446
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:29,840
glanced at this 2010 nature paper
 

1447
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,630
glanced at this 2010 nature paper
on the quote ongoing expansion of the

1448
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:32,640
on the quote ongoing expansion of the
 

1449
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,230
on the quote ongoing expansion of the
protein universe

1450
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:34,240
protein universe
 

1451
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,350
protein universe
and then you know it kind of implies

1452
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:37,360
and then you know it kind of implies
 

1453
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,789
and then you know it kind of implies
and uh talks about that uh protein

1454
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:40,799
and uh talks about that uh protein
 

1455
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:43,190
and uh talks about that uh protein
started with a common ancestor which is

1456
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:43,200
started with a common ancestor which is
 

1457
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,630
started with a common ancestor which is
you know kind of interesting it's

1458
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:44,640
you know kind of interesting it's
 

1459
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,310
you know kind of interesting it's
interesting thing about like even just

1460
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:46,320
interesting thing about like even just
 

1461
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,070
interesting thing about like even just
like the first

1462
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:48,080
like the first
 

1463
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,750
like the first
organic thing that started life on earth

1464
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:51,760
organic thing that started life on earth
 

1465
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,350
organic thing that started life on earth
and from that there's now uh you know

1466
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:55,360
and from that there's now uh you know
 

1467
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,830
and from that there's now uh you know
what is it 3.5 billion years later

1468
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
what is it 3.5 billion years later
 

1469
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,750
what is it 3.5 billion years later
there's now millions of proteins

1470
00:27:59,750 --> 00:27:59,760
there's now millions of proteins
 

1471
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,070
there's now millions of proteins
and they're still evolving and that's

1472
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
and they're still evolving and that's
 

1473
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,590
and they're still evolving and that's
you know in part one of the things that

1474
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:03,600
you know in part one of the things that
 

1475
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,029
you know in part one of the things that
you're researching

1476
00:28:05,029 --> 00:28:05,039
you're researching
 

1477
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,710
you're researching
is there something interesting to you

1478
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:06,720
is there something interesting to you
 

1479
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,029
is there something interesting to you
about the evolution

1480
00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:09,039
about the evolution
 

1481
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,029
about the evolution
of proteins from this initial ancestor

1482
00:28:13,029 --> 00:28:13,039
of proteins from this initial ancestor
 

1483
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,510
of proteins from this initial ancestor
to today is there something beautiful

1484
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:15,520
to today is there something beautiful
 

1485
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,950
to today is there something beautiful
insightful about this

1486
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:16,960
insightful about this
 

1487
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,389
insightful about this
long story so i think you know uh if

1488
00:28:20,389 --> 00:28:20,399
long story so i think you know uh if
 

1489
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,070
long story so i think you know uh if
if i were to pick a single keyword

1490
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,080
if i were to pick a single keyword
 

1491
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,070
if i were to pick a single keyword
about uh protein evolution i would pick

1492
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
about uh protein evolution i would pick
 

1493
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,310
about uh protein evolution i would pick
modularity something that we talked

1494
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,320
modularity something that we talked
 

1495
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,190
modularity something that we talked
about uh

1496
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:31,200
about uh
 

1497
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,669
about uh
in the in the beginning and that's the

1498
00:28:33,669 --> 00:28:33,679
in the in the beginning and that's the
 

1499
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:34,710
in the in the beginning and that's the
fact that

1500
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:34,720
fact that
 

1501
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,990
fact that
the proteins are no longer considered

1502
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:38,000
the proteins are no longer considered
 

1503
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,350
the proteins are no longer considered
as you know as a sequence of letters

1504
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:41,360
as you know as a sequence of letters
 

1505
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,990
as you know as a sequence of letters
there are hierarchical uh complexities

1506
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:46,000
there are hierarchical uh complexities
 

1507
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,389
there are hierarchical uh complexities
in the way these proteins are organized

1508
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
in the way these proteins are organized
 

1509
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:49,190
in the way these proteins are organized
and uh

1510
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:49,200
and uh
 

1511
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,909
and uh
this complexities are actually going

1512
00:28:51,909 --> 00:28:51,919
this complexities are actually going
 

1513
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:52,789
this complexities are actually going
beyond

1514
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
beyond
 

1515
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,950
beyond
the protein sequence it's actually going

1516
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:54,960
the protein sequence it's actually going
 

1517
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,389
the protein sequence it's actually going
all the way back to the

1518
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:56,399
all the way back to the
 

1519
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,029
all the way back to the
uh to the gene to the nucleotide

1520
00:28:59,029 --> 00:28:59,039
uh to the gene to the nucleotide
 

1521
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,070
uh to the gene to the nucleotide
sequence

1522
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
sequence
 

1523
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,190
sequence
and so you know again these

1524
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,200
and so you know again these
 

1525
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,470
and so you know again these
protein domains they are not only

1526
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:06,480
protein domains they are not only
 

1527
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,389
protein domains they are not only
functional building blocks they are also

1528
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:08,399
functional building blocks they are also
 

1529
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:09,990
functional building blocks they are also
evolutionary building blocks

1530
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,000
evolutionary building blocks
 

1531
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,950
evolutionary building blocks
and so what we see in the sort of in the

1532
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:12,960
and so what we see in the sort of in the
 

1533
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,110
and so what we see in the sort of in the
later stages of evolution

1534
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
later stages of evolution
 

1535
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,029
later stages of evolution
i mean once this stable structurally and

1536
00:29:19,029 --> 00:29:19,039
i mean once this stable structurally and
 

1537
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:19,909
i mean once this stable structurally and
functionally

1538
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:19,919
functionally
 

1539
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,630
functionally
building blocks were discovered they

1540
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:22,640
building blocks were discovered they
 

1541
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,350
building blocks were discovered they
essentially

1542
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:23,360
essentially
 

1543
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,190
essentially
they stay those domains stay

1544
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:27,200
they stay those domains stay
 

1545
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,669
they stay those domains stay
as such so that's why if you start

1546
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
as such so that's why if you start
 

1547
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,470
as such so that's why if you start
comparing

1548
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,480
comparing
 

1549
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,269
comparing
different proteins you will see that

1550
00:29:33,269 --> 00:29:33,279
different proteins you will see that
 

1551
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,470
different proteins you will see that
many of them

1552
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:34,480
many of them
 

1553
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,830
many of them
will have similar fragments and those

1554
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:37,840
will have similar fragments and those
 

1555
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,669
will have similar fragments and those
fragments will correspond to something

1556
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:39,679
fragments will correspond to something
 

1557
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,389
fragments will correspond to something
that we call

1558
00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:40,399
that we call
 

1559
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,190
that we call
protein domain families and so so they

1560
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:43,200
protein domain families and so so they
 

1561
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,710
protein domain families and so so they
are still different because you you

1562
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
are still different because you you
 

1563
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,350
are still different because you you
still have

1564
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:45,360
still have
 

1565
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,549
still have
mutations and and and and you know

1566
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
mutations and and and and you know
 

1567
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,909
mutations and and and and you know
the you know different mutations

1568
00:29:51,909 --> 00:29:51,919
the you know different mutations
 

1569
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,389
the you know different mutations
are attributed to to you know

1570
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:54,399
are attributed to to you know
 

1571
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,230
are attributed to to you know
diversification of the function

1572
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,240
diversification of the function
 

1573
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,870
diversification of the function
of this uh you know uh protein domains

1574
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
of this uh you know uh protein domains
 

1575
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,990
of this uh you know uh protein domains
however

1576
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
however
 

1577
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,110
however
you don't you very rarely see um

1578
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
you don't you very rarely see um
 

1579
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,830
you don't you very rarely see um
you know the the evolutionary events

1580
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:05,840
you know the the evolutionary events
 

1581
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,710
you know the the evolutionary events
that would split this domain

1582
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:08,720
that would split this domain
 

1583
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,110
that would split this domain
into fragments because and it's you know

1584
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:13,120
into fragments because and it's you know
 

1585
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,470
into fragments because and it's you know
once you have the the the the domain

1586
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:16,480
once you have the the the the domain
 

1587
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,470
once you have the the the the domain
split you actually you uh you know

1588
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:20,480
split you actually you uh you know
 

1589
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,110
split you actually you uh you know
you can completely cancel out its

1590
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,120
you can completely cancel out its
 

1591
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:23,909
you can completely cancel out its
function

1592
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:23,919
function
 

1593
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,470
function
or at the very least you can reduce it

1594
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
or at the very least you can reduce it
 

1595
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,590
or at the very least you can reduce it
and that's not

1596
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:27,600
and that's not
 

1597
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,110
and that's not
you know efficient from the point of

1598
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:29,120
you know efficient from the point of
 

1599
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,190
you know efficient from the point of
view of the you know of the

1600
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
view of the you know of the
 

1601
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,549
view of the you know of the
cell functioning so so the

1602
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:34,559
cell functioning so so the
 

1603
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,750
cell functioning so so the
the protein domain level is a very

1604
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
the protein domain level is a very
 

1605
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,110
the protein domain level is a very
important one

1606
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:39,120
important one
 

1607
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,630
important one
now on top of that right so

1608
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:42,640
now on top of that right so
 

1609
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,230
now on top of that right so
if you look at the proteins right so you

1610
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:44,240
if you look at the proteins right so you
 

1611
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,230
if you look at the proteins right so you
have this structural units

1612
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:46,240
have this structural units
 

1613
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,430
have this structural units
and they carry out the function but then

1614
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:49,440
and they carry out the function but then
 

1615
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,990
and they carry out the function but then
much less is known about things that

1616
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,000
much less is known about things that
 

1617
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,029
much less is known about things that
connect this

1618
00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:53,039
connect this
 

1619
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,430
connect this
protein domains something that we call

1620
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:55,440
protein domains something that we call
 

1621
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,470
protein domains something that we call
linkers

1622
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
linkers
 

1623
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,470
linkers
and those linkers are completely

1624
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:58,480
and those linkers are completely
 

1625
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,830
and those linkers are completely
flexible

1626
00:30:59,830 --> 00:30:59,840
flexible
 

1627
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,470
flexible
you know parts of the protein that

1628
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:02,480
you know parts of the protein that
 

1629
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,070
you know parts of the protein that
nevertheless carry out

1630
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,080
nevertheless carry out
 

1631
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,269
nevertheless carry out
a lot of function it's like little tails

1632
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:07,279
a lot of function it's like little tails
 

1633
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:07,990
a lot of function it's like little tails
little heads

1634
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:08,000
little heads
 

1635
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,310
little heads
so so we we do have tails so they called

1636
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:10,320
so so we we do have tails so they called
 

1637
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,029
so so we we do have tails so they called
termini

1638
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:11,039
termini
 

1639
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,190
termini
c and and terminus so these are things

1640
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
c and and terminus so these are things
 

1641
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,310
c and and terminus so these are things
right on the on

1642
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,320
right on the on
 

1643
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:17,350
right on the on
on on one and

1644
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:17,360
on on one and
 

1645
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,549
on on one and
another ends of the protein sequence so

1646
00:31:20,549 --> 00:31:20,559
another ends of the protein sequence so
 

1647
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,789
another ends of the protein sequence so
they are also very important so they

1648
00:31:22,789 --> 00:31:22,799
they are also very important so they
 

1649
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:23,990
they are also very important so they
they attribute it to

1650
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:24,000
they attribute it to
 

1651
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,470
they attribute it to
very specific uh interactions between

1652
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
very specific uh interactions between
 

1653
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,669
very specific uh interactions between
the proteins

1654
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:27,679
the proteins
 

1655
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,669
the proteins
so but you're referring to the links

1656
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
so but you're referring to the links
 

1657
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,710
so but you're referring to the links
between domains

1658
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:30,720
between domains
 

1659
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,909
between domains
that connect the domains and you know

1660
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:33,919
that connect the domains and you know
 

1661
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,110
that connect the domains and you know
apart from the just the the uh

1662
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:37,120
apart from the just the the uh
 

1663
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,669
apart from the just the the uh
simple perspective if you have you know

1664
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:39,679
simple perspective if you have you know
 

1665
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,110
simple perspective if you have you know
a very short domain

1666
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,120
a very short domain
 

1667
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,750
a very short domain
you have sorry a very short linker you

1668
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:43,760
you have sorry a very short linker you
 

1669
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,870
you have sorry a very short linker you
have two domains

1670
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:44,880
have two domains
 

1671
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,470
have two domains
next to each other they are forced to be

1672
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:46,480
next to each other they are forced to be
 

1673
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,149
next to each other they are forced to be
next to each other if you have a very

1674
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:48,159
next to each other if you have a very
 

1675
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:48,950
next to each other if you have a very
long one

1676
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
long one
 

1677
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,190
long one
you have the domains that are extremely

1678
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:51,200
you have the domains that are extremely
 

1679
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:51,990
you have the domains that are extremely
flexible

1680
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,000
flexible
 

1681
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,310
flexible
and they carry out a lot of sort of pa

1682
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:54,320
and they carry out a lot of sort of pa
 

1683
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,269
and they carry out a lot of sort of pa
spatial

1684
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:55,279
spatial
 

1685
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,310
spatial
reorganization right so but

1686
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,320
reorganization right so but
 

1687
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,029
reorganization right so but
on top of that right just this linker

1688
00:32:01,029 --> 00:32:01,039
on top of that right just this linker
 

1689
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:01,830
on top of that right just this linker
itself

1690
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:01,840
itself
 

1691
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,870
itself
because it's so flexible it actually can

1692
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:04,880
because it's so flexible it actually can
 

1693
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,430
because it's so flexible it actually can
adapt to a lot of different shapes and

1694
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:07,440
adapt to a lot of different shapes and
 

1695
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,230
adapt to a lot of different shapes and
therefore

1696
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:08,240
therefore
 

1697
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,190
therefore
it's a it's a very good interactor when

1698
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:11,200
it's a it's a very good interactor when
 

1699
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,029
it's a it's a very good interactor when
it comes to interaction between

1700
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:13,039
it comes to interaction between
 

1701
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,590
it comes to interaction between
this protein and other protein all right

1702
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:15,600
this protein and other protein all right
 

1703
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,830
this protein and other protein all right
so these things also evolve

1704
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:17,840
so these things also evolve
 

1705
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,110
so these things also evolve
you know uh and they in a way

1706
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:21,120
you know uh and they in a way
 

1707
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,830
you know uh and they in a way
have different law uh sort of uh uh laws

1708
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:23,840
have different law uh sort of uh uh laws
 

1709
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:24,310
have different law uh sort of uh uh laws
of

1710
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:24,320
of
 

1711
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,470
of
uh or the driving laws that

1712
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:28,480
uh or the driving laws that
 

1713
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,430
uh or the driving laws that
underlie the the evolution because they

1714
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:31,440
underlie the the evolution because they
 

1715
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,789
underlie the the evolution because they
no longer need to

1716
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:32,799
no longer need to
 

1717
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,310
no longer need to
uh to preserve certain structure

1718
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:36,320
uh to preserve certain structure
 

1719
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,509
uh to preserve certain structure
right uh unlike protein domains and so

1720
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
right uh unlike protein domains and so
 

1721
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:39,909
right uh unlike protein domains and so
now

1722
00:32:39,909 --> 00:32:39,919
now
 

1723
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,190
now
on top of that you have uh something

1724
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
on top of that you have uh something
 

1725
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:43,909
on top of that you have uh something
that is

1726
00:32:43,909 --> 00:32:43,919
that is
 

1727
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,789
that is
even less studied and this is something

1728
00:32:46,789 --> 00:32:46,799
even less studied and this is something
 

1729
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:47,669
even less studied and this is something
that uh

1730
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:47,679
that uh
 

1731
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,870
that uh
uh attribute to to the concept of

1732
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:50,880
uh attribute to to the concept of
 

1733
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,750
uh attribute to to the concept of
alternative splicing so alternative

1734
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:53,760
alternative splicing so alternative
 

1735
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,870
alternative splicing so alternative
splicing so

1736
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:54,880
splicing so
 

1737
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,950
splicing so
it's a it's a very cool concept it's

1738
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
it's a it's a very cool concept it's
 

1739
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,230
it's a it's a very cool concept it's
something that uh

1740
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:58,240
something that uh
 

1741
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,789
something that uh
uh we've been fascinated about for you

1742
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
uh we've been fascinated about for you
 

1743
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,310
uh we've been fascinated about for you
know over a decade

1744
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:02,320
know over a decade
 

1745
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,789
know over a decade
uh in my lab and trying to do research

1746
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:04,799
uh in my lab and trying to do research
 

1747
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,350
uh in my lab and trying to do research
with that

1748
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
with that
 

1749
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,909
with that
but so you know so so typically you know

1750
00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:07,919
but so you know so so typically you know
 

1751
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,669
but so you know so so typically you know
a simplistic

1752
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:09,679
a simplistic
 

1753
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,509
a simplistic
perspective is that one gene is equal

1754
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
perspective is that one gene is equal
 

1755
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,549
perspective is that one gene is equal
one protein product right so you have a

1756
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:16,559
one protein product right so you have a
 

1757
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,830
one protein product right so you have a
gene

1758
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:17,840
gene
 

1759
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,310
gene
you know you transcribe it and and

1760
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:20,320
you know you transcribe it and and
 

1761
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,509
you know you transcribe it and and
translate it and you

1762
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:21,519
translate it and you
 

1763
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,909
translate it and you
it becomes a protein in reality

1764
00:33:25,909 --> 00:33:25,919
it becomes a protein in reality
 

1765
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,870
it becomes a protein in reality
when we talk about eukaryotes especially

1766
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:28,880
when we talk about eukaryotes especially
 

1767
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,789
when we talk about eukaryotes especially
sort of

1768
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:30,799
sort of
 

1769
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,789
sort of
more recent eukaryotes that are very

1770
00:33:32,789 --> 00:33:32,799
more recent eukaryotes that are very
 

1771
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,789
more recent eukaryotes that are very
complex

1772
00:33:34,789 --> 00:33:34,799
complex
 

1773
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:39,350
complex
the gene is not it's no longer equal to

1774
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:39,360
the gene is not it's no longer equal to
 

1775
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,710
the gene is not it's no longer equal to
one protein it actually can

1776
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:42,720
one protein it actually can
 

1777
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,149
one protein it actually can
uh produce multiple

1778
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:46,159
uh produce multiple
 

1779
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,350
uh produce multiple
functionally uh you know active

1780
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:49,360
functionally uh you know active
 

1781
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,950
functionally uh you know active
protein products and each of them is

1782
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:52,960
protein products and each of them is
 

1783
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,470
protein products and each of them is
you know is called an alternatively

1784
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,480
you know is called an alternatively
 

1785
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,830
you know is called an alternatively
spliced product

1786
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:57,840
spliced product
 

1787
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,070
spliced product
the reason it happens is that if you

1788
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,080
the reason it happens is that if you
 

1789
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,590
the reason it happens is that if you
look at the gene

1790
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:01,600
look at the gene
 

1791
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,509
look at the gene
it actually has it has also blocks

1792
00:34:05,509 --> 00:34:05,519
it actually has it has also blocks
 

1793
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,710
it actually has it has also blocks
and the blocks some of which and it

1794
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:08,720
and the blocks some of which and it
 

1795
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,869
and the blocks some of which and it
it's essentially it goes like this so we

1796
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:10,879
it's essentially it goes like this so we
 

1797
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,030
it's essentially it goes like this so we
have a block that will later be

1798
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:13,040
have a block that will later be
 

1799
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,869
have a block that will later be
translated we call it exon

1800
00:34:14,869 --> 00:34:14,879
translated we call it exon
 

1801
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,829
translated we call it exon
then we'll have a block that is not

1802
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:17,839
then we'll have a block that is not
 

1803
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,109
then we'll have a block that is not
translated cut out

1804
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:19,119
translated cut out
 

1805
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,829
translated cut out
we call it intron so we have exon intron

1806
00:34:21,829 --> 00:34:21,839
we call it intron so we have exon intron
 

1807
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,829
we call it intron so we have exon intron
exon intro et cetera et cetera et cetera

1808
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:23,839
exon intro et cetera et cetera et cetera
 

1809
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:24,470
exon intro et cetera et cetera et cetera
right so

1810
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
right so
 

1811
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,790
right so
sometimes you can have uh you know

1812
00:34:26,790 --> 00:34:26,800
sometimes you can have uh you know
 

1813
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,990
sometimes you can have uh you know
dozens of these

1814
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:28,000
dozens of these
 

1815
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,030
dozens of these
exons and introns so what happens is

1816
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
exons and introns so what happens is
 

1817
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,589
exons and introns so what happens is
during the the process when the gene is

1818
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
during the the process when the gene is
 

1819
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,310
during the the process when the gene is
converted

1820
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:34,320
converted
 

1821
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,629
converted
to rna we have

1822
00:34:38,629 --> 00:34:38,639
to rna we have
 

1823
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,470
to rna we have
things that are cut out the introns that

1824
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:42,480
things that are cut out the introns that
 

1825
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,750
things that are cut out the introns that
cut out and exons that now get assembled

1826
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:45,760
cut out and exons that now get assembled
 

1827
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,030
cut out and exons that now get assembled
together

1828
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,040
together
 

1829
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,149
together
and sometimes we will throw out

1830
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
and sometimes we will throw out
 

1831
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,190
and sometimes we will throw out
some of the exons and the remaining

1832
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,200
some of the exons and the remaining
 

1833
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,869
some of the exons and the remaining
protein products will become still be

1834
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
protein products will become still be
 

1835
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,790
protein products will become still be
the same different or different right so

1836
00:34:56,790 --> 00:34:56,800
the same different or different right so
 

1837
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,150
the same different or different right so
so now you have

1838
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:58,160
so now you have
 

1839
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,230
so now you have
uh fragments of the protein that no

1840
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:00,240
uh fragments of the protein that no
 

1841
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,190
uh fragments of the protein that no
longer there

1842
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
longer there
 

1843
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,829
longer there
they were cut out with the introns

1844
00:35:03,829 --> 00:35:03,839
they were cut out with the introns
 

1845
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,870
they were cut out with the introns
sometimes

1846
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:04,880
sometimes
 

1847
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,589
sometimes
you will essentially take one exam and

1848
00:35:07,589 --> 00:35:07,599
you will essentially take one exam and
 

1849
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:09,349
you will essentially take one exam and
replace it with another one

1850
00:35:09,349 --> 00:35:09,359
replace it with another one
 

1851
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,430
replace it with another one
right so there's some flexibility in in

1852
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
right so there's some flexibility in in
 

1853
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,550
right so there's some flexibility in in
this process

1854
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
this process
 

1855
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,510
this process
so so that creates a whole new level of

1856
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:15,520
so so that creates a whole new level of
 

1857
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,950
so so that creates a whole new level of
complexity

1858
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:16,960
complexity
 

1859
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,589
complexity
because it's random though is it random

1860
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:19,599
because it's random though is it random
 

1861
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,109
because it's random though is it random
it's it's not random we

1862
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:21,119
it's it's not random we
 

1863
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,829
it's it's not random we
and and this is where i think uh now the

1864
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:23,839
and and this is where i think uh now the
 

1865
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,990
and and this is where i think uh now the
the appearance of this modern uh single

1866
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:26,000
the appearance of this modern uh single
 

1867
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,470
the appearance of this modern uh single
cell

1868
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:26,480
cell
 

1869
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,670
cell
uh and and before that tissue

1870
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
uh and and before that tissue
 

1871
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,829

00:35:31,829 --> 00:35:31,839
level sequencing next generation
 

1873
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,230

sequencing techniques such as rna-seq

1874
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:34,240
sequencing techniques such as rna-seq
 

1875
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,109
sequencing techniques such as rna-seq
allows us to see that this these are the

1876
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
allows us to see that this these are the
 

1877
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,069
allows us to see that this these are the

1878
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:38,079

1879
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,510

it's a dynamic event

1882
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:42,880
it's a dynamic event
 

1883
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,069
it's a dynamic event
that happens in response to to

developmental stage
 

1889
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,630
developmental stage
of a cell and and this is an incredibly

1890
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:54,640
of a cell and and this is an incredibly
 

1891
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,790
of a cell and and this is an incredibly
complex layer that also

1892
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:58,800
complex layer that also
 

1893
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,710
complex layer that also
undergoes i mean because it's at the

00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:00,720
undergoes i mean because it's at the
 

1895
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,190
undergoes i mean because it's at the
gene level right so it undergoes certain

1896
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,200
gene level right so it undergoes certain
 

1897
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,630
gene level right so it undergoes certain
evolution right and uh

1898
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:06,640
evolution right and uh
 

1899
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,030
evolution right and uh
now we have this interplay between

1900
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:09,040
now we have this interplay between
 

1901
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,790
now we have this interplay between
what's happening and what is happening

1902
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:10,800
what's happening and what is happening
 

1903
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,270
what's happening and what is happening
in the

1904
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:11,280
in the
 

1905
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,430
in the
in the protein world and what is

1906
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:13,440
in the protein world and what is
 

1907
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,870
in the protein world and what is
happening in the

1908
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:14,880
happening in the
 

1909
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,990
happening in the
in the gene and you know rna world

1910
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:18,000
in the gene and you know rna world
 

1911
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,030
in the gene and you know rna world
and for example you know it's

1912
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:21,040
and for example you know it's
 

1913
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,310
and for example you know it's
it's often that we see that the

1914
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:24,320
it's often that we see that the
 

1915
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,430
it's often that we see that the
boundaries of this exons

1916
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:27,440
boundaries of this exons
 

1917
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,109
boundaries of this exons
coincide with the boundaries of the

1918
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:29,119
coincide with the boundaries of the
 

1919
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,750
coincide with the boundaries of the
protein domains

1920
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:31,760
protein domains
 

1921
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,790
protein domains
right so there is this you know close

1922
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:34,800
right so there is this you know close
 

1923
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,069
right so there is this you know close
interplay to that

1924
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
interplay to that
 

1925
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,829
interplay to that
uh it's not always i mean you know

1926
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:37,839
uh it's not always i mean you know
 

1927
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:39,750
uh it's not always i mean you know
otherwise it would be too simple right

1928
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:39,760
otherwise it would be too simple right
 

1929
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,470
otherwise it would be too simple right
but we do see the connection between

1930
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:42,480
but we do see the connection between
 

1931
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,270
but we do see the connection between
those

1932
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:43,280
those
 

1933
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,990
those
sort of machineries and obviously the

1934
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,000
sort of machineries and obviously the
 

1935
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,190
sort of machineries and obviously the
evolution

1936
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,200
evolution
 

1937
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,230
evolution
will pick up this complexity and

1938
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
will pick up this complexity and
 

1939
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,829
will pick up this complexity and
uh you know select for whatever is

1940
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:52,839
uh you know select for whatever is
 

1941
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,950
uh you know select for whatever is
successful

1942
00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:54,960
successful
 

1943
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,470
successful
we see that complexity in play and and

1944
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:58,480
we see that complexity in play and and
 

1945
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,710
we see that complexity in play and and
makes this question you know more

1946
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
makes this question you know more
 

1947
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,150
makes this question you know more
complex but more exciting

1948
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:02,160
complex but more exciting
 

1949
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,150
complex but more exciting
as a small detour i don't know if you

1950
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:04,160
as a small detour i don't know if you
 

1951
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,349
as a small detour i don't know if you
think about this in

1952
00:37:05,349 --> 00:37:05,359
think about this in
 

1953
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:07,430
think about this in
into the world of computer science

1954
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:07,440
into the world of computer science
 

1955
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,030
into the world of computer science
there's uh

1956
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,040
there's uh
 

1957
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,510
there's uh
douglas house that or i think came up

1958
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:11,520
douglas house that or i think came up
 

1959
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,550
douglas house that or i think came up
with a

1960
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:12,560
with a
 

1961
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,510
with a
name of quine which are i don't know if

1962
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:15,520
name of quine which are i don't know if
 

1963
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,710
name of quine which are i don't know if
you're familiar with these things but

1964
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:16,720
you're familiar with these things but
 

1965
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,790
you're familiar with these things but
it's computer programs

1966
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
it's computer programs
 

1967
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,069
it's computer programs
that have uh i guess exxon and intron

1968
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:22,079
that have uh i guess exxon and intron
 

1969
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,150
that have uh i guess exxon and intron
and they copy the whole purpose of the

1970
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:24,160
and they copy the whole purpose of the
 

1971
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,069
and they copy the whole purpose of the
program is to copy itself

1972
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:26,079
program is to copy itself
 

1973
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,710
program is to copy itself
so it prints copies of itself but can

1974
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:28,720
so it prints copies of itself but can
 

1975
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,790
so it prints copies of itself but can
also carry information inside of it

1976
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800
also carry information inside of it
 

1977
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,510
also carry information inside of it
so it's a very kind of crude fun

1978
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,520
so it's a very kind of crude fun
 

1979
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,710
so it's a very kind of crude fun
exercise

1980
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:34,720
exercise
 

1981
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,310
exercise
of um can we sort of replicate these

1982
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:38,320
of um can we sort of replicate these
 

1983
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,829
of um can we sort of replicate these
ideas from cells

1984
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:39,839
ideas from cells
 

1985
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,670
ideas from cells
can we have a computer program that when

1986
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:41,680
can we have a computer program that when
 

1987
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,870
can we have a computer program that when
you run it

1988
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
you run it
 

1989
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:46,150
you run it
just prints itself the entirety of

00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,160
just prints itself the entirety of
 

1991
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,950
just prints itself the entirety of

1992
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:46,960
itself
 

1993
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,390
itself
and does it in different programming

1994
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:48,400
and does it in different programming
 

1995
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,550
and does it in different programming
languages and so on i've been playing

1996
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:50,560
languages and so on i've been playing
 

1997
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,270
languages and so on i've been playing
around and

1998
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:51,280
around and
 

1999
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,950
around and
writing them it's a kind of fun little

2000
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
writing them it's a kind of fun little
 

2001
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,870
writing them it's a kind of fun little
exercise you know when i was a kid

2002
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880
exercise you know when i was a kid
 

2003
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,829
exercise you know when i was a kid
so so you know it it was essentially one

2004
00:37:57,829 --> 00:37:57,839
so so you know it it was essentially one
 

2005
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:58,790
so so you know it it was essentially one
of the

2006
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:58,800
of the
 

2007
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,790
of the
of the sort of main stages

2008
00:38:02,790 --> 00:38:02,800
of the sort of main stages
 

2009
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,630
of the sort of main stages
in in informatics olympiads

2010
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:06,640
in in informatics olympiads
 

2011
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,430
in in informatics olympiads
that you have to reach in order to be

2012
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:09,440
that you have to reach in order to be
 

2013
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,790
that you have to reach in order to be
any so good

2014
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:10,800
any so good
 

2015
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,310
any so good
is you should be able to write a program

2016
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:14,320
is you should be able to write a program
 

2017
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:14,870
is you should be able to write a program
that

2018
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:14,880
that
 

2019
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,310
that
replicates itself and so the tax then

2020
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:18,320
replicates itself and so the tax then
 

2021
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:18,950
replicates itself and so the tax then
becomes

2022
00:38:18,950 --> 00:38:18,960
becomes
 

2023
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,790
becomes
even you know sort of more complicated

2024
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:20,800
even you know sort of more complicated
 

2025
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,470
even you know sort of more complicated
so what is the shortest

2026
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:22,480
so what is the shortest
 

2027
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,230
so what is the shortest
what is the sure program yeah and of

2028
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
what is the sure program yeah and of
 

2029
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,510
what is the sure program yeah and of
course it's it's you know it's a

2030
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:25,520
course it's it's you know it's a
 

2031
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,349
course it's it's you know it's a
function of a programming language

2032
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:27,359
function of a programming language
 

2033
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:29,670
function of a programming language
but yeah i remember you know long long

2034
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
but yeah i remember you know long long
 

2035
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,870
but yeah i remember you know long long
long time ago

2036
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:30,880
long time ago
 

2037
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,990
long time ago
when we tried to you know to to make it

2038
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,000
when we tried to you know to to make it
 

2039
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,750
when we tried to you know to to make it
short and short and find the the

2040
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:35,760
short and short and find the the
 

2041
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,750
short and short and find the the
the shortcut there's actually on a stack

2042
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:37,760
the shortcut there's actually on a stack
 

2043
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,510
the shortcut there's actually on a stack
exchange there's a

2044
00:38:39,510 --> 00:38:39,520
exchange there's a
 

2045
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,030
exchange there's a
entire site called code golf

2046
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,040
entire site called code golf
 

2047
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,589
entire site called code golf
i think where the entirety is just a

2048
00:38:45,589 --> 00:38:45,599
i think where the entirety is just a
 

2049
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:46,390
i think where the entirety is just a
competition

2050
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:46,400
competition
 

2051
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,510
competition
people just come up with whatever task i

2052
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:49,520
people just come up with whatever task i
 

2053
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,230
people just come up with whatever task i
don't know

2054
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,240
don't know
 

2055
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,190
don't know
like uh write code that reports the

2056
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:53,200
like uh write code that reports the
 

2057
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,550
like uh write code that reports the
weather today

2058
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:54,560
weather today
 

2059
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,670
weather today
and the competition is about whatever

2060
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:57,680
and the competition is about whatever
 

2061
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,030
and the competition is about whatever
programming language what is the

2062
00:38:59,030 --> 00:38:59,040
programming language what is the
 

2063
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,230
programming language what is the
shortest program

2064
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,240
shortest program
 

2065
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,589
shortest program
and it makes you actually people should

2066
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:01,599
and it makes you actually people should
 

2067
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,109
and it makes you actually people should
check it out because it makes you

2068
00:39:03,109 --> 00:39:03,119
check it out because it makes you
 

2069
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,230
check it out because it makes you
realize there's some

2070
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:04,240
realize there's some
 

2071
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,990
realize there's some
some weird programming languages out

2072
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:06,000
some weird programming languages out
 

2073
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,670
some weird programming languages out
there but

2074
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:07,680
there but
 

2075
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,870
there but
you know just to dig on that a little uh

2076
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:10,880
you know just to dig on that a little uh
 

2077
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,630
you know just to dig on that a little uh
deeper uh do you think

2078
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:14,640
deeper uh do you think
 

2079
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,470
deeper uh do you think
you know in computer science we don't

2080
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:16,480
you know in computer science we don't
 

2081
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,470
you know in computer science we don't
often think about

2082
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:18,480
often think about
 

2083
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,150
often think about
programs just like the machine learning

2084
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:20,160
programs just like the machine learning
 

2085
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,829
programs just like the machine learning
world now

2086
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:21,839
world now
 

2087
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,950
world now
uh that's still kind of basic

2088
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:24,960
uh that's still kind of basic
 

2089
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,829
uh that's still kind of basic
programs and then there's humans that

2090
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:27,839
programs and then there's humans that
 

2091
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:29,030
programs and then there's humans that
replicate themselves

2092
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:29,040
replicate themselves
 

2093
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,790
replicate themselves
right and there's these mutations and so

2094
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:30,800
right and there's these mutations and so
 

2095
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,710
right and there's these mutations and so
on

2096
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:32,720
on
 

2097
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,230
on
do you think we'll ever have a world

2098
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:34,240
do you think we'll ever have a world
 

2099
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,829
do you think we'll ever have a world
where there's programs that kind of

2100
00:39:37,829 --> 00:39:37,839
where there's programs that kind of
 

2101
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,790
where there's programs that kind of
have an evolutionary process so i'm not

2102
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:40,800
have an evolutionary process so i'm not
 

2103
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,390
have an evolutionary process so i'm not
talking about evolutionary algorithms

2104
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:42,400
talking about evolutionary algorithms
 

2105
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,910
talking about evolutionary algorithms
but i'm talking about programs that kind

2106
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:43,920
but i'm talking about programs that kind
 

2107
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,630
but i'm talking about programs that kind
of

2108
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,640
of
 

2109
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,430
of
mate with each other and evolve and like

2110
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:47,440
mate with each other and evolve and like
 

2111
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,430
mate with each other and evolve and like
on their own replicate themselves

2112
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:49,440
on their own replicate themselves
 

2113
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:53,270
on their own replicate themselves
so this is kind of the idea here

2114
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:53,280
so this is kind of the idea here
 

2115
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,510
so this is kind of the idea here
is you know that's how you can have a

2116
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:55,520
is you know that's how you can have a
 

2117
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,390
is you know that's how you can have a
runaway

2118
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:56,400
runaway
 

2119
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,550
runaway
thing so we think about machine learning

2120
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
thing so we think about machine learning
 

2121
00:39:58,560 --> 00:39:59,670
thing so we think about machine learning
as a system that gets smarter and

2122
00:39:59,670 --> 00:39:59,680
as a system that gets smarter and
 

2123
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,349
as a system that gets smarter and
smarter and smarter and smarter

2124
00:40:01,349 --> 00:40:01,359
smarter and smarter and smarter
 

2125
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,870
smarter and smarter and smarter
at least the machine learning systems of

2126
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:02,880
at least the machine learning systems of
 

2127
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,550
at least the machine learning systems of
today are

2128
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:04,560
today are
 

2129
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,790
today are
like it's it's a program that you can

2130
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:06,800
like it's it's a program that you can
 

2131
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,950
like it's it's a program that you can
like turn off

2132
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:08,960
like turn off
 

2133
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,829
like turn off
as opposed to throwing a bunch of little

2134
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839
as opposed to throwing a bunch of little
 

2135
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,349
as opposed to throwing a bunch of little
programs out there and letting them

2136
00:40:13,349 --> 00:40:13,359
programs out there and letting them
 

2137
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:16,390
programs out there and letting them
like multiply and mate and evolve and

2138
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:16,400
like multiply and mate and evolve and
 

2139
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,270
like multiply and mate and evolve and
replicate

2140
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:17,280
replicate
 

2141
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,190
replicate
do you ever think about that kind of

2142
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:19,200
do you ever think about that kind of
 

2143
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,589
do you ever think about that kind of
world you know when we jump from the

2144
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:21,599
world you know when we jump from the
 

2145
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:22,790
world you know when we jump from the
biological

2146
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:22,800
biological
 

2147
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,990
biological
systems that you're looking at to to

2148
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:26,000
systems that you're looking at to to
 

2149
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,190
systems that you're looking at to to
artificial ones i mean it's

2150
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:29,200
artificial ones i mean it's
 

2151
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,750
artificial ones i mean it's
almost like you you take the the sort of

2152
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:31,760
almost like you you take the the sort of
 

2153
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,910
almost like you you take the the sort of
the area of intelligent agents

2154
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:33,920
the area of intelligent agents
 

2155
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,829
the area of intelligent agents
right which are essentially the the

2156
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:35,839
right which are essentially the the
 

2157
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:38,069
right which are essentially the the
independent sort of uh

2158
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:38,079
independent sort of uh
 

2159
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:40,950
independent sort of uh
codes that run and interact and exchange

2160
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:40,960
codes that run and interact and exchange
 

2161
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,990
codes that run and interact and exchange
the information

2162
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,000
the information
 

2163
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,750
the information
right so i i don't see why not i mean i

2164
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:45,760
right so i i don't see why not i mean i
 

2165
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,069
right so i i don't see why not i mean i
you know it could be sort of a natural

2166
00:40:48,069 --> 00:40:48,079
you know it could be sort of a natural
 

2167
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:49,430
you know it could be sort of a natural
evolution in in

2168

in this you know uh area of computer

2170
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:52,240
in this you know uh area of computer
 

2171
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,790
in this you know uh area of computer
science

2172

science
 

2173
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,990
science
i think it's kind of an interesting

2174
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,000
i think it's kind of an interesting
 

2175
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,829
i think it's kind of an interesting
possibility it's terrifying too

2176
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:55,839
possibility it's terrifying too
 

2177
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,150
possibility it's terrifying too
but i think it's a really powerful tool

2178
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:58,160
but i think it's a really powerful tool
 

2179
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,230
but i think it's a really powerful tool
like to have like agents that inter

2180
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:00,240
like to have like agents that inter
 

2181
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,750
like to have like agents that inter
you know we have social networks with

2182
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:01,760
you know we have social networks with
 

2183
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,670
you know we have social networks with
millions of people and they interact

2184
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:03,680
millions of people and they interact
 

2185
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,349
millions of people and they interact
i think it's interesting to inject into

2186
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:05,359
i think it's interesting to inject into
 

2187
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,510
i think it's interesting to inject into
that was already injected into that bots

2188
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
that was already injected into that bots
 

2189
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,309
that was already injected into that bots
right but those bots are pretty dumb uh

2190
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:10,319
right but those bots are pretty dumb uh
 

2191
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:11,109
right but those bots are pretty dumb uh
uh

2192
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:11,119
uh
 

2193
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,349
uh
you know they're they're probably pretty

2194
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
you know they're they're probably pretty
 

2195
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:14,550
you know they're they're probably pretty
dumb algorithms

2196
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,560
dumb algorithms
 

2197
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,270
dumb algorithms
uh you know it's interesting to think

2198
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:17,280
uh you know it's interesting to think
 

2199
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,589
uh you know it's interesting to think
that

2200
00:41:17,589 --> 00:41:17,599
that
 

2201
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,349
that
there might be bots that evolve together

2202
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:19,359
there might be bots that evolve together
 

2203
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:21,510
there might be bots that evolve together
with humans and there's the sea of

2204
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
with humans and there's the sea of
 

2205
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,870
with humans and there's the sea of
humans

2206

2207
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,030
humans
and robots that are operating first in

2208
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:25,040
and robots that are operating first in
 

2209
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,309
and robots that are operating first in
the digital space

the digital space
 

2211
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,550
the digital space
and then you can also think i love the

2212
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:28,560
and then you can also think i love the
 

2213
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,710
and then you can also think i love the
idea some people worked i think

2214
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:30,720
idea some people worked i think
 

2215
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,230

at harvard at penn there's uh

2216
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:34,240
at harvard at penn there's uh
 

2217
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,430
at harvard at penn there's uh
robotics labs that you know build

2218
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:37,440
robotics labs that you know build
 

2219
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,349
robotics labs that you know build
take as a fundamental task to build a

take as a fundamental task to build a
 

2221
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,190
take as a fundamental task to build a
robot that given

extra resources can build another copy
 

2225
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,790
extra resources can build another copy
of itself

of itself
 

2227
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,430
of itself
like in the physical space which is uh

2228
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:47,440
like in the physical space which is uh
 

2229
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,990
like in the physical space which is uh
super

2230
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,000
super
 

2231
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,870
super
difficult to do but super interesting i

2232
00:41:50,870 --> 00:41:50,880
difficult to do but super interesting i
 

2233
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,349
difficult to do but super interesting i
remember there's like research on

2234
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:53,359
remember there's like research on
 

2235
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,430
remember there's like research on
robots that can build a bridge so they

2236
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:55,440
robots that can build a bridge so they
 

2237
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,030
robots that can build a bridge so they
make a copy of themselves and they

2238
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:57,040
make a copy of themselves and they
 

2239
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,390
make a copy of themselves and they
connect themselves and

2240
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:58,400
connect themselves and
 

2241
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,790
connect themselves and
sort of like self-building bridge based

2242
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:00,800
sort of like self-building bridge based
 

2243
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,349
sort of like self-building bridge based
on building blocks you can imagine like

2244
00:42:03,349 --> 00:42:03,359
on building blocks you can imagine like
 

2245
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:05,750
on building blocks you can imagine like
a building that self-assembles so it's

2246
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:05,760
a building that self-assembles so it's
 

2247
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,430
a building that self-assembles so it's
basically self-assembling structures

2248
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:07,440
basically self-assembling structures
 

2249
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,710
basically self-assembling structures
from uh

2250
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:08,720
from uh
 

2251
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,870
from uh
from uh robotic parts but it's

2252
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:10,880
from uh robotic parts but it's
 

2253
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,069
from uh robotic parts but it's
interesting

2254
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:12,079
interesting
 

2255
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:14,829
interesting
to within that robot add the ability to

2256
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839
to within that robot add the ability to
 

2257
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:16,150
to within that robot add the ability to
mutate and

2258
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,160
mutate and
 

2259
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,750
mutate and
uh and and do all the interesting

2260
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:19,760
uh and and do all the interesting
 

2261
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,150
uh and and do all the interesting
like little things that you're referring

2262
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:22,160
like little things that you're referring
 

2263
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,150
like little things that you're referring
to in evolution to go from a single

2264
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:24,160
to in evolution to go from a single
 

2265
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,670
to in evolution to go from a single
origin protein building block to like

2266
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:27,680
origin protein building block to like
 

2267
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,589
origin protein building block to like
well weird complexity and if you think

2268
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:29,599
well weird complexity and if you think
 

2269
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,670
well weird complexity and if you think
about this i mean you know the bits and

2270
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:31,680
about this i mean you know the bits and
 

2271
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,190
about this i mean you know the bits and
pieces

2272
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:33,200
pieces
 

2273
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,349
pieces
are there you know so so you mentioned

2274
00:42:35,349 --> 00:42:35,359
are there you know so so you mentioned
 

2275
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,190
are there you know so so you mentioned
revolutionary algorithm right you know

2276
00:42:37,190 --> 00:42:37,200
revolutionary algorithm right you know
 

2277
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,390
revolutionary algorithm right you know
so this is sort of yeah

2278
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:38,400
so this is sort of yeah
 

2279
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,390
so this is sort of yeah
and the the maybe sort of the the goal

2280
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400
and the the maybe sort of the the goal
 

2281
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,270
and the the maybe sort of the the goal
is in a way different right so the goal

2282
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:45,280
is in a way different right so the goal
 

2283
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,190
is in a way different right so the goal
is to you know to essentially

2284
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:47,200
is to you know to essentially
 

2285
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,550
is to you know to essentially
uh to to optimize your search right so

2286
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:50,560
uh to to optimize your search right so
 

2287
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,630
uh to to optimize your search right so
uh but uh sort of the the ideas are

2288
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:52,640
uh but uh sort of the the ideas are
 

2289
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,790
uh but uh sort of the the ideas are
there so you people recognize that you

2290
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:54,800
there so you people recognize that you
 

2291
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,589
there so you people recognize that you
know that the

2292
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:55,599
know that the
 

2293
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,109
know that the
the you know recombination events

2294
00:42:59,109 --> 00:42:59,119
the you know recombination events
 

2295
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,230
the you know recombination events
lead to global changes in the in in

2296
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240
lead to global changes in the in in
 

2297
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,230
lead to global changes in the in in
search trajectories the mutations event

2298
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,240
search trajectories the mutations event
 

2299
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,510
search trajectories the mutations event
is a more refined

2300
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
is a more refined
 

2301
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:09,990
is a more refined
uh you know uh step in in the search

2302
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,000
uh you know uh step in in the search
 

2303
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,190
uh you know uh step in in the search
then you have you know uh other sort of

2304
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:13,200
then you have you know uh other sort of
 

2305
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,630
then you have you know uh other sort of
uh nature inspired algorithm right so

2306
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:16,640
uh nature inspired algorithm right so
 

2307
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,990
uh nature inspired algorithm right so
one of the reason that

2308
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,000
one of the reason that
 

2309
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,950
one of the reason that
that you know i think it's it's one of

2310
00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:20,960
that you know i think it's it's one of
 

2311
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,030
that you know i think it's it's one of
the funnest one is the slime

2312
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
the funnest one is the slime
 

2313
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,309
the funnest one is the slime
uh based algorithm right so that it's a

2314
00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:26,319
uh based algorithm right so that it's a
 

2315
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:28,390
uh based algorithm right so that it's a
i think the first was introduced by the

2316
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:28,400
i think the first was introduced by the
 

2317
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,349
i think the first was introduced by the
japanese

2318
00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:29,359
japanese
 

2319
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,790
japanese
group but where it was able to to solve

2320
00:43:32,790 --> 00:43:32,800
group but where it was able to to solve
 

2321
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,190
group but where it was able to to solve
uh some some pre you know complex

2322
00:43:35,190 --> 00:43:35,200
uh some some pre you know complex
 

2323
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,150
uh some some pre you know complex
problems

2324
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:36,160
problems
 

2325
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,190
problems
uh so so that's the yeah and and then

2326
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:39,200
uh so so that's the yeah and and then
 

2327
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,230
uh so so that's the yeah and and then
i think uh there are still

2328
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:42,240
i think uh there are still
 

2329
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,750
i think uh there are still
a lot of things we've yet to to

2330
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:45,760
a lot of things we've yet to to
 

2331
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,950
a lot of things we've yet to to
you know borrow from the nature right so

2332
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:48,960
you know borrow from the nature right so
 

2333
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:49,510
you know borrow from the nature right so
there are

2334
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
there are
 

2335
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:53,030
there are
a lot of sort of ideas that nature

2336
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:53,040
a lot of sort of ideas that nature
 

2337
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,230
a lot of sort of ideas that nature
uh you know gets to offer us that

2338
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:56,240
uh you know gets to offer us that
 

2339
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,190
uh you know gets to offer us that
you know it's up to us to grab it and to

2340
00:43:59,190 --> 00:43:59,200
you know it's up to us to grab it and to
 

2341
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,670
you know it's up to us to grab it and to
to

2342
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
to
 

2343
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,069
to
to you know get the best use of it

2344
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:02,079
to you know get the best use of it
 

2345
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,589
to you know get the best use of it
including neural networks

2346
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
including neural networks
 

2347
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,309
including neural networks
you know we have a very crude inspire

2348
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:06,319
you know we have a very crude inspire
 

2349
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:07,750
you know we have a very crude inspire
inspiration from nature on neural

2350
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:07,760
inspiration from nature on neural
 

2351
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,109
inspiration from nature on neural
networks maybe there's

2352
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:09,119
networks maybe there's
 

2353
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,870
networks maybe there's
other inspirations to be discovered in

2354
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:10,880
other inspirations to be discovered in
 

2355
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,309
other inspirations to be discovered in
the brain or

2356
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:12,319
the brain or
 

2357
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,150
the brain or
other aspects of uh the various systems

2358
00:44:16,150 --> 00:44:16,160
other aspects of uh the various systems
 

2359
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,230
other aspects of uh the various systems
even like the immune system the way it

2360
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,240
even like the immune system the way it
 

2361
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,990
even like the immune system the way it
uh interplays

2362
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:20,000
uh interplays
 

2363
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,390
uh interplays
i recently started to understand that

2364
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:22,400
i recently started to understand that
 

2365
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,069
i recently started to understand that
like the immune system has something to

2366
00:44:24,069 --> 00:44:24,079
like the immune system has something to
 

2367
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:25,270
like the immune system has something to
do with the way the brain

2368
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,280
do with the way the brain
 

2369
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,950
do with the way the brain
operates like there's multiple things

2370
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:26,960
operates like there's multiple things
 

2371
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,309
operates like there's multiple things
going on in there

2372
00:44:28,309 --> 00:44:28,319
going on in there
 

2373
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,550
going on in there
which uh all of which are not modeled in

2374
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
which uh all of which are not modeled in
 

2375
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,990
which uh all of which are not modeled in
artificial neural networks

2376
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:32,000
artificial neural networks
 

2377
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,910
artificial neural networks
and maybe if you throw a little bit of

2378
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:33,920
and maybe if you throw a little bit of
 

2379
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,069
and maybe if you throw a little bit of
that biological spice in there

2380
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:36,079
that biological spice in there
 

2381
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,990
that biological spice in there
you'll come up with something uh

2382
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:38,000
you'll come up with something uh
 

2383
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,589
you'll come up with something uh
something cool i i

2384
00:44:39,589 --> 00:44:39,599
something cool i i
 

2385
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,430
something cool i i
i'm not sure if you're familiar with the

2386
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:41,440
i'm not sure if you're familiar with the
 

2387
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,670
i'm not sure if you're familiar with the
drake equation

2388
00:44:43,670 --> 00:44:43,680
drake equation
 

2389
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,150
drake equation
that uh estimate i just did a video on

2390
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
that uh estimate i just did a video on
 

2391
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,670
that uh estimate i just did a video on
it yesterday because i wanted to give my

2392
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:47,680
it yesterday because i wanted to give my
 

2393
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,190
it yesterday because i wanted to give my
own estimate of it

2394
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:49,200
own estimate of it
 

2395
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,349
own estimate of it
it's uh it's an equation that combines a

2396
00:44:51,349 --> 00:44:51,359
it's uh it's an equation that combines a
 

2397
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:53,990
it's uh it's an equation that combines a
bunch of factors to estimate how many

2398
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:54,000
bunch of factors to estimate how many
 

2399
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,270
bunch of factors to estimate how many
alien civilizations oh yeah i've heard

2400
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:57,280
alien civilizations oh yeah i've heard
 

2401
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,069
alien civilizations oh yeah i've heard
about it

2402
00:44:58,069 --> 00:44:58,079
about it
 

2403
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,910
about it
yes so one one of the interesting

2404
00:44:59,910 --> 00:44:59,920
yes so one one of the interesting
 

2405
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,470
yes so one one of the interesting
parameters you know it's like

2406
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:02,480
parameters you know it's like
 

2407
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,910
parameters you know it's like
how many uh stars are born every year

2408
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:05,920
how many uh stars are born every year
 

2409
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,309
how many uh stars are born every year
how many planets are on average per star

2410
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
how many planets are on average per star
 

2411
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,190
how many planets are on average per star
uh for this how many habitable planets

2412
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200
uh for this how many habitable planets
 

2413
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,150
uh for this how many habitable planets
are there

2414
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:14,160
are there
 

2415
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,390
are there
and then the the one that starts being

2416
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
and then the the one that starts being
 

2417
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,630
and then the the one that starts being
really interesting

2418
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:18,640
really interesting
 

2419
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,230
really interesting
is uh the probability that life emerges

2420
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:22,240
is uh the probability that life emerges
 

2421
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,990
is uh the probability that life emerges
on a habitable planet so like

2422
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:26,000
on a habitable planet so like
 

2423
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,829
on a habitable planet so like
i don't know if you think about you

2424
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:27,839
i don't know if you think about you
 

2425
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:29,510
i don't know if you think about you
certainly think a lot about evolution

2426
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:29,520
certainly think a lot about evolution
 

2427
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,870
certainly think a lot about evolution
but do you think about the thing

2428
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:30,880
but do you think about the thing
 

2429
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,550
but do you think about the thing
which evolution doesn't describe which

2430
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:32,560
which evolution doesn't describe which
 

2431
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,710
which evolution doesn't describe which
is like the beginning of evolution

2432
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:34,720
is like the beginning of evolution
 

2433
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,510
is like the beginning of evolution
the origin of life i think i put the

2434
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:37,520
the origin of life i think i put the
 

2435
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,349
the origin of life i think i put the
probability of life developing a

2436
00:45:39,349 --> 00:45:39,359
probability of life developing a
 

2437
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:40,390
probability of life developing a
habitable planet

2438
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:40,400
habitable planet
 

2439
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,950
habitable planet
one percent this is very scientifically

2440
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:42,960
one percent this is very scientifically
 

2441
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,309
one percent this is very scientifically
uh rigorous

2442
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:44,319
uh rigorous
 

2443
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,670
uh rigorous
okay uh well first at a high level for

2444
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:47,680
okay uh well first at a high level for
 

2445
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,190
okay uh well first at a high level for
the drake equation what would you put

2446
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:49,200
the drake equation what would you put
 

2447
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,390
the drake equation what would you put
that percent that

2448
00:45:50,390 --> 00:45:50,400
that percent that
 

2449
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,670
that percent that
on earth and in general do you have

2450
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:53,680
on earth and in general do you have
 

2451
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,870
on earth and in general do you have
something

2452
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:54,880
something
 

2453
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,870
something
do you have thoughts about how life

2454
00:45:56,870 --> 00:45:56,880
do you have thoughts about how life
 

2455
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:57,990
do you have thoughts about how life
might have started

2456
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:58,000
might have started
 

2457
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,230
might have started
you know like the proteins being the

2458
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
you know like the proteins being the
 

2459
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,069
you know like the proteins being the
first kind of one of the early

2460
00:46:02,069 --> 00:46:02,079
first kind of one of the early
 

2461
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,270
first kind of one of the early
jumping points yes so so um i think

2462
00:46:05,270 --> 00:46:05,280
jumping points yes so so um i think
 

2463
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,470
jumping points yes so so um i think
back in 2018 there was a very exciting

2464
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:08,480
back in 2018 there was a very exciting
 

2465
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,390
back in 2018 there was a very exciting
paper published in nature

2466
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:10,400
paper published in nature
 

2467
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,309
paper published in nature
where they uh found

2468
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:14,319
where they uh found
 

2469
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:18,150
where they uh found
uh one of the simplest amino acids

2470
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
uh one of the simplest amino acids
 

2471
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,829
uh one of the simplest amino acids
glycine

2472
00:46:19,829 --> 00:46:19,839
glycine
 

2473
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:23,430
glycine

get close to this comment and get the
the

2494
00:46:45,589 --> 00:46:45,599
the
 

2495
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,630
the
stardust from from its tail and

2496
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
stardust from from its tail and
 

2497
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,710
stardust from from its tail and
uh when scientists analyzed it they

2498
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
uh when scientists analyzed it they
 

2499
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,150
uh when scientists analyzed it they
actually found

2500
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:52,160
actually found
 

2501
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,270
actually found
traces of uh you know uh

2502
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
traces of uh you know uh
 

2503
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,390
traces of uh you know uh
of glycine which you know makes up you

2504
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:58,400
of glycine which you know makes up you
 

2505
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:58,950
of glycine which you know makes up you
know the

2506
00:46:58,950 --> 00:46:58,960
know the
 

2507
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,349
know the
one it's one of the basic uh one of the

2508
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:01,359
one it's one of the basic uh one of the
 

2509
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,309
one it's one of the basic uh one of the
20 basic

2510
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:02,319
20 basic
 

2511
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,990
20 basic
uh amino acids that makes up proteins

2512
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,000
uh amino acids that makes up proteins
 

2513
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,349
uh amino acids that makes up proteins
right so uh so that was exciting very

2514
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:09,359
right so uh so that was exciting very
 

2515
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:09,990
right so uh so that was exciting very
exciting

2516
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:10,000
exciting
 

2517
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,190
exciting
right but you know it's the question is

2518
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:13,200
right but you know it's the question is
 

2519
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,390
right but you know it's the question is
very interesting right so

2520
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:14,400
very interesting right so
 

2521
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,430
very interesting right so
what uh you know what if there is some

2522
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,440
what uh you know what if there is some
 

2523
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:19,750
what uh you know what if there is some
alien life

2524
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:19,760
alien life
 

2525
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:22,870
alien life
is it gonna be made of proteins right or

2526
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:22,880
is it gonna be made of proteins right or
 

2527
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:23,349
is it gonna be made of proteins right or
maybe

2528
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:23,359
maybe
 

2529
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,910
maybe
rnas right so we see that you know the

2530
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
rnas right so we see that you know the
 

2531
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:26,470
rnas right so we see that you know the
the

2532
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:26,480
the
 

2533
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,470
the
rna viruses are certainly you know

2534
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
rna viruses are certainly you know
 

2535
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,309
rna viruses are certainly you know
very well established sort of uh

2536
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:34,319
very well established sort of uh
 

2537
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:37,349
very well established sort of uh
you know group of molecular machines

2538
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:37,359
you know group of molecular machines
 

2539
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:40,150
you know group of molecular machines
right so um so yeah it's it's it's a

2540
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
right so um so yeah it's it's it's a
 

2541
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,549
right so um so yeah it's it's it's a
very

2542
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:40,559
very
 

2543
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:42,230
very
interesting question you know what what

2544
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:42,240
interesting question you know what what
 

2545
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,069
interesting question you know what what
probability would you put like how hard

2546
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:44,079
probability would you put like how hard
 

2547
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:44,870
probability would you put like how hard
is this

2548
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:44,880
is this
 

2549
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,309
is this
job like how unlikely just on earth do

2550
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
job like how unlikely just on earth do
 

2551
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,670
job like how unlikely just on earth do
you think this whole thing is

2552
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:49,680
you think this whole thing is
 

2553
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,390
you think this whole thing is
that we got going like is that are we

2554
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:52,400
that we got going like is that are we
 

2555
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,829
that we got going like is that are we
really lucky or is it

2556
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:53,839
really lucky or is it
 

2557
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,430
really lucky or is it
inevitable like what's your sense when

2558
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
inevitable like what's your sense when
 

2559
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,510
inevitable like what's your sense when
you sit back and think about

2560
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:57,520
you sit back and think about
 

2561
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,829
you sit back and think about
life on earth is it higher or lower than

2562
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
life on earth is it higher or lower than
 

2563
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:00,790
life on earth is it higher or lower than
one percent

2564
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:00,800
one percent
 

2565
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,230
one percent
well because one percent is pretty low

2566
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:02,240
well because one percent is pretty low
 

2567
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,150
well because one percent is pretty low
but it still is like damn that's pretty

2568
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,160
but it still is like damn that's pretty
 

2569
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:04,950
but it still is like damn that's pretty
good chance

2570
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
good chance
 

2571
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,549
good chance
yes it's it's a pretty good chance i

2572
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:06,559
yes it's it's a pretty good chance i
 

2573
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,069
yes it's it's a pretty good chance i
mean i i would

2574
00:48:08,069 --> 00:48:08,079
mean i i would
 

2575
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,910
mean i i would
personally but again you know i'm um

2576
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:11,920
personally but again you know i'm um
 

2577
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,710
personally but again you know i'm um
you know probably not the best person to

2578
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
you know probably not the best person to
 

2579
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:15,109
you know probably not the best person to
to

2580
00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:15,119
to
 

2581
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,150
to
to do such estimations but uh

2582
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:18,160
to do such estimations but uh
 

2583
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,870
to do such estimations but uh
i would you know intuitively i would

2584
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:20,880
i would you know intuitively i would
 

2585
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:21,829
i would you know intuitively i would
probably put it

2586
00:48:21,829 --> 00:48:21,839
probably put it
 

2587
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,710
probably put it
lower yeah but still i mean you know

2588
00:48:24,710 --> 00:48:24,720
lower yeah but still i mean you know
 

2589
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,670
lower yeah but still i mean you know
we're really lucky

2590
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:25,680
we're really lucky
 

2591
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,630
we're really lucky
here on earth uh i mean or the

2592
00:48:28,630 --> 00:48:28,640
here on earth uh i mean or the
 

2593
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,309
here on earth uh i mean or the
conditions are really good

2594
00:48:30,309 --> 00:48:30,319
conditions are really good
 

2595
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,230
conditions are really good
it means you know i think that there was

2596
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,240
it means you know i think that there was
 

2597
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,670
it means you know i think that there was
everything was

2598
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:33,680
everything was
 

2599
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,309
everything was
right in a way right so it's still it's

2600
00:48:36,309 --> 00:48:36,319
right in a way right so it's still it's
 

2601
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:36,790
right in a way right so it's still it's
not

2602
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:36,800
not
 

2603
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,589
not
the the conditions were not like ideal

2604
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:39,599
the the conditions were not like ideal
 

2605
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:40,390
the the conditions were not like ideal
if you

2606
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,400
if you
 

2607
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,190
if you
try to to look at you know what was you

2608
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:43,200
try to to look at you know what was you
 

2609
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,910
try to to look at you know what was you
know

2610
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
know
 

2611
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,870
know
several billions years ago when the life

2612
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:46,880
several billions years ago when the life
 

2613
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,230
several billions years ago when the life
emerged

2614
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:48,240
emerged
 

2615
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,630
emerged
so there is something called uh the rare

2616
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:50,640
so there is something called uh the rare
 

2617
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,910
so there is something called uh the rare
earth hypothesis

2618
00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:51,920
earth hypothesis
 

2619
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:54,790
earth hypothesis
that you know encounter to the drake

2620
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:54,800
that you know encounter to the drake
 

2621
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,870
that you know encounter to the drake
equation says that

2622
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:56,880
equation says that
 

2623
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,230
equation says that
the you know the conditions of earth if

2624
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:00,240
the you know the conditions of earth if
 

2625
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,750
the you know the conditions of earth if
you actually were to describe

2626
00:49:01,750 --> 00:49:01,760
you actually were to describe
 

2627
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:05,750
you actually were to describe
earth it's quite a special place

2628
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:05,760
earth it's quite a special place
 

2629
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,030
earth it's quite a special place
so special might be unique in our galaxy

2630
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,040
so special might be unique in our galaxy
 

2631
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,670
so special might be unique in our galaxy
and potentially you know close to unique

2632
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:11,680
and potentially you know close to unique
 

2633
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,270
and potentially you know close to unique
in the entire universe like it's very

2634
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:13,280
in the entire universe like it's very
 

2635
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,950
in the entire universe like it's very
difficult to reconstruct those

2636
00:49:14,950 --> 00:49:14,960
difficult to reconstruct those
 

2637
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,430
difficult to reconstruct those
same conditions and what the rare earth

2638
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:17,440
same conditions and what the rare earth
 

2639
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,870
same conditions and what the rare earth
hypothesis

2640
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:18,880
hypothesis
 

2641
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,950
hypothesis
argues is all those different conditions

2642
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:20,960
argues is all those different conditions
 

2643
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,870
argues is all those different conditions
are essential for life

2644
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:22,880
are essential for life
 

2645
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:25,670
are essential for life
and so that's the sort of the counter

2646
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:25,680
and so that's the sort of the counter
 

2647
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,109
and so that's the sort of the counter
you know like all the things we

2648
00:49:29,109 --> 00:49:29,119

 

2649
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:31,589

thinking that earth is pretty average um

2650
00:49:31,589 --> 00:49:31,599
thinking that earth is pretty average um
 

2651
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,109
thinking that earth is pretty average um
i mean i can't really

2652
00:49:33,109 --> 00:49:33,119
i mean i can't really
 

2653
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:34,710
i mean i can't really
i'm trying to remember to to go through

2654
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:34,720
i'm trying to remember to to go through
 

2655
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,349
i'm trying to remember to to go through
all of them but just the fact that it um

2656
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:37,359
all of them but just the fact that it um
 

2657
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:41,030
all of them but just the fact that it um
is shielded from a lot of asteroids

2658
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,040
is shielded from a lot of asteroids
 

2659
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:43,589
is shielded from a lot of asteroids
the obviously the distance to the sun

2660
00:49:43,589 --> 00:49:43,599
the obviously the distance to the sun
 

2661
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,270
the obviously the distance to the sun
but also the fact that it's

2662
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,280
but also the fact that it's
 

2663
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,030
but also the fact that it's
um it's like a perfect balance between

2664
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:49,040
um it's like a perfect balance between
 

2665
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,230
um it's like a perfect balance between
the amount of water and land and all

2666
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:52,240
the amount of water and land and all
 

2667
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,430
the amount of water and land and all
those kinds of things and

2668
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:53,440
those kinds of things and
 

2669
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,309
those kinds of things and
i don't know there's a bunch of

2670
00:49:54,309 --> 00:49:54,319
i don't know there's a bunch of
 

2671
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:56,150
i don't know there's a bunch of
different factors that i remember

2672
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
different factors that i remember
 

2673
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,270
different factors that i remember
there's a long list

2674
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:57,280
there's a long list
 

2675
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,670
there's a long list
but it's fascinating to think about if

2676
00:49:59,670 --> 00:49:59,680
but it's fascinating to think about if
 

2677
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,630
but it's fascinating to think about if
if uh

2678
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:00,640
if uh
 

2679
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,510
if uh
in order for something like proteins and

2680
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:03,520
in order for something like proteins and
 

2681
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:03,910
in order for something like proteins and
then

2682
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
then
 

2683
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,309
then
dna and rna to emerge you need um

2684
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:08,319
dna and rna to emerge you need um
 

2685
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:11,670
dna and rna to emerge you need um
and basic living organisms you need

2686
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:11,680
and basic living organisms you need
 

2687
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,790
and basic living organisms you need
to be a very close and earth-like planet

2688
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:14,800
to be a very close and earth-like planet
 

2689
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,150
to be a very close and earth-like planet
which would be sad or

2690
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:18,160
which would be sad or
 

2691
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,910
which would be sad or
exciting i don't know which uh if you

2692
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:19,920
exciting i don't know which uh if you
 

2693
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,750
exciting i don't know which uh if you
ask me i you know

2694
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:21,760
ask me i you know
 

2695
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,950
ask me i you know
in a way i put a parallel between um

2696
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:24,960
in a way i put a parallel between um
 

2697
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,309
in a way i put a parallel between um
you know between our own research uh

2698
00:50:28,309 --> 00:50:28,319
you know between our own research uh
 

2699
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:31,589
you know between our own research uh
and i mean from the

2700
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
and i mean from the
 

2701
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,910
and i mean from the
from the intuitive perspective you know

2702
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:33,920
from the intuitive perspective you know
 

2703
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:34,870
from the intuitive perspective you know
you have those

2704
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:34,880
you have those
 

2705
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,549
you have those
two extremes and the reality is never

2706
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:38,559
two extremes and the reality is never
 

2707
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,829
two extremes and the reality is never
very rarely falls into the extremes

2708
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:41,839
very rarely falls into the extremes
 

2709
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:44,549
very rarely falls into the extremes
it's always the optimus always reached

2710
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:44,559
it's always the optimus always reached
 

2711
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,470
it's always the optimus always reached
somewhere in between

2712
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:46,480
somewhere in between
 

2713
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:49,430
somewhere in between
so so i would so and that's what i tend

2714
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:49,440
so so i would so and that's what i tend
 

2715
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,870
so so i would so and that's what i tend
to think i think that

2716
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:50,880
to think i think that
 

2717
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,510
to think i think that
uh you know we're probably somewhere in

2718
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:53,520
uh you know we're probably somewhere in
 

2719
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,630
uh you know we're probably somewhere in
between so they were

2720
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:54,640
between so they were
 

2721
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:57,750
between so they were
not unique unique but

2722
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:57,760
not unique unique but
 

2723
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,630
not unique unique but
again the chances are you know

2724
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:00,640
again the chances are you know
 

2725
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,750
again the chances are you know
reasonably small

2726
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:01,760
reasonably small
 

2727
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:03,430
reasonably small
the problem is we don't know the the

2728
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:03,440
the problem is we don't know the the
 

2729
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,109
the problem is we don't know the the
other extreme is like

2730
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:05,119
other extreme is like
 

2731
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,430
other extreme is like
i tend to think that we don't actually

2732
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
i tend to think that we don't actually
 

2733
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,750
i tend to think that we don't actually
understand the basic mechanisms of like

2734
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:09,760
understand the basic mechanisms of like
 

2735
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,270
understand the basic mechanisms of like
what this is all originated from like it

2736
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:13,280
what this is all originated from like it
 

2737
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,150
what this is all originated from like it
seems like

2738
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:14,160
seems like
 

2739
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,990
seems like
we think of life as this distinct thing

2740
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
we think of life as this distinct thing
 

2741
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,390
we think of life as this distinct thing
maybe intelligence is a distinct thing

2742
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:18,400
maybe intelligence is a distinct thing
 

2743
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,510
maybe intelligence is a distinct thing
maybe the physics that from which

2744
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:21,520
maybe the physics that from which
 

2745
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,670
maybe the physics that from which
planets and suns are born is a distinct

2746
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:23,680
planets and suns are born is a distinct
 

2747
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,750
planets and suns are born is a distinct
thing but that could be a very

2748
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:25,760
thing but that could be a very
 

2749
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,430
thing but that could be a very
it's like the stephen wolfram thing it's

2750
00:51:27,430 --> 00:51:27,440
it's like the stephen wolfram thing it's
 

2751
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,349
it's like the stephen wolfram thing it's
like the from simple rules emerges

2752
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:29,359
like the from simple rules emerges
 

2753
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:30,870
like the from simple rules emerges
greater and greater complexity

2754
00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:30,880
greater and greater complexity
 

2755
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,349
greater and greater complexity
so i you know i tend to believe that

2756
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:33,359
so i you know i tend to believe that
 

2757
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:35,589
so i you know i tend to believe that
just life finds a way

2758
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:35,599
just life finds a way
 

2759
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,069
just life finds a way
it like we don't know the extreme of how

2760
00:51:38,069 --> 00:51:38,079
it like we don't know the extreme of how
 

2761
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,349
it like we don't know the extreme of how
common life is

2762
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:39,359
common life is
 

2763
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,190
common life is
because it could be life is like

2764
00:51:42,190 --> 00:51:42,200
because it could be life is like
 

2765
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,870
because it could be life is like
everywhere

2766
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:44,880
everywhere
 

2767
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,829
everywhere
like like so everywhere that it's almost

2768
00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:47,839
like like so everywhere that it's almost
 

2769
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,150
like like so everywhere that it's almost
like

2770
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:48,160
like
 

2771
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:51,109
like
laughable like that we're such idiots to

2772
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
laughable like that we're such idiots to
 

2773
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:51,990
laughable like that we're such idiots to
think where you

2774
00:51:51,990 --> 00:51:52,000
think where you
 

2775
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,549
think where you
like it's it's like ridiculous to even

2776
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:54,559
like it's it's like ridiculous to even
 

2777
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,150
like it's it's like ridiculous to even
like think

2778
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:56,160
like think
 

2779
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,470
like think
it's like ants thinking that their

2780
00:51:58,470 --> 00:51:58,480
it's like ants thinking that their
 

2781
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,069
it's like ants thinking that their
little colony is the

2782
00:52:00,069 --> 00:52:00,079
little colony is the
 

2783
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,470
little colony is the
unique thing and everything else doesn't

2784
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,480
unique thing and everything else doesn't
 

2785
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,510
unique thing and everything else doesn't
exist i mean

2786
00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:03,520
exist i mean
 

2787
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,069
exist i mean
it it's also very possible that that's

2788
00:52:06,069 --> 00:52:06,079
it it's also very possible that that's
 

2789
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:06,630
it it's also very possible that that's
uh

2790
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:06,640
uh
 

2791
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,230
uh
that's the extreme and we're just not

2792
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:08,240
that's the extreme and we're just not
 

2793
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,750
that's the extreme and we're just not
able to maybe comprehend

2794
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:09,760
able to maybe comprehend
 

2795
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,510
able to maybe comprehend
the nature of that uh life just to stick

2796
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
the nature of that uh life just to stick
 

2797
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,430
the nature of that uh life just to stick
on alien life for just a brief

2798
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:15,440
on alien life for just a brief
 

2799
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,790
on alien life for just a brief
moment more is there is some signs of

2800
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:18,800
moment more is there is some signs of
 

2801
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,150
moment more is there is some signs of
signs of life on venus in gaseous form

2802
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
signs of life on venus in gaseous form
 

2803
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:25,589
signs of life on venus in gaseous form
there's uh hope for life

2804
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:25,599
there's uh hope for life
 

2805
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,230
there's uh hope for life
on mars probably extinct we're not

2806
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:28,240
on mars probably extinct we're not
 

2807
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,710
on mars probably extinct we're not
talking about intelligent life

2808
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:30,720
talking about intelligent life
 

2809
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,150
talking about intelligent life
although that has been in the news

2810
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:32,160
although that has been in the news
 

2811
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,109
although that has been in the news
recently we're talking about basic like

2812
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:35,119
recently we're talking about basic like
 

2813
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:38,470
recently we're talking about basic like
you know uh bacteria bacteria yeah

2814
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:38,480
you know uh bacteria bacteria yeah
 

2815
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,549
you know uh bacteria bacteria yeah
and then also i guess uh there's a

2816
00:52:40,549 --> 00:52:40,559
and then also i guess uh there's a
 

2817
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:41,589
and then also i guess uh there's a
couple moons

2818
00:52:41,589 --> 00:52:41,599
couple moons
 

2819
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,630
couple moons
there yeah your europa which is

2820
00:52:44,630 --> 00:52:44,640
there yeah your europa which is
 

2821
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:46,630
there yeah your europa which is
jupiter's moon i think there's another

2822
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
jupiter's moon i think there's another
 

2823
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:47,349
jupiter's moon i think there's another
one

2824
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:47,359
one
 

2825
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,309
one
are you um is that exciting or is it

2826
00:52:50,309 --> 00:52:50,319
are you um is that exciting or is it
 

2827
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,510
are you um is that exciting or is it
terrifying to you that

2828
00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:51,520
terrifying to you that
 

2829
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,750
terrifying to you that
we might find life do you hope we find

2830
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:53,760
we might find life do you hope we find
 

2831
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,030
we might find life do you hope we find
life i certainly

2832
00:52:55,030 --> 00:52:55,040
life i certainly
 

2833
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,150
life i certainly
do hope that we'll find life um i mean

2834
00:52:58,150 --> 00:52:58,160
do hope that we'll find life um i mean
 

2835
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:59,990
do hope that we'll find life um i mean
it was very exciting to

2836
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:00,000
it was very exciting to
 

2837
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,589
it was very exciting to
to hear about uh you know uh this

2838
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
to hear about uh you know uh this
 

2839
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,710
to hear about uh you know uh this
uh news about the the

2840
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:06,720
uh news about the the
 

2841
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,670
uh news about the the
possible life on the venus it'd be nice

2842
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
possible life on the venus it'd be nice
 

2843
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,870
possible life on the venus it'd be nice
to have hard evidence

2844
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:10,880
to have hard evidence
 

2845
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,109
to have hard evidence
of something with uh which is what the

2846
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:13,119
of something with uh which is what the
 

2847
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:14,630
of something with uh which is what the
hope is for

2848
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:14,640
hope is for
 

2849
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,270
hope is for
for mars and and uh europa but do you

2850
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:17,280
for mars and and uh europa but do you
 

2851
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,349
for mars and and uh europa but do you
think those organisms would be similar

2852
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:19,359
think those organisms would be similar
 

2853
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:22,390
think those organisms would be similar
biologically or would they even be sort

2854
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:22,400
biologically or would they even be sort
 

2855
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,829
biologically or would they even be sort
of carbon based

2856
00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:23,839
of carbon based
 

2857
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:27,030
of carbon based
if we do find them i would say they

2858
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:27,040
if we do find them i would say they
 

2859
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:29,190
if we do find them i would say they
they would be carbon based uh how

2860
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:29,200
they would be carbon based uh how
 

2861
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,150
they would be carbon based uh how
similar

2862
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,160
similar
 

2863
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,990
similar
it's a big question right so it's it's

2864
00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:34,000
it's a big question right so it's it's
 

2865
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,990
it's a big question right so it's it's
the moment we discover things

2866
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:38,000
the moment we discover things
 

2867
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,630
the moment we discover things
outside earth right even if it's a tiny

2868
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
outside earth right even if it's a tiny
 

2869
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:41,270
outside earth right even if it's a tiny
little

2870
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,280
little
 

2871
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,190
little
single cell i mean there's so much

2872
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:45,200
single cell i mean there's so much
 

2873
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,829
single cell i mean there's so much
just imagine that that would be so i i

2874
00:53:47,829 --> 00:53:47,839
just imagine that that would be so i i
 

2875
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,190
just imagine that that would be so i i
think that that would be

2876
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:49,200
think that that would be
 

2877
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,870
think that that would be
another turning point for for the

2878
00:53:50,870 --> 00:53:50,880
another turning point for for the
 

2879
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,950
another turning point for for the
science you know and if especially if

2880
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:52,960
science you know and if especially if
 

2881
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,430
science you know and if especially if
it's

2882
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:53,440
it's
 

2883
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,390
it's
different in some very new way that's

2884
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:56,400
different in some very new way that's
 

2885
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,150
different in some very new way that's
exciting because that says

2886
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:58,160
exciting because that says
 

2887
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,829
exciting because that says
that's a definitive state not a

2888
00:53:59,829 --> 00:53:59,839
that's a definitive state not a
 

2889
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,589
that's a definitive state not a
definitive but a pretty strong statement

2890
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:01,599
definitive but a pretty strong statement
 

2891
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:04,069
definitive but a pretty strong statement
that life is everywhere in the in the

2892
00:54:04,069 --> 00:54:04,079
that life is everywhere in the in the
 

2893
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,309
that life is everywhere in the in the
in the universe to me at least that's

2894
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:06,319
in the universe to me at least that's
 

2895
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:08,790
in the universe to me at least that's
that's really exciting

2896
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:08,800
that's really exciting
 

2897
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,829
that's really exciting
you brought up joshua letterberg in an

2898
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:11,839
you brought up joshua letterberg in an
 

2899
00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:13,349
you brought up joshua letterberg in an
offline conversation

interesting way to
 

2907
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,630
interesting way to
enter that conversation because uh so he

2908
00:54:20,630 --> 00:54:20,640
enter that conversation because uh so he
 

2909
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,270
enter that conversation because uh so he
won the

2910

but uh he also did a ton of other stuff

2918
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:32,160
but uh he also did a ton of other stuff
 

2919
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,390
but uh he also did a ton of other stuff
like uh like we mentioned helping nasa

uh do you uh what do you find

2930
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:49,040
uh do you uh what do you find
 

2931

uh do you uh what do you find
interesting

2932
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:50,160
interesting
 

2933
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,950
interesting
about this guy and his his ideas about

2934
00:54:52,950 --> 00:54:52,960
about this guy and his his ideas about
 

2935
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,789
about this guy and his his ideas about
artificial intelligence in general

2936
00:54:54,789 --> 00:54:54,799
artificial intelligence in general
 

2937
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,829
artificial intelligence in general
so i have a kind of personal story

2938
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:57,839
so i have a kind of personal story
 

2939
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:01,270
so i have a kind of personal story
to um to share so i

2940
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:01,280
to um to share so i

started my phd in canada back in 2000

2942
00:55:05,030 --> 00:55:05,040
started my phd in canada back in 2000
 

2943
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,910
started my phd in canada back in 2000
and so essentially my pg was uh so we

2944
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
and so essentially my pg was uh so we
 

2945
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:08,230
and so essentially my pg was uh so we
were

2946
00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:08,240
were
 

2947
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,230
were
developing sort of a new language for

2948
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:10,240
developing sort of a new language for
 

2949
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,470
developing sort of a new language for
symbolic uh machine learning

2950
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:12,480
symbolic uh machine learning
 

2951
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,390
symbolic uh machine learning
so it's different from the feature based

2952
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:14,400
so it's different from the feature based
 

2953
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,910
so it's different from the feature based
machine learning and and the

machine learning and and the
 

2955
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,950
machine learning and and the
uh one of the sort of cleanest

2956
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:18,960
uh one of the sort of cleanest
 

2957
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,230
uh one of the sort of cleanest
applications of this

2958
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:20,240
applications of this
 

2959
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,870
applications of this
uh you know of this approach of this

2960
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:22,880
uh you know of this approach of this
 

2961
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,910
uh you know of this approach of this

00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,710
formalism
was uh two uh chem informatics and

2964
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:26,720
was uh two uh chem informatics and
 

2965
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:28,390
was uh two uh chem informatics and
computer aided drug design

2966
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
computer aided drug design
 

2967
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,630
computer aided drug design
right so so so essentially we were uh

2968
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:30,640
right so so so essentially we were uh
 

2969
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,710
right so so so essentially we were uh
you know as a part of my research

2970
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:32,720
you know as a part of my research
 

2971
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,230
you know as a part of my research
uh i developed a system that

2972
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:36,240
uh i developed a system that
 

2973
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,990
uh i developed a system that
essentially looked at chemical compounds

2974
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:40,000
essentially looked at chemical compounds
 

2975
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,030
essentially looked at chemical compounds
of say the same therapeutic category

2976
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:43,040
of say the same therapeutic category
 

2977
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,309
of say the same therapeutic category
you know male hormones right

2978
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:46,319
you know male hormones right
 

2979
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:49,670
you know male hormones right
and tried to figure out

2980
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:49,680
and tried to figure out
 

2981
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,109
and tried to figure out
the structural fragments that are the

2982
00:55:53,109 --> 00:55:53,119
the structural fragments that are the
 

2983
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,030
the structural fragments that are the
structural building blocks

2984
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:55,040
structural building blocks
 

2985
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:57,829
structural building blocks
that are important that define this

2986
00:55:57,829 --> 00:55:57,839
that are important that define this

2989
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,630

versus structural building blocks that

2990
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:00,640
versus structural building blocks that
 

2991
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,390
versus structural building blocks that
are there just because

2992
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:02,400
are there just because
 

2993
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,870
are there just because
you know the to complete the structure

2994
00:56:04,870 --> 00:56:04,880
you know the to complete the structure
 

2995
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,630
you know the to complete the structure
but they are not essentially the ones

2996
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
but they are not essentially the ones
 

2997
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,069
but they are not essentially the ones
that make up the

2998
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
that make up the
 

2999
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,829
that make up the
the chemical the the key chemical

3000
00:56:09,829 --> 00:56:09,839

you know uh for me it was something new

3006
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:17,440
you know uh for me it was something new
 

3007
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,349

you know as with some a machine learning

3012
00:56:23,030 --> 00:56:23,040
you know as with some a machine learning
 

3013
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,789
you know as with some a machine learning
background but you know computer

00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:27,040
drug design was completely a completely
 

3017
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,309
drug design was completely a completely
new territory

3018

new territory
 

3019
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,510
new territory
so because of that i often uh find

3020
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:31,520
so because of that i often uh find
 

3021
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,069
so because of that i often uh find
myself

you know it's a forum it's essentially
 

3035
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:46,230
you know it's a forum it's essentially
it's like a bulletin board

yeah right yeah so you essentially you
 

3039
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,589
yeah right yeah so you essentially you
have a bunch of people and you post a

3040
00:56:51,589 --> 00:56:51,599
have a bunch of people and you post a
 

3041
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:52,309
have a bunch of people and you post a
question

question
 

3043
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,549
question
and you get you know an answer from you

3044
00:56:54,549 --> 00:56:54,559
and you get you know an answer from you
 

3045
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:55,910
and you get you know an answer from you
know different people

3046
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:55,920
know different people
 

3047
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,230

in the middle of the night
 

3099
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,630
in the middle of the night
and you know i went back uh you know to

and and next morning have a
 

3105
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,829
and and next morning have a
phone call from my advisor who also

phone call from my advisor who also
 

3107
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:07,589
phone call from my advisor who also
looked at this forum it's like

3108
00:58:07,589 --> 00:58:07,599
looked at this forum it's like
 

3109
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,950
looked at this forum it's like
you won't believe who replied to you

3110
00:58:10,950 --> 00:58:10,960
you won't believe who replied to you
 

3111
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:14,710
you won't believe who replied to you
and and it's like who he said well you

3112
00:58:14,710 --> 00:58:14,720
and and it's like who he said well you

lederberg
 

3119
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,750
lederberg
and my reaction was like who is joshua

3120
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:21,760
and my reaction was like who is joshua
 

3121
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,630
and my reaction was like who is joshua
later back

3122
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:24,640

 

3123
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,990

your eyes are hung up so

3124

that
 

3129
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:34,230
that
we we had conceptually similar ideas in

3130
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:34,240
we we had conceptually similar ideas in
 

3131
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,829
we we had conceptually similar ideas in
in the dandruff

3132
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:35,839
in the dandruff
 

3133
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:38,050
in the dandruff
project you may want to look it up

3134

00:58:41,589 --> 00:58:41,599
and you know we should also sorry and
 

3139
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,190
and you know we should also sorry and
it's a side comment say that

3140
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:43,200
it's a side comment say that
 

3141
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,910
it's a side comment say that
even though he he won the nobel prize at

3142
00:58:45,910 --> 00:58:45,920
even though he he won the nobel prize at
 

3143
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,109
even though he he won the nobel prize at
a really young age

3144
00:58:47,109 --> 00:58:47,119
a really young age
 

3145
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,390
a really young age
in 58 but so he he was i think

3146
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:50,400
in 58 but so he he was i think
 

3147
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,829
in 58 but so he he was i think
he was what 33 yeah it's just crazy yeah

3148
00:58:53,829 --> 00:58:53,839
he was what 33 yeah it's just crazy yeah
 

3149
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:56,230
he was what 33 yeah it's just crazy yeah
so anyway so that's so hence hence in

person
and i met him very briefly right the you

3194
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:41,040
and i met him very briefly right the you
 

3195
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,069
and i met him very briefly right the you
know

know
 

3197
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,270
know
just because he was walking you know

3198
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:45,280
just because he was walking you know
 

3199
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,430
just because he was walking you know
there's a little breach that connects

3200
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:47,440
there's a little breach that connects
 

3201
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:48,549
there's a little breach that connects
the sort of the

3202
00:59:48,549 --> 00:59:48,559
the sort of the
 

3203
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,910
the sort of the
research campus with the um

3204
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:51,920
research campus with the um
 

3205
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,309
research campus with the um
with the uh sort of sky scrapper that

3206
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:54,319
with the uh sort of sky scrapper that
 

3207
00:59:54,319 --> 00:59:55,030
with the uh sort of sky scrapper that
rockefeller

3208
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:55,040
rockefeller
 

3209
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:58,069
rockefeller
owns the where you know uh post docs and

3210
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
owns the where you know uh post docs and
 

3211
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,030
owns the where you know uh post docs and
faculty and

3212
00:59:59,030 --> 00:59:59,040
faculty and
 

3213
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,349
faculty and
graduate students live and so so i met

3214
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:01,359
graduate students live and so so i met
 

3215
01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:03,750
graduate students live and so so i met
him you know and i had a

3216
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:03,760
him you know and i had a
 

3217
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:07,270
him you know and i had a
very short conversation you know but uh

3218
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,280
very short conversation you know but uh
 

3219
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,430
very short conversation you know but uh
so i i started you know reading about

3220
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:09,440
so i i started you know reading about
 

3221
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:10,309
so i i started you know reading about
dandrull

3222
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:10,319
dandrull
 

3223
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:12,710
dandrull
and i was amazed you know it's we're

3224
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
and i was amazed you know it's we're
 

3225
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,390
and i was amazed you know it's we're
talking about 1960

3226
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
talking about 1960
 

3227
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,430
talking about 1960
yeah right the ideas

3228
01:00:17,430 --> 01:00:17,440
yeah right the ideas
 

3229
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,670
yeah right the ideas
were so profound well what's the

3230
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:19,680
were so profound well what's the
 

3231
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,109
were so profound well what's the
fundamental ideas of it

3232
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:21,119
fundamental ideas of it
 

3233
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,910
fundamental ideas of it
the the reason to make this is even

3234
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:23,920
the the reason to make this is even
 

3235
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:24,950
the the reason to make this is even
crazier

3236
01:00:24,950 --> 01:00:24,960
crazier
 

3237
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:28,390
crazier
so so so leatherberg wanted to make a

3238
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:28,400
so so so leatherberg wanted to make a
 

3239
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,829
so so so leatherberg wanted to make a
system

3240
01:00:29,829 --> 01:00:29,839
system
 

3241
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,430
system
that would help him study

3242
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:33,440
that would help him study
 

3243
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,630
that would help him study
the extraterrestrial

3244
01:00:36,630 --> 01:00:36,640
the extraterrestrial
 

3245
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:40,470
the extraterrestrial
molecules right so so the idea was that

3246
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:40,480
molecules right so so the idea was that
 

3247
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,069
molecules right so so the idea was that
you know the way you study the

3248
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:42,079
you know the way you study the
 

3249
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,069
you know the way you study the
extraterrestrial molecules is you do the

3250
01:00:44,069 --> 01:00:44,079
extraterrestrial molecules is you do the
 

3251
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:44,870
extraterrestrial molecules is you do the
mass spec

3252
01:00:44,870 --> 01:00:44,880
mass spec
 

3253
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,069
mass spec
analysis right and so the mass spec

3254
01:00:48,069 --> 01:00:48,079
analysis right and so the mass spec
 

3255
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,230
analysis right and so the mass spec
gives you sort of bits numbers about

3256
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:50,240
gives you sort of bits numbers about
 

3257
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,589
gives you sort of bits numbers about
essentially uh

3258
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
essentially uh
 

3259
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,589
essentially uh
gives you the ideas about the possible

3260
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:53,599
gives you the ideas about the possible
 

3261
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:54,710
gives you the ideas about the possible
fragments

3262
01:00:54,710 --> 01:00:54,720
fragments
 

3263
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,069
fragments
or you know atoms and you know and and

3264
01:00:58,069 --> 01:00:58,079
or you know atoms and you know and and
 

3265
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:00,390
or you know atoms and you know and and
and maybe little fragments pieces of

3266
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:00,400
and maybe little fragments pieces of
 

3267
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:01,430
and maybe little fragments pieces of
this molecule

3268
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:01,440
this molecule
 

3269
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,910
this molecule
that make up the molecule right so now

3270
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:03,920
that make up the molecule right so now
 

3271
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,190
that make up the molecule right so now
you need to

3272
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:05,200
you need to
 

3273
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,109
you need to
sort of to decompose this information

3274
01:01:09,109 --> 01:01:09,119
sort of to decompose this information
 

3275
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,390
sort of to decompose this information
and to figure out what was the whole

3276
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:12,400
and to figure out what was the whole
 

3277
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:15,430
and to figure out what was the whole
before you know it beca became uh

3278
01:01:15,430 --> 01:01:15,440
before you know it beca became uh
 

3279
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,470
before you know it beca became uh
fragments bits and pieces right so so

3280
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:18,480
fragments bits and pieces right so so
 

3281
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,870
fragments bits and pieces right so so
in order to make this uh you know to

3282
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:20,880
in order to make this uh you know to
 

3283
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,910
in order to make this uh you know to
have this

3284
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:21,920
have this
 

3285
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,230
have this
tool the idea of leather work was to

3286
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:26,240
tool the idea of leather work was to
 

3287
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,589
tool the idea of leather work was to
connect

project ended up being
 

3315
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:05,190
project ended up being
was that you know it would provide a

3316
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:05,200
was that you know it would provide a
 

3317
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:06,950
was that you know it would provide a
list of candidates

3318
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:06,960
list of candidates
 

3319
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,910
list of candidates
that then a chemist would look at and

3320
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:09,920
that then a chemist would look at and
 

3321
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:10,549
that then a chemist would look at and
and and

3322
01:02:10,549 --> 01:02:10,559
and and
 

3323
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:13,109
and and
make final decision so but the original

3324
01:02:13,109 --> 01:02:13,119
make final decision so but the original
 

3325
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:14,950
make final decision so but the original
idea is supposed to solve the entirety

automatically yes so so so he uh you

3330
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:19,200
automatically yes so so so he uh you
 

3331
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:20,390
automatically yes so so so he uh you
know so uh

3332
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:20,400
know so uh
 

3333
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:23,910
know so uh
so he uh back then uh he

3334
01:02:23,910 --> 01:02:23,920
so he uh back then uh he
 

3335
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,190
so he uh back then uh he
succeeded yes believe that

3336
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:27,200
succeeded yes believe that
 

3337
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,670
succeeded yes believe that
yeah it's it's amazing i mean it still

3338
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:29,680
yeah it's it's amazing i mean it still
 

3339
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,750
yeah it's it's amazing i mean it still
blows my mind you know that

3340
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:31,760
blows my mind you know that
 

3341
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,829
blows my mind you know that
it's that's is and this was essentially

3342
01:02:35,829 --> 01:02:35,839
it's that's is and this was essentially
 

3343
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:36,549
it's that's is and this was essentially

the the
 

3345
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,750
the the

you know back in the 60s yeah right so

3350
01:02:42,789 --> 01:02:42,799
you know back in the 60s yeah right so
 

3351
01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:44,390
you know back in the 60s yeah right so
that's that's you know

that's that's you know
 

3353
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,029
that's that's you know
you know so every time you you you deal

you just you know uh so the the power

3362
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:54,240
you just you know uh so the the power
 

3363
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,870
you just you know uh so the the power
of of the of the you know intelligence

3364
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:56,880
of of the of the you know intelligence
 

3365
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:57,510
of of the of the you know intelligence
of this

3366
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:57,520
of this
 

3367
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,630
of this
people uh is is just you know

3368
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:00,640
people uh is is just you know
 

3369
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:02,870
people uh is is just you know
overwhelming do you think about expert

3370
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:02,880
overwhelming do you think about expert
 

3371
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,069
overwhelming do you think about expert
systems

3372
01:03:04,069 --> 01:03:04,079
systems
 

3373
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,870
systems
is there um and why they kind of didn't

3374
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:08,880
is there um and why they kind of didn't
 

3375
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,870
is there um and why they kind of didn't
become successful especially in the

3376
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:10,880
become successful especially in the
 

3377
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,390
become successful especially in the
space of bioinformatics

3378
01:03:12,390 --> 01:03:12,400
space of bioinformatics
 

3379
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,630
space of bioinformatics
where it does seem like there's a lot of

3380
01:03:14,630 --> 01:03:14,640
where it does seem like there's a lot of
 

3381
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:16,870
where it does seem like there's a lot of
expertise in humans

3382
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:16,880
expertise in humans
 

3383
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:19,750
expertise in humans
and uh you know it's it's possible to

3384
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:19,760
and uh you know it's it's possible to
 

3385
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:20,309
and uh you know it's it's possible to
see that

3386
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:20,319
see that
 

3387
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,390
see that
a system like this could be made very

3388
01:03:22,390 --> 01:03:22,400
a system like this could be made very
 

3389
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:23,430
a system like this could be made very
useful

3390
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
useful
 

3391
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,829
useful
right so it's it's actually it's a it's

3392
01:03:25,829 --> 01:03:25,839
right so it's it's actually it's a it's
 

3393
01:03:25,839 --> 01:03:27,510
right so it's it's actually it's a it's
a great question and and this is

3394
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:27,520
a great question and and this is
 

3395
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:28,870
a great question and and this is
something so you know so

3396
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:28,880
something so you know so
 

3397
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,150
something so you know so
uh you know at my university i teach

3398
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160
uh you know at my university i teach
 

3399
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:35,430
uh you know at my university i teach
artificial intelligence and you know we

3400
01:03:35,430 --> 01:03:35,440
artificial intelligence and you know we
 

3401
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,470
artificial intelligence and you know we
start the my first two lectures are on

3402
01:03:38,470 --> 01:03:38,480
start the my first two lectures are on
 

3403
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:40,069
start the my first two lectures are on
the history of ai

3404
01:03:40,069 --> 01:03:40,079
the history of ai
 

3405
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,589
the history of ai
and and there we you know we tried to

3406
01:03:43,589 --> 01:03:43,599
and and there we you know we tried to
 

3407
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,270
and and there we you know we tried to
you know go through the main stages of

3408
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
you know go through the main stages of
 

3409
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,630
you know go through the main stages of
ei and so you know the question of why

3410
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:50,640
ei and so you know the question of why
 

3411
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,150
ei and so you know the question of why
expert systems failed

3412
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:54,160
expert systems failed
 

3413
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:57,670
expert systems failed
or became obsolete it's actually a very

3414
01:03:57,670 --> 01:03:57,680
or became obsolete it's actually a very
 

3415
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:58,150
or became obsolete it's actually a very
interesting

3416
01:03:58,150 --> 01:03:58,160
interesting
 

3417
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,470
interesting
one and there are you know if you uh try

3418
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:00,480
one and there are you know if you uh try
 

3419
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,510
one and there are you know if you uh try
to read the

3420
01:04:01,510 --> 01:04:01,520
to read the
 

3421
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,190
to read the
you know the historical perspectives

3422
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:03,200
you know the historical perspectives
 

3423
01:04:03,200 --> 01:04:05,510
you know the historical perspectives
there are actually two lines of thoughts

3424
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:05,520
there are actually two lines of thoughts
 

3425
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,710
there are actually two lines of thoughts
one is that the they were

3426
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:08,720
one is that the they were
 

3427
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,309
one is that the they were
uh essentially not

3428
01:04:12,309 --> 01:04:12,319
uh essentially not
 

3429
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,069
uh essentially not
up to the expectations and so therefore

3430
01:04:16,069 --> 01:04:16,079
up to the expectations and so therefore
 

3431
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,710
up to the expectations and so therefore
they were replaced you know uh by by

3432
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:18,720
they were replaced you know uh by by
 

3433
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:19,510
they were replaced you know uh by by
other

3434
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:19,520
other
 

3435
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,630
other
things right the other one

3436
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:22,640
things right the other one
 

3437
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,430
things right the other one
was that uh completely opposite one that

3438
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
was that uh completely opposite one that
 

3439
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,549
was that uh completely opposite one that
they were

3440
01:04:26,549 --> 01:04:26,559
they were
 

3441
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,829
they were
too good and and as a result

3442
01:04:29,829 --> 01:04:29,839
too good and and as a result
 

3443
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:32,150
too good and and as a result
they essentially became sort of a

3444
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:32,160
they essentially became sort of a
 

3445
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,589
they essentially became sort of a
household name and

3446
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:33,599
household name and
 

3447
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:36,150
household name and
then essentially they they got

3448
01:04:36,150 --> 01:04:36,160
then essentially they they got
 

3449
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:36,950
then essentially they they got
transformed

3450
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:36,960
transformed
 

3451
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:39,430
transformed
i mean the in both cases sort of the

3452
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:39,440
i mean the in both cases sort of the
 

3453
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,750
i mean the in both cases sort of the
outcome was the same they evolved into

3454
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
outcome was the same they evolved into
 

3455
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:42,390
outcome was the same they evolved into
something

3456
01:04:42,390 --> 01:04:42,400
something
 

3457
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,390
something
yeah right and that's what i you know if

3458
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:46,400
yeah right and that's what i you know if
 

3459
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,470
yeah right and that's what i you know if
if i look at this right so the modern

3460
01:04:48,470 --> 01:04:48,480
if i look at this right so the modern
 

3461
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:49,829
if i look at this right so the modern
machine learning

3462
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
machine learning
 

3463
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:52,470
machine learning
right so those echoes in in the modern

3464
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:52,480
right so those echoes in in the modern
 

3465
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,990
right so those echoes in in the modern
machine learning i think so

3466
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:54,000
machine learning i think so
 

3467
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,990
machine learning i think so
i think so because you know if if you

3468
01:04:55,990 --> 01:04:56,000
i think so because you know if if you
 

3469
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,589
i think so because you know if if you
think about this you know and how we

3470
01:04:57,589 --> 01:04:57,599
think about this you know and how we
 

3471

of the first one
 

3539
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,789
of the first one
was the discipline in predicting the

01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
was the discipline in predicting the
 

3541
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,150
was the discipline in predicting the
protein structure

3542
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:10,160

so so the original one was uh casp

3560
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:28,000
so so the original one was uh casp
 

3561
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,470
so so the original one was uh casp
or a critical assessment of uh of

during these competitions
 

3571
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:44,829
during these competitions
is uh you know scientists experimental

3579
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,069
them
into the protein data bank which is the

3580
01:06:52,069 --> 01:06:52,079
into the protein data bank which is the
 

3581
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:52,870

instead they hold it and release

3588
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:00,559
instead they hold it and release
 

3589
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,750
instead they hold it and release
protein sequences and now the challenge

3590
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:03,760
protein sequences and now the challenge
 

3591
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:07,190
protein sequences and now the challenge
of the community is to predict

3592
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:07,200
of the community is to predict
 

3593
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,309
of the community is to predict
the 3d structures of these proteins and

3594
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:10,319
the 3d structures of these proteins and
 

3595
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,029
the 3d structures of these proteins and
then

3596
01:07:11,029 --> 01:07:11,039
then
 

3597
01:07:11,039 --> 01:07:12,789
then
use the experimental resolve structures

3598
01:07:12,789 --> 01:07:12,799
use the experimental resolve structures
 

3599
01:07:12,799 --> 01:07:14,630
use the experimental resolve structures
to assess which one

3600
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:14,640
to assess which one
 

3601
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,789
to assess which one
is the closest one right and this

3602
01:07:16,789 --> 01:07:16,799
is the closest one right and this
 

3603
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,549
is the closest one right and this
competition by the way just a bunch of

3604
01:07:18,549 --> 01:07:18,559
competition by the way just a bunch of
 

3605
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:19,990
competition by the way just a bunch of
different tangents and maybe you can

3606
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:20,000
different tangents and maybe you can
 

3607
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,309
different tangents and maybe you can
also say what is protein folding

3608
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:22,319
also say what is protein folding
 

3609
01:07:22,319 --> 01:07:24,950
also say what is protein folding
uh and this competition casp competition

3610
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:24,960
uh and this competition casp competition
 

3611
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:25,910
uh and this competition casp competition
is

3612
01:07:25,910 --> 01:07:25,920
is
 

3613
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:27,670
is
has become the gold standard and that's

3614
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:27,680
has become the gold standard and that's
 

3615
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:30,470
has become the gold standard and that's
what was used to say that protein

3616
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:30,480
what was used to say that protein
 

3617
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,029
what was used to say that protein
folding was solved so i used to add a

3618
01:07:33,029 --> 01:07:33,039
folding was solved so i used to add a
 

3619
01:07:33,039 --> 01:07:33,589
folding was solved so i used to add a
little

3620
01:07:33,589 --> 01:07:33,599
little
 

3621
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:36,309
little
um yeah just a bunch so if you could

3622
01:07:36,309 --> 01:07:36,319
um yeah just a bunch so if you could
 

3623
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,510
um yeah just a bunch so if you could
whenever you say stuff

3624
01:07:37,510 --> 01:07:37,520
whenever you say stuff
 

3625
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:39,430
whenever you say stuff
maybe throw in some of the basics for

3626
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:39,440
maybe throw in some of the basics for
 

3627
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:40,870
maybe throw in some of the basics for
the folks that might be outside of the

3628
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
the folks that might be outside of the
 

3629
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:41,430
the folks that might be outside of the
field

3630
01:07:41,430 --> 01:07:41,440
field
 

3631
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:43,670
field
anyway sorry so so yeah so you know so

3632
01:07:43,670 --> 01:07:43,680
anyway sorry so so yeah so you know so
 

3633
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:44,870
anyway sorry so so yeah so you know so
the reason it's it's

3634
01:07:44,870 --> 01:07:44,880
the reason it's it's
 

3635
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,990
the reason it's it's
um you know it's relevant to

3636
01:07:47,990 --> 01:07:48,000
um you know it's relevant to
 

3637
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,390
um you know it's relevant to
our understanding of protein folding is

3638
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:50,400
our understanding of protein folding is
 

3639
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,109
our understanding of protein folding is
because

3640
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:51,119
because
 

3641
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:54,150
because
you know we we we've yet to learn

3642
01:07:54,150 --> 01:07:54,160
you know we we we've yet to learn
 

3643
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,349
you know we we we've yet to learn
how the folding mechanistically works

3644
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:57,359
how the folding mechanistically works
 

3645
01:07:57,359 --> 01:08:01,510
how the folding mechanistically works
right so there are different hypotheses

3646
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:01,520
right so there are different hypotheses
 

3647
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,750
right so there are different hypotheses
what happens to this fault for example

3648
01:08:03,750 --> 01:08:03,760
what happens to this fault for example
 

3649
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:06,390
what happens to this fault for example
uh there is a hypothesis that

3650
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
uh there is a hypothesis that
 

3651
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,990
uh there is a hypothesis that
the folding happens by you know in also

3652
01:08:09,990 --> 01:08:10,000
the folding happens by you know in also
 

3653
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,589
the folding happens by you know in also
in the modular fashion right so that

3654
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:13,599
in the modular fashion right so that
 

3655
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,309
in the modular fashion right so that
you know we have protein domains that

3656
01:08:16,309 --> 01:08:16,319
you know we have protein domains that
 

3657
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:17,110
you know we have protein domains that
get folded

3658
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:17,120
get folded
 

3659
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:19,110
get folded
independently because their structure is

3660
01:08:19,110 --> 01:08:19,120
independently because their structure is
 

3661
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:20,630
independently because their structure is
stable and then

3662
01:08:20,630 --> 01:08:20,640
stable and then
 

3663
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:23,269
stable and then
the whole protein structure gets formed

3664
01:08:23,269 --> 01:08:23,279
the whole protein structure gets formed
 

3665
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:24,229
the whole protein structure gets formed
but you know

3666
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,239
but you know
 

3667
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:26,070
but you know
within those domains we also have uh

3668
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:26,080
within those domains we also have uh
 

3669
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,910
within those domains we also have uh
so-called secondary structure the small

3670
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:27,920
so-called secondary structure the small
 

3671
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,390
so-called secondary structure the small
alpha helices beta sheets so these are

3672
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:30,400
alpha helices beta sheets so these are
 

3673
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:31,189
alpha helices beta sheets so these are
you know uh

3674
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:31,199
you know uh
 

3675
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:34,229
you know uh
uh elements that are structurally stable

3676
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
uh elements that are structurally stable
 

3677
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,669
uh elements that are structurally stable
and so and the the question is you know

3678
01:08:37,669 --> 01:08:37,679
and so and the the question is you know
 

3679
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,229
and so and the the question is you know
when they when do they get formed

3680
01:08:40,229 --> 01:08:40,239
when they when do they get formed
 

3681
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:41,829
when they when do they get formed
because some of the secondary structure

3682
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:41,839
because some of the secondary structure
 

3683
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:42,390
because some of the secondary structure
elements

3684
01:08:42,390 --> 01:08:42,400
elements
 

3685
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:45,590
elements
you have to have uh you know a fragment

3686
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:45,600
you have to have uh you know a fragment
 

3687
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,510
you have to have uh you know a fragment
in the beginning and say they're

3688
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
in the beginning and say they're
 

3689
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,030
in the beginning and say they're
fragment in the middle

3690
01:08:49,030 --> 01:08:49,040
fragment in the middle
 

3691
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:52,789
fragment in the middle
right so so you cannot potentially start

3692
01:08:52,789 --> 01:08:52,799
right so so you cannot potentially start
 

3693
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:55,030
right so so you cannot potentially start
having a the the full fault from the

3694
01:08:55,030 --> 01:08:55,040
having a the the full fault from the
 

3695
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,070
having a the the full fault from the
get-go

3696
01:08:56,070 --> 01:08:56,080
get-go
 

3697
01:08:56,080 --> 01:08:58,950
get-go
right uh so so it's still you know it's

3698
01:08:58,950 --> 01:08:58,960
right uh so so it's still you know it's
 

3699
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:00,229
right uh so so it's still you know it's
still a big enigma

3700
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:00,239
still a big enigma
 

3701
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:02,709
still a big enigma
what what happens we know that it it's

3702
01:09:02,709 --> 01:09:02,719
what what happens we know that it it's
 

3703
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:03,510
what what happens we know that it it's
an extremely

3704
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:03,520
an extremely
 

3705
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,070
an extremely
efficient and stable process right so

3706
01:09:06,070 --> 01:09:06,080
efficient and stable process right so
 

3707
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:07,510
efficient and stable process right so
there's this long sequence

3708
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:07,520
there's this long sequence
 

3709
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:09,430
there's this long sequence
and the fold happens really quickly

3710
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:09,440
and the fold happens really quickly
 

3711
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:11,189
and the fold happens really quickly
exactly well that's really weird right

3712
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:11,199
exactly well that's really weird right
 

3713
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,229
exactly well that's really weird right
and it happens like the same way almost

3714
01:09:14,229 --> 01:09:14,239
and it happens like the same way almost
 

3715
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:16,870
and it happens like the same way almost
every time exactly exactly right really

3716
01:09:16,870 --> 01:09:16,880
every time exactly exactly right really
 

3717
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:17,430
every time exactly exactly right really
weird

3718
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:17,440
weird
 

3719
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,910
weird
so that's freaking weird it's it's yeah

3720
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:19,920
so that's freaking weird it's it's yeah
 

3721
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,590
so that's freaking weird it's it's yeah
that's that's why it's it is it's such a

3722
01:09:21,590 --> 01:09:21,600
that's that's why it's it is it's such a
 

3723
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:22,789
that's that's why it's it is it's such a
mega it's amazing

3724
01:09:22,789 --> 01:09:22,799
mega it's amazing
 

3725
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,709
mega it's amazing
but most importantly right so it's you

3726
01:09:24,709 --> 01:09:24,719
but most importantly right so it's you
 

3727
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,309
but most importantly right so it's you
know so when when you see the

3728
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
know so when when you see the
 

3729
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:28,950
know so when when you see the
the the you know the translation process

3730
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:28,960
the the you know the translation process
 

3731
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:29,590
the the you know the translation process
right so

3732
01:09:29,590 --> 01:09:29,600
right so
 

3733
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,789
right so
when you don't have the the the whole

3734
01:09:32,789 --> 01:09:32,799
when you don't have the the the whole
 

3735
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,990
when you don't have the the the whole
uh protein translated

3736
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:36,000
uh protein translated
 

3737
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,829
uh protein translated
right it's still being translated you

3738
01:09:37,829 --> 01:09:37,839
right it's still being translated you
 

3739
01:09:37,839 --> 01:09:39,030
right it's still being translated you
know uh

3740
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
know uh
 

3741
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:41,749
know uh
getting out from the ribosome you you

3742
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:41,759
getting out from the ribosome you you
 

3743
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,470
getting out from the ribosome you you
already see some structural

3744
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:44,480
already see some structural
 

3745
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,990
already see some structural
you know fragmentation so so folding

3746
01:09:47,990 --> 01:09:48,000
you know fragmentation so so folding
 

3747
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,229
you know fragmentation so so folding
starts happening before the whole

3748
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:50,239
starts happening before the whole
 

3749
01:09:50,239 --> 01:09:52,229
starts happening before the whole
protein gets produced

3750
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:52,239
protein gets produced
 

3751
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:54,630
protein gets produced
right and so this is this is obviously

3752
01:09:54,630 --> 01:09:54,640
right and so this is this is obviously
 

3753
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,070
right and so this is this is obviously
you know one of the

3754
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:56,080
you know one of the
 

3755
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,590
you know one of the
biggest questions in you know in modern

3756
01:09:59,590 --> 01:09:59,600
biggest questions in you know in modern
 

3757
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,870
biggest questions in you know in modern
molecular biology

3758
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:00,880
molecular biology
 

3759
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,229
molecular biology
not not like maybe what happens like

3760
01:10:04,229 --> 01:10:04,239
not not like maybe what happens like
 

3761
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:05,270
not not like maybe what happens like
that's not

3762
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:05,280
that's not
 

3763
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,630
that's not
that's bigger than the question of

3764
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:06,640
that's bigger than the question of
 

3765
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:09,590
that's bigger than the question of
folding that's the question of like

3766
01:10:09,590 --> 01:10:09,600
folding that's the question of like
 

3767
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,310
folding that's the question of like
like deeper fundamental idea of folding

3768
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:12,320
like deeper fundamental idea of folding
 

3769
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:12,630
like deeper fundamental idea of folding
yes

3770
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:12,640
yes
 

3771
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,270
yes
behind folks exactly exactly so you know

3772
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:15,280
behind folks exactly exactly so you know
 

3773
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,149
behind folks exactly exactly so you know
so obviously

3774
01:10:16,149 --> 01:10:16,159
so obviously
 

3775
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:19,669
so obviously
if we are able to uh

3776
01:10:19,669 --> 01:10:19,679
if we are able to uh
 

3777
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:22,709
if we are able to uh
predict the end product

3778
01:10:22,709 --> 01:10:22,719
predict the end product
 

3779
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,110
predict the end product
of protein folding we are one step

3780
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:25,120
of protein folding we are one step
 

3781
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:25,990
of protein folding we are one step
closer

3782
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:26,000
closer
 

3783
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,910
closer
to understanding sort of the

3784
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:27,920
to understanding sort of the
 

3785
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,149
to understanding sort of the
mechanistics of the protein folding

3786
01:10:30,149 --> 01:10:30,159
mechanistics of the protein folding
 

3787
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:32,950
mechanistics of the protein folding
because we can then potentially look and

3788
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:32,960
because we can then potentially look and
 

3789
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,630
because we can then potentially look and
and start probing

3790
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:34,640
and start probing
 

3791
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,590
and start probing
what are the critical parts of this

3792
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:37,600
what are the critical parts of this
 

3793
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,030
what are the critical parts of this
process and what are

3794
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:39,040
process and what are
 

3795
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,750
process and what are
not so critical parts of this process so

3796
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:41,760
not so critical parts of this process so
 

3797
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,590
not so critical parts of this process so
we can start decomposing

3798
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:43,600
we can start decomposing
 

3799
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,189
we can start decomposing
this you know so so so in the way this

3800
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:47,199
this you know so so so in the way this
 

3801
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,990
this you know so so so in the way this
protein structure prediction algorithm

3802
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:50,000
protein structure prediction algorithm
 

3803
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,430
protein structure prediction algorithm
can be

3804
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:51,440
can be
 

3805
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:54,550
can be
can be used as a tool right so so

3806
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,560
can be used as a tool right so so
 

3807
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:57,030
can be used as a tool right so so
you change the the the you know you

3808
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,040
you change the the the you know you
 

3809
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:57,990
you change the the the you know you
modify the the

3810
01:10:57,990 --> 01:10:58,000
modify the the
 

3811
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,590
modify the the
protein you get back to to this tool

3812
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:01,600
protein you get back to to this tool
 

3813
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,830
protein you get back to to this tool
it predicts okay it's completely it's

3814
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:03,840
it predicts okay it's completely it's
 

3815
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,910
it predicts okay it's completely it's
completely unstable yeah which

3816
01:11:05,910 --> 01:11:05,920
completely unstable yeah which
 

3817
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,990
completely unstable yeah which
uh which aspects of the input will have

3818
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:08,000
uh which aspects of the input will have
 

3819
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,830
uh which aspects of the input will have
a big impact on the output

3820
01:11:09,830 --> 01:11:09,840
a big impact on the output
 

3821
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:12,950
a big impact on the output
exactly exactly so so what happens is

3822
01:11:12,950 --> 01:11:12,960
exactly exactly so so what happens is
 

3823
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:15,030
exactly exactly so so what happens is
you know we typically have some sort of

3824
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:15,040
you know we typically have some sort of
 

3825
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,390
you know we typically have some sort of
incremental

3826
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:16,400
incremental
 

3827
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,149
incremental

this
 

3831
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,830
this
cusp competition you have groups with

3832
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
cusp competition you have groups with
 

3833
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,270
cusp competition you have groups with
incremental advancement

incremental advancement
 

3835
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:28,310

with you know the the data mining
 

3849
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,990
with you know the the data mining
uh and that was uh you know that

3850
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:46,000
uh and that was uh you know that
 

3851
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,510
uh and that was uh you know that
would enable them to obtain uh

3852
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:49,520
would enable them to obtain uh
 

3853
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,550
would enable them to obtain uh
protein structures of those proteins

3854
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
protein structures of those proteins
 

3855
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,070
protein structures of those proteins
that don't have any structurally soft

3856
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:56,080
that don't have any structurally soft
 

3857
01:11:56,080 --> 01:11:57,430
that don't have any structurally soft
relatives

3858
01:11:57,430 --> 01:11:57,440
relatives
 

3859
01:11:57,440 --> 01:12:00,950
relatives
because you know if we have

3860
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
because you know if we have
 

3861
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,750
because you know if we have
another protein say the same protein but

3862
01:12:03,750 --> 01:12:03,760
another protein say the same protein but
 

3863
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:07,510
another protein say the same protein but
coming from a different species

3864
01:12:07,510 --> 01:12:07,520

 

3865
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:10,310

we could potentially derive some ideas

3866
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:10,320
we could potentially derive some ideas
 

3867
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,750
we could potentially derive some ideas
and that's so-called homology or

3868
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:11,760
and that's so-called homology or
 

3869
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,030
and that's so-called homology or
comparative modeling

3870
01:12:13,030 --> 01:12:13,040
comparative modeling
 

3871
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,669
comparative modeling
where we'll derive some ideas from the

3872
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:15,679
where we'll derive some ideas from the
 

3873
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:17,430
where we'll derive some ideas from the
previously known structures

3874
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:17,440
previously known structures
 

3875
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:20,470
previously known structures
and that would help us tremendously in

3876
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:20,480
and that would help us tremendously in
 

3877
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:23,110
and that would help us tremendously in
uh you know in uh reconstructing the 3d

3878
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:23,120
uh you know in uh reconstructing the 3d
 

3879
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:23,910
uh you know in uh reconstructing the 3d
structure

3880
01:12:23,910 --> 01:12:23,920
structure
 

3881
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:26,470
structure
uh overall but what happens when we

3882
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:26,480
uh overall but what happens when we
 

3883
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:28,470
uh overall but what happens when we
don't have these relatives this is when

3884
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:28,480
don't have these relatives this is when
 

3885
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:29,430
don't have these relatives this is when
it becomes

3886
01:12:29,430 --> 01:12:29,440
it becomes
 

3887
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,430
it becomes
really really hard right so that's

3888
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:31,440
really really hard right so that's
 

3889
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,110
really really hard right so that's
so-called de novo

3890
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:33,120
so-called de novo
 

3891
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,310
so-called de novo
uh uh you know uh the nova protein

3892
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:36,320
uh uh you know uh the nova protein
 

3893
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:37,669
uh uh you know uh the nova protein
structure prediction

3894
01:12:37,669 --> 01:12:37,679
structure prediction
 

3895
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:40,870
structure prediction
and in this case those methods were uh

3896
01:12:40,870 --> 01:12:40,880
and in this case those methods were uh
 

3897
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,350
and in this case those methods were uh
traditionally very good but what

3898
01:12:43,350 --> 01:12:43,360
traditionally very good but what
 

3899
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,310
traditionally very good but what
happened in the

3900
01:12:44,310 --> 01:12:44,320
happened in the
 

3901
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:47,669
happened in the
in the last year the original alpha

3902
01:12:47,669 --> 01:12:47,679
in the last year the original alpha
 

3903
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:48,310
in the last year the original alpha
fault

3904
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:48,320
fault
 

3905
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:52,229
fault
came into and over sudden

3906
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:52,239
came into and over sudden
 

3907
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:56,229
came into and over sudden
it's much better than everyone else

3908
01:12:56,229 --> 01:12:56,239
it's much better than everyone else
 

3909
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:59,350
it's much better than everyone else
this is 2018. yeah oh the competition is

3910
01:12:59,350 --> 01:12:59,360
this is 2018. yeah oh the competition is
 

3911
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,189
this is 2018. yeah oh the competition is
only every two years um

3912
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
only every two years um
 

3913
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:04,310
only every two years um
i think and and then so uh

3914
01:13:04,310 --> 01:13:04,320
i think and and then so uh
 

3915
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,189
i think and and then so uh
you know it was sort of kind of of a

3916
01:13:07,189 --> 01:13:07,199
you know it was sort of kind of of a
 

3917
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:08,229
you know it was sort of kind of of a
shock wave to

3918
01:13:08,229 --> 01:13:08,239
shock wave to
 

3919
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:10,070
shock wave to
to to to the bioinformatics community

3920
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:10,080
to to to the bioinformatics community
 

3921
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:11,510
to to to the bioinformatics community
that you know we have

3922
01:13:11,510 --> 01:13:11,520
that you know we have
 

3923
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,149
that you know we have
like a state-of-the-art machine learning

3924
01:13:14,149 --> 01:13:14,159
like a state-of-the-art machine learning
 

3925
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,350
like a state-of-the-art machine learning
system

3926
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:15,360
system
 

3927
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,510
system
that does uh you know structure

3928
01:13:17,510 --> 01:13:17,520
that does uh you know structure
 

3929
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:18,630
that does uh you know structure
prediction and

3930
01:13:18,630 --> 01:13:18,640
prediction and
 

3931
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:21,830
prediction and
and essentially what it does you know so

3932
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
and essentially what it does you know so
 

3933
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,910
and essentially what it does you know so
you know if you look at this it actually

3934
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:23,920
you know if you look at this it actually
 

3935
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,070
you know if you look at this it actually
predicts the context

3936
01:13:26,070 --> 01:13:26,080
predicts the context
 

3937
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:28,550
predicts the context
so you know so so the the process of

3938
01:13:28,550 --> 01:13:28,560
so you know so so the the process of
 

3939
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:29,830
so you know so so the the process of
reconstructing the

3940
01:13:29,830 --> 01:13:29,840
reconstructing the
 

3941
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:32,870
reconstructing the
the 3d structure starts by predicting

3942
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:32,880
the 3d structure starts by predicting
 

3943
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,830
the 3d structure starts by predicting
the

3944
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:33,840
the
 

3945
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,189
the
the context between the different parts

3946
01:13:37,189 --> 01:13:37,199
the context between the different parts
 

3947
01:13:37,199 --> 01:13:37,830
the context between the different parts
of the

3948
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:37,840
of the
 

3949
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,990
of the
protein and the context essentially the

3950
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:40,000
protein and the context essentially the
 

3951
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:41,430
protein and the context essentially the
parts of the proteins that are in a

3952
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:41,440
parts of the proteins that are in a
 

3953
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,110
parts of the proteins that are in a
close proximity to each other

3954
01:13:43,110 --> 01:13:43,120
close proximity to each other
 

3955
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,430
close proximity to each other
right so actually the machine learning

3956
01:13:45,430 --> 01:13:45,440
right so actually the machine learning
 

3957
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:46,950
right so actually the machine learning
part seems to be

3958
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:46,960
part seems to be
 

3959
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,310
part seems to be
estimating you can correct me uh if i'm

3960
01:13:50,310 --> 01:13:50,320
estimating you can correct me uh if i'm
 

3961
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,669
estimating you can correct me uh if i'm
i'm wrong here but it seems to be

3962
01:13:51,669 --> 01:13:51,679
i'm wrong here but it seems to be
 

3963
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:53,430
i'm wrong here but it seems to be
estimating the distance matrix which is

3964
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:53,440
estimating the distance matrix which is
 

3965
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,070
estimating the distance matrix which is
like

3966
01:13:54,070 --> 01:13:54,080
like
 

3967
01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:55,750
like
the distance between the different parts

3968
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:55,760
the distance between the different parts
 

3969
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,990
the distance between the different parts
yeah so we call the contact map

3970
01:13:57,990 --> 01:13:58,000
yeah so we call the contact map
 

3971
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,590
yeah so we call the contact map
contact map right so once you have the

3972
01:13:59,590 --> 01:13:59,600
contact map right so once you have the
 

3973
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:01,910
contact map right so once you have the
contact map the reconstruction

3974
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:01,920
contact map the reconstruction
 

3975
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,149
contact map the reconstruction
is becoming more straightforward yeah

3976
01:14:04,149 --> 01:14:04,159
is becoming more straightforward yeah
 

3977
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,709
is becoming more straightforward yeah
right but so the contact map is the key

3978
01:14:06,709 --> 01:14:06,719
right but so the contact map is the key
 

3979
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,229
right but so the contact map is the key
and so so uh you know so that

3980
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:10,239
and so so uh you know so that
 

3981
01:14:10,239 --> 01:14:13,189
and so so uh you know so that
what happened and uh now we started

3982
01:14:13,189 --> 01:14:13,199
what happened and uh now we started
 

3983
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,030
what happened and uh now we started
seeing in this current

3984
01:14:15,030 --> 01:14:15,040
seeing in this current
 

3985
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,669
seeing in this current
stage right where in the in the most

3986
01:14:17,669 --> 01:14:17,679
stage right where in the in the most
 

3987
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:18,390
stage right where in the in the most
recent one

3988
01:14:18,390 --> 01:14:18,400
recent one
 

3989
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,870
recent one
we started seeing the emergence of these

3990
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:20,880
we started seeing the emergence of these
 

3991
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:21,910
we started seeing the emergence of these
ideas

3992
01:14:21,910 --> 01:14:21,920
ideas
 

3993
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:25,030
ideas
in others people works right

3994
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,040
in others people works right
 

3995
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,110
in others people works right
but yet is you know alpha fault two

3996
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:29,120
but yet is you know alpha fault two
 

3997
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,390
but yet is you know alpha fault two
yeah that again outperforms everyone

3998
01:14:32,390 --> 01:14:32,400
yeah that again outperforms everyone
 

3999
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:33,270
yeah that again outperforms everyone
else

4000
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:33,280
else
 

4001
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:35,669
else
and also by introducing yet another wave

4002
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:35,679
and also by introducing yet another wave
 

4003
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:36,870
and also by introducing yet another wave
of of the

4004
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:36,880
of of the
 

4005
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,550
of of the
of the you know machine learning ideas

4006
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:38,560
of the you know machine learning ideas
 

4007
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,470
of the you know machine learning ideas
yeah uh they don't seem to be also an

4008
01:14:40,470 --> 01:14:40,480
yeah uh they don't seem to be also an
 

4009
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:41,830
yeah uh they don't seem to be also an
incorporation first of all this the

4010
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:41,840
incorporation first of all this the
 

4011
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,430
incorporation first of all this the
paper is not out yet but there's a bunch

4012
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:43,440
paper is not out yet but there's a bunch
 

4013
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,709
paper is not out yet but there's a bunch
of ideas already out

4014
01:14:44,709 --> 01:14:44,719
of ideas already out
 

4015
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:46,550
of ideas already out
there does seem to be an incorporation

4016
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:46,560
there does seem to be an incorporation
 

4017
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:47,910
there does seem to be an incorporation
of this other thing

4018
01:14:47,910 --> 01:14:47,920
of this other thing
 

4019
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:49,110
of this other thing
i don't know if it's something that you

4020
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:49,120
i don't know if it's something that you
 

4021
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:51,669
i don't know if it's something that you
could speak to which is like

4022
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:51,679
could speak to which is like
 

4023
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:56,950
could speak to which is like
the incorporation of like other

4024
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:56,960
the incorporation of like other
 

4025
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:00,630
the incorporation of like other
structures like evolutionary similar

4026
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
structures like evolutionary similar
 

4027
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,709
structures like evolutionary similar
yes structures that are used to kind of

4028
01:15:02,709 --> 01:15:02,719
yes structures that are used to kind of
 

4029
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:03,750
yes structures that are used to kind of
give you hints

4030
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:03,760
give you hints
 

4031
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,189
give you hints
yes so so so the evolutionary similarity

4032
01:15:07,189 --> 01:15:07,199
yes so so so the evolutionary similarity
 

4033
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:09,590
yes so so so the evolutionary similarity
uh is something that we can detect at

4034
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:09,600
uh is something that we can detect at
 

4035
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,590
uh is something that we can detect at
different levels right so

4036
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:11,600
different levels right so
 

4037
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,750
different levels right so
we know for example that this structure

4038
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:15,760
we know for example that this structure
 

4039
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,030
we know for example that this structure
of proteins is more conserved than the

4040
01:15:19,030 --> 01:15:19,040
of proteins is more conserved than the
 

4041
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,390
of proteins is more conserved than the
sequence

4042
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:20,400
sequence
 

4043
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,390
sequence
the sequence could be very different but

4044
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:22,400
the sequence could be very different but
 

4045
01:15:22,400 --> 01:15:23,830
the sequence could be very different but
the structural shape

4046
01:15:23,830 --> 01:15:23,840
the structural shape
 

4047
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:26,310
the structural shape
is actually still very conserved so

4048
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:26,320
is actually still very conserved so
 

4049
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,669
is actually still very conserved so
that's that's sort of the intrinsic

4050
01:15:27,669 --> 01:15:27,679
that's that's sort of the intrinsic
 

4051
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:28,470
that's that's sort of the intrinsic
property that

4052
01:15:28,470 --> 01:15:28,480
property that
 

4053
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,310
property that
you know in a way related to protein

4054
01:15:30,310 --> 01:15:30,320
you know in a way related to protein
 

4055
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,870
you know in a way related to protein
folds you know to the evolution

4056
01:15:32,870 --> 01:15:32,880
folds you know to the evolution
 

4057
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,430
folds you know to the evolution
of the you know of the protein of

4058
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
of the you know of the protein of
 

4059
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,669
of the you know of the protein of
proteins and protein domains etc

4060
01:15:37,669 --> 01:15:37,679
proteins and protein domains etc
 

4061
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:39,750
proteins and protein domains etc
but we know that i mean we they've been

4062
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:39,760
but we know that i mean we they've been
 

4063
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,030
but we know that i mean we they've been
multiple studies

4064
01:15:41,030 --> 01:15:41,040
multiple studies
 

4065
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:43,990
multiple studies
and uh you know ideally if you have

4066
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:44,000
and uh you know ideally if you have
 

4067
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:45,189
and uh you know ideally if you have
structures

4068
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:45,199
structures
 

4069
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:48,470
structures
you know you should use that information

4070
01:15:48,470 --> 01:15:48,480
you know you should use that information
 

4071
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,229
you know you should use that information
however sometimes we don't have this

4072
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:50,239
however sometimes we don't have this
 

4073
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:51,990
however sometimes we don't have this
information instead we have

4074
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:52,000
information instead we have
 

4075
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,990
information instead we have
a bunch of sequences sequences we have a

4076
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
a bunch of sequences sequences we have a
 

4077
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:55,510
a bunch of sequences sequences we have a
lot right so so we

4078
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:55,520
lot right so so we
 

4079
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:59,590
lot right so so we
we have you know hundreds

4080
01:15:59,590 --> 01:15:59,600
we have you know hundreds
 

4081
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,070
we have you know hundreds
thousands of uh you know different

4082
01:16:02,070 --> 01:16:02,080
thousands of uh you know different
 

4083
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:02,950
thousands of uh you know different
organisms

4084
01:16:02,950 --> 01:16:02,960
organisms
 

4085
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,070
organisms
sequenced right and by taking this same

4086
01:16:06,070 --> 01:16:06,080
sequenced right and by taking this same
 

4087
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:07,750
sequenced right and by taking this same
protein

4088
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:07,760
protein
 

4089
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:10,790
protein
but in different organisms and

4090
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:10,800
but in different organisms and
 

4091
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:13,830
but in different organisms and
aligning it so making it you know

4092
01:16:13,830 --> 01:16:13,840
aligning it so making it you know
 

4093
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:15,830
aligning it so making it you know
making the corresponding positions

4094
01:16:15,830 --> 01:16:15,840
making the corresponding positions
 

4095
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:16,950
making the corresponding positions
aligned

4096
01:16:16,950 --> 01:16:16,960
aligned
 

4097
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:20,390
aligned
we can actually uh say a lot

4098
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:20,400
we can actually uh say a lot
 

4099
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:23,350
we can actually uh say a lot
about sort of what is conserved in this

4100
01:16:23,350 --> 01:16:23,360
about sort of what is conserved in this
 

4101
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:24,229
about sort of what is conserved in this
protein

4102
01:16:24,229 --> 01:16:24,239
protein
 

4103
01:16:24,239 --> 01:16:26,310
protein
and therefore you know structurally more

4104
01:16:26,310 --> 01:16:26,320
and therefore you know structurally more
 

4105
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:28,790
and therefore you know structurally more
stable what is diverse in these proteins

4106
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
stable what is diverse in these proteins
 

4107
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,189
stable what is diverse in these proteins
so on top of that we we could provide

4108
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:31,199
so on top of that we we could provide
 

4109
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:33,189
so on top of that we we could provide
sort of the information about the

4110
01:16:33,189 --> 01:16:33,199
sort of the information about the
 

4111
01:16:33,199 --> 01:16:35,270
sort of the information about the
sort of the secondary structure of this

4112
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
sort of the secondary structure of this
 

4113
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:37,590
sort of the secondary structure of this
protein et cetera so this information is

4114
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:37,600
protein et cetera so this information is
 

4115
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,189
protein et cetera so this information is
extremely useful and it's already there

4116
01:16:41,189 --> 01:16:41,199
extremely useful and it's already there
 

4117
01:16:41,199 --> 01:16:44,149
extremely useful and it's already there
so so while it's tempting to you know to

4118
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:44,159
so so while it's tempting to you know to
 

4119
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:44,470
so so while it's tempting to you know to
do

4120
01:16:44,470 --> 01:16:44,480
do
 

4121
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,950
do
a complete ab initio so you just have a

4122
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
a complete ab initio so you just have a
 

4123
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,430
a complete ab initio so you just have a
protein sequence and nothing else

4124
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
protein sequence and nothing else
 

4125
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,229
protein sequence and nothing else
the reality is such that we we are

4126
01:16:52,229 --> 01:16:52,239
the reality is such that we we are
 

4127
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,070
the reality is such that we we are
overwhelmed with this data

4128
01:16:54,070 --> 01:16:54,080
overwhelmed with this data
 

4129
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,110
overwhelmed with this data
so why not use it and

4130
01:16:57,110 --> 01:16:57,120
so why not use it and
 

4131
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:59,430
so why not use it and
so yeah so i i'm looking forward to to

4132
01:16:59,430 --> 01:16:59,440
so yeah so i i'm looking forward to to
 

4133
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,350
so yeah so i i'm looking forward to to
reading the the this paper

4134
01:17:01,350 --> 01:17:01,360
reading the the this paper
 

4135
01:17:01,360 --> 01:17:03,510
reading the the this paper
it does seem to like they've in the

4136
01:17:03,510 --> 01:17:03,520
it does seem to like they've in the
 

4137
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,189
it does seem to like they've in the
previous version of alpha fold they

4138
01:17:05,189 --> 01:17:05,199
previous version of alpha fold they
 

4139
01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:06,630
previous version of alpha fold they
didn't

4140
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:06,640
didn't
 

4141
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,189
didn't
uh for this the evolutionary similarity

4142
01:17:09,189 --> 01:17:09,199
uh for this the evolutionary similarity
 

4143
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:11,270
uh for this the evolutionary similarity
thing they didn't use machine learning

4144
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
thing they didn't use machine learning
 

4145
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:14,790
thing they didn't use machine learning
for that or they rather they used it as

4146
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:14,800
for that or they rather they used it as
 

4147
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,550
for that or they rather they used it as
like the input to the entirety of the

4148
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:16,560
like the input to the entirety of the
 

4149
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,750
like the input to the entirety of the
the neural net

4150
01:17:17,750 --> 01:17:17,760
the neural net
 

4151
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:20,790
the neural net
like the features uh derived from the

4152
01:17:20,790 --> 01:17:20,800
like the features uh derived from the
 

4153
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,910
like the features uh derived from the
similarity

4154
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
similarity
 

4155
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,590
similarity
it seems like there's some kind of

4156
01:17:23,590 --> 01:17:23,600
it seems like there's some kind of
 

4157
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,830
it seems like there's some kind of
quote-unquote iterative thing

4158
01:17:25,830 --> 01:17:25,840
quote-unquote iterative thing
 

4159
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,510
quote-unquote iterative thing
where it seems to be part of the

4160
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:29,520
where it seems to be part of the
 

4161
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:31,750
where it seems to be part of the
part of the learning process is the

4162
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:31,760
part of the learning process is the
 

4163
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:32,870
part of the learning process is the
incorporation of this

4164
01:17:32,870 --> 01:17:32,880
incorporation of this
 

4165
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:34,950
incorporation of this
evolutionary similarity yeah i i don't

4166
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:34,960
evolutionary similarity yeah i i don't
 

4167
01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:36,790
evolutionary similarity yeah i i don't
think there is a bioarchive paper right

4168
01:17:36,790 --> 01:17:36,800
think there is a bioarchive paper right
 

4169
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:37,590
think there is a bioarchive paper right
there's no no

4170
01:17:37,590 --> 01:17:37,600
there's no no
 

4171
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:39,990
there's no no
there's nothing yeah it's a blog post

4172
01:17:39,990 --> 01:17:40,000
there's nothing yeah it's a blog post
 

4173
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,510
there's nothing yeah it's a blog post
that's written by a marketing team

4174
01:17:41,510 --> 01:17:41,520
that's written by a marketing team
 

4175
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,229
that's written by a marketing team
essentially

4176
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,239
essentially
 

4177
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:44,790
essentially
yeah which you know it has some

4178
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
yeah which you know it has some
 

4179
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,390
yeah which you know it has some
scientific uh

4180
01:17:46,390 --> 01:17:46,400
scientific uh
 

4181
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:49,669
scientific uh
uh similarity probably to

4182
01:17:49,669 --> 01:17:49,679
uh similarity probably to
 

4183
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,310
uh similarity probably to
the the actual methodology used but it

4184
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
the the actual methodology used but it
 

4185
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,350
the the actual methodology used but it
could be

4186
01:17:53,350 --> 01:17:53,360
could be
 

4187
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:55,189
could be
it's like interpreting scripture it

4188
01:17:55,189 --> 01:17:55,199
it's like interpreting scripture it
 

4189
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:56,390
it's like interpreting scripture it
could it could be just

4190
01:17:56,390 --> 01:17:56,400
could it could be just
 

4191
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,270
could it could be just
poetic uh interpretations of the actual

4192
01:17:59,270 --> 01:17:59,280
poetic uh interpretations of the actual
 

4193
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,950
poetic uh interpretations of the actual
work as opposed to direct connection to

4194
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:00,960
work as opposed to direct connection to
 

4195
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:01,750
work as opposed to direct connection to
the work

4196
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:01,760
the work
 

4197
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,910
the work
so now speaking about protein folding

4198
01:18:03,910 --> 01:18:03,920
so now speaking about protein folding
 

4199
01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:05,830
so now speaking about protein folding
right so so so you know in order to

4200
01:18:05,830 --> 01:18:05,840
right so so so you know in order to
 

4201
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:07,669
right so so so you know in order to
answer the question whether or not we we

4202
01:18:07,669 --> 01:18:07,679
answer the question whether or not we we
 

4203
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:08,709
answer the question whether or not we we
have solved this

4204
01:18:08,709 --> 01:18:08,719
have solved this
 

4205
01:18:08,719 --> 01:18:11,110
have solved this
right yeah so we need to go back to to

4206
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:11,120
right yeah so we need to go back to to
 

4207
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,110
right yeah so we need to go back to to
the beginning of our conversation

4208
01:18:13,110 --> 01:18:13,120
the beginning of our conversation
 

4209
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:14,709
the beginning of our conversation
you know with the realization that you

4210
01:18:14,709 --> 01:18:14,719
you know with the realization that you
 

4211
01:18:14,719 --> 01:18:16,390
you know with the realization that you
know an average protein is

4212
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:16,400
know an average protein is
 

4213
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:20,630
know an average protein is
that typically what uh the the cusp

4214
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:20,640
that typically what uh the the cusp
 

4215
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:23,669
that typically what uh the the cusp
uh has been focusing on is uh the

4216
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:23,679
uh has been focusing on is uh the
 

4217
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:25,189
uh has been focusing on is uh the
you know this competition has been

4218
01:18:25,189 --> 01:18:25,199
you know this competition has been
 

4219
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,110
you know this competition has been
focusing on the single

4220
01:18:27,110 --> 01:18:27,120
focusing on the single
 

4221
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,990
focusing on the single
maybe two domain proteins that are still

4222
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:30,000
maybe two domain proteins that are still
 

4223
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:30,950
maybe two domain proteins that are still
very compact

4224
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:30,960
very compact
 

4225
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:32,950
very compact
and even those ones are extremely

4226
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:32,960
and even those ones are extremely
 

4227
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,709
and even those ones are extremely
challenging to to solve

4228
01:18:34,709 --> 01:18:34,719
challenging to to solve
 

4229
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:37,750
challenging to to solve
right but now we talk about you know an

4230
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:37,760
right but now we talk about you know an
 

4231
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,790
right but now we talk about you know an
average protein that has two three

4232
01:18:40,790 --> 01:18:40,800
average protein that has two three
 

4233
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:42,310
average protein that has two three
protein domains

4234
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:42,320
protein domains
 

4235
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:45,750
protein domains
if you look at the um proteins that uh

4236
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:45,760
if you look at the um proteins that uh
 

4237
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,229
if you look at the um proteins that uh
that are in charge of the you know of

4238
01:18:48,229 --> 01:18:48,239
that are in charge of the you know of
 

4239
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:49,110
that are in charge of the you know of
the process

4240
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:49,120
the process
 

4241
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,550
the process
in you know with the neural system right

4242
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:52,560
in you know with the neural system right
 

4243
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,149
in you know with the neural system right
perhaps one of the uh of the

4244
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
perhaps one of the uh of the
 

4245
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,189
perhaps one of the uh of the
most recently evolved sort of uh

4246
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
most recently evolved sort of uh
 

4247
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:03,110
most recently evolved sort of uh
systems in in in a in an organism

4248
01:19:03,110 --> 01:19:03,120
systems in in in a in an organism
 

4249
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,910
systems in in in a in an organism
right all of them well the majority of

4250
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:05,920
right all of them well the majority of
 

4251
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:06,310
right all of them well the majority of
them

4252
01:19:06,310 --> 01:19:06,320
them
 

4253
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,350
them
are highly multi-domain proteins so they

4254
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:09,360
are highly multi-domain proteins so they
 

4255
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:09,830
are highly multi-domain proteins so they
are

4256
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:09,840
are
 

4257
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:12,550
are
you know some of them have five six

4258
01:19:12,550 --> 01:19:12,560
you know some of them have five six
 

4259
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:13,350
you know some of them have five six
seven

4260
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:13,360
seven
 

4261
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,709
seven
you know and more domains right

4262
01:19:16,709 --> 01:19:16,719
you know and more domains right
 

4263
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:20,070
you know and more domains right
and you know we are very far away from

4264
01:19:20,070 --> 01:19:20,080
and you know we are very far away from
 

4265
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,590
and you know we are very far away from
understanding how these proteins are

4266
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:21,600
understanding how these proteins are
 

4267
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:22,310
understanding how these proteins are
folded

4268
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,320
folded
 

4269
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,070
folded
so the complexity of the protein matters

4270
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
so the complexity of the protein matters
 

4271
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:25,510
so the complexity of the protein matters
here the complexity the

4272
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:25,520
here the complexity the
 

4273
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:28,709
here the complexity the
complexity of the protein modules or the

4274
01:19:28,709 --> 01:19:28,719
complexity of the protein modules or the
 

4275

4277
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,110

so you're saying solve so the definition

self-playing mechanisms are nice because
 

4335
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:42,950
self-playing mechanisms are nice because
it's all in simulation so you can

it's all in simulation so you can
 

4337
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,070
it's all in simulation so you can
learn from just huge amounts like you

01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:00,470
no matter what it's like millions maybe
a one or two million or something like

that
 

4357
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,750
that
but some very small number but like it

01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:10,560
like you want
 

4365
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:14,470
like you want
to somehow 10x the data or 100x the data

4366
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:14,480
to somehow 10x the data or 100x the data

yes but we also can take advantage of

4370
01:21:19,110 --> 01:21:19,120
yes but we also can take advantage of
 

4371
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:22,629
yes but we also can take advantage of
um of uh homology models

4372
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:22,639
um of uh homology models
 

4373
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,669
um of uh homology models
right so the models that are of very

4374
01:21:25,669 --> 01:21:25,679
right so the models that are of very
 

4375
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:27,669
right so the models that are of very
good quality because they are

4376
01:21:27,669 --> 01:21:27,679
good quality because they are
 

4377
01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:28,870
good quality because they are
essentially

4378
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:28,880
essentially

to enhance this
 

4387
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:41,350
to enhance this

how much of a brain power you need
 

4583
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:32,629
how much of a brain power you need
you know to to reach those you know

4584
01:25:32,629 --> 01:25:32,639
you know to to reach those you know
 

4585
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:33,990
you know to to reach those you know
those levels of

uh grand masters right level and it's
 

4589
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,229
uh grand masters right level and it's
probably one of the first time and

probably one of the first time and
 

4591
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:41,270
probably one of the first time and
how good caspar was and again yeah so

4592
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:41,280
how good caspar was and again yeah so
 

4593
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:44,149
how good caspar was and again yeah so
kasparov is actually one of the best

4594
01:25:44,149 --> 01:25:44,159
kasparov is actually one of the best
 

4595
01:25:44,159 --> 01:25:44,550
kasparov is actually one of the best
ever

4596
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:44,560
ever
 

4597
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,110
ever
right and you get a machine that beats

01:25:47,110 --> 01:25:47,120
right and you get a machine that beats
 

4599
01:25:47,120 --> 01:25:47,669
right and you get a machine that beats
him

4600
01:25:47,669 --> 01:25:47,679
him
 

4601
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:49,590
him
right so it's it's first time a machine

4602
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:49,600
right so it's it's first time a machine
 

4603
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,030
right so it's it's first time a machine
probably beat a human at

4604
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:51,040
probably beat a human at
 

4605
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,310
probably beat a human at
that scale of a thing of anything yes

4606
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:54,320
that scale of a thing of anything yes
 

4607
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,470
that scale of a thing of anything yes
yes so that was to me that was like you

4608
01:25:56,470 --> 01:25:56,480
yes so that was to me that was like you
 

4609
01:25:56,480 --> 01:25:58,790
yes so that was to me that was like you
know one of the groundbreaking

4610
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
know one of the groundbreaking
 

4611
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,709
know one of the groundbreaking
events in the history of ayat that's

4612
01:26:00,709 --> 01:26:00,719
events in the history of ayat that's
 

4613
01:26:00,719 --> 01:26:02,229
events in the history of ayat that's
probably number one as

4614
01:26:02,229 --> 01:26:02,239
probably number one as
 

4615
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:04,950
probably number one as
probably like we don't it's hard to

4616
01:26:04,950 --> 01:26:04,960
probably like we don't it's hard to
 

4617
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,950
probably like we don't it's hard to
remember it's like muhammad ali versus

4618
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:06,960
remember it's like muhammad ali versus
 

4619
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:07,590
remember it's like muhammad ali versus
uh

4620
01:26:07,590 --> 01:26:07,600
uh
 

4621
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,110
uh
i don't know any other mike tyson or

4622
01:26:09,110 --> 01:26:09,120
i don't know any other mike tyson or
 

4623
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:10,629
i don't know any other mike tyson or
something like that it's like nah

4624
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
something like that it's like nah
 

4625
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,229
something like that it's like nah
you got to put muhammad ali at number

4626
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:12,239
you got to put muhammad ali at number
 

4627
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,229
you got to put muhammad ali at number
one uh same with

4628
01:26:14,229 --> 01:26:14,239
one uh same with
 

4629
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,550
one uh same with
same with d blue even though it's not

4630
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560
same with d blue even though it's not
 

4631
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,310
same with d blue even though it's not
machine learning based

4632
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:18,320
machine learning based
 

4633
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,430
machine learning based
uh i still it uses advanced search

4634
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:21,440
uh i still it uses advanced search
 

4635
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,270
uh i still it uses advanced search
and search is the integral part of the

4636
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:23,280
and search is the integral part of the
 

4637
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,270
and search is the integral part of the
api yeah right so it's not you said this

4638
01:26:25,270 --> 01:26:25,280
api yeah right so it's not you said this
 

4639
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,709
api yeah right so it's not you said this
people don't think of it that way not

4640
01:26:26,709 --> 01:26:26,719
people don't think of it that way not
 

4641
01:26:26,719 --> 01:26:29,910
people don't think of it that way not
at this moment in vogue currently search

4642
01:26:29,910 --> 01:26:29,920
at this moment in vogue currently search
 

4643
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:31,830
at this moment in vogue currently search
is not seen as a

that's what neural networks are

4652
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:39,760
that's what neural networks are
 

4653
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:41,350
that's what neural networks are
they're just performing search on the

4654
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:41,360
they're just performing search on the
 

4655
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:45,590
they're just performing search on the
space of parameters and it's all search

4656
01:26:45,590 --> 01:26:45,600
space of parameters and it's all search
 

4657
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,270

all of intelligence is some form of

01:26:47,270 --> 01:26:47,280
all of intelligence is some form of
 

4659
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:48,550
all of intelligence is some form of
search and you just have to become

4660
01:26:48,550 --> 01:26:48,560
search and you just have to become
 

4661
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:50,709
search and you just have to become
clever and clever at that search problem

4662
01:26:50,709 --> 01:26:50,719
clever and clever at that search problem
 

4663
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,110
clever and clever at that search problem
and i also have uh another one that you

4664
01:26:53,110 --> 01:26:53,120
and i also have uh another one that you
 

4665
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:54,229
and i also have uh another one that you
didn't mention that's

4666
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:54,239
didn't mention that's
 

4667
01:26:54,239 --> 01:26:57,510
didn't mention that's
that's that's uh one of my favorite ones

4668
01:26:57,510 --> 01:26:57,520
that's that's uh one of my favorite ones
 

4669
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,470
that's that's uh one of my favorite ones
is uh so you probably heard of this it's

4670
01:27:00,470 --> 01:27:00,480
is uh so you probably heard of this it's
 

4671
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,830
is uh so you probably heard of this it's
uh i think it's called

4672
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:01,840
uh i think it's called
 

4673
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,790
uh i think it's called
deep rembrandt it's the project where

4674
01:27:04,790 --> 01:27:04,800
deep rembrandt it's the project where
 

4675
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:05,110
deep rembrandt it's the project where
they

4676
01:27:05,110 --> 01:27:05,120
they
 

4677
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:07,350
they
they trained i think there was a

4678
01:27:07,350 --> 01:27:07,360
they trained i think there was a
 

4679
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,030
they trained i think there was a
collaboration between

4680
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:09,040
collaboration between
 

4681
01:27:09,040 --> 01:27:11,990
collaboration between
the uh sort of the uh experts in in

4682
01:27:11,990 --> 01:27:12,000
the uh sort of the uh experts in in
 

4683
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:12,629
the uh sort of the uh experts in in
rembrandt

4684
01:27:12,629 --> 01:27:12,639
rembrandt
 

4685
01:27:12,639 --> 01:27:15,750
rembrandt
uh painting in netherlands and

4686
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:15,760
uh painting in netherlands and
 

4687
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,149
uh painting in netherlands and
a group an artificial intelligence group

4688
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
a group an artificial intelligence group
 

4689
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:20,070
a group an artificial intelligence group
where they train an algorithm

4690
01:27:20,070 --> 01:27:20,080
where they train an algorithm
 

4691
01:27:20,080 --> 01:27:22,950
where they train an algorithm
to replicate the style of the rembrandt

4692
01:27:22,950 --> 01:27:22,960
to replicate the style of the rembrandt
 

4693
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:23,430
to replicate the style of the rembrandt
and they

4694
01:27:23,430 --> 01:27:23,440
and they
 

4695
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:27,350
and they
actually printed a a portrait that never

4696
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:27,360
actually printed a a portrait that never
 

4697
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,629
actually printed a a portrait that never
existed before

4698
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:28,639
existed before
 

4699
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,669
existed before
uh in the style of rembrandt they they

4700
01:27:31,669 --> 01:27:31,679
uh in the style of rembrandt they they
 

4701
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:32,550
uh in the style of rembrandt they they
uh

4702
01:27:32,550 --> 01:27:32,560
uh
 

4703
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:35,669
uh
i think they printed it only on a sort

4704
01:27:35,669 --> 01:27:35,679
i think they printed it only on a sort
 

4705
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:36,229
i think they printed it only on a sort
of

4706
01:27:36,229 --> 01:27:36,239
of
 

4707
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:38,950
of
uh on the canvas that you know using

4708
01:27:38,950 --> 01:27:38,960
uh on the canvas that you know using
 

4709
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:39,990
uh on the canvas that you know using
pretty much

4710
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:40,000
pretty much
 

4711
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,709
pretty much
same types of paints and stuff and to me

4712
01:27:42,709 --> 01:27:42,719
same types of paints and stuff and to me
 

4713
01:27:42,719 --> 01:27:43,990
same types of paints and stuff and to me
it was mind-blowing

4714
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,000
it was mind-blowing
 

4715
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,390
it was mind-blowing
yeah it's in the space of art that's

4716
01:27:46,390 --> 01:27:46,400
yeah it's in the space of art that's
 

4717
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:48,870
yeah it's in the space of art that's
interesting there hasn't been um

4718
01:27:48,870 --> 01:27:48,880
interesting there hasn't been um
 

4719
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,070
interesting there hasn't been um
maybe that's that's it but i i think

4720
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
maybe that's that's it but i i think
 

4721
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:53,750
maybe that's that's it but i i think
there hasn't been an image in that

4722
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:53,760
there hasn't been an image in that
 

4723
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,629
there hasn't been an image in that
moment yet in a space of art

4724
01:27:56,629 --> 01:27:56,639
moment yet in a space of art
 

4725
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,870
moment yet in a space of art
you haven't been able to achieve super

4726
01:27:58,870 --> 01:27:58,880
you haven't been able to achieve super
 

4727
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,149
you haven't been able to achieve super
human level performance

4728
01:28:00,149 --> 01:28:00,159
human level performance
 

4729
01:28:00,159 --> 01:28:01,910
human level performance
in the space of art even though there

4730
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
in the space of art even though there
 

4731
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,750
in the space of art even though there
was you know there's a

4732
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:03,760
was you know there's a
 

4733
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,629
was you know there's a
big famous thing where there was a piece

4734
01:28:06,629 --> 01:28:06,639
big famous thing where there was a piece
 

4735
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:08,149
big famous thing where there was a piece
of art was purchased i guess for a lot

4736
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:08,159
of art was purchased i guess for a lot
 

4737
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:09,110
of art was purchased i guess for a lot
of money yes

4738
01:28:09,110 --> 01:28:09,120
of money yes
 

4739
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:11,990
of money yes
yeah but it's still you know people are

4740
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:12,000
yeah but it's still you know people are
 

4741
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:15,510
yeah but it's still you know people are
like in the space of music at least um

4742
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:15,520
like in the space of music at least um
 

4743
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:18,550
like in the space of music at least um
that's you know it's clear that human

4744
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:18,560
that's you know it's clear that human
 

4745
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:19,590
that's you know it's clear that human
created pieces

4746
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:19,600
created pieces
 

4747
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:22,709
created pieces
are much more popular so there hasn't

4748
01:28:22,709 --> 01:28:22,719
are much more popular so there hasn't
 

4749
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:24,229
are much more popular so there hasn't
been a moment where it's like

4750
01:28:24,229 --> 01:28:24,239
been a moment where it's like
 

4751
01:28:24,239 --> 01:28:27,270
been a moment where it's like
oh this is we're now i would say in the

4752
01:28:27,270 --> 01:28:27,280
oh this is we're now i would say in the
 

4753
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,629
oh this is we're now i would say in the
space of music

4754
01:28:28,629 --> 01:28:28,639
space of music
 

4755
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:30,390
space of music
what makes a lot of money we're talking

4756
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:30,400

uh cinema like netflix show
 

4773
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,950
uh cinema like netflix show
that is uh you know that's sufficiently

4774
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:52,960
that is uh you know that's sufficiently
 

4775
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:54,229
that is uh you know that's sufficiently
popular to make

4776
01:28:54,229 --> 01:28:54,239
popular to make
 

4777
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,470
popular to make
a ton of money yeah and that moment

4778
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:56,480
a ton of money yeah and that moment
 

4779
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:57,669
a ton of money yeah and that moment
would be very

4780
01:28:57,669 --> 01:28:57,679
would be very
 

4781
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,070
would be very
very powerful because that's like a

4782
01:29:00,070 --> 01:29:00,080
very powerful because that's like a
 

4783
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,990
very powerful because that's like a
that's in the ai system being used to

4784
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,000
that's in the ai system being used to
 

4785
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:03,830
that's in the ai system being used to
make a lot of money and like direct of

course ai tools

4788
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:05,280
course ai tools
 

4789
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,430
course ai tools
like even premiere audio editing all the

4790

to edit this podcast there's a lot of ai

4794
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:10,480
to edit this podcast there's a lot of ai
 

4795
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:12,390
to edit this podcast there's a lot of ai
involved i won't actually this is

4796
01:29:12,390 --> 01:29:12,400
involved i won't actually this is
 

4797
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,149
involved i won't actually this is
a program i want to talk to those folks

4798
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:14,159
a program i want to talk to those folks
 

4799
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:15,590
a program i want to talk to those folks
just because i want to nerd out it's

4800
01:29:15,590 --> 01:29:15,600
just because i want to nerd out it's
 

4801
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,030
just because i want to nerd out it's
called izotope i don't know if you're

4802
01:29:17,030 --> 01:29:17,040
called izotope i don't know if you're
 

4803
01:29:17,040 --> 01:29:17,830
called izotope i don't know if you're
familiar with it

4804
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:17,840
familiar with it
 

4805
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:19,350
familiar with it
they have a bunch of tools of audio

4806
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:19,360
they have a bunch of tools of audio
 

4807
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,270
they have a bunch of tools of audio
processing and they have

4808
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:21,280
processing and they have
 

4809
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:23,669
processing and they have
i think they're boston based just it's

4810
01:29:23,669 --> 01:29:23,679
i think they're boston based just it's
 

4811
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:25,189
i think they're boston based just it's
so exciting to me

4812
01:29:25,189 --> 01:29:25,199
so exciting to me
 

4813
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,470
so exciting to me
to use it like on the audio here because

4814
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:28,480
to use it like on the audio here because
 

4815
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:31,189
to use it like on the audio here because
it's all machine learning it's not

4816
01:29:31,189 --> 01:29:31,199
it's all machine learning it's not
 

4817
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,550
it's all machine learning it's not
because most

4818
01:29:32,550 --> 01:29:32,560
because most
 

4819
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:35,669
because most
most audio production stuff

4820
01:29:35,669 --> 01:29:35,679
most audio production stuff
 

4821
01:29:35,679 --> 01:29:37,590
most audio production stuff
is like any kind of processing you do is

4822
01:29:37,590 --> 01:29:37,600
is like any kind of processing you do is
 

4823
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,430
is like any kind of processing you do is
very basic signal processing

4824
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
very basic signal processing
 

4825
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,070
very basic signal processing
and you're tuning knobs and so on they

4826
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:42,080
and you're tuning knobs and so on they
 

4827
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:43,350
and you're tuning knobs and so on they
have all of that of course

4828
01:29:43,350 --> 01:29:43,360
have all of that of course
 

4829
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,270
have all of that of course
but they also have all of this machine

4830
01:29:45,270 --> 01:29:45,280
but they also have all of this machine
 

4831
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,270
but they also have all of this machine
learning stuff like where you actually

4832
01:29:47,270 --> 01:29:47,280
learning stuff like where you actually
 

4833
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,669
learning stuff like where you actually
give it training data you select parts

4834
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:49,679
give it training data you select parts
 

4835
01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:51,669
give it training data you select parts
of the audio you train on

4836
01:29:51,669 --> 01:29:51,679
of the audio you train on
 

4837
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,950
of the audio you train on
you you train on it and it it

4838
01:29:54,950 --> 01:29:54,960
you you train on it and it it
 

4839
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:57,110
you you train on it and it it
figures stuff out it's great it's able

4840
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
figures stuff out it's great it's able
 

4841
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,629
figures stuff out it's great it's able
to detect

4842
01:29:58,629 --> 01:29:58,639
to detect
 

4843
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:01,990
to detect
uh like the ability of it to be able to

4844
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:02,000
uh like the ability of it to be able to
 

4845
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,870
uh like the ability of it to be able to
separate voice and music for example or

4846
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:04,880
separate voice and music for example or
 

4847
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,830
separate voice and music for example or
voice in anything

4848
01:30:05,830 --> 01:30:05,840
voice in anything
 

4849
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,870
voice in anything
is incredible like it it just

4850
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:08,880
is incredible like it it just
 

4851
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:12,149
is incredible like it it just
it's clearly exceptionally good at uh

4852
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:12,159
it's clearly exceptionally good at uh
 

4853
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,910
it's clearly exceptionally good at uh
you know applying these different neural

4854
01:30:13,910 --> 01:30:13,920
you know applying these different neural
 

4855
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:15,590
you know applying these different neural
networks models to

4856
01:30:15,590 --> 01:30:15,600
networks models to
 

4857
01:30:15,600 --> 01:30:17,669
networks models to
to just separate the different kinds of

4858
01:30:17,669 --> 01:30:17,679
to just separate the different kinds of
 

4859
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:19,030
to just separate the different kinds of
signals from the audio

4860
01:30:19,030 --> 01:30:19,040
signals from the audio
 

4861
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,510
signals from the audio
that that uh okay so that's really

4862
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
that that uh okay so that's really
 

4863

4917
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:18,790
have some link to uh to to arts i mean
you know i think

4918
01:31:18,790 --> 01:31:18,800
you know i think
 

4919
01:31:18,800 --> 01:31:22,149
you know i think
last year uh we had a group

4920
01:31:22,149 --> 01:31:22,159
last year uh we had a group
 

4921
01:31:22,159 --> 01:31:25,510
last year uh we had a group
who designed an ai uh producing uh

4922
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:25,520
who designed an ai uh producing uh
 

4923
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,189
who designed an ai uh producing uh
hocus japanese poems oh wow

4924
01:31:29,189 --> 01:31:29,199
hocus japanese poems oh wow
 

4925
01:31:29,199 --> 01:31:32,709
hocus japanese poems oh wow
uh so and some of them so you know it

4926
01:31:32,709 --> 01:31:32,719
uh so and some of them so you know it
 

4927
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:33,030
uh so and some of them so you know it
got

4928
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:33,040
got
 

4929
01:31:33,040 --> 01:31:35,669
got
trained on the on the english space

4930
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
trained on the on the english space
 

4931
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:37,189
trained on the on the english space
hikers hikers right there

4932
01:31:37,189 --> 01:31:37,199
hikers hikers right there
 

4933
01:31:37,199 --> 01:31:41,110
hikers hikers right there
so um and and some of them you know

4934
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:41,120
so um and and some of them you know
 

4935
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,270
so um and and some of them you know
they get to present like the the top

4936
01:31:43,270 --> 01:31:43,280
they get to present like the the top
 

4937
01:31:43,280 --> 01:31:45,030
they get to present like the the top
selection they were pretty good

4938
01:31:45,030 --> 01:31:45,040
selection they were pretty good
 

4939
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:46,870
selection they were pretty good
i mean you know i mean of course i'm not

4940
01:31:46,870 --> 01:31:46,880
i mean you know i mean of course i'm not
 

4941
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:48,550
i mean you know i mean of course i'm not
i'm not a specialist but yeah you you

4942
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:48,560
i'm not a specialist but yeah you you
 

4943
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:49,350
i'm not a specialist but yeah you you
read them

4944
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:49,360
read them
 

4945
01:31:49,360 --> 01:31:52,070
read them
and you see it seems profound yes yeah

4946
01:31:52,070 --> 01:31:52,080
and you see it seems profound yes yeah
 

4947
01:31:52,080 --> 01:31:53,430
and you see it seems profound yes yeah
it seems

4948
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:53,440
it seems
 

4949
01:31:53,440 --> 01:31:56,790
it seems
so it's kind of cool we also had a

4950
01:31:56,790 --> 01:31:56,800
so it's kind of cool we also had a
 

4951
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,990
so it's kind of cool we also had a
couple of projects where

4952
01:31:57,990 --> 01:31:58,000
couple of projects where
 

4953
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,910
couple of projects where
people tried to to teach ai how to play

4954
01:32:01,910 --> 01:32:01,920
people tried to to teach ai how to play
 

4955
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:05,189
people tried to to teach ai how to play
like rock music classical music

4956
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:05,199
like rock music classical music
 

4957
01:32:05,199 --> 01:32:10,310
like rock music classical music
uh i think and and and popular music

4958
01:32:10,310 --> 01:32:10,320

 

4959
01:32:10,320 --> 01:32:13,030

interestingly enough uh you know

4960
01:32:13,030 --> 01:32:13,040
interestingly enough uh you know
 

4961
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,550
interestingly enough uh you know
classical music was

4962
01:32:14,550 --> 01:32:14,560
classical music was
 

4963
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:17,750
classical music was
among the most difficult ones and and

4964
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:17,760
among the most difficult ones and and
 

4965
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:21,030
among the most difficult ones and and
and you know of course if you

4966
01:32:21,030 --> 01:32:21,040
and you know of course if you
 

4967
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,149
and you know of course if you
if you know uh you know

4968
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:24,159
if you know uh you know
 

4969
01:32:24,159 --> 01:32:27,350
if you know uh you know
if if you look at the you know the uh

4970
01:32:27,350 --> 01:32:27,360
if if you look at the you know the uh
 

4971
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,470
if if you look at the you know the uh
like grand masters of music like bach

4972
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
like grand masters of music like bach
 

4973
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:33,110
like grand masters of music like bach
right so there is a lot of uh there is a

4974
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:33,120
right so there is a lot of uh there is a
 

4975
01:32:33,120 --> 01:32:34,709
right so there is a lot of uh there is a
lot of almost math

4976
01:32:34,709 --> 01:32:34,719
lot of almost math
 

4977
01:32:34,719 --> 01:32:37,350
lot of almost math
yeah well he's very mathematical exactly

4978
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,360
yeah well he's very mathematical exactly
 

4979
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,510
yeah well he's very mathematical exactly
so so this is i would imagine that

4980
01:32:39,510 --> 01:32:39,520
so so this is i would imagine that
 

4981
01:32:39,520 --> 01:32:42,629
so so this is i would imagine that
at least some style of this music could

4982
01:32:42,629 --> 01:32:42,639
at least some style of this music could
 

4983
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:43,669
at least some style of this music could
be picked up

4984
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
be picked up
 

4985
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,590
be picked up
but then you have those completely

4986
01:32:45,590 --> 01:32:45,600
but then you have those completely
 

4987
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:46,870
but then you have those completely
different spectrum

4988
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:46,880
different spectrum
 

4989
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,430
different spectrum
of of you know classical composers and

4990
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:49,440
of of you know classical composers and
 

4991
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,149
of of you know classical composers and
so

4992
01:32:50,149 --> 01:32:50,159
so
 

4993
01:32:50,159 --> 01:32:53,350
so
you know it and you know it's almost

4994
01:32:53,350 --> 01:32:53,360
you know it and you know it's almost
 

4995
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:54,229
you know it and you know it's almost
like you know

4996
01:32:54,229 --> 01:32:54,239
like you know
 

4997
01:32:54,239 --> 01:32:56,229
like you know
you don't have to sort of look at the

4998
01:32:56,229 --> 01:32:56,239
you don't have to sort of look at the
 

4999
01:32:56,239 --> 01:32:58,790
you don't have to sort of look at the
data you just listen to it and say nah

5000
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:58,800
data you just listen to it and say nah
 

5001
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,950
data you just listen to it and say nah
that's that's that's not it not yet

5002
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:00,960
that's that's that's not it not yet
 

5003
01:33:00,960 --> 01:33:01,910
that's that's that's not it not yet
that's not right yeah

5004
01:33:01,910 --> 01:33:01,920
that's not right yeah
 

5005
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:03,910
that's not right yeah
that's that's how i feel too this open

5006
01:33:03,910 --> 01:33:03,920
that's that's how i feel too this open
 

5007
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:06,070
that's that's how i feel too this open
ai has i think open muse or something

5008
01:33:06,070 --> 01:33:06,080
ai has i think open muse or something
 

5009
01:33:06,080 --> 01:33:07,430
ai has i think open muse or something
like that the system

5010
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:07,440
like that the system
 

5011
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,990
like that the system
it's cool but it's like eh it's not

5012
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:10,000
it's cool but it's like eh it's not
 

5013
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:11,910
it's cool but it's like eh it's not
compelling for some for some reason

5014
01:33:11,910 --> 01:33:11,920
compelling for some for some reason
 

5015
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,070
compelling for some for some reason
it could be a psychological reason too

5016
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:14,080
it could be a psychological reason too
 

5017
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:16,629
it could be a psychological reason too
maybe we need to have a human

5018
01:33:16,629 --> 01:33:16,639
maybe we need to have a human
 

5019
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:19,590
maybe we need to have a human
being a tortured soul behind the music i

5020
01:33:19,590 --> 01:33:19,600
being a tortured soul behind the music i
 

5021
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,550
being a tortured soul behind the music i
don't know

5022
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:20,560
don't know
 

5023
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:22,790
don't know
yeah no that absolutely i completely

5024
01:33:22,790 --> 01:33:22,800
yeah no that absolutely i completely
 

5025
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:23,830
yeah no that absolutely i completely
agree

5026
01:33:23,830 --> 01:33:23,840
agree
 

5027
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,550
agree
but yeah whether or not we'll have at

5028
01:33:26,550 --> 01:33:26,560
but yeah whether or not we'll have at
 

5029
01:33:26,560 --> 01:33:28,149
but yeah whether or not we'll have at
one day we'll have

5030
01:33:28,149 --> 01:33:28,159
one day we'll have
 

5031
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:31,830
one day we'll have
you know a song written by an ai

5032
01:33:31,830 --> 01:33:31,840
you know a song written by an ai
 

5033
01:33:31,840 --> 01:33:35,110
you know a song written by an ai
engine to to be in like in top

5034
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:35,120
engine to to be in like in top
 

5035
01:33:35,120 --> 01:33:38,310
engine to to be in like in top
charts yeah musical charts i wouldn't be

5036
01:33:38,310 --> 01:33:38,320
charts yeah musical charts i wouldn't be
 

5037
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,310
charts yeah musical charts i wouldn't be
surprised

5038
01:33:40,310 --> 01:33:40,320
surprised
 

5039
01:33:40,320 --> 01:33:43,750
surprised
i wouldn't be surprised i wonder if we

5040
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:43,760
i wouldn't be surprised i wonder if we
 

5041
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:44,629
i wouldn't be surprised i wonder if we
already have one

5042
01:33:44,629 --> 01:33:44,639
already have one
 

5043
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,310
already have one
and it just hasn't been announced

5044
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,320

 

5045
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,590

we wouldn't know how hard is the

5046
01:33:51,590 --> 01:33:51,600
we wouldn't know how hard is the
 

5047
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,310
we wouldn't know how hard is the
multi-protein folding problem is that

5048
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:54,320
multi-protein folding problem is that
 

5049
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:55,669
multi-protein folding problem is that
kind of

5050
01:33:55,669 --> 01:33:55,679
kind of
 

5051
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:57,189
kind of
something you've already mentioned which

5052
01:33:57,189 --> 01:33:57,199
something you've already mentioned which
 

5053
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,110
something you've already mentioned which
is baked into this idea of greater and

5054
01:33:59,110 --> 01:33:59,120
is baked into this idea of greater and
 

5055
01:33:59,120 --> 01:34:01,030
is baked into this idea of greater and
greater complexity of proteins

5056
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:01,040
greater complexity of proteins
 

5057
01:34:01,040 --> 01:34:04,149
greater complexity of proteins
like multi-domain proteins does that

5058
01:34:04,149 --> 01:34:04,159
like multi-domain proteins does that
 

5059
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:07,270
like multi-domain proteins does that
basically become multi-protein

5060
01:34:07,270 --> 01:34:07,280
basically become multi-protein
 

5061
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:10,229
basically become multi-protein
like complexes it's yes you you got it

5062
01:34:10,229 --> 01:34:10,239
like complexes it's yes you you got it
 

5063
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:11,270
like complexes it's yes you you got it
right so so

5064
01:34:11,270 --> 01:34:11,280
right so so
 

5065
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:14,790
right so so
it's sort of it has

5066
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:14,800
it's sort of it has
 

5067
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,189
it's sort of it has
the components of both of protein

5068
01:34:17,189 --> 01:34:17,199
the components of both of protein
 

5069
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,390
the components of both of protein
folding

5070
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:18,400
folding
 

5071
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,390
folding
and protein protein interactions

5072
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:22,400
and protein protein interactions
 

5073
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:24,390
and protein protein interactions
because in order for these domains i

5074
01:34:24,390 --> 01:34:24,400
because in order for these domains i
 

5075
01:34:24,400 --> 01:34:25,910
because in order for these domains i
mean many of these

5076
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:25,920
mean many of these
 

5077
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,629
mean many of these
proteins actually they never form a

5078
01:34:28,629 --> 01:34:28,639
proteins actually they never form a
 

5079
01:34:28,639 --> 01:34:30,310
proteins actually they never form a
stable structure

5080
01:34:30,310 --> 01:34:30,320
stable structure
 

5081
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:32,629
stable structure
uh you know one of my favorite proteins

5082
01:34:32,629 --> 01:34:32,639
uh you know one of my favorite proteins
 

5083
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:34,149
uh you know one of my favorite proteins
you know and uh

5084
01:34:34,149 --> 01:34:34,159
you know and uh
 

5085
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:36,709
you know and uh
pretty much everyone who who works in

5086
01:34:36,709 --> 01:34:36,719
pretty much everyone who who works in
 

5087
01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:37,669
pretty much everyone who who works in
the

5088
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
the
 

5089
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,470
the
i know who whom i know who works in the

5090
01:34:40,470 --> 01:34:40,480
i know who whom i know who works in the
 

5091
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:40,950
i know who whom i know who works in the
you know

5092
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:40,960
you know
 

5093
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,109
you know
with proteins they always have their

5094
01:34:43,109 --> 01:34:43,119
with proteins they always have their
 

5095
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,550
with proteins they always have their
favorite proteins

5096
01:34:44,550 --> 01:34:44,560
favorite proteins
 

5097
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,270
favorite proteins
right so so one of my favorite proteins

5098
01:34:47,270 --> 01:34:47,280
right so so one of my favorite proteins
 

5099
01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:47,990
right so so one of my favorite proteins
are probably

5100
01:34:47,990 --> 01:34:48,000
are probably
 

5101
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,590
are probably
my favorite protein the one that i

5102
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:49,600
my favorite protein the one that i
 

5103
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:51,430
my favorite protein the one that i
worked when i was a postdoc

5104
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:51,440
worked when i was a postdoc
 

5105
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,390
worked when i was a postdoc
is so-called post-synaptic density 95

5106
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:54,400
is so-called post-synaptic density 95
 

5107
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,149
is so-called post-synaptic density 95
psd 95 protein

5108
01:34:56,149 --> 01:34:56,159
psd 95 protein
 

5109
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:59,270
psd 95 protein
so it's uh it's one of the key

5110
01:34:59,270 --> 01:34:59,280
so it's uh it's one of the key
 

5111
01:34:59,280 --> 01:35:02,310
so it's uh it's one of the key
actors in uh in the majority of

5112
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:02,320
actors in uh in the majority of
 

5113
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,310
actors in uh in the majority of
neurological processes at the molecular

5114
01:35:04,310 --> 01:35:04,320
neurological processes at the molecular
 

5115
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:05,750
neurological processes at the molecular
level so it's a

5116
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:05,760
level so it's a
 

5117
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:09,189
level so it's a
and it essentially it's a it's a key

5118
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199
and it essentially it's a it's a key
 

5119
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,030
and it essentially it's a it's a key
player

5120
01:35:11,030 --> 01:35:11,040
player
 

5121
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:13,910
player
in the postsynaptic density so this is

5122
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:13,920
in the postsynaptic density so this is
 

5123
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,430
in the postsynaptic density so this is
the crucial part of this

5124
01:35:15,430 --> 01:35:15,440
the crucial part of this
 

5125
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:19,270
the crucial part of this
uh synapse where you know a lot of these

5126
01:35:19,270 --> 01:35:19,280
uh synapse where you know a lot of these
 

5127
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:22,390
uh synapse where you know a lot of these
chemoliquor processes are happening

5128
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:22,400
chemoliquor processes are happening
 

5129
01:35:22,400 --> 01:35:25,830
chemoliquor processes are happening
so it's it has five domains

5130
01:35:25,830 --> 01:35:25,840
so it's it has five domains
 

5131
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,830
so it's it has five domains
right so five protein dominances so

5132
01:35:27,830 --> 01:35:27,840
right so five protein dominances so
 

5133
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:29,109
right so five protein dominances so
pretty you know

5134
01:35:29,109 --> 01:35:29,119
pretty you know
 

5135
01:35:29,119 --> 01:35:32,790
pretty you know
large proteins uh i think uh 600

5136
01:35:32,790 --> 01:35:32,800
large proteins uh i think uh 600
 

5137
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:36,390
large proteins uh i think uh 600
something amino acids uh but

5138
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:36,400
something amino acids uh but
 

5139
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:39,430
something amino acids uh but
you know the way it's organized itself

5140
01:35:39,430 --> 01:35:39,440
you know the way it's organized itself
 

5141
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:42,470
you know the way it's organized itself
it's flexible right so it acts as a

5142
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:42,480
it's flexible right so it acts as a
 

5143
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,830
it's flexible right so it acts as a
scaffold

5144
01:35:43,830 --> 01:35:43,840
scaffold
 

5145
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,870
scaffold
so it is used to bring

5146
01:35:46,870 --> 01:35:46,880
so it is used to bring
 

5147
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:50,390
so it is used to bring
in other proteins so they start

5148
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:50,400
in other proteins so they start
 

5149
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,510
in other proteins so they start
acting in the orchestrated manner

5150
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:53,520
acting in the orchestrated manner
 

5151
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,669
acting in the orchestrated manner
right so and the the type of the shape

5152
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
right so and the the type of the shape
 

5153
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:58,790
right so and the the type of the shape
of this protein

5154
01:35:58,790 --> 01:35:58,800
of this protein
 

5155
01:35:58,800 --> 01:36:01,030
of this protein
it's in a way there are some stable

5156
01:36:01,030 --> 01:36:01,040
it's in a way there are some stable
 

5157
01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:02,070
it's in a way there are some stable
parts of this

5158
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:02,080
parts of this
 

5159
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,470
parts of this
protein but there are some flexible and

5160
01:36:04,470 --> 01:36:04,480
protein but there are some flexible and
 

5161
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:05,990
protein but there are some flexible and
this flexibility

5162
01:36:05,990 --> 01:36:06,000
this flexibility
 

5163
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:08,950
this flexibility
is built in into the protein in order to

5164
01:36:08,950 --> 01:36:08,960
is built in into the protein in order to
 

5165
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:10,350
is built in into the protein in order to
become sort of this

5166
01:36:10,350 --> 01:36:10,360
become sort of this
 

5167
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:13,750
become sort of this
multifunctional machine so do you think

5168
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:13,760
multifunctional machine so do you think
 

5169
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:16,390
multifunctional machine so do you think
that kind of thing is also learnable

5170
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:16,400
that kind of thing is also learnable
 

5171
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,149
that kind of thing is also learnable
through the alpha fold two kind of

5172
01:36:18,149 --> 01:36:18,159
through the alpha fold two kind of
 

5173
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:19,270
through the alpha fold two kind of
approach

5174
01:36:19,270 --> 01:36:19,280
approach
 

5175
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,310
approach
i mean the time will tell

5176
01:36:22,310 --> 01:36:22,320
i mean the time will tell
 

5177
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:24,709
i mean the time will tell
is it another level of complexity is it

5178
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:24,719
is it another level of complexity is it
 

5179
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:25,430
is it another level of complexity is it
is it uh

5180
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:25,440
is it uh
 

5181
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:27,350
is it uh
like how big of a jumping complexity is

5182
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
like how big of a jumping complexity is
 

5183
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:28,470
like how big of a jumping complexity is
that whole thing to me

5184
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:28,480
that whole thing to me
 

5185
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:30,550
that whole thing to me
it's it's yet another level of

5186
01:36:30,550 --> 01:36:30,560
it's it's yet another level of
 

5187
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,790
it's it's yet another level of
complexity because when we talk about

5188
01:36:32,790 --> 01:36:32,800
complexity because when we talk about
 

5189
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,189
complexity because when we talk about
uh protein protein interactions and

5190
01:36:35,189 --> 01:36:35,199
uh protein protein interactions and
 

5191
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:36,950
uh protein protein interactions and
there is actually a

5192
01:36:36,950 --> 01:36:36,960
there is actually a
 

5193
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,030
there is actually a
a different challenge for this called

5194
01:36:39,030 --> 01:36:39,040
a different challenge for this called
 

5195
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,950
a different challenge for this called
capri and so this

5196
01:36:40,950 --> 01:36:40,960
capri and so this
 

5197
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,669
capri and so this
that is focus uh specifically on

5198
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
that is focus uh specifically on
 

5199
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:45,510
that is focus uh specifically on
macromolecular interactions

5200
01:36:45,510 --> 01:36:45,520
macromolecular interactions
 

5201
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,550
macromolecular interactions
protein protein for dna etc

5202
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:48,560
protein protein for dna etc
 

5203
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:52,070
protein protein for dna etc
so uh but it's you know

5204
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
so uh but it's you know
 

5205
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,510
so uh but it's you know
there are different mechanisms

5206
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:55,520
there are different mechanisms
 

5207
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,629
there are different mechanisms
uh that govern molecular interactions

5208
01:36:58,629 --> 01:36:58,639
uh that govern molecular interactions
 

5209
01:36:58,639 --> 01:37:00,629
uh that govern molecular interactions
and that need to be picked up

5210
01:37:00,629 --> 01:37:00,639
and that need to be picked up
 

5211
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,590
and that need to be picked up
say by a machine learning algorithm uh

5212
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:03,600
say by a machine learning algorithm uh
 

5213
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:04,950
say by a machine learning algorithm uh
interestingly enough

5214
01:37:04,950 --> 01:37:04,960
interestingly enough
 

5215
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:08,390
interestingly enough
we actually we participated uh

5216
01:37:08,390 --> 01:37:08,400
we actually we participated uh
 

5217
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:11,590
we actually we participated uh
for a few years in this competition

5218
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:11,600
for a few years in this competition
 

5219
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,109
for a few years in this competition
we typically don't participate in

5220
01:37:13,109 --> 01:37:13,119
we typically don't participate in
 

5221
01:37:13,119 --> 01:37:15,030
we typically don't participate in
competitions

5222
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:15,040
competitions
 

5223
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:19,030
competitions
i don't know uh don't have enough time

5224
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:19,040
i don't know uh don't have enough time
 

5225
01:37:19,040 --> 01:37:21,270
i don't know uh don't have enough time
you know because it's very intensive

5226
01:37:21,270 --> 01:37:21,280
you know because it's very intensive
 

5227
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:23,590
you know because it's very intensive
yeah yeah it's a very intensive process

5228
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:23,600
yeah yeah it's a very intensive process
 

5229
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:26,629
yeah yeah it's a very intensive process
but we participated back in

5230
01:37:26,629 --> 01:37:26,639
but we participated back in
 

5231
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:30,470
but we participated back in
um you know about 10 years ago or so

5232
01:37:30,470 --> 01:37:30,480
um you know about 10 years ago or so
 

5233
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,629
um you know about 10 years ago or so
and the way we enter this competition so

5234
01:37:32,629 --> 01:37:32,639
and the way we enter this competition so
 

5235
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:34,310
and the way we enter this competition so
we design a

5236
01:37:34,310 --> 01:37:34,320
we design a
 

5237
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,910
we design a
scoring function right so the function

5238
01:37:35,910 --> 01:37:35,920
scoring function right so the function
 

5239
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:37,430
scoring function right so the function
that evaluates

5240
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:37,440
that evaluates
 

5241
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:39,109
that evaluates
whether or not your protein protein

5242
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,119
whether or not your protein protein
 

5243
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,750
whether or not your protein protein
interaction is supposed to look like

5244
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:41,760
interaction is supposed to look like
 

5245
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,430
interaction is supposed to look like
experimentally solved right so the

5246
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
experimentally solved right so the
 

5247
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,750
experimentally solved right so the
scoring function is very critical part

5248
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:45,760
scoring function is very critical part
 

5249
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:49,669
scoring function is very critical part
of the of the uh model prediction

5250
01:37:49,669 --> 01:37:49,679
of the of the uh model prediction
 

5251
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:51,350
of the of the uh model prediction
so we designed it to be a machine

5252
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:51,360
so we designed it to be a machine
 

5253
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,350
so we designed it to be a machine
learning one and so

5254
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:53,360
learning one and so
 

5255
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:56,470
learning one and so
it was one of the first machine learning

5256
01:37:56,470 --> 01:37:56,480
it was one of the first machine learning
 

5257
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,149
it was one of the first machine learning
based scoring function

5258
01:37:58,149 --> 01:37:58,159
based scoring function
 

5259
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:01,270
based scoring function
used in capri and uh

5260
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:01,280
used in capri and uh
 

5261
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:04,310
used in capri and uh
you know we essentially you know learned

5262
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:04,320
you know we essentially you know learned
 

5263
01:38:04,320 --> 01:38:05,109
you know we essentially you know learned
what

5264
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:05,119
what
 

5265
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,350
what
should contribute what are the critical

5266
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:07,360
should contribute what are the critical
 

5267
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:08,790
should contribute what are the critical
components contributing

5268
01:38:08,790 --> 01:38:08,800
components contributing
 

5269
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,550
components contributing
into the protein protein interaction so

5270
01:38:10,550 --> 01:38:10,560
into the protein protein interaction so
 

5271
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,390
into the protein protein interaction so
this this could be converted into a

5272
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:12,400
this this could be converted into a
 

5273
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:14,390
this this could be converted into a
learning problem and thereby could be

5274
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:14,400
learning problem and thereby could be
 

5275
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,950
learning problem and thereby could be
it could be learned i believe so yes do

5276
01:38:16,950 --> 01:38:16,960
it could be learned i believe so yes do
 

5277
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,229
it could be learned i believe so yes do
you think alpha fold

5278
01:38:18,229 --> 01:38:18,239
you think alpha fold
 

5279
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,790
you think alpha fold
two or something similar to it from deep

5280
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
two or something similar to it from deep
 

5281
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,709
two or something similar to it from deep
mind or somebody else

5282
01:38:22,709 --> 01:38:22,719
mind or somebody else
 

5283
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:26,470
mind or somebody else
will be will result in a nobel prize

5284
01:38:26,470 --> 01:38:26,480
will be will result in a nobel prize
 

5285
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:30,149
will be will result in a nobel prize
or multiple nobel prizes so like the

5286
01:38:30,149 --> 01:38:30,159
or multiple nobel prizes so like the
 

5287
01:38:30,159 --> 01:38:32,390
or multiple nobel prizes so like the
you know obviously maybe not so

5288
01:38:32,390 --> 01:38:32,400
you know obviously maybe not so
 

5289
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:33,189
you know obviously maybe not so
obviously

5290
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:33,199
obviously
 

5291
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:36,070
obviously
you can't give a nobel prize to the

5292
01:38:36,070 --> 01:38:36,080
you can't give a nobel prize to the
 

5293
01:38:36,080 --> 01:38:37,590
you can't give a nobel prize to the
computer program

5294
01:38:37,590 --> 01:38:37,600
computer program
 

5295
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:40,310
computer program
uh you at least for now give it to the

5296
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,320
uh you at least for now give it to the
 

5297
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,070
uh you at least for now give it to the
designers of that program

5298
01:38:42,070 --> 01:38:42,080
designers of that program
 

5299
01:38:42,080 --> 01:38:45,189
designers of that program
but is do you see one or multiple nobel

5300
01:38:45,189 --> 01:38:45,199
but is do you see one or multiple nobel
 

5301
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:46,070
but is do you see one or multiple nobel
prizes

5302
01:38:46,070 --> 01:38:46,080
prizes
 

5303
01:38:46,080 --> 01:38:49,189
prizes
where alpha fold two

5304
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:49,199
where alpha fold two
 

5305
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:52,149
where alpha fold two
is like a large percentage of what that

5306
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:52,159
is like a large percentage of what that
 

5307
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:53,030
is like a large percentage of what that
prize

5308
01:38:53,030 --> 01:38:53,040
prize
 

5309
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:55,669
prize
is given for would it lead to

5310
01:38:55,669 --> 01:38:55,679
is given for would it lead to
 

5311
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:58,070
is given for would it lead to
discoveries at the level of nobel

5312
01:38:58,070 --> 01:38:58,080
discoveries at the level of nobel
 

5313
01:38:58,080 --> 01:39:02,870
discoveries at the level of nobel
prizes i mean

5314
01:39:02,870 --> 01:39:02,880

 

5315
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:05,510

i think we are definitely destined to

5316
01:39:05,510 --> 01:39:05,520
i think we are definitely destined to
 

5317
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,030
i think we are definitely destined to
see the nobel prize

5318
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:07,040
see the nobel prize
 

5319
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:10,470
see the nobel prize
becoming sort of to be evolving

5320
01:39:10,470 --> 01:39:10,480
becoming sort of to be evolving
 

5321
01:39:10,480 --> 01:39:12,470
becoming sort of to be evolving
with the evolution of science and the

5322
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:12,480
with the evolution of science and the
 

5323
01:39:12,480 --> 01:39:14,390
with the evolution of science and the
evolution of science as such

5324
01:39:14,390 --> 01:39:14,400
evolution of science as such
 

5325
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,629
evolution of science as such
that it now becomes like really

5326
01:39:16,629 --> 01:39:16,639
that it now becomes like really
 

5327
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:18,390
that it now becomes like really
multifaceted right so where you have

5328
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:18,400
multifaceted right so where you have
 

5329
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,310
multifaceted right so where you have
you don't really have like a unique

5330
01:39:20,310 --> 01:39:20,320
you don't really have like a unique
 

5331
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:22,390
you don't really have like a unique
discipline you have sort of the

5332
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:22,400
discipline you have sort of the
 

5333
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,669
discipline you have sort of the
the a lot of cross disciplinary talks in

5334
01:39:25,669 --> 01:39:25,679
the a lot of cross disciplinary talks in
 

5335
01:39:25,679 --> 01:39:25,990
the a lot of cross disciplinary talks in
order

5336
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,000
order
 

5337
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,870
order
to achieve uh sort of you know really

5338
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:28,880
to achieve uh sort of you know really
 

5339
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:29,350
to achieve uh sort of you know really
big

5340
01:39:29,350 --> 01:39:29,360
big
 

5341
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,470
big
advancements uh you know

5342
01:39:32,470 --> 01:39:32,480
advancements uh you know
 

5343
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:36,790
advancements uh you know
so i think

5344
01:39:36,790 --> 01:39:36,800

 

5345
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:39,510

you know the computational methods will

5346
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:39,520
you know the computational methods will
 

5347
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:40,229
you know the computational methods will
be

5348
01:39:40,229 --> 01:39:40,239
be
 

5349
01:39:40,239 --> 01:39:42,790
be
acknowledged in one way or another and

5350
01:39:42,790 --> 01:39:42,800
acknowledged in one way or another and
 

5351
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:43,510
acknowledged in one way or another and
in

5352
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:43,520
in
 

5353
01:39:43,520 --> 01:39:46,790
in
as a matter of fact uh you know

5354
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:46,800
as a matter of fact uh you know
 

5355
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,830
as a matter of fact uh you know
they were first acknowledged back in

5356
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:48,840
they were first acknowledged back in
 

5357
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:50,070
they were first acknowledged back in
2013

5358
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:50,080
2013
 

5359
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,109
2013
right where you know the first

5360
01:39:53,109 --> 01:39:53,119
right where you know the first
 

5361
01:39:53,119 --> 01:39:56,390
right where you know the first
three uh people were uh you know

5362
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:56,400
three uh people were uh you know
 

5363
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:59,030
three uh people were uh you know
awarded the the nobel prize for the pro

5364
01:39:59,030 --> 01:39:59,040
awarded the the nobel prize for the pro
 

5365
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,550
awarded the the nobel prize for the pro
for studying the protein folding right

5366
01:40:00,550 --> 01:40:00,560
for studying the protein folding right
 

5367
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,350
for studying the protein folding right
the principle

5368
01:40:01,350 --> 01:40:01,360
the principle
 

5369
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:03,669
the principle
and you know i think all three of them

5370
01:40:03,669 --> 01:40:03,679
and you know i think all three of them
 

5371
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:06,390
and you know i think all three of them
are computational by physicists

5372
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,400
are computational by physicists
 

5373
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,590
are computational by physicists
right so um you know that

5374
01:40:09,590 --> 01:40:09,600
right so um you know that
 

5375
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:13,189
right so um you know that
i think is is inavoidable

5376
01:40:13,189 --> 01:40:13,199
i think is is inavoidable
 

5377
01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:16,790
i think is is inavoidable
you know it will come with the time

5378
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
you know it will come with the time
 

5379
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,550
you know it will come with the time
um the fact that

5380
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:20,560
um the fact that
 

5381
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,910
um the fact that
you know alpha fold and you know similar

5382
01:40:23,910 --> 01:40:23,920
you know alpha fold and you know similar
 

5383
01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:24,950
you know alpha fold and you know similar
approaches because

5384
01:40:24,950 --> 01:40:24,960
approaches because
 

5385
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,270
approaches because
again it's a matter of time that people

5386
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:27,280
again it's a matter of time that people
 

5387
01:40:27,280 --> 01:40:28,709
again it's a matter of time that people
will embrace

5388
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:28,719
will embrace
 

5389
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:32,229
will embrace
the this uh you know principle and

5390
01:40:32,229 --> 01:40:32,239
the this uh you know principle and
 

5391
01:40:32,239 --> 01:40:34,790
the this uh you know principle and
we'll see more and more such uh you know

5392
01:40:34,790 --> 01:40:34,800
we'll see more and more such uh you know
 

5393
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:35,590
we'll see more and more such uh you know
such tools

5394
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:35,600
such tools
 

5395
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,870
such tools
coming into play but uh you know these

5396
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:38,880
coming into play but uh you know these
 

5397
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:42,310
coming into play but uh you know these
methods will be critical

5398
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:42,320
methods will be critical
 

5399
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:45,350
methods will be critical
in uh in a scientific discovery

5400
01:40:45,350 --> 01:40:45,360
in uh in a scientific discovery
 

5401
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:48,830
in uh in a scientific discovery
no no doubts about it on the engineering

5402
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:48,840
no no doubts about it on the engineering
 

5403
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:51,350
no no doubts about it on the engineering
side may be a dark question

5404
01:40:51,350 --> 01:40:51,360
side may be a dark question
 

5405
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:53,669
side may be a dark question
but do you think it's possible to use

5406
01:40:53,669 --> 01:40:53,679
but do you think it's possible to use
 

5407
01:40:53,679 --> 01:40:55,430
but do you think it's possible to use
these machine learning methods to

5408
01:40:55,430 --> 01:40:55,440
these machine learning methods to
 

5409
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:58,950
these machine learning methods to
start to engineer proteins

5410
01:40:58,950 --> 01:40:58,960
start to engineer proteins
 

5411
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,229
start to engineer proteins
and the next question is

5412
01:41:02,229 --> 01:41:02,239
and the next question is
 

5413
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,629
and the next question is
something quite a few biologists are

5414
01:41:04,629 --> 01:41:04,639
something quite a few biologists are
 

5415
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:05,990
something quite a few biologists are
against some are for

5416
01:41:05,990 --> 01:41:06,000
against some are for
 

5417
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,990
against some are for
for study purposes is to engineer

5418
01:41:07,990 --> 01:41:08,000
for study purposes is to engineer
 

5419
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,430
for study purposes is to engineer
viruses

5420
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:09,440
viruses
 

5421
01:41:09,440 --> 01:41:11,430
viruses
do you think machine learning like

5422
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:11,440
do you think machine learning like
 

5423
01:41:11,440 --> 01:41:12,950
do you think machine learning like
something like alpha fold could be used

5424
01:41:12,950 --> 01:41:12,960
something like alpha fold could be used
 

5425
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:14,629
something like alpha fold could be used
to engineer viruses

5426
01:41:14,629 --> 01:41:14,639
to engineer viruses
 

5427
01:41:14,639 --> 01:41:16,629
to engineer viruses
so to answering the first question you

5428
01:41:16,629 --> 01:41:16,639
so to answering the first question you
 

5429
01:41:16,639 --> 01:41:17,990
so to answering the first question you
know it has been

5430
01:41:17,990 --> 01:41:18,000
know it has been
 

5431
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,030
know it has been
you know a part of the

01:41:38,950 --> 01:41:38,960
was doing the the nova design and was
 

5449
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:39,510
was doing the the nova design and was
used

5450
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,520
used
 

5451
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,590
used
to design new proteins you know and

5452
01:41:41,590 --> 01:41:41,600
to design new proteins you know and
 

5453
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,590
to design new proteins you know and
designer proteins means design of

5454
01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:43,600
designer proteins means design of
 

5455
01:41:43,600 --> 01:41:44,229
designer proteins means design of
functions

5456
01:41:44,229 --> 01:41:44,239
functions
 

5457
01:41:44,239 --> 01:41:46,310
functions
like when you design a protein you can

5458
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
like when you design a protein you can
 

5459
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,070
like when you design a protein you can
control i mean the whole point of the

5460
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:48,080
control i mean the whole point of the
 

5461
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,030
control i mean the whole point of the
protein

5462
01:41:49,030 --> 01:41:49,040
protein
 

5463
01:41:49,040 --> 01:41:51,590
protein
with the protein structure comes a

5464
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:51,600
with the protein structure comes a
 

5465
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:53,109
with the protein structure comes a
function like correct it's doing

5466
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:53,119
function like correct it's doing
 

5467
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:54,149
function like correct it's doing
something correct

5468
01:41:54,149 --> 01:41:54,159
something correct
 

5469
01:41:54,159 --> 01:41:56,229
something correct
so you can design different things so

5470
01:41:56,229 --> 01:41:56,239
so you can design different things so
 

5471
01:41:56,239 --> 01:41:57,750
so you can design different things so
you can yeah so you can do

5472
01:41:57,750 --> 01:41:57,760
you can yeah so you can do
 

5473
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,590
you can yeah so you can do
well you can look at the proteins from

5474
01:41:59,590 --> 01:41:59,600
well you can look at the proteins from
 

5475
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:01,189
well you can look at the proteins from
the function perspective you can

5476
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
the function perspective you can
 

5477
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:02,870
the function perspective you can
also look at the proteins from the

5478
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:02,880
also look at the proteins from the
 

5479
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:04,310
also look at the proteins from the
structure perspective right so the

5480
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:04,320
structure perspective right so the
 

5481
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:05,510
structure perspective right so the
structural building blocks

5482
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
structural building blocks
 

5483
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:07,510
structural building blocks
so if you want to have a building block

5484
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:07,520
so if you want to have a building block
 

5485
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,709
so if you want to have a building block
of a certain shape

5486
01:42:08,709 --> 01:42:08,719
of a certain shape
 

5487
01:42:08,719 --> 01:42:10,870
of a certain shape
you can try to achieve it yes by you

5488
01:42:10,870 --> 01:42:10,880
you can try to achieve it yes by you
 

5489
01:42:10,880 --> 01:42:12,310
you can try to achieve it yes by you
know introducing a new pro

5490
01:42:12,310 --> 01:42:12,320
know introducing a new pro
 

5491
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:14,870
know introducing a new pro
protein sequence and predicting you know

5492
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:14,880
protein sequence and predicting you know
 

5493
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,189
protein sequence and predicting you know
uh how it will fold

5494
01:42:17,189 --> 01:42:17,199
uh how it will fold
 

5495
01:42:17,199 --> 01:42:20,629
uh how it will fold
so uh so with that i mean it's it's a

5496
01:42:20,629 --> 01:42:20,639
so uh so with that i mean it's it's a
 

5497
01:42:20,639 --> 01:42:21,350
so uh so with that i mean it's it's a
natural

5498
01:42:21,350 --> 01:42:21,360
natural
 

5499
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:24,390
natural
uh one of the you know natural uh

5500
01:42:24,390 --> 01:42:24,400
uh one of the you know natural uh
 

5501
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,149
uh one of the you know natural uh
applications of these algorithms

5502
01:42:28,149 --> 01:42:28,159
applications of these algorithms
 

5503
01:42:28,159 --> 01:42:31,430
applications of these algorithms
now talking about engineering

5504
01:42:31,430 --> 01:42:31,440
now talking about engineering
 

5505
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:35,189
now talking about engineering
a virus with machine learning with

5506
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:35,199
a virus with machine learning with
 

5507
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:37,030
a virus with machine learning with
machine learning right so so

5508
01:42:37,030 --> 01:42:37,040
machine learning right so so
 

5509
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:40,070
machine learning right so so
well um you know

5510
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:40,080
well um you know
 

5511
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:43,189
well um you know
so luckily for us i mean uh we don't

5512
01:42:43,189 --> 01:42:43,199
so luckily for us i mean uh we don't
 

5513
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:43,910
so luckily for us i mean uh we don't
have

5514
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:43,920
have
 

5515
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,189
have
that much data right

5516
01:42:47,189 --> 01:42:47,199
that much data right
 

5517
01:42:47,199 --> 01:42:49,590
that much data right
uh we actually uh right now one of the

5518
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:49,600
uh we actually uh right now one of the
 

5519
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,030
uh we actually uh right now one of the
projects that we are uh

5520
01:42:51,030 --> 01:42:51,040
projects that we are uh
 

5521
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:54,310
projects that we are uh
carrying on in the lab is we

5522
01:42:54,310 --> 01:42:54,320
carrying on in the lab is we
 

5523
01:42:54,320 --> 01:42:55,750
carrying on in the lab is we
we're trying to develop a machine

5524
01:42:55,750 --> 01:42:55,760
we're trying to develop a machine
 

5525
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:57,430
we're trying to develop a machine
learning algorithm that

5526
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:57,440
learning algorithm that
 

5527
01:42:57,440 --> 01:42:59,910
learning algorithm that
uh determines the uh whether or not the

5528
01:42:59,910 --> 01:42:59,920
uh determines the uh whether or not the
 

5529
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:02,629
uh determines the uh whether or not the
the current strain is pathogenic

5530
01:43:02,629 --> 01:43:02,639
the current strain is pathogenic
 

5531
01:43:02,639 --> 01:43:03,750
the current strain is pathogenic
and the current strain of the

5532
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:03,760
and the current strain of the
 

5533
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:06,070
and the current strain of the
cardiovirus of the one of the virus i

5534
01:43:06,070 --> 01:43:06,080
cardiovirus of the one of the virus i
 

5535
01:43:06,080 --> 01:43:07,990
cardiovirus of the one of the virus i
mean so there are applications to

5536
01:43:07,990 --> 01:43:08,000
mean so there are applications to
 

5537
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,470
mean so there are applications to
coronaviruses because we have strains of

5538
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:10,480
coronaviruses because we have strains of
 

5539
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,950
coronaviruses because we have strains of
sarskov2 also sarskovi

5540
01:43:12,950 --> 01:43:12,960
sarskov2 also sarskovi
 

5541
01:43:12,960 --> 01:43:15,030
sarskov2 also sarskovi
mers that are pathogenic but we also

5542
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:15,040
mers that are pathogenic but we also
 

5543
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:16,149
mers that are pathogenic but we also
have strains

5544
01:43:16,149 --> 01:43:16,159
have strains
 

5545
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:18,709
have strains
of other coronaviruses that are you know

5546
01:43:18,709 --> 01:43:18,719
of other coronaviruses that are you know
 

5547
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:19,270
of other coronaviruses that are you know
not

5548
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:19,280
not
 

5549
01:43:19,280 --> 01:43:21,750
not
pathogenic i mean the the common cold

5550
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:21,760
pathogenic i mean the the common cold
 

5551
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,109
pathogenic i mean the the common cold
viruses and

5552
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:23,119
viruses and
 

5553
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:26,310
viruses and
you know and some other ones right so so

5554
01:43:26,310 --> 01:43:26,320
you know and some other ones right so so
 

5555
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,790
you know and some other ones right so so
pathogenic meaning spreading oh but

5556
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:28,800
pathogenic meaning spreading oh but
 

5557
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,750
pathogenic meaning spreading oh but
pathogenic

5558
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:29,760
pathogenic
 

5559
01:43:29,760 --> 01:43:33,669
pathogenic
means actually inflicting damage

5560
01:43:33,669 --> 01:43:33,679
means actually inflicting damage
 

5561
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,030
means actually inflicting damage
correct uh there are also some you know

5562
01:43:37,030 --> 01:43:37,040
correct uh there are also some you know
 

5563
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:39,990
correct uh there are also some you know

right so that are built in into the

5572
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:47,280
right so that are built in into the
 

5573
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:49,030
right so that are built in into the
protein sequence into the

5574
01:43:49,030 --> 01:43:49,040
protein sequence into the
 

5575
01:43:49,040 --> 01:43:51,669
protein sequence into the
gene sequence right so and uh whether or

5576
01:43:51,669 --> 01:43:51,679
gene sequence right so and uh whether or
 

5577
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:54,149
gene sequence right so and uh whether or
not the machine learning can

5578
01:43:54,149 --> 01:43:54,159
not the machine learning can
 

5579
01:43:54,159 --> 01:43:57,910
not the machine learning can
determine those deter those components

5580
01:43:57,910 --> 01:43:57,920
determine those deter those components
 

5581
01:43:57,920 --> 01:43:59,510
determine those deter those components
right oh interesting so like using

5582
01:43:59,510 --> 01:43:59,520
right oh interesting so like using
 

5583
01:43:59,520 --> 01:44:01,030
right oh interesting so like using
machine learning to do that's really

5584
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:01,040
machine learning to do that's really
 

5585
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:01,910
machine learning to do that's really
interesting to

5586
01:44:01,910 --> 01:44:01,920
interesting to
 

5587
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,990
interesting to
to to given give the input is like uh

5588
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:06,000
to to given give the input is like uh
 

5589
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:07,990
to to given give the input is like uh
what the entire sequence the protein

5590
01:44:07,990 --> 01:44:08,000
what the entire sequence the protein
 

5591
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:09,910
what the entire sequence the protein
sequence and then determine if this

5592
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:09,920
sequence and then determine if this
 

5593
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,229
sequence and then determine if this
thing is going to be able to do damage

5594
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:12,239
thing is going to be able to do damage
 

5595
01:44:12,239 --> 01:44:15,750
thing is going to be able to do damage
to to uh to a biological system yeah

5596
01:44:15,750 --> 01:44:15,760
to to uh to a biological system yeah
 

5597
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:17,350
to to uh to a biological system yeah
so so i mean good machine learning

5598
01:44:17,350 --> 01:44:17,360
so so i mean good machine learning
 

5599
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:18,470
so so i mean good machine learning
you're saying we don't have enough data

5600
01:44:18,470 --> 01:44:18,480
you're saying we don't have enough data
 

5601
01:44:18,480 --> 01:44:19,270
you're saying we don't have enough data
for that

5602
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:19,280
for that
 

5603
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:21,590
for that
we i mean for for this specific one we

5604
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:21,600
we i mean for for this specific one we
 

5605
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:23,350
we i mean for for this specific one we
do uh we might

5606
01:44:23,350 --> 01:44:23,360
do uh we might
 

5607
01:44:23,360 --> 01:44:25,109
do uh we might
actually uh you know have to back up on

5608
01:44:25,109 --> 01:44:25,119
actually uh you know have to back up on
 

5609
01:44:25,119 --> 01:44:27,109
actually uh you know have to back up on
this because we're still in the process

5610
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
this because we're still in the process
 

5611
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:30,229
this because we're still in the process
there was uh one uh work uh that

5612
01:44:30,229 --> 01:44:30,239
there was uh one uh work uh that
 

5613
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:33,030
there was uh one uh work uh that

01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:39,750
in in
evolutionary genomics uh and they

5620
01:44:39,750 --> 01:44:39,760
evolutionary genomics uh and they
 

5621
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:42,709
evolutionary genomics uh and they
tried to look at this uh but uh you know

5622
01:44:42,709 --> 01:44:42,719
tried to look at this uh but uh you know
 

5623
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,229
tried to look at this uh but uh you know
the the methods were sort of

5624
01:44:44,229 --> 01:44:44,239
the the methods were sort of
 

5625
01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:46,870
the the methods were sort of
standard uh you know supervised learning

5626
01:44:46,870 --> 01:44:46,880
standard uh you know supervised learning
 

5627
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:47,510
standard uh you know supervised learning
uh

5628
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:47,520
uh
 

5629
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,790
uh
methods uh and now the question is

5630
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:50,800
methods uh and now the question is
 

5631
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,390
methods uh and now the question is
you know can you you know advance it

5632
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:54,400
you know can you you know advance it
 

5633
01:44:54,400 --> 01:44:56,950
you know can you you know advance it
further by by using you know not so

5634
01:44:56,950 --> 01:44:56,960
further by by using you know not so
 

5635
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,149
further by by using you know not so
standard methods

5636
01:44:58,149 --> 01:44:58,159
standard methods
 

5637
01:44:58,159 --> 01:45:00,470
standard methods
you know so there's obviously a lot of

5638
01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:00,480
you know so there's obviously a lot of
 

5639
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,550
you know so there's obviously a lot of
hope in in transfer learning

5640
01:45:02,550 --> 01:45:02,560
hope in in transfer learning
 

5641
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:05,430
hope in in transfer learning
where you can actually try to transfer

5642
01:45:05,430 --> 01:45:05,440
where you can actually try to transfer
 

5643
01:45:05,440 --> 01:45:06,629
where you can actually try to transfer
the information that the

5644
01:45:06,629 --> 01:45:06,639
the information that the
 

5645
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:09,669
the information that the
machine learns about the proper protein

5646
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:09,679
machine learns about the proper protein
 

5647
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:10,390
machine learns about the proper protein
sequences

5648
01:45:10,390 --> 01:45:10,400
sequences
 

5649
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,790
sequences
right and you know so so there is

5650
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:14,800
right and you know so so there is
 

5651
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:17,350
right and you know so so there is
some promise in going this direction but

5652
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:17,360
some promise in going this direction but
 

5653
01:45:17,360 --> 01:45:18,629
some promise in going this direction but
if we have this

5654
01:45:18,629 --> 01:45:18,639
if we have this
 

5655
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:20,629
if we have this
it would be extremely useful because

5656
01:45:20,629 --> 01:45:20,639
it would be extremely useful because
 

5657
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,709
it would be extremely useful because
then we could essentially forecast

5658
01:45:22,709 --> 01:45:22,719
then we could essentially forecast
 

5659
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:24,709
then we could essentially forecast
the potential mutations that would make

5660
01:45:24,709 --> 01:45:24,719
the potential mutations that would make
 

5661
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:26,149
the potential mutations that would make
the current strain

5662
01:45:26,149 --> 01:45:26,159
the current strain
 

5663
01:45:26,159 --> 01:45:28,709
the current strain
more or less pathogenic and anticipate

5664
01:45:28,709 --> 01:45:28,719
more or less pathogenic and anticipate
 

5665
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:30,470
more or less pathogenic and anticipate
anticipate them exactly from a vaccine

5666
01:45:30,470 --> 01:45:30,480
anticipate them exactly from a vaccine
 

5667
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,550
anticipate them exactly from a vaccine
development for the treatment the anti

5668
01:45:32,550 --> 01:45:32,560
development for the treatment the anti
 

5669
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,270
development for the treatment the anti
any viral drug development that would be

5670
01:45:35,270 --> 01:45:35,280
any viral drug development that would be
 

5671
01:45:35,280 --> 01:45:37,030
any viral drug development that would be
a very crucial task

5672
01:45:37,030 --> 01:45:37,040
a very crucial task
 

5673
01:45:37,040 --> 01:45:40,550
a very crucial task
but you could also use that system

5674
01:45:40,550 --> 01:45:40,560
but you could also use that system
 

5675
01:45:40,560 --> 01:45:43,430
but you could also use that system
to then say how would we potentially

5676
01:45:43,430 --> 01:45:43,440
to then say how would we potentially
 

5677
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:44,070
to then say how would we potentially
modify

5678
01:45:44,070 --> 01:45:44,080
modify
 

5679
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:47,830
modify
this virus to make it more pathogenic

5680
01:45:47,830 --> 01:45:47,840
this virus to make it more pathogenic
 

5681
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:52,310
this virus to make it more pathogenic
this that's true that's true i mean uh

5682
01:45:52,310 --> 01:45:52,320
this that's true that's true i mean uh
 

5683
01:45:52,320 --> 01:45:55,910
this that's true that's true i mean uh
you know the again

5684
01:45:55,910 --> 01:45:55,920
you know the again
 

5685
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:59,830
you know the again
the hope is well several things right so

5686
01:45:59,830 --> 01:45:59,840
the hope is well several things right so
 

5687
01:45:59,840 --> 01:46:00,310
the hope is well several things right so
one

5688
01:46:00,310 --> 01:46:00,320
one
 

5689
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:03,350
one
is that you know it's even if you design

5690
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:03,360
is that you know it's even if you design
 

5691
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,709
is that you know it's even if you design
a you know a sequence right

5692
01:46:06,709 --> 01:46:06,719
a you know a sequence right
 

5693
01:46:06,719 --> 01:46:10,390
a you know a sequence right
so to carry out the actual

5694
01:46:10,390 --> 01:46:10,400
so to carry out the actual
 

5695
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:13,430
so to carry out the actual
experimental biology to ensure that

5696
01:46:13,430 --> 01:46:13,440
experimental biology to ensure that
 

5697
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,990
experimental biology to ensure that
all the common components working you

5698
01:46:15,990 --> 01:46:16,000
all the common components working you
 

5699
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:16,709
all the common components working you
know

5700
01:46:16,709 --> 01:46:16,719
know
 

5701
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:18,950
know
is is a completely different matter

5702
01:46:18,950 --> 01:46:18,960
is is a completely different matter
 

5703
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:20,229
is is a completely different matter
difficult process yes

5704
01:46:20,229 --> 01:46:20,239
difficult process yes
 

5705
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:23,510
difficult process yes
uh then they did you know uh we've seen

5706
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:23,520
uh then they did you know uh we've seen
 

5707
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:25,270
uh then they did you know uh we've seen
in the past there could be some

5708
01:46:25,270 --> 01:46:25,280
in the past there could be some
 

5709
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,030
in the past there could be some
regulation of the

5710
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:27,040
regulation of the
 

5711
01:46:27,040 --> 01:46:29,510
regulation of the
the moment the scientific community

5712
01:46:29,510 --> 01:46:29,520
the moment the scientific community
 

5713
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,189
the moment the scientific community
recognizes that it's now

5714
01:46:31,189 --> 01:46:31,199
recognizes that it's now
 

5715
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:34,070
recognizes that it's now
becoming no longer a sort of a a fun

5716
01:46:34,070 --> 01:46:34,080
becoming no longer a sort of a a fun
 

5717
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:34,950
becoming no longer a sort of a a fun
puzzle to

5718
01:46:34,950 --> 01:46:34,960
puzzle to
 

5719
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:36,470
puzzle to
you know for for machine learning it

5720
01:46:36,470 --> 01:46:36,480
you know for for machine learning it
 

5721
01:46:36,480 --> 01:46:39,350
you know for for machine learning it
could be yeah so so then there might be

5722
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:39,360
could be yeah so so then there might be
 

5723
01:46:39,360 --> 01:46:40,390
could be yeah so so then there might be
some regulation

5724
01:46:40,390 --> 01:46:40,400
some regulation
 

5725
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:44,629
some regulation
so i i think back in what 2015

5726
01:46:44,629 --> 01:46:44,639
so i i think back in what 2015
 

5727
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:46,070
so i i think back in what 2015
there was you know the there was the

5728
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:46,080
there was you know the there was the
 

5729
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,070
there was you know the there was the
issue on regulating the

5730
01:46:48,070 --> 01:46:48,080
issue on regulating the
 

5731
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:51,510
issue on regulating the
uh the research on um on influenza

5732
01:46:51,510 --> 01:46:51,520
uh the research on um on influenza
 

5733
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,189
uh the research on um on influenza
strains right that there were

5734
01:46:53,189 --> 01:46:53,199
strains right that there were
 

5735
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,910
strains right that there were
you know several groups uh you know use

5736
01:46:55,910 --> 01:46:55,920
you know several groups uh you know use
 

5737
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:56,950
you know several groups uh you know use
surfaces

5738
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:56,960
surfaces
 

5739
01:46:56,960 --> 01:46:59,669
surfaces
mutation analysis to to determine uh

5740
01:46:59,669 --> 01:46:59,679
mutation analysis to to determine uh
 

5741
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:01,189
mutation analysis to to determine uh
whether or not this strain will

5742
01:47:01,189 --> 01:47:01,199
whether or not this strain will
 

5743
01:47:01,199 --> 01:47:03,510
whether or not this strain will
jump from one species to another and i

5744
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:03,520
jump from one species to another and i
 

5745
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:04,709
jump from one species to another and i
think there was like a

5746
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:04,719
think there was like a
 

5747
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:07,189
think there was like a
half a year more moratorium on on the

5748
01:47:07,189 --> 01:47:07,199
half a year more moratorium on on the
 

5749
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,870
half a year more moratorium on on the
research on on the paper

5750
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:08,880
research on on the paper
 

5751
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:12,229
research on on the paper
published until you know uh scientists

5752
01:47:12,229 --> 01:47:12,239
published until you know uh scientists
 

5753
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:14,310
published until you know uh scientists
you know analyzed it and decided that

5754
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:14,320
you know analyzed it and decided that
 

5755
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:15,830
you know analyzed it and decided that
it's actually safe

5756
01:47:15,830 --> 01:47:15,840
it's actually safe
 

5757
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:17,990
it's actually safe
um i forgot what that's called something

5758
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:18,000
um i forgot what that's called something
 

5759
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:20,229
um i forgot what that's called something
a function testing function

5760
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:20,239
a function testing function
 

5761
01:47:20,239 --> 01:47:22,550
a function testing function
function gain a function yeah and gain a

5762
01:47:22,550 --> 01:47:22,560
function gain a function yeah and gain a
 

5763
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:23,910
function gain a function yeah and gain a
functional loss of function that's right

5764
01:47:23,910 --> 01:47:23,920
functional loss of function that's right
 

5765
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:24,709
functional loss of function that's right
sorry

5766
01:47:24,709 --> 01:47:24,719
sorry
 

5767
01:47:24,719 --> 01:47:28,390
sorry
uh it's it's like let's watch this thing

5768
01:47:28,390 --> 01:47:28,400
uh it's it's like let's watch this thing
 

5769
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,070
uh it's it's like let's watch this thing
mutate for a while to see

5770
01:47:30,070 --> 01:47:30,080
mutate for a while to see
 

5771
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,310
mutate for a while to see
like to see what kind of things we can

5772
01:47:32,310 --> 01:47:32,320
like to see what kind of things we can
 

5773
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,669
like to see what kind of things we can
observe

5774
01:47:33,669 --> 01:47:33,679
observe
 

5775
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:36,310
observe
i guess i'm not so much worried about

5776
01:47:36,310 --> 01:47:36,320
i guess i'm not so much worried about
 

5777
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,669
i guess i'm not so much worried about
that kind of research if there's a lot

5778
01:47:37,669 --> 01:47:37,679
that kind of research if there's a lot
 

5779
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:38,470
that kind of research if there's a lot
of regulation

5780
01:47:38,470 --> 01:47:38,480
of regulation
 

5781
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:40,950
of regulation
and if it's done very well and with with

5782
01:47:40,950 --> 01:47:40,960
and if it's done very well and with with
 

5783
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,629
and if it's done very well and with with
competence and seriously

5784
01:47:42,629 --> 01:47:42,639
competence and seriously
 

5785
01:47:42,639 --> 01:47:46,229
competence and seriously
i am more worried about kind of this

5786
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:46,239
i am more worried about kind of this
 

5787
01:47:46,239 --> 01:47:48,470
i am more worried about kind of this
uh you know the the the underlying

5788
01:47:48,470 --> 01:47:48,480
uh you know the the the underlying
 

5789
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:50,310
uh you know the the the underlying
aspect of this question is more like 50

5790
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:50,320
aspect of this question is more like 50
 

5791
01:47:50,320 --> 01:47:52,790
aspect of this question is more like 50
years from now

5792
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:52,800
years from now
 

5793
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:55,350
years from now
speaking to the drake equation one one

5794
01:47:55,350 --> 01:47:55,360
speaking to the drake equation one one
 

5795
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,189
speaking to the drake equation one one
of the parameters in the drake equation

5796
01:47:57,189 --> 01:47:57,199
of the parameters in the drake equation
 

5797
01:47:57,199 --> 01:47:59,910
of the parameters in the drake equation
is how long civilizations last

5798
01:47:59,910 --> 01:47:59,920
is how long civilizations last
 

5799
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,310
is how long civilizations last
and that's that seems to be the most

5800
01:48:02,310 --> 01:48:02,320
and that's that seems to be the most
 

5801
01:48:02,320 --> 01:48:04,470
and that's that seems to be the most
important value actually for calculating

5802
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:04,480
important value actually for calculating
 

5803
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:06,070
important value actually for calculating
if there's other alien

5804
01:48:06,070 --> 01:48:06,080
if there's other alien
 

5805
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:07,910
if there's other alien
intelligence civilizations out there

5806
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:07,920
intelligence civilizations out there
 

5807
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,870
intelligence civilizations out there
that's where there's most variability

5808
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:10,880
that's where there's most variability
 

5809
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:14,149
that's where there's most variability
uh assuming like if life if that

5810
01:48:14,149 --> 01:48:14,159
uh assuming like if life if that
 

5811
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:14,950
uh assuming like if life if that
percentage

5812
01:48:14,950 --> 01:48:14,960
percentage
 

5813
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:18,550
percentage
that life can emerge is like not

5814
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:18,560
that life can emerge is like not
 

5815
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:21,590
that life can emerge is like not
zero like if we're super unique then

5816
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:21,600
zero like if we're super unique then
 

5817
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:22,390
zero like if we're super unique then
it's the

5818
01:48:22,390 --> 01:48:22,400
it's the
 

5819
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:25,109
it's the
how long we last is basically the most

5820
01:48:25,109 --> 01:48:25,119
how long we last is basically the most
 

5821
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:26,070
how long we last is basically the most
important thing

5822
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:26,080
important thing
 

5823
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:29,030
important thing
so from from a selfish perspective but

5824
01:48:29,030 --> 01:48:29,040
so from from a selfish perspective but
 

5825
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:30,390
so from from a selfish perspective but
also from a drake

5826
01:48:30,390 --> 01:48:30,400
also from a drake
 

5827
01:48:30,400 --> 01:48:32,390
also from a drake
uh equation perspective i'm worried

5828
01:48:32,390 --> 01:48:32,400
uh equation perspective i'm worried
 

5829
01:48:32,400 --> 01:48:33,990
uh equation perspective i'm worried
about the la our civilization

5830
01:48:33,990 --> 01:48:34,000
about the la our civilization
 

5831
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,030
about the la our civilization
lasting and you kind of think about all

5832
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:37,040
lasting and you kind of think about all
 

5833
01:48:37,040 --> 01:48:38,470
lasting and you kind of think about all
the ways in which machine learning can

5834
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:38,480
the ways in which machine learning can
 

5835
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:40,629
the ways in which machine learning can
be used to design

5836
01:48:40,629 --> 01:48:40,639
be used to design
 

5837
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:44,709
be used to design
greater weapons of destruction

5838
01:48:44,709 --> 01:48:44,719
greater weapons of destruction
 

5839
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:48,070
greater weapons of destruction
right and i mean one way to ask

5840
01:48:48,070 --> 01:48:48,080
right and i mean one way to ask
 

5841
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:50,149
right and i mean one way to ask
that if you look sort of 50 years from

5842
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:50,159
that if you look sort of 50 years from
 

5843
01:48:50,159 --> 01:48:52,470
that if you look sort of 50 years from
now 100 years from now

5844
01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:52,480
now 100 years from now
 

5845
01:48:52,480 --> 01:48:54,629
now 100 years from now
would you be more worried about natural

5846
01:48:54,629 --> 01:48:54,639
would you be more worried about natural
 

5847
01:48:54,639 --> 01:48:55,669
would you be more worried about natural
pandemics

5848
01:48:55,669 --> 01:48:55,679
pandemics
 

5849
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:59,270
pandemics
or engineered pandemics

5850
01:48:59,270 --> 01:48:59,280

 

5851
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,830

like who's who is the better designer of

5852
01:49:01,830 --> 01:49:01,840
like who's who is the better designer of
 

5853
01:49:01,840 --> 01:49:02,629
like who's who is the better designer of
viruses

5854
01:49:02,629 --> 01:49:02,639
viruses
 

5855
01:49:02,639 --> 01:49:05,430
viruses
nature or humans if we look down the

5856
01:49:05,430 --> 01:49:05,440
nature or humans if we look down the
 

5857
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:05,910
nature or humans if we look down the
line

5858
01:49:05,910 --> 01:49:05,920
line
 

5859
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:09,590
line
i i think uh in my view i would still be

5860
01:49:09,590 --> 01:49:09,600
i i think uh in my view i would still be
 

5861
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,950
i i think uh in my view i would still be
worried about the

5862
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:10,960
worried about the
 

5863
01:49:10,960 --> 01:49:13,830
worried about the
natural pandemics simply because i mean

5864
01:49:13,830 --> 01:49:13,840
natural pandemics simply because i mean
 

5865
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:14,229
natural pandemics simply because i mean
the

5866
01:49:14,229 --> 01:49:14,239
the
 

5867
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:17,669
the
the capacity uh of

5868
01:49:17,669 --> 01:49:17,679
the capacity uh of
 

5869
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:20,950
the capacity uh of
the nature producing yeah this it does

5870
01:49:20,950 --> 01:49:20,960
the nature producing yeah this it does
 

5871
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:21,270
the nature producing yeah this it does
pretty

5872
01:49:21,270 --> 01:49:21,280
pretty
 

5873
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,990
pretty
good job right yes and the motivation

5874
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:24,000
good job right yes and the motivation
 

5875
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:24,390
good job right yes and the motivation
for

5876
01:49:24,390 --> 01:49:24,400
for
 

5877
01:49:24,400 --> 01:49:27,109
for
using virus engineering viruses for uh

5878
01:49:27,109 --> 01:49:27,119
using virus engineering viruses for uh
 

5879
01:49:27,119 --> 01:49:28,070
using virus engineering viruses for uh
as a weapon

5880
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:28,080
as a weapon
 

5881
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:30,629
as a weapon
is a weird one because uh maybe you can

5882
01:49:30,629 --> 01:49:30,639
is a weird one because uh maybe you can
 

5883
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:32,390
is a weird one because uh maybe you can
correct me on this but it's very

5884
01:49:32,390 --> 01:49:32,400
correct me on this but it's very
 

5885
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:34,470
correct me on this but it's very
it seems very difficult to target a

5886
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:34,480
it seems very difficult to target a
 

5887
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,470
it seems very difficult to target a
virus right the whole point of a weapon

5888
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
virus right the whole point of a weapon
 

5889
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,229
virus right the whole point of a weapon
the way a rocket works

5890
01:49:38,229 --> 01:49:38,239
the way a rocket works
 

5891
01:49:38,239 --> 01:49:39,669
the way a rocket works
if a starting point you have an end

5892
01:49:39,669 --> 01:49:39,679
if a starting point you have an end
 

5893
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:42,149
if a starting point you have an end
point and you're trying to hit a target

5894
01:49:42,149 --> 01:49:42,159
point and you're trying to hit a target
 

5895
01:49:42,159 --> 01:49:43,990
point and you're trying to hit a target
to hit a target with a virus is very

5896
01:49:43,990 --> 01:49:44,000
to hit a target with a virus is very
 

5897
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:46,229
to hit a target with a virus is very
difficult it's basically just

5898
01:49:46,229 --> 01:49:46,239
difficult it's basically just
 

5899
01:49:46,239 --> 01:49:48,870
difficult it's basically just
right it it's the target would be the

5900
01:49:48,870 --> 01:49:48,880
right it it's the target would be the
 

5901
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:51,830
right it it's the target would be the
human species

5902
01:49:51,830 --> 01:49:51,840

 

5903
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:54,629

oh man yeah i have a i have a hope in us

5904
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:54,639
oh man yeah i have a i have a hope in us
 

5905
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:55,270
oh man yeah i have a i have a hope in us
i'm

5906
01:49:55,270 --> 01:49:55,280
i'm
 

5907
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:58,229
i'm
forever optimistic that we will not

5908
01:49:58,229 --> 01:49:58,239
forever optimistic that we will not
 

5909
01:49:58,239 --> 01:49:59,189
forever optimistic that we will not
there's no

5910
01:49:59,189 --> 01:49:59,199
there's no
 

5911
01:49:59,199 --> 01:50:01,430
there's no
there's insufficient evil in the world

5912
01:50:01,430 --> 01:50:01,440
there's insufficient evil in the world
 

5913
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,109
there's insufficient evil in the world
to do to lead that to that kind of

5914
01:50:03,109 --> 01:50:03,119
to do to lead that to that kind of
 

5915
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:04,390
to do to lead that to that kind of
destruction

5916
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:04,400
destruction
 

5917
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,550
destruction
well you know i also hope that i mean

5918
01:50:06,550 --> 01:50:06,560
well you know i also hope that i mean
 

5919
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,669
well you know i also hope that i mean
that's what we see

5920
01:50:07,669 --> 01:50:07,679
that's what we see
 

5921
01:50:07,679 --> 01:50:10,870
that's what we see
i mean uh with the way we are getting

5922
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:10,880
i mean uh with the way we are getting
 

5923
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:11,669
i mean uh with the way we are getting
connected

5924
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:11,679
connected
 

5925
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,950
connected
the world is getting connected i think

5926
01:50:14,950 --> 01:50:14,960
the world is getting connected i think
 

5927
01:50:14,960 --> 01:50:18,310
the world is getting connected i think
it it helps

5928
01:50:18,310 --> 01:50:18,320
it it helps
 

5929
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,589
it it helps
for the world to become more transparent

5930
01:50:21,589 --> 01:50:21,599
for the world to become more transparent
 

5931
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:25,430
for the world to become more transparent
yeah so so the information spread

5932
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,440
yeah so so the information spread
 

5933
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:29,189
yeah so so the information spread
is you know i think it's one of the key

5934
01:50:29,189 --> 01:50:29,199
is you know i think it's one of the key
 

5935
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:32,470
is you know i think it's one of the key
things for the for the society

5936
01:50:32,470 --> 01:50:32,480
things for the for the society
 

5937
01:50:32,480 --> 01:50:35,990
things for the for the society
to become more balanced yeah one way or

5938
01:50:35,990 --> 01:50:36,000
to become more balanced yeah one way or
 

5939
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,350
to become more balanced yeah one way or
another this is something that people

5940
01:50:37,350 --> 01:50:37,360
another this is something that people
 

5941
01:50:37,360 --> 01:50:39,270
another this is something that people
disagree with me on but

5942
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:39,280
disagree with me on but
 

5943
01:50:39,280 --> 01:50:41,990
disagree with me on but
i do think that the kind of secrecy that

5944
01:50:41,990 --> 01:50:42,000
i do think that the kind of secrecy that
 

5945
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:43,270
i do think that the kind of secrecy that
governments have

5946
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:43,280
governments have
 

5947
01:50:43,280 --> 01:50:46,149
governments have
so you're kind of speaking more to the

5948
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:46,159
so you're kind of speaking more to the
 

5949
01:50:46,159 --> 01:50:47,350
so you're kind of speaking more to the
other aspects like

5950
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:47,360
other aspects like
 

5951
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,589
other aspects like
research community being more open

5952
01:50:49,589 --> 01:50:49,599
research community being more open
 

5953
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,070
research community being more open
companies are being more open uh

5954
01:50:52,070 --> 01:50:52,080
companies are being more open uh
 

5955
01:50:52,080 --> 01:50:55,750
companies are being more open uh
government is still like

5956
01:50:55,750 --> 01:50:55,760

 

5957
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:56,870

we're talking about like military

5958
01:50:56,870 --> 01:50:56,880
we're talking about like military
 

5959
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:59,510
we're talking about like military
secrets yeah i think i think military

5960
01:50:59,510 --> 01:50:59,520
secrets yeah i think i think military
 

5961
01:50:59,520 --> 01:51:00,390
secrets yeah i think i think military
secrets

5962
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:00,400
secrets
 

5963
01:51:00,400 --> 01:51:03,589
secrets
of the kind that could destroy the world

5964
01:51:03,589 --> 01:51:03,599
of the kind that could destroy the world
 

5965
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:06,310
of the kind that could destroy the world
will become also a thing of the 20th

5966
01:51:06,310 --> 01:51:06,320
will become also a thing of the 20th
 

5967
01:51:06,320 --> 01:51:07,109
will become also a thing of the 20th
century

5968
01:51:07,109 --> 01:51:07,119
century
 

5969
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,270
century
it'll become more and more open yeah

5970
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:09,280
it'll become more and more open yeah
 

5971
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,229
it'll become more and more open yeah
like i

5972
01:51:10,229 --> 01:51:10,239
like i
 

5973
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:12,310
like i
i think nations will lose power in the

5974
01:51:12,310 --> 01:51:12,320
i think nations will lose power in the
 

5975
01:51:12,320 --> 01:51:13,350
i think nations will lose power in the
21st century like

5976
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:13,360
21st century like
 

5977
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:15,830
21st century like
lose sufficient power towards secrecies

5978
01:51:15,830 --> 01:51:15,840
lose sufficient power towards secrecies
 

5979
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:17,910
lose sufficient power towards secrecies
transparency is more beneficial than

5980
01:51:17,910 --> 01:51:17,920
transparency is more beneficial than
 

5981
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:18,790
transparency is more beneficial than
secrecy

5982
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:18,800
secrecy
 

5983
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,270
secrecy
but of course it's not obvious let's

5984
01:51:21,270 --> 01:51:21,280
but of course it's not obvious let's
 

5985
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,070
but of course it's not obvious let's
hope so

5986
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:22,080
hope so
 

5987
01:51:22,080 --> 01:51:24,790
hope so
let's hope so that that you know the the

5988
01:51:24,790 --> 01:51:24,800
let's hope so that that you know the the
 

5989
01:51:24,800 --> 01:51:25,350
let's hope so that that you know the the
the

5990
01:51:25,350 --> 01:51:25,360
the
 

5991
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:28,790
the
uh the governments will become

5992
01:51:28,790 --> 01:51:28,800
uh the governments will become
 

5993
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:32,870
uh the governments will become
more transparent what so we last talked

5994
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:32,880
more transparent what so we last talked
 

5995
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:35,189
more transparent what so we last talked
i think in march or april

5996
01:51:35,189 --> 01:51:35,199
i think in march or april
 

5997
01:51:35,199 --> 01:51:37,830
i think in march or april
what have you learned how has your

5998
01:51:37,830 --> 01:51:37,840
what have you learned how has your
 

5999
01:51:37,840 --> 01:51:38,870
what have you learned how has your
philosophical

6000
01:51:38,870 --> 01:51:38,880
philosophical
 

6001
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:41,990
philosophical
psychological biological worldview

6002
01:51:41,990 --> 01:51:42,000
psychological biological worldview
 

6003
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,550
psychological biological worldview
changed since then or you've been

6004
01:51:44,550 --> 01:51:44,560
changed since then or you've been
 

6005
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:45,990
changed since then or you've been
studying it non-stop

6006
01:51:45,990 --> 01:51:46,000
studying it non-stop
 

6007
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,709
studying it non-stop
from a computational biology perspective

6008
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:48,719
from a computational biology perspective
 

6009
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,229
from a computational biology perspective
how is your understanding and thoughts

6010
01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:50,239
how is your understanding and thoughts
 

6011
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:51,910
how is your understanding and thoughts
about this fire has changed over those

6012
01:51:51,910 --> 01:51:51,920
about this fire has changed over those
 

6013
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:52,870
about this fire has changed over those
months

6014
01:51:52,870 --> 01:51:52,880
months
 

6015
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:54,870
months
from the beginning to today one thing

6016
01:51:54,870 --> 01:51:54,880
from the beginning to today one thing
 

6017
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,950
from the beginning to today one thing
that uh i was

6018
01:51:56,950 --> 01:51:56,960
that uh i was
 

6019
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:00,870
that uh i was
really amazed at how efficient

6020
01:52:00,870 --> 01:52:00,880
really amazed at how efficient
 

6021
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,750
really amazed at how efficient
the scientific community was i mean and

6022
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
the scientific community was i mean and
 

6023
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:04,629
the scientific community was i mean and
uh you know

6024
01:52:04,629 --> 01:52:04,639
uh you know
 

6025
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:08,390
uh you know
even just judging uh on on this

6026
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:08,400
even just judging uh on on this
 

6027
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,030
even just judging uh on on this
very narrow domain of you know uh

6028
01:52:11,030 --> 01:52:11,040
very narrow domain of you know uh
 

6029
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,229
very narrow domain of you know uh
protein structure

6030
01:52:12,229 --> 01:52:12,239
protein structure
 

6031
01:52:12,239 --> 01:52:15,669
protein structure
and understanding the structural uh

6032
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:15,679
and understanding the structural uh
 

6033
01:52:15,679 --> 01:52:17,589
and understanding the structural uh
characterization of of this virus from

6034
01:52:17,589 --> 01:52:17,599
characterization of of this virus from
 

6035
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:19,189
characterization of of this virus from
the components point of view of the

6036
01:52:19,189 --> 01:52:19,199
the components point of view of the
 

6037
01:52:19,199 --> 01:52:21,910
the components point of view of the
you know whole wireless point of view

6038
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:21,920
you know whole wireless point of view
 

6039
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:22,870
you know whole wireless point of view
you know

6040
01:52:22,870 --> 01:52:22,880
you know
 

6041
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:25,990
you know
if you look at at sars right

6042
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:26,000
if you look at at sars right
 

6043
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,270
if you look at at sars right
the the something that happened you know

6044
01:52:29,270 --> 01:52:29,280
the the something that happened you know
 

6045
01:52:29,280 --> 01:52:32,149
the the something that happened you know
oh less than 20 but you know close

6046
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:32,159
oh less than 20 but you know close
 

6047
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:32,790
oh less than 20 but you know close
enough

6048
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:32,800
enough
 

6049
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,310
enough
20 years ago and you see what

6050
01:52:36,310 --> 01:52:36,320
20 years ago and you see what
 

6051
01:52:36,320 --> 01:52:38,629
20 years ago and you see what
you know when it happened you know what

6052
01:52:38,629 --> 01:52:38,639
you know when it happened you know what
 

6053
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:40,470
you know when it happened you know what
was sort of the response to

6054
01:52:40,470 --> 01:52:40,480
was sort of the response to
 

6055
01:52:40,480 --> 01:52:43,030
was sort of the response to
by the scientific community you see that

6056
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,040
by the scientific community you see that
 

6057
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,189
by the scientific community you see that
the the structure characterizations

6058
01:52:45,189 --> 01:52:45,199
the the structure characterizations
 

6059
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:49,109
the the structure characterizations
did a cure but it took

6060
01:52:49,109 --> 01:52:49,119
did a cure but it took
 

6061
01:52:49,119 --> 01:52:52,550
did a cure but it took
several years right now

6062
01:52:52,550 --> 01:52:52,560
several years right now
 

6063
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,030
several years right now
the things that took several years it's

6064
01:52:55,030 --> 01:52:55,040
the things that took several years it's
 

6065
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,470
the things that took several years it's
a matter of months

6066
01:52:56,470 --> 01:52:56,480
a matter of months
 

6067
01:52:56,480 --> 01:52:58,950
a matter of months
right so so we we see that you know the

6068
01:52:58,950 --> 01:52:58,960
right so so we we see that you know the
 

6069
01:52:58,960 --> 01:52:59,990
right so so we we see that you know the
the the

6070
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:00,000
the the
 

6071
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,550
the the
research pop up we are at the

6072
01:53:02,550 --> 01:53:02,560
research pop up we are at the
 

6073
01:53:02,560 --> 01:53:04,709
research pop up we are at the
unprecedented level in terms of the

6074
01:53:04,709 --> 01:53:04,719
unprecedented level in terms of the
 

6075
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:05,589
unprecedented level in terms of the
sequencing

6076
01:53:05,589 --> 01:53:05,599
sequencing
 

6077
01:53:05,599 --> 01:53:08,870
sequencing
right never uh before we had

6078
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:08,880
right never uh before we had
 

6079
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:13,910
right never uh before we had
a single virus sequence so many times

6080
01:53:13,910 --> 01:53:13,920
a single virus sequence so many times
 

6081
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:16,950
a single virus sequence so many times
you know so which allows us to actually

6082
01:53:16,950 --> 01:53:16,960
you know so which allows us to actually
 

6083
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,390
you know so which allows us to actually
to trace very precisely

6084
01:53:20,390 --> 01:53:20,400
to trace very precisely
 

6085
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:23,589
to trace very precisely
the sort of the evolutionary

6086
01:53:23,589 --> 01:53:23,599
the sort of the evolutionary
 

6087
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:25,990
the sort of the evolutionary
nature of this virus what happens and

6088
01:53:25,990 --> 01:53:26,000
nature of this virus what happens and
 

6089
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:27,030
nature of this virus what happens and
it's not just

6090
01:53:27,030 --> 01:53:27,040
it's not just
 

6091
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:30,870
it's not just
the you know this virus independently

6092
01:53:30,870 --> 01:53:30,880
the you know this virus independently
 

6093
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,910
the you know this virus independently
of everything is you know it's the you

6094
01:53:33,910 --> 01:53:33,920
of everything is you know it's the you
 

6095
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,910
of everything is you know it's the you
know the the sequence of this virus

6096
01:53:35,910 --> 01:53:35,920
know the the sequence of this virus
 

6097
01:53:35,920 --> 01:53:38,470
know the the sequence of this virus
linked anchored to the specific

the
our genotype influences also

6106
01:53:46,709 --> 01:53:46,719
our genotype influences also
 

6107
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:48,550
our genotype influences also
you know the the evolution of this you

6108
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:48,560
you know the the evolution of this you
 

6109
01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:50,070
you know the the evolution of this you
know it's it's always a

6110
01:53:50,070 --> 01:53:50,080
know it's it's always a
 

6111
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,430
know it's it's always a
horse pathogen co evolution that that

6112
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
horse pathogen co evolution that that
 

6113
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:56,310
horse pathogen co evolution that that
you know occurs it'd be cool if we also

6114
01:53:56,310 --> 01:53:56,320
you know occurs it'd be cool if we also
 

6115
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:56,870
you know occurs it'd be cool if we also
had

6116
01:53:56,870 --> 01:53:56,880
had
 

6117
01:53:56,880 --> 01:53:59,589
had
a lot more data about sort of the spread

6118
01:53:59,589 --> 01:53:59,599
a lot more data about sort of the spread
 

6119
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,189
a lot more data about sort of the spread
of this virus

6120
01:54:01,189 --> 01:54:01,199
of this virus
 

6121
01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:04,950
of this virus
not maybe well it'd be nice if we had it

6122
01:54:04,950 --> 01:54:04,960
not maybe well it'd be nice if we had it
 

6123
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:06,950
not maybe well it'd be nice if we had it
for like contact tracing purposes

6124
01:54:06,950 --> 01:54:06,960
for like contact tracing purposes
 

6125
01:54:06,960 --> 01:54:08,950
for like contact tracing purposes
for this virus but it would be also nice

6126
01:54:08,950 --> 01:54:08,960
for this virus but it would be also nice
 

6127
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,870
for this virus but it would be also nice
if we had it for the study for future

6128
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:10,880
if we had it for the study for future
 

6129
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,750
if we had it for the study for future
viruses

6130
01:54:11,750 --> 01:54:11,760
viruses
 

6131
01:54:11,760 --> 01:54:14,149
viruses
to be able to respond and so on but it's

6132
01:54:14,149 --> 01:54:14,159
to be able to respond and so on but it's
 

6133
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:15,589
to be able to respond and so on but it's
already nice that we have geographical

6134
01:54:15,589 --> 01:54:15,599
already nice that we have geographical
 

6135
01:54:15,599 --> 01:54:16,229
already nice that we have geographical
data and the

6136
01:54:16,229 --> 01:54:16,239
data and the
 

6137
01:54:16,239 --> 01:54:18,390
data and the
basic data from individual humans yeah

6138
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:18,400
basic data from individual humans yeah
 

6139
01:54:18,400 --> 01:54:19,669
basic data from individual humans yeah
exactly i know i think

6140
01:54:19,669 --> 01:54:19,679
exactly i know i think
 

6141
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:22,790
exactly i know i think
context racing is is is obviously

6142
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800
context racing is is is obviously
 

6143
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:26,390
context racing is is is obviously
a key uh component in understanding

6144
01:54:26,390 --> 01:54:26,400
a key uh component in understanding
 

6145
01:54:26,400 --> 01:54:29,589
a key uh component in understanding
the spread of this virus uh we there is

6146
01:54:29,589 --> 01:54:29,599
the spread of this virus uh we there is
 

6147
01:54:29,599 --> 01:54:31,430
the spread of this virus uh we there is
also there is a number of challenges

6148
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:31,440
also there is a number of challenges
 

6149
01:54:31,440 --> 01:54:32,790
also there is a number of challenges
right so xprice

6150
01:54:32,790 --> 01:54:32,800
right so xprice
 

6151
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,149
right so xprice
is one of them we we you know uh

6152
01:54:36,149 --> 01:54:36,159
is one of them we we you know uh
 

6153
01:54:36,159 --> 01:54:39,270
is one of them we we you know uh
just recently the you know took a part

6154
01:54:39,270 --> 01:54:39,280
just recently the you know took a part
 

6155
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:39,669
just recently the you know took a part
of

6156
01:54:39,669 --> 01:54:39,679
of
 

6157
01:54:39,679 --> 01:54:42,149
of
this competition it's the prediction of

6158
01:54:42,149 --> 01:54:42,159
this competition it's the prediction of
 

6159
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:42,870
this competition it's the prediction of
the

6160
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:42,880
the
 

6161
01:54:42,880 --> 01:54:45,990
the
uh of the uh number of

6162
01:54:45,990 --> 01:54:46,000
uh of the uh number of
 

6163
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,350
uh of the uh number of
infections in different regions so

6164
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:49,360
infections in different regions so
 

6165
01:54:49,360 --> 01:54:52,550
infections in different regions so
and you know obviously the the ai

6166
01:54:52,550 --> 01:54:52,560
and you know obviously the the ai
 

6167
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:56,149
and you know obviously the the ai
is the main topic in those predictions

6168
01:54:56,149 --> 01:54:56,159
is the main topic in those predictions
 

6169
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:58,870
is the main topic in those predictions
yeah but it's still the data i mean

6170
01:54:58,870 --> 01:54:58,880
yeah but it's still the data i mean
 

6171
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:01,910
yeah but it's still the data i mean
that's that's a competition but the

6172
01:55:01,910 --> 01:55:01,920
that's that's a competition but the
 

6173
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:05,669
that's that's a competition but the
the data is weak on the training

6174
01:55:05,669 --> 01:55:05,679
the data is weak on the training
 

6175
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:08,310
the data is weak on the training
like it's it's great it's much more than

6176
01:55:08,310 --> 01:55:08,320
like it's it's great it's much more than
 

6177
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:09,830
like it's it's great it's much more than
probably before but like

6178
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:09,840
probably before but like
 

6179
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,390
probably before but like
it would be nice if it was like really

6180
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:12,400
it would be nice if it was like really
 

6181
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:12,950
it would be nice if it was like really
rich i

6182
01:55:12,950 --> 01:55:12,960
rich i
 

6183
01:55:12,960 --> 01:55:15,510
rich i
i i talked to michael mina from uh from

6184
01:55:15,510 --> 01:55:15,520
i i talked to michael mina from uh from
 

6185
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:16,629
i i talked to michael mina from uh from
harvard

6186
01:55:16,629 --> 01:55:16,639
harvard
 

6187
01:55:16,639 --> 01:55:18,229
harvard
i mean he dreams that the community

6188
01:55:18,229 --> 01:55:18,239
i mean he dreams that the community
 

6189
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:20,390
i mean he dreams that the community
comes together with like a weather map

6190
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:20,400
comes together with like a weather map
 

6191
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:23,510
comes together with like a weather map
to wear of viruses right like

6192
01:55:23,510 --> 01:55:23,520
to wear of viruses right like
 

6193
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,030
to wear of viruses right like
really high resolution sensors on like

6194
01:55:27,030 --> 01:55:27,040
really high resolution sensors on like
 

6195
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:29,350
really high resolution sensors on like
how from person to person the viruses

6196
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:29,360
how from person to person the viruses
 

6197
01:55:29,360 --> 01:55:30,709
how from person to person the viruses
that travel all the different kinds of

6198
01:55:30,709 --> 01:55:30,719
that travel all the different kinds of
 

6199
01:55:30,719 --> 01:55:32,550
that travel all the different kinds of
viruses right because there's

6200
01:55:32,550 --> 01:55:32,560
viruses right because there's
 

6201
01:55:32,560 --> 01:55:34,709
viruses right because there's
there's there's a ton of them and then

6202
01:55:34,709 --> 01:55:34,719
there's there's a ton of them and then
 

6203
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,709
there's there's a ton of them and then
you'll be able to tell the story

6204
01:55:36,709 --> 01:55:36,719
you'll be able to tell the story
 

6205
01:55:36,719 --> 01:55:39,669
you'll be able to tell the story
that uh you've spoken about of the

6206
01:55:39,669 --> 01:55:39,679
that uh you've spoken about of the
 

6207
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:41,350
that uh you've spoken about of the
evolution of these viruses like

6208
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:41,360
evolution of these viruses like
 

6209
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:42,470
evolution of these viruses like
day-to-day

6210
01:55:42,470 --> 01:55:42,480
day-to-day
 

6211
01:55:42,480 --> 01:55:44,950
day-to-day
mutations that are occurring i mean that

6212
01:55:44,950 --> 01:55:44,960
mutations that are occurring i mean that
 

6213
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:45,990
mutations that are occurring i mean that
would be fascinating

6214
01:55:45,990 --> 01:55:46,000
would be fascinating
 

6215
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:48,950
would be fascinating
just uh from perspective study and from

6216
01:55:48,950 --> 01:55:48,960
just uh from perspective study and from
 

6217
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:50,470
just uh from perspective study and from
the perspective of being able to respond

6218
01:55:50,470 --> 01:55:50,480
the perspective of being able to respond
 

6219
01:55:50,480 --> 01:55:52,149
the perspective of being able to respond
to future pandemics that's ultimately

6220
01:55:52,149 --> 01:55:52,159
to future pandemics that's ultimately
 

6221

ideas are incredible
um even nowadays you know so so he tried

6602
02:03:19,750 --> 02:03:19,760
um even nowadays you know so so he tried
 

6603
02:03:19,760 --> 02:03:21,350
um even nowadays you know so so he tried
to put the parallels

6604
02:03:21,350 --> 02:03:21,360
to put the parallels
 

6605
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:25,109
to put the parallels
between the brain computing power

6606
02:03:25,109 --> 02:03:25,119
between the brain computing power
 

6607
02:03:25,119 --> 02:03:28,310
between the brain computing power
the neural system and the computers

6608
02:03:28,310 --> 02:03:28,320
the neural system and the computers
 

6609
02:03:28,320 --> 02:03:30,709
the neural system and the computers
you know as they were here he was

6610
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:30,719
you know as they were here he was
 

6611
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:32,229
you know as they were here he was
working on this like approximately

6612
02:03:32,229 --> 02:03:32,239
working on this like approximately
 

6613
02:03:32,239 --> 02:03:35,990
working on this like approximately
57 57. so so that was right during his

6614
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,000
57 57. so so that was right during his
 

6615
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:37,669
57 57. so so that was right during his
you know when he was diagnosed with
