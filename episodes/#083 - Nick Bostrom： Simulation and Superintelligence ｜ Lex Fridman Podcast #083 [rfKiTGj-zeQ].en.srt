166
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:25,500
advanced civilization who built a lot of
 

167
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,059
advanced civilization who built a lot of
computers and that what we experience is

168
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:29,069
computers and that what we experience is
 

169
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:32,870
computers and that what we experience is
an effect of what's going on inside one

an effect of what's going on inside one
 

171
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,699
an effect of what's going on inside one
of those computers so that the the world

of those computers so that the the world
 

173
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:38,090
of those computers so that the the world
around us our own brains everything we

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,010
certain programs do you think of this

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,270
certain programs do you think of this
computer as something similar to the

00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:09,780
much more complicated something much
 

197
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,780
much more complicated something much
more mysterious from our current

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:11,790
more mysterious from our current
 

199
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,640
more mysterious from our current

you'd need more memory and more

204
00:04:17,599 --> 00:04:17,609
you'd need more memory and more
 

205
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:19,550
you'd need more memory and more
processing power I don't think anything

206
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:19,560
processing power I don't think anything
 

207
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,400

that would give them even more

00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,240
that would give them even more
 

215
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,550
that would give them even more
implausible but I don't think it's a

00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:31,560
implausible but I don't think it's a
 

217
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,710
implausible but I don't think it's a

these kinds of computer simulations with

00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:44,139
these kinds of computer simulations with
 

225
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:46,890
these kinds of computer simulations with
conscious beings inside them so do you

226
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:46,900
conscious beings inside them so do you
 

227
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,770
conscious beings inside them so do you
think the simulation hypothesis is an

228
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:49,780
think the simulation hypothesis is an
 

229
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,890
think the simulation hypothesis is an
idea that's most useful in philosophy

230
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:51,900
idea that's most useful in philosophy
 

231
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,679
idea that's most useful in philosophy
computer science physics sort of where

232
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:55,689
computer science physics sort of where
 

233
00:04:55,689 --> 00:05:00,830
computer science physics sort of where
do you see it having valuable kind of

234
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:00,840
do you see it having valuable kind of
 

235
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,450
do you see it having valuable kind of

thought experiment of it is it useful I

238
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:06,069
thought experiment of it is it useful I
 

239
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:10,559
thought experiment of it is it useful I
guess it's more in in informative and

240
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:10,569
guess it's more in in informative and
 

241
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:14,040
guess it's more in in informative and
interesting and maybe important it's not

242
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,050
interesting and maybe important it's not
 

243
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,080
interesting and maybe important it's not

designed to be useful for something else
 

245
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,670
designed to be useful for something else
okay interesting

246
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:17,680
okay interesting
 

247
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,649
okay interesting
sure but is it philosophically

248
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:19,659
sure but is it philosophically
 

249
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:22,439
sure but is it philosophically
interesting or is there some kind of

250
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:22,449
interesting or is there some kind of
 

251
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:23,879
interesting or is there some kind of
implications of computer science and

252
00:05:23,879 --> 00:05:23,889
implications of computer science and
 

253
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,300
implications of computer science and
physics I think not so much for computer

254
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:27,310
physics I think not so much for computer
 

255
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,610
physics I think not so much for computer
science or physics per se certainly it

256
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:29,620
science or physics per se certainly it
 

257
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,189
science or physics per se certainly it
would be of interest in philosophy I

258
00:05:32,189 --> 00:05:32,199
would be of interest in philosophy I
 

259
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,170
would be of interest in philosophy I
think also to say cosmology or physics

260
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:37,180
think also to say cosmology or physics
 

261
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,869
think also to say cosmology or physics
in as much as you're interested in the

262
00:05:39,869 --> 00:05:39,879
in as much as you're interested in the
 

263
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,749
in as much as you're interested in the
fundamental building blocks of the world

264
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:42,759
fundamental building blocks of the world
 

265
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:46,170
fundamental building blocks of the world
and the rules that govern it and if we

266
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,180
and the rules that govern it and if we
 

267
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,519
and the rules that govern it and if we
are in a simulation there is then the

268
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:47,529
are in a simulation there is then the
 

269
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,219
are in a simulation there is then the
possibility that say physics at the

270
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:50,229
possibility that say physics at the
 

271
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:52,140
possibility that say physics at the
level were the computer running the

272
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,150
level were the computer running the
 

273
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,709
level were the computer running the
simulation could could be different from

274
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:55,719
simulation could could be different from
 

275
00:05:55,719 --> 00:05:58,379
simulation could could be different from
the physics governing phenomena in the

276
00:05:58,379 --> 00:05:58,389
the physics governing phenomena in the
 

277
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:01,589
the physics governing phenomena in the
simulation so I think might be

278
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:01,599
simulation so I think might be
 

279
00:06:01,599 --> 00:06:03,619
simulation so I think might be
interesting from point of view of

280
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:03,629
interesting from point of view of
 

281
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,059
interesting from point of view of
religion or just from for a kind of

282
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:06,069
religion or just from for a kind of
 

283
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:07,800
religion or just from for a kind of
trying to figure out what what the heck

284
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:07,810
trying to figure out what what the heck
 

285
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,140
trying to figure out what what the heck
is going on so we mentioned the

286
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,150
is going on so we mentioned the
 

287
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,820
is going on so we mentioned the
simulation hypothesis so far there is

288
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:14,830
simulation hypothesis so far there is
 

289
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:17,899
simulation hypothesis so far there is
also the simulation argument which I

290
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:17,909
also the simulation argument which I
 

291
00:06:17,909 --> 00:06:20,279
also the simulation argument which I
tend to make a distinction so simulation

292
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:20,289
tend to make a distinction so simulation
 

293
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:21,779
tend to make a distinction so simulation
hypothesis we are living in a computer

295
00:06:21,789 --> 00:06:23,700
hypothesis we are living in a computer
simulation simulation argument this

296
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:23,710
simulation simulation argument this
 

297
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,189
simulation simulation argument this
argument that tries to show that one of

298
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:26,199
argument that tries to show that one of
 

299
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:28,409
argument that tries to show that one of
three propositions is true one of which

300
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:28,419
three propositions is true one of which
 

301
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:31,050
three propositions is true one of which
is the simulation hypothesis but there

302
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:31,060
is the simulation hypothesis but there
 

303
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,559
is the simulation hypothesis but there
are two alternatives in the original

304
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:34,569
are two alternatives in the original
 

305
00:06:34,569 --> 00:06:36,179
are two alternatives in the original
simulation argument which which we can

306
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:36,189
simulation argument which which we can
 

307
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,070
simulation argument which which we can
get to yeah let's go there by the way

308
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:38,080
get to yeah let's go there by the way
 

309
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,700
get to yeah let's go there by the way
confusing terms Picasa people will I

310
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:41,710
confusing terms Picasa people will I
 

311
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,899
confusing terms Picasa people will I

simulation argument equals simulation

314
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:44,650
simulation argument equals simulation
 

315
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,159
simulation argument equals simulation
hypothesis just terminology wise but

316
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:47,169
hypothesis just terminology wise but
 

317
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,230
hypothesis just terminology wise but
let's go there so simulation hypothesis

318
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:49,240
let's go there so simulation hypothesis
 

319
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,540
let's go there so simulation hypothesis
means that we are living in simulations

320
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:51,550
means that we are living in simulations
 

321
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:53,010
means that we are living in simulations
the hypothesis that we're living in

322
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:53,020
the hypothesis that we're living in
 

323
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:55,109
the hypothesis that we're living in
simulation simulation argument has the

324
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:55,119
simulation simulation argument has the
 

325
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:59,100
simulation simulation argument has the
three complete possibilities that cover

326
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,110
three complete possibilities that cover
 

327
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,469
three complete possibilities that cover
all possibilities so what yeah so it's

328
00:07:01,469 --> 00:07:01,479
all possibilities so what yeah so it's
 

329
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,149
all possibilities so what yeah so it's
like a disjunction it says at least one

330
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:03,159
like a disjunction it says at least one
 

331
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:06,629
like a disjunction it says at least one
of these three is true yeah although it

332
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:06,639
of these three is true yeah although it
 

333
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,799
of these three is true yeah although it
doesn't on its own tell us which one so

334
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:10,809
doesn't on its own tell us which one so
 

335
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:14,149
doesn't on its own tell us which one so
the first one is that almost all

336
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:14,159
the first one is that almost all
 

337
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,319
the first one is that almost all
civilizations at our current stage of

338
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:16,329
civilizations at our current stage of
 

339
00:07:16,329 --> 00:07:19,979
civilizations at our current stage of
technological development go extinct

340
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:19,989
technological development go extinct
 

341
00:07:19,989 --> 00:07:22,850
technological development go extinct
before they reach technological maturity

342
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:22,860
before they reach technological maturity
 

343
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,049
before they reach technological maturity
so there is some great filter that makes

344
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:28,059
so there is some great filter that makes
 

345
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:33,749
so there is some great filter that makes
it so that basically none of the

346
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
it so that basically none of the
 

347
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,729
it so that basically none of the
civilizations throughout you know maybe

348
00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:35,739
civilizations throughout you know maybe
 

349
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:39,359
civilizations throughout you know maybe
vast cosmos will ever get to realize the

350
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:39,369
vast cosmos will ever get to realize the
 

351
00:07:39,369 --> 00:07:42,119
vast cosmos will ever get to realize the
full potential of technological develop

352
00:07:42,119 --> 00:07:42,129
full potential of technological develop
 

353
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,429
full potential of technological develop
and this could be theoretically speaking

354
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:44,439
and this could be theoretically speaking
 

355
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,699
and this could be theoretically speaking
this could be because most civilizations

356
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:46,709
this could be because most civilizations
 

357
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:49,799
this could be because most civilizations
kill themselves too eagerly or destroy

358
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:49,809
kill themselves too eagerly or destroy
 

359
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:52,229
kill themselves too eagerly or destroy
themselves early or it might be super

360
00:07:52,229 --> 00:07:52,239
themselves early or it might be super
 

361
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:55,379
themselves early or it might be super
difficult to build a simulation so the

362
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:55,389
difficult to build a simulation so the
 

363
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:57,659
difficult to build a simulation so the
the span of time theoretically it could

364
00:07:57,659 --> 00:07:57,669
the span of time theoretically it could
 

365
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,350
the span of time theoretically it could
be both now I think it looks like we

366
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:00,360
be both now I think it looks like we
 

367
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,819
be both now I think it looks like we
would technically be able to get there

368
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:02,829
would technically be able to get there
 

369
00:08:02,829 --> 00:08:06,799
would technically be able to get there
in a time span that is short compared to

370
00:08:06,799 --> 00:08:06,809
in a time span that is short compared to
 

371
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,859
in a time span that is short compared to
say the lifetime of planets and other

372
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:10,869
say the lifetime of planets and other
 

373
00:08:10,869 --> 00:08:13,949
say the lifetime of planets and other
sort of astronomical processes so your

374
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:13,959
sort of astronomical processes so your
 

375
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,069
sort of astronomical processes so your
intuition is the build simulation is not

376
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:16,079
intuition is the build simulation is not
 

377
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,359
intuition is the build simulation is not
well so this is interesting concept of

378
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:18,369
well so this is interesting concept of
 

379
00:08:18,369 --> 00:08:21,659
well so this is interesting concept of
technological maturity it's kind of an

380
00:08:21,659 --> 00:08:21,669
technological maturity it's kind of an
 

381
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:23,069
technological maturity it's kind of an
interesting concept to have other

382
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:23,079
interesting concept to have other
 

383
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,579
interesting concept to have other
purposes as well we can see even based

384
00:08:26,579 --> 00:08:26,589
purposes as well we can see even based
 

385
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,859
purposes as well we can see even based
on our current limited understanding

what is it technological matures well
 

581
00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:29,119
what is it technological matures well
yeah so that mean it's a strong concept

582
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:29,129
yeah so that mean it's a strong concept
 

583
00:12:29,129 --> 00:12:30,740
yeah so that mean it's a strong concept
and we really need for the simulation

584
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:30,750
and we really need for the simulation

00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,879
and we really need for the simulation
hypothesis I just think it's interesting

00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:31,889
hypothesis I just think it's interesting
 

587
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,879
hypothesis I just think it's interesting
in its own right so it would be the idea

588
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:34,889
in its own right so it would be the idea
 

589
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:37,610
in its own right so it would be the idea
that there is some stage of

that there is some stage of
 

591
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,840
that there is some stage of
technological development for you

592
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:38,850
technological development for you
 

593
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:41,540
technological development for you
basically maxed out that you developed

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,550
basically maxed out that you developed
 

595
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:44,809
basically maxed out that you developed
all those general-purpose widely useful

596
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:44,819
all those general-purpose widely useful
 

597
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:47,150
all those general-purpose widely useful
technologies that could be developed or

598
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:47,160
technologies that could be developed or
 

599
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,309
technologies that could be developed or
at least kind of come very close to the

600
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:49,319
at least kind of come very close to the
 

601
00:12:49,319 --> 00:12:51,769
at least kind of come very close to the
my you know 99.9 percent there or

602
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:51,779
my you know 99.9 percent there or
 

603
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,350
my you know 99.9 percent there or
something so that's that's that's an

604
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:54,360
something so that's that's that's an
 

605
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,240
something so that's that's that's an
independent question you can think

606
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,250
independent question you can think
 

607
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,799
independent question you can think
either that there is such a ceiling or

608
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:57,809
either that there is such a ceiling or
 

609
00:12:57,809 --> 00:12:59,569
either that there is such a ceiling or
you might think it just goes the

610
00:12:59,569 --> 00:12:59,579
you might think it just goes the
 

611
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,850
you might think it just goes the
technology tree just goes on forever

612
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:01,860

where where is your sense for I would

614
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:05,129
where where is your sense for I would
 

615
00:13:05,129 --> 00:13:07,369
where where is your sense for I would
guess that there is I I'm a maximum that

616
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:07,379
guess that there is I I'm a maximum that
 

617
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:10,040
guess that there is I I'm a maximum that
you would start to asymptotes towards so

618
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,050
you would start to asymptotes towards so
 

619
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:12,829
you would start to asymptotes towards so
new things won't keep springing up new

620
00:13:12,829 --> 00:13:12,839
new things won't keep springing up new
 

621
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:15,249
new things won't keep springing up new
ceilings in terms of basic technological

622
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:15,259
ceilings in terms of basic technological
 

623
00:13:15,259 --> 00:13:17,660
ceilings in terms of basic technological
capabilities I think that yeah there's

624
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:17,670
capabilities I think that yeah there's
 

625
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,780
capabilities I think that yeah there's
like a finite set of those that can

626
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:20,790
like a finite set of those that can
 

627
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:24,139
like a finite set of those that can
exist in this universe more of our I

628
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:24,149
exist in this universe more of our I
 

629
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,470
exist in this universe more of our I
mean I wouldn't be that surprised if we

630
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:27,480
mean I wouldn't be that surprised if we
 

631
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,689
mean I wouldn't be that surprised if we
actually reached close to that level

632
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:29,699
actually reached close to that level
 

633
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:32,389
actually reached close to that level
fairly shortly after we have say machine

634
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:32,399
fairly shortly after we have say machine
 

635
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,850
fairly shortly after we have say machine
super intelligence so I don't think it

636
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:34,860
super intelligence so I don't think it
 

637
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:35,600
super intelligence so I don't think it
would take million

638
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,610
would take million
 

639
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:39,050
would take million
of years for a human originating

640
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,060
of years for a human originating
 

641
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,440

civilization to begin to do this it

642
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:42,450
civilization to begin to do this it
 

643
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,540
civilization to begin to do this it
think it's like more more likely to

644
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:44,550
think it's like more more likely to
 

645
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:47,060
think it's like more more likely to
happen on historical timescales but that

646
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,070
happen on historical timescales but that
 

647
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,370
happen on historical timescales but that
that's that's an independent speculation

648
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:49,380
that's that's an independent speculation
 

649
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,800
that's that's an independent speculation
from the simulation argument I mean for

650
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:51,810
from the simulation argument I mean for
 

651
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,110
from the simulation argument I mean for
the purpose of the simulation argument

652
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:53,120
the purpose of the simulation argument
 

653
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,660
the purpose of the simulation argument
it doesn't really matter whether it goes

654
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:55,670
it doesn't really matter whether it goes
 

655
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,769
it doesn't really matter whether it goes
indefinitely far up or whether there is

656
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:57,779
indefinitely far up or whether there is
 

657
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,480
indefinitely far up or whether there is
a ceiling as long as we know we could at

658
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,490
a ceiling as long as we know we could at
 

659
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,180
a ceiling as long as we know we could at
least get to a certain level and it also

660
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:02,190
least get to a certain level and it also
 

661
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,500
least get to a certain level and it also
doesn't matter whether that's gonna

662
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:03,510
doesn't matter whether that's gonna
 

663
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,930
doesn't matter whether that's gonna
happen in a hundred years or five

664
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:05,940
happen in a hundred years or five
 

665
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,509
happen in a hundred years or five
thousand years or 50 million years like

666
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:08,519
thousand years or 50 million years like
 

667
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,850
thousand years or 50 million years like
the timescales really don't make any

668
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:10,860
the timescales really don't make any
 

669
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,920
the timescales really don't make any
difference for the ceilin garna a little

670
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:12,930
difference for the ceilin garna a little
 

671
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,480
difference for the ceilin garna a little
bit like there's a big difference

672
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:14,490
bit like there's a big difference
 

673
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:18,050
bit like there's a big difference
between a hundred years and ten million

674
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:18,060
between a hundred years and ten million
 

675
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,389
between a hundred years and ten million
years you know so it doesn't really not

676
00:14:20,389 --> 00:14:20,399
years you know so it doesn't really not
 

677
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,380
years you know so it doesn't really not
matter because you just said this is a

678
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,390
matter because you just said this is a
 

679
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,569
matter because you just said this is a
matter if we jump scales to beyond

680
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:26,579
matter if we jump scales to beyond
 

681
00:14:26,579 --> 00:14:30,110
matter if we jump scales to beyond
historical skills so we described that

682
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:30,120
historical skills so we described that
 

683
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,240
historical skills so we described that
so for the simulation argument sort of

684
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,250
so for the simulation argument sort of
 

685
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:39,769
so for the simulation argument sort of
doesn't it matter that we if it takes

686
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:39,779
doesn't it matter that we if it takes
 

687
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,990
doesn't it matter that we if it takes
ten million years it gives us a lot more

688
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,000
ten million years it gives us a lot more
 

689
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,090
ten million years it gives us a lot more
opportunity to destroy civilization in

690
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,100
opportunity to destroy civilization in
 

691
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,590
opportunity to destroy civilization in
the mean time yeah well so it would

692
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:45,600
the mean time yeah well so it would
 

693
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,420
the mean time yeah well so it would
shift around the probabilities between

694
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:47,430
shift around the probabilities between
 

695
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:51,170
shift around the probabilities between
these three alternatives that is if we

696
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,180
these three alternatives that is if we
 

697
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:53,240
these three alternatives that is if we
are very very far away from being able

698
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:53,250
are very very far away from being able
 

699
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,040
are very very far away from being able
to create these simulations if it's like

700
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,050
to create these simulations if it's like
 

701
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,540
to create these simulations if it's like
say the billions of years into the

702
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:56,550
say the billions of years into the
 

703
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,699
say the billions of years into the
future then it's more likely that we

704
00:14:58,699 --> 00:14:58,709
future then it's more likely that we
 

705
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:00,350
future then it's more likely that we
will fail ever to get there they're more

706
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:00,360
will fail ever to get there they're more
 

707
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,050
will fail ever to get there they're more
time for us to kind of you know give go

708
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,060
time for us to kind of you know give go
 

709
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,150
time for us to kind of you know give go
extinct along the way and similarly for

710
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,160
extinct along the way and similarly for
 

711
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,100
extinct along the way and similarly for
other civilizations so it's important to

712
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,110
other civilizations so it's important to
 

713
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,720
other civilizations so it's important to
think about how hard it is to build

714
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:08,730
think about how hard it is to build
 

715
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,810
think about how hard it is to build
simulation from in terms of yeah

716
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:11,820
simulation from in terms of yeah
 

717
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,759
simulation from in terms of yeah
figuring out which of the disk jockeys

718
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:13,769
figuring out which of the disk jockeys
 

719
00:15:13,769 --> 00:15:16,069
figuring out which of the disk jockeys
but for the simulation argument itself

720
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:16,079
but for the simulation argument itself
 

721
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,530
but for the simulation argument itself
which is agnostic as to which of these

722
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:18,540
which is agnostic as to which of these
 

723
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,380
which is agnostic as to which of these
three alternatives is true okay it's

724
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:21,390
three alternatives is true okay it's
 

725
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,939
three alternatives is true okay it's
like you don't have to sit like this

726
00:15:22,939 --> 00:15:22,949
like you don't have to sit like this
 

727
00:15:22,949 --> 00:15:24,680
like you don't have to sit like this
immolation argument would be true

728
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:24,690
immolation argument would be true
 

729
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:27,139
immolation argument would be true
whether or not we thought this could be

730
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:27,149
whether or not we thought this could be
 

731
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,670
whether or not we thought this could be
done in five hundred years or it would

732
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:28,680
done in five hundred years or it would
 

733
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,259
done in five hundred years or it would
take five hundred million years so for

734
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:30,269
take five hundred million years so for
 

735
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:31,910
take five hundred million years so for
sure the simulation argument stands I'm

736
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:31,920
sure the simulation argument stands I'm
 

737
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,560
sure the simulation argument stands I'm
sure there might be some people who

738
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:33,570
sure there might be some people who
 

739
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,319
sure there might be some people who
oppose it but it doesn't matter I mean

740
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:36,329
oppose it but it doesn't matter I mean
 

741
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:38,930
oppose it but it doesn't matter I mean
it's it's very nice those three cases

742
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:38,940
it's it's very nice those three cases
 

743
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,689
it's it's very nice those three cases
covered but the fun part is at least not

744
00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:41,699
covered but the fun part is at least not
 

745
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,699
covered but the fun part is at least not
saying what the probabilities are but

746
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:43,709
saying what the probabilities are but
 

747
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:45,949
saying what the probabilities are but
kind of thinking about kind of intuitive

748
00:15:45,949 --> 00:15:45,959
kind of thinking about kind of intuitive
 

749
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,040
kind of thinking about kind of intuitive
reasoning about what's more likely what

750
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:49,050
reasoning about what's more likely what
 

751
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,759
reasoning about what's more likely what
what

752
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:49,769
what
 

753
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:51,679
what
the kind of things that would make some

754
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:51,689
the kind of things that would make some
 

755
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:53,840
the kind of things that would make some
of the arguments less and more so like

756
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:53,850
of the arguments less and more so like
 

757
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,059
of the arguments less and more so like
but let's actually I don't think we went

758
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:56,069
but let's actually I don't think we went
 

759
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:58,280
but let's actually I don't think we went
through them so number one is we destroy

760
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,290
through them so number one is we destroy
 

761
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,109
through them so number one is we destroy
ourselves before we ever create simulate

762
00:16:00,109 --> 00:16:00,119
ourselves before we ever create simulate
 

763
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:03,949
ourselves before we ever create simulate
right so that's kind of sad but we have

764
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:03,959
right so that's kind of sad but we have
 

765
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:06,439
right so that's kind of sad but we have
to think not just what what might

766
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:06,449
to think not just what what might
 

767
00:16:06,449 --> 00:16:08,780
to think not just what what might
destroy us I mean the day there could be

768
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,790
destroy us I mean the day there could be
 

769
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:12,079
destroy us I mean the day there could be
some whatever disastrous for me crowd

770
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:12,089
some whatever disastrous for me crowd
 

771
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:14,389
some whatever disastrous for me crowd
slamming the earth a few years from now

772
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:14,399
slamming the earth a few years from now
 

773
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,509
slamming the earth a few years from now
that that could destroy us right but

774
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:16,519
that that could destroy us right but
 

775
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:20,119
that that could destroy us right but
you'd have to postulate in order for

776
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:20,129
you'd have to postulate in order for
 

777
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:23,319
you'd have to postulate in order for
this first disjunct to be true that

778
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:23,329
this first disjunct to be true that
 

779
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:26,960
this first disjunct to be true that
almost all civilizations throughout the

780
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:26,970
almost all civilizations throughout the
 

781
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:30,139
almost all civilizations throughout the
cosmos also failed to reach

782
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:30,149
cosmos also failed to reach
 

783
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,329
cosmos also failed to reach
technological maturity and the

784
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:32,339
technological maturity and the
 

785
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,009
technological maturity and the
underlying assumption there is that

786
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:34,019
underlying assumption there is that
 

787
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,829
underlying assumption there is that
there is likely a very large number of

788
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:36,839
there is likely a very large number of
 

789
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:40,489
there is likely a very large number of
other intelligent civilizations well if

790
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:40,499
other intelligent civilizations well if
 

791
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,220
other intelligent civilizations well if
there are yeah then they would virtually

792
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,230
there are yeah then they would virtually
 

793
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:45,590
there are yeah then they would virtually
all have to succumb in the same way I

794
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:45,600
all have to succumb in the same way I
 

795
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,619
all have to succumb in the same way I
mean then that that leads off another I

796
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:48,629
mean then that that leads off another I
 

797
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:49,369
mean then that that leads off another I
guess there are a lot of little

798
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:49,379
guess there are a lot of little
 

799
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,889
guess there are a lot of little
digressions that you know there so there

800
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:51,899
digressions that you know there so there
 

801
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,230
digressions that you know there so there
yeah give me dragging us back there are

802
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:54,240
yeah give me dragging us back there are
 

803
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,449
yeah give me dragging us back there are
these there is a set of basic questions

804
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:56,459
these there is a set of basic questions
 

805
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:58,939
these there is a set of basic questions
that always come up in conversations

806
00:16:58,939 --> 00:16:58,949
that always come up in conversations
 

807
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:01,730
that always come up in conversations
with interesting people yeah like the

808
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:01,740
with interesting people yeah like the
 

809
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,789
with interesting people yeah like the
Fermi paradox like there's like you

810
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:04,799
Fermi paradox like there's like you
 

811
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,260
Fermi paradox like there's like you
could almost define whether person is

812
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:06,270
could almost define whether person is
 

813
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,389
could almost define whether person is
interesting whether they're at some

814
00:17:08,389 --> 00:17:08,399
interesting whether they're at some
 

815
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:09,649
interesting whether they're at some
point because there was a Fermi paradox

816
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:09,659
point because there was a Fermi paradox
 

817
00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:13,970
point because there was a Fermi paradox
comes up like well so forward it's worse

818
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:13,980
comes up like well so forward it's worse
 

819
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,189
comes up like well so forward it's worse
it looks to me that the universe is very

820
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:16,199
it looks to me that the universe is very
 

821
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:20,480
it looks to me that the universe is very
big I mean in fact according to the most

822
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,490
big I mean in fact according to the most
 

823
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,639
big I mean in fact according to the most
popular current cosmological theory is

824
00:17:22,639 --> 00:17:22,649
popular current cosmological theory is
 

825
00:17:22,649 --> 00:17:27,289
popular current cosmological theory is
infinitely big and so then it would

826
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:27,299
infinitely big and so then it would
 

827
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:28,970
infinitely big and so then it would
follow pretty trivially that that it

828
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:28,980
follow pretty trivially that that it
 

829
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:29,930
follow pretty trivially that that it
would contain a lot of other

830
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:29,940
would contain a lot of other
 

831
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:34,159
would contain a lot of other
civilizations in fact infinitely many if

832
00:17:34,159 --> 00:17:34,169
civilizations in fact infinitely many if
 

833
00:17:34,169 --> 00:17:36,620
civilizations in fact infinitely many if
you have some locals stochasticity and

834
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:36,630
you have some locals stochasticity and
 

835
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,990
you have some locals stochasticity and
infinitely many is like you know

836
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,000
infinitely many is like you know
 

837
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,820
infinitely many is like you know
infinitely many lumps of matter one next

838
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:40,830
infinitely many lumps of matter one next
 

839
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:41,870
infinitely many lumps of matter one next
to another there's a kind of random

840
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:41,880
to another there's a kind of random
 

841
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,610
to another there's a kind of random
stuff in each one then you're going to

842
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:43,620
stuff in each one then you're going to
 

843
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,950
stuff in each one then you're going to
get all possible outcomes with

844
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:45,960
get all possible outcomes with
 

845
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:51,019
get all possible outcomes with
probability one infinitely repeated so

846
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:51,029
probability one infinitely repeated so
 

847
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,340
probability one infinitely repeated so
so then then certainly that would be a

848
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,350
so then then certainly that would be a
 

849
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:55,519
so then then certainly that would be a
lot of extraterrestrials out there I'd

850
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:55,529
lot of extraterrestrials out there I'd
 

851
00:17:55,529 --> 00:17:57,529
lot of extraterrestrials out there I'd
maybe short of that if the universe is

852
00:17:57,529 --> 00:17:57,539
maybe short of that if the universe is
 

853
00:17:57,539 --> 00:17:59,389
maybe short of that if the universe is
very big there might be a finite but

854
00:17:59,389 --> 00:17:59,399
very big there might be a finite but
 

855
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:03,769
very big there might be a finite but
large number if we literally

856
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:03,779
large number if we literally
 

857
00:18:03,779 --> 00:18:07,459
large number if we literally
one yet and then of course if we went

858
00:18:07,459 --> 00:18:07,469
one yet and then of course if we went
 

859
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:10,940
one yet and then of course if we went
extinct then all of civilizations at our

860
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:10,950
extinct then all of civilizations at our
 

861
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,950
extinct then all of civilizations at our
current stage would have gone extinct

862
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:12,960
current stage would have gone extinct
 

863
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,779
current stage would have gone extinct
before becoming technological material

864
00:18:14,779 --> 00:18:14,789
before becoming technological material
 

865
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:17,060
before becoming technological material
so then it kind of becomes trivially

866
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:17,070
so then it kind of becomes trivially
 

867
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:19,759
so then it kind of becomes trivially
true that a very high fraction of those

868
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:19,769
true that a very high fraction of those
 

869
00:18:19,769 --> 00:18:23,209
true that a very high fraction of those
Quantic things but if we think there are

870
00:18:23,209 --> 00:18:23,219
Quantic things but if we think there are
 

871
00:18:23,219 --> 00:18:24,649
Quantic things but if we think there are
many I mean it's interesting because

872
00:18:24,649 --> 00:18:24,659
many I mean it's interesting because
 

873
00:18:24,659 --> 00:18:27,339
many I mean it's interesting because
there are certain things that plausibly

874
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:27,349
there are certain things that plausibly
 

875
00:18:27,349 --> 00:18:30,919
there are certain things that plausibly
could kill us like a certain if you look

876
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:30,929
could kill us like a certain if you look
 

877
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:34,549
could kill us like a certain if you look
at existential risks and it might be a

878
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:34,559
at existential risks and it might be a
 

879
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,399
at existential risks and it might be a
different like that that the best answer

880
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:37,409
different like that that the best answer
 

881
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:38,779
different like that that the best answer
to what would be most likely to kill us

882
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:38,789
to what would be most likely to kill us
 

883
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:41,209
to what would be most likely to kill us
might be a different answer than the

884
00:18:41,209 --> 00:18:41,219
might be a different answer than the
 

885
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,999
might be a different answer than the
best answer to the question if there is

886
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:44,009
best answer to the question if there is
 

887
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,070
best answer to the question if there is
something that kills almost everyone

888
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
something that kills almost everyone
 

889
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,169
something that kills almost everyone
what would that be because that would

890
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:48,179
what would that be because that would
 

891
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:50,119
what would that be because that would
have to be some risk factor that was

892
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:50,129
have to be some risk factor that was
 

893
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,729
have to be some risk factor that was
kind of uniform over all possible

894
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:52,739
kind of uniform over all possible
 

895
00:18:52,739 --> 00:18:55,039
kind of uniform over all possible
civilizations yeah so in this for the

896
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:55,049
civilizations yeah so in this for the
 

897
00:18:55,049 --> 00:18:56,570
civilizations yeah so in this for the
for the seekers argument you have to

898
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:56,580
for the seekers argument you have to
 

899
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:00,219
for the seekers argument you have to
think about not just us but like every

900
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:00,229
think about not just us but like every
 

901
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,359
think about not just us but like every
civilization dies out before they create

902
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:02,369
civilization dies out before they create
 

903
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:04,310
civilization dies out before they create
this simulation yeah or something very

904
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:04,320
this simulation yeah or something very
 

905
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,869
this simulation yeah or something very
close to everybody okay so what's number

906
00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:08,879
close to everybody okay so what's number
 

907
00:19:08,879 --> 00:19:11,119
close to everybody okay so what's number
two in well so number two is the

908
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:11,129
two in well so number two is the
 

909
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:13,519
two in well so number two is the
convergence hypothesis that is that

910
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:13,529
convergence hypothesis that is that
 

911
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,379
convergence hypothesis that is that
maybe like a lot of some of these

912
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:15,389
maybe like a lot of some of these
 

913
00:19:15,389 --> 00:19:17,359
maybe like a lot of some of these
civilizations do make it through to

914
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:17,369
civilizations do make it through to
 

915
00:19:17,369 --> 00:19:19,759
civilizations do make it through to
technological maturity but out of those

916
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:19,769
technological maturity but out of those
 

917
00:19:19,769 --> 00:19:24,200
technological maturity but out of those
who do get there they all lose interest

918
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:24,210
who do get there they all lose interest
 

919
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:26,570
who do get there they all lose interest
in creating these simulations so they

920
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:26,580
in creating these simulations so they
 

921
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,329
in creating these simulations so they
just they have the capability of doing

922
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:29,339
just they have the capability of doing
 

923
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,019
just they have the capability of doing
it but they choose not to yeah not just

924
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:33,029
it but they choose not to yeah not just
 

925
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,609
it but they choose not to yeah not just
a few of them decide not to but you know

926
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:36,619
a few of them decide not to but you know
 

927
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,499
a few of them decide not to but you know
you know out of a million you know maybe

928
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:39,509
you know out of a million you know maybe
 

929
00:19:39,509 --> 00:19:40,969
you know out of a million you know maybe
not even a single one of them would do

930
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:40,979
not even a single one of them would do
 

931
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:44,209
not even a single one of them would do
it and I think when you say lose

932
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:44,219
it and I think when you say lose
 

933
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:46,879
it and I think when you say lose
interest that sounds like unlikely

934
00:19:46,879 --> 00:19:46,889
interest that sounds like unlikely
 

935
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,979
interest that sounds like unlikely
because it's like they get bored or

936
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:48,989
because it's like they get bored or
 

937
00:19:48,989 --> 00:19:50,419
because it's like they get bored or
whatever but it could be so many

938
00:19:50,419 --> 00:19:50,429
whatever but it could be so many
 

939
00:19:50,429 --> 00:19:53,509
whatever but it could be so many
possibility within that igniculus

940
00:19:53,509 --> 00:19:53,519
possibility within that igniculus
 

941
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,830
possibility within that igniculus
I mean losing interest could be

942
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:58,840

 

943
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,080

it could be anything from it being

944
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,090
it could be anything from it being
 

945
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,250
it could be anything from it being
exceptionally difficult to do to

946
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:04,260
exceptionally difficult to do to
 

947
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:07,830
exceptionally difficult to do to
fundamentally changing the sort of the

948
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:07,840
fundamentally changing the sort of the
 

949
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,230
fundamentally changing the sort of the
fabric of reality if you do it as

950
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
fabric of reality if you do it as
 

951
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,420
fabric of reality if you do it as
ethical concerns all those kinds of

952
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:12,430
ethical concerns all those kinds of
 

953
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,160
ethical concerns all those kinds of
things could be exceptionally strong

954
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,170
things could be exceptionally strong
 

955
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,910
things could be exceptionally strong
pressures well certainly I mean yeah

956
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:16,920
pressures well certainly I mean yeah
 

957
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,340
pressures well certainly I mean yeah
ethical concerns I mean not really too

958
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:20,350
ethical concerns I mean not really too
 

959
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,020
ethical concerns I mean not really too
difficult to do I mean in a sense that's

960
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,030
difficult to do I mean in a sense that's
 

961
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:24,630
difficult to do I mean in a sense that's
the first adopter that you get to

962
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:24,640
the first adopter that you get to
 

963
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,490
the first adopter that you get to
technical maturity where you would have

964
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:26,500
technical maturity where you would have
 

965
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,040
technical maturity where you would have
the ability using only a tiny fraction

966
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:29,050
the ability using only a tiny fraction
 

967
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,550
the ability using only a tiny fraction
of your resources to create many many

968
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:32,560
of your resources to create many many
 

969
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,760
of your resources to create many many

970
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:35,770
simulations so it wouldn't be the case
 

971
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,890
simulations so it wouldn't be the case
that they would need to spend half of

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:37,900
that they would need to spend half of
 

973
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,590
that they would need to spend half of
their GDP forever in order to create one

simulation and the head is like

976
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:41,920
simulation and the head is like
 

977
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,560
simulation and the head is like
difficult debate about whether they

978
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:43,570
difficult debate about whether they
 

979
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,660
difficult debate about whether they
should you know invest half of their GDP

980
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:45,670
should you know invest half of their GDP
 

981
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:47,490
should you know invest half of their GDP
for this it would more be like well if

982
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:47,500
for this it would more be like well if
 

983
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,560
for this it would more be like well if
any little fraction of the civilization

any little fraction of the civilization
 

985
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,570

during maybe they're you know millions
 

989
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:56,940
during maybe they're you know millions
of years of existence then there would

of years of existence then there would
 

991
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,570
of years of existence then there would
be millions of simulations but but

992
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:00,580
be millions of simulations but but
 

993
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,860
be millions of simulations but but
certainly that could be many conceivable

00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,040
ancestor simulation well that would be
 

1007
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,940
ancestor simulation well that would be
the type of computer simulation that

1008
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:20,950
the type of computer simulation that
 

1009
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,720
the type of computer simulation that
would contain people all like those we

1010
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:24,730
would contain people all like those we
 

1011
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,150
would contain people all like those we
think have lived on our planet in the

where those simulated people are

1018
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:33,040
where those simulated people are
 

1019
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,640
where those simulated people are
conscious so it's like not just

1020
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:34,650
conscious so it's like not just
 

1021
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,200
conscious so it's like not just
simulated in the same sense that a a

non-player character would be simulated
 

1025
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,840
non-player character would be simulated
in the current computer game where it's

1026
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:42,850
in the current computer game where it's
 

1027
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:45,090
in the current computer game where it's
kind of has you can have at our body and

kind of has you can have at our body and

kind of has you can have at our body and
then a very simple mechanism that moves

1030
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:47,740
then a very simple mechanism that moves
 

1031
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,950
then a very simple mechanism that moves
it forward or backwards or but but

00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:49,960
it forward or backwards or but but
 

1033
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,690
it forward or backwards or but but
something where the the simulated being

1034
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:53,700
something where the the simulated being
 

1035
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,310
something where the the simulated being
has a brain let's say that simulated at

1036
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:56,320
has a brain let's say that simulated at
 

1037
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,060
has a brain let's say that simulated at
a sufficient level of granularity that

1038
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,070
a sufficient level of granularity that
 

1039
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,830
a sufficient level of granularity that
that it would have the same subjective

that it would have the same subjective
 

1041

that it would have the same subjective
experiences as we have so where does

00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:03,910
experiences as we have so where does
 

1043
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,630
experiences as we have so where does
consciousness fit into this do you think

1044
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:06,640
consciousness fit into this do you think
 

1045
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
consciousness fit into this do you think
simulation like is there are different

1046
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,130
simulation like is there are different
 

1047
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,530
simulation like is there are different
ways to think about how this can be

1048
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:10,540
ways to think about how this can be
 

1049
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,350
ways to think about how this can be
simulated

1050
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:11,360
simulated
 

1051
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,530
simulated
just like you're talking about now do we

1052
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:14,540
just like you're talking about now do we
 

1053
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:19,210
just like you're talking about now do we
have to simulate each brain within the

1054
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:19,220
have to simulate each brain within the
 

1055
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,669
have to simulate each brain within the
larger simulation is it enough to

1056
00:22:21,669 --> 00:22:21,679
larger simulation is it enough to
 

1057
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,890
larger simulation is it enough to
simulate just the brain just the minds

1058
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:23,900
simulate just the brain just the minds
 

1059
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,530
simulate just the brain just the minds
and not the simulation I'm not the big

1060
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:26,540
and not the simulation I'm not the big
 

1061
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,940
and not the simulation I'm not the big
in the universe itself like is there

1062
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:27,950
in the universe itself like is there
 

1063
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,310
in the universe itself like is there
different ways to think about this yeah

1064
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:30,320
different ways to think about this yeah
 

1065
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,760
different ways to think about this yeah
I guess there is a kind of premise in

1066
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:33,770
I guess there is a kind of premise in
 

1067
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,180
I guess there is a kind of premise in
the simulation argument rolled in from

1068
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,190
the simulation argument rolled in from
 

1069
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,090
the simulation argument rolled in from
philosophy of mind that is that it would

1070
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:40,100
philosophy of mind that is that it would
 

1071
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:43,690
philosophy of mind that is that it would
be possible to create a conscious mind

1072
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:43,700
be possible to create a conscious mind
 

1073
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,570
be possible to create a conscious mind
in a computer and that what determines

1074
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:46,580
in a computer and that what determines
 

1075
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,909
in a computer and that what determines
whether some system is conscious or not

1076
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:48,919
whether some system is conscious or not
 

1077
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,270
whether some system is conscious or not
is is not like whether it's built from

1078
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,280
is is not like whether it's built from
 

1079
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,030
is is not like whether it's built from
our organic biological neurons but maybe

1080
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,040
our organic biological neurons but maybe
 

1081
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,980
our organic biological neurons but maybe
something like what the structure of the

1082
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:56,990
something like what the structure of the
 

1083
00:22:56,990 --> 00:22:59,830
something like what the structure of the
computation is that it implements so we

1084
00:22:59,830 --> 00:22:59,840
computation is that it implements so we
 

1085
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,549
computation is that it implements so we
can discuss that if we want but I think

1086
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:03,559
can discuss that if we want but I think
 

1087
00:23:03,559 --> 00:23:05,650
can discuss that if we want but I think
it would be far worse worse might be

1088
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:05,660
it would be far worse worse might be
 

1089
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,799
it would be far worse worse might be
that it would be sufficient say if you

1090
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:08,809
that it would be sufficient say if you
 

1091
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:14,080
that it would be sufficient say if you
had a computation that was identical to

1092
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,090
had a computation that was identical to
 

1093
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,940
had a computation that was identical to
the computation in the human brain down

1094
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:15,950
the computation in the human brain down
 

1095
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,190
the computation in the human brain down
to the level of neuron so if you had a

1096
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,200
to the level of neuron so if you had a
 

1097
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,690
to the level of neuron so if you had a
simulation with 100 billion neurons

1098
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:19,700
simulation with 100 billion neurons
 

1099
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,070
simulation with 100 billion neurons
connected in the same ways to human

1100
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:21,080
connected in the same ways to human
 

1101
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,820
connected in the same ways to human
brain and you'd then roll that forward

1102
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:23,830
brain and you'd then roll that forward
 

1103
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,890
brain and you'd then roll that forward
with the same kind of synaptic weights

1104
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:26,900
with the same kind of synaptic weights
 

1105
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,270
with the same kind of synaptic weights
and so forth so you actually had the

1106
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:28,280
and so forth so you actually had the
 

1107
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:31,600
and so forth so you actually had the
same behavior coming out of this as a

1108
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:31,610
same behavior coming out of this as a
 

1109
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,880
same behavior coming out of this as a
human without brain would have done then

1110
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:33,890
human without brain would have done then
 

1111
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:36,490
human without brain would have done then
I think that would be conscious now it's

1112
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:36,500
I think that would be conscious now it's
 

1113
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,570
I think that would be conscious now it's
possible you could also generate

1114
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:37,580
possible you could also generate
 

1115
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,250
possible you could also generate
consciousness without having that

1116
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:42,260
consciousness without having that
 

1117
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,190
consciousness without having that
detailed simulation there I'm getting

00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:45,200
detailed simulation there I'm getting
 

1119
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,860
detailed simulation there I'm getting
more uncertain exactly how much you

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:47,870
more uncertain exactly how much you
 

1121
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,280
more uncertain exactly how much you

00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,290
could simplify or abstract away
 

1123
00:23:50,290 --> 00:23:53,070
could simplify or abstract away
canyonland garnett what do you mean I

1124
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:53,080
canyonland garnett what do you mean I
 

1125
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,690
canyonland garnett what do you mean I
missed where your place in consciousness

1126
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:55,700
missed where your place in consciousness
 

1127
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,970
missed where your place in consciousness
in a second well so that so if you are a

1128
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:57,980
in a second well so that so if you are a
 

1129
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:00,580
in a second well so that so if you are a
computational is do you think that what

1130
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:00,590
computational is do you think that what
 

1131
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,490
computational is do you think that what
creates consciousness is the

1132
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:02,500
creates consciousness is the
 

1133
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,960
creates consciousness is the
implementation of a computation some

1134
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:04,970
implementation of a computation some
 

1135
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,669
implementation of a computation some
property emergent property in the

1136
00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:06,679
property emergent property in the
 

1137
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:09,610
property emergent property in the
computation itself yes the idea yeah you

1138
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:09,620
computation itself yes the idea yeah you
 

1139
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:11,230
computation itself yes the idea yeah you
could say that but then the question is

1140
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:11,240
could say that but then the question is
 

1141
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,539
could say that but then the question is
which what what's the class of

1142
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:13,549
which what what's the class of
 

1143
00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:15,400
which what what's the class of
computations such that when they are

1144
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,410
computations such that when they are
 

1145
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:18,430
computations such that when they are
wrong consciousness emerges so if you

1146
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:18,440
wrong consciousness emerges so if you
 

1147
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,890
wrong consciousness emerges so if you
just have like something that I adds 1

1148
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:20,900
just have like something that I adds 1
 

1149
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,530
just have like something that I adds 1
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 like a simple

1150
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:23,540
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 like a simple
 

1151
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,210
plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 like a simple
computation you think maybe that's not

1152
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:25,220
computation you think maybe that's not
 

1153
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,110
computation you think maybe that's not
gonna have any consciousness if on the

1154
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:29,120
gonna have any consciousness if on the
 

1155
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,210
gonna have any consciousness if on the
other hand the computation is one like

1156
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:31,220
other hand the computation is one like
 

1157
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:36,190
other hand the computation is one like
our human brains are performing where as

1158
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:36,200
our human brains are performing where as
 

1159
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,080
our human brains are performing where as
part of the computation there is like

1160
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,090
part of the computation there is like
 

1161
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:40,990
part of the computation there is like
you know a global work space is

1162
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:41,000
you know a global work space is
 

1163
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,540
you know a global work space is
sophisticated attention mechanism there

1164
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:43,550
sophisticated attention mechanism there
 

1165
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,880
sophisticated attention mechanism there
is like self representations of other

1166
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:45,890
is like self representations of other
 

1167
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,210
is like self representations of other
cognitive processes and a whole lot of

1168
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:49,220
cognitive processes and a whole lot of
 

1169
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,300
cognitive processes and a whole lot of
other things that possibly would be

1170
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:52,310
other things that possibly would be
 

1171
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,070
other things that possibly would be
conscious and in fact if it's exactly

1172
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:54,080
conscious and in fact if it's exactly
 

1173
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,870
conscious and in fact if it's exactly
like ours I think definitely it would

1174
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:55,880
like ours I think definitely it would
 

1175
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,460
like ours I think definitely it would
but exactly how much less than the full

1176
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:00,470
but exactly how much less than the full
 

1177
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,020
but exactly how much less than the full
computation that the human brain is

1178
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:02,030
computation that the human brain is
 

1179
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,260
computation that the human brain is
performing would be required is a little

1180
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,270
performing would be required is a little
 

1181
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:09,700
performing would be required is a little
bit I think of an open question he asks

1182
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:09,710
bit I think of an open question he asks
 

1183
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,430
bit I think of an open question he asks
another interesting question as well

1184
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:12,440
another interesting question as well
 

1185
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:17,470
another interesting question as well
which is would it be sufficient to just

1186
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:17,480
which is would it be sufficient to just
 

1187
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,990
which is would it be sufficient to just
have say the brain or would you need the

1188
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
have say the brain or would you need the
 

1189
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
have say the brain or would you need the
environment right that's a nice way in

1190
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,250
environment right that's a nice way in
 

1191
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,220
environment right that's a nice way in
order to generate the same kind of

1192
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,230
order to generate the same kind of
 

1193
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,580
order to generate the same kind of
experiences that we have and there is a

1194
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:27,590
experiences that we have and there is a
 

1195
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,530
experiences that we have and there is a
bunch of stuff we don't know I mean if

1196
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:29,540
bunch of stuff we don't know I mean if
 

1197
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,100
bunch of stuff we don't know I mean if
you look at say current virtual reality

1198
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:32,110
you look at say current virtual reality
 

1199
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:35,590
you look at say current virtual reality
environments one thing that's clear is

1200
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:35,600
environments one thing that's clear is
 

1201
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,480
environments one thing that's clear is
that we don't have to simulate all

1202
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:37,490
that we don't have to simulate all
 

1203
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,910
that we don't have to simulate all
details of them all the time in order

1204
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:39,920
details of them all the time in order
 

1205
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,110
details of them all the time in order
for say that the human player to have

1206
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,120
for say that the human player to have
 

1207
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,580
for say that the human player to have
the perception that there is a full

1208
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:45,590
the perception that there is a full
 

1209
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,750
the perception that there is a full
reality and that you can have say

1210
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:46,760
reality and that you can have say
 

1211
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,730
reality and that you can have say
procedurally generated virtual might

1212
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:48,740
procedurally generated virtual might
 

1213
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,680
procedurally generated virtual might
only render a scene when it's actually

1214
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:50,690
only render a scene when it's actually
 

1215
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:53,700
only render a scene when it's actually
within the view of the player character

1216
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:53,710
within the view of the player character
 

1217
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,470
within the view of the player character
and so similarly if this if this if this

1218
00:25:59,470 --> 00:25:59,480
and so similarly if this if this if this
 

1219
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,670
and so similarly if this if this if this
environment that that we perceive is

1220
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:02,680
environment that that we perceive is
 

1221
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,880
environment that that we perceive is
simulated it might be that all of the

1222
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:06,890
simulated it might be that all of the
 

1223
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,500
simulated it might be that all of the
parts that come into our view are

1224
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:08,510
parts that come into our view are
 

1225
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,050
parts that come into our view are
rendered at any given time and a lot of

1226
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:11,060
rendered at any given time and a lot of
 

1227
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,810
rendered at any given time and a lot of
aspects that never come into view say

1228
00:26:13,810 --> 00:26:13,820
aspects that never come into view say
 

1229
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,780
aspects that never come into view say
the details of this microphone I'm

1230
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:16,790
the details of this microphone I'm
 

1231
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:19,300
the details of this microphone I'm
talking into exactly what each atom is

1232
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,310
talking into exactly what each atom is
 

1233
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,180
talking into exactly what each atom is
doing at any given point in time might

1234
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:22,190
doing at any given point in time might
 

1235
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,340
doing at any given point in time might
not be part of the simulation only a

1236
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,350
not be part of the simulation only a
 

1237
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,280
not be part of the simulation only a
more coarse-grained representation so

1238
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:27,290
more coarse-grained representation so
 

1239
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,570
more coarse-grained representation so
that to me is actually from an

1240
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:28,580
that to me is actually from an
 

1241
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,160
that to me is actually from an
engineering perspective why the

1242
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,170
engineering perspective why the
 

1243
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:32,020
engineering perspective why the
simulation hypothesis is really

1244
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,030
simulation hypothesis is really
 

1245
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,430
simulation hypothesis is really
interesting to think about is how much

1246
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:35,440
interesting to think about is how much
 

1247
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,829
interesting to think about is how much
how difficult is it to

1248
00:26:38,829 --> 00:26:38,839
how difficult is it to
 

1249
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:41,319
how difficult is it to
sort of in a virtual reality context I

1250
00:26:41,319 --> 00:26:41,329
sort of in a virtual reality context I
 

1251
00:26:41,329 --> 00:26:43,089
sort of in a virtual reality context I
don't know fake is the right word but to

1252
00:26:43,089 --> 00:26:43,099
don't know fake is the right word but to
 

1253
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,819
don't know fake is the right word but to
construct a reality that is sufficiently

1254
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:45,829
construct a reality that is sufficiently
 

1255
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:50,799
construct a reality that is sufficiently
real to us to be to be immersive in that

1256
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:50,809
real to us to be to be immersive in that
 

1257
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:52,449
real to us to be to be immersive in that
way that the physical world is I think

1258
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:52,459
way that the physical world is I think
 

1259
00:26:52,459 --> 00:26:55,689
way that the physical world is I think
that's just that's actually probably an

1260
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:55,699
that's just that's actually probably an
 

1261
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,060
that's just that's actually probably an
answerable question of psychology of

1262
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,070
answerable question of psychology of
 

1263
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:02,499
answerable question of psychology of
computer science of how how where's the

1264
00:27:02,499 --> 00:27:02,509
computer science of how how where's the
 

1265
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:05,379
computer science of how how where's the
line where it becomes so immersive that

1266
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:05,389
line where it becomes so immersive that
 

1267
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:08,409
line where it becomes so immersive that
you don't want to leave that world yeah

1268
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:08,419
you don't want to leave that world yeah
 

1269
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,149
you don't want to leave that world yeah
alright that you don't realize while

1270
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:10,159
alright that you don't realize while
 

1271
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,059
alright that you don't realize while
you're in it that it is a virtual world

1272
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:13,069
you're in it that it is a virtual world
 

1273
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:14,529
you're in it that it is a virtual world
yeah those are two actually questions

1274
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:14,539
yeah those are two actually questions
 

1275
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:16,959
yeah those are two actually questions
yours is the more sort of the good

1276
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:16,969
yours is the more sort of the good
 

1277
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,809
yours is the more sort of the good
question about the realism but mine from

1278
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:19,819
question about the realism but mine from
 

1279
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:22,239
question about the realism but mine from
my perspective what's interesting is it

1280
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:22,249
my perspective what's interesting is it
 

1281
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:26,919
my perspective what's interesting is it
doesn't have to be real but it how how

1282
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:26,929
doesn't have to be real but it how how
 

1283
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:28,359
doesn't have to be real but it how how
can we construct the world that we

1284
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:28,369
can we construct the world that we
 

1285
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:30,219
can we construct the world that we
wouldn't want to leave oh yeah I mean I

1286
00:27:30,219 --> 00:27:30,229
wouldn't want to leave oh yeah I mean I
 

1287
00:27:30,229 --> 00:27:32,739
wouldn't want to leave oh yeah I mean I
think that might be too low a bar I mean

1288
00:27:32,739 --> 00:27:32,749
think that might be too low a bar I mean
 

1289
00:27:32,749 --> 00:27:34,959
think that might be too low a bar I mean
if you think say when people first had

1290
00:27:34,959 --> 00:27:34,969
if you think say when people first had
 

1291
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,359
if you think say when people first had
the pong or something like that like I'm

1292
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:37,369
the pong or something like that like I'm
 

1293
00:27:37,369 --> 00:27:38,469
the pong or something like that like I'm
sure there were people who wanted to

1294
00:27:38,469 --> 00:27:38,479
sure there were people who wanted to
 

1295
00:27:38,479 --> 00:27:40,899
sure there were people who wanted to
keep playing it for a long time because

1296
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:40,909
keep playing it for a long time because
 

1297
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,549
keep playing it for a long time because
it was fun and I wanted to be in this

1298
00:27:42,549 --> 00:27:42,559
it was fun and I wanted to be in this
 

1299
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,699
it was fun and I wanted to be in this
little world I'm not sure we would say

1300
00:27:45,699 --> 00:27:45,709
little world I'm not sure we would say
 

1301
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:47,409
little world I'm not sure we would say
it's immersive I mean I guess in some

1302
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:47,419
it's immersive I mean I guess in some
 

1303
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:49,329
it's immersive I mean I guess in some
sense it is but like an absorbing

1304
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:49,339
sense it is but like an absorbing
 

1305
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:51,430
sense it is but like an absorbing
activity it doesn't even have to be but

1306
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:51,440
activity it doesn't even have to be but
 

1307
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,529
activity it doesn't even have to be but
they left that world though that's the

1308
00:27:53,529 --> 00:27:53,539
they left that world though that's the
 

1309
00:27:53,539 --> 00:27:58,149
they left that world though that's the
so like I think that bar is deceivingly

1310
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
so like I think that bar is deceivingly
 

1311
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,569
so like I think that bar is deceivingly
high so they eventually look so they you

high so they eventually look so they you
 

1313
00:28:01,579 --> 00:28:04,749

can play pong or Starcraft or would have

1314
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:04,759
can play pong or Starcraft or would have
 

1315
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,649

eventually they escape that ah so you

if you step into the experience machine

not to enter the experience machine I

00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,560
not to enter the experience machine I
mean many might want to go there for a

1394
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:50,570
mean many might want to go there for a
 

1395
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:52,090
mean many might want to go there for a
holiday but they wouldn't want to check

00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,100
holiday but they wouldn't want to check

out of existence permanently and so he

1398
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:54,920
out of existence permanently and so he
 

1399
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,660
out of existence permanently and so he
thought that was an argument against

1400
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:57,670
thought that was an argument against
 

1401
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,520
thought that was an argument against
certain views of value according to what

1402
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:00,530
certain views of value according to what
 

1403
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,710
certain views of value according to what
we what we value is a function of what

1404
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:02,720
we what we value is a function of what
 

1405
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,350
we what we value is a function of what
we experience because in the experience

1406
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
we experience because in the experience
 

1407
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,790
we experience because in the experience
machine you can have any experience you

1408
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:06,800
machine you can have any experience you
 

1409
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:09,190
machine you can have any experience you
want and yet many people would think

1410
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:09,200
want and yet many people would think
 

1411
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,070
want and yet many people would think
that would not be much value so

1412
00:30:12,070 --> 00:30:12,080
that would not be much value so
 

1413
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,010
that would not be much value so
therefore what we value depends on other

1414
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:15,020
therefore what we value depends on other
 

1415
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,690
therefore what we value depends on other
things than what we experience so ok can

1416
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:19,700
things than what we experience so ok can
 

1417
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,010
things than what we experience so ok can
you can you take that argument further

1418
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,020
you can you take that argument further
 

1419
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,350
you can you take that argument further
what about the fact that maybe what we

1420
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:23,360
what about the fact that maybe what we
 

1421
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,570
what about the fact that maybe what we
values the up and down of life so you

1422
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:25,580
values the up and down of life so you
 

1423
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,680
values the up and down of life so you
could have up and downs in the

1424
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:26,690
could have up and downs in the
 

1425
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:29,620
could have up and downs in the
experience machine right but what can't

1426
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:29,630
experience machine right but what can't
 

1427
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,300
experience machine right but what can't
you have in the experience machine well

1428
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:31,310
you have in the experience machine well
 

1429
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,120
you have in the experience machine well
I mean that then becomes an interesting

1430
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,130
I mean that then becomes an interesting
 

1431
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:37,570
I mean that then becomes an interesting
question to explore but for example real

1432
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:37,580
question to explore but for example real
 

1433
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,190
question to explore but for example real
connection with other people if the

something you wouldn't have there you

1440
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:44,960
something you wouldn't have there you
 

1441
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,060
something you wouldn't have there you
would have this objective experience

1442
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,070
would have this objective experience
 

1443
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,530
would have this objective experience
that would be like fake people yeah but

1444
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:49,540
that would be like fake people yeah but
 

1445
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,970
that would be like fake people yeah but
when if you gave somebody flowers that

1446
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:51,980
when if you gave somebody flowers that
 

1447
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,020
when if you gave somebody flowers that
wouldn't be any bother they were

1448
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,030
wouldn't be any bother they were
 

1449
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,360
wouldn't be any bother they were
actually got happy it would just be a

1450
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:55,370
actually got happy it would just be a
 

1451
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:58,300
actually got happy it would just be a
little simulation of somebody smiling

1452
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:58,310
little simulation of somebody smiling
 

1453
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,800
little simulation of somebody smiling
but the simulation would not be the kind

1454
00:30:59,800 --> 00:30:59,810
but the simulation would not be the kind
 

1455
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,150
but the simulation would not be the kind
of simulation I'm talking about in the

1456
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,160
of simulation I'm talking about in the
 

1457
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,760
of simulation I'm talking about in the
simulation argument where

1458
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:02,770
simulation argument where
 

1459
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,260
simulation argument where
simulated creatures conscious it would

1460
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,270
simulated creatures conscious it would
 

1461
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,960
simulated creatures conscious it would
just be a kind of smiley face that would

1462
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:06,970
just be a kind of smiley face that would
 

1463
00:31:06,970 --> 00:31:09,360
just be a kind of smiley face that would
look perfectly real to you so we're now

1464
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:09,370
look perfectly real to you so we're now
 

1465
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,390
look perfectly real to you so we're now
drawing a distinction between appear to

1466
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:12,400
drawing a distinction between appear to
 

1467
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,520
drawing a distinction between appear to
be perfectly real and actually being

1468
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:14,530
be perfectly real and actually being
 

1469
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,240
be perfectly real and actually being
real yeah so that could be one thing I

1470
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,250
real yeah so that could be one thing I
 

1471
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,610
real yeah so that could be one thing I
mean like a big impact on history maybe

1472
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:20,620
mean like a big impact on history maybe
 

1473
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,830
mean like a big impact on history maybe
it's also something you won't have if

1474
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:22,840
it's also something you won't have if
 

1475
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,690
it's also something you won't have if
you check into this experience machine

1476
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:24,700
you check into this experience machine
 

1477
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,840
you check into this experience machine
so some people might actually feel the

1478
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:27,850
so some people might actually feel the
 

1479
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,669
so some people might actually feel the
life I want to have for me is one where

1480
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:29,679
life I want to have for me is one where
 

1481
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,290
life I want to have for me is one where
I have a big positive impact on history

1482
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:34,300
I have a big positive impact on history
 

1483
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,590
I have a big positive impact on history
unfolds so let's see if you could kind

1484
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:37,600
unfolds so let's see if you could kind
 

1485
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,310
unfolds so let's see if you could kind
of explore these different possible

1486
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:40,320
of explore these different possible
 

1487
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,590
of explore these different possible
explanations for why this you wouldn't

1488
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:43,600
explanations for why this you wouldn't
 

1489
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,790
explanations for why this you wouldn't
want to go into the experience machine

1490
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:44,800
want to go into the experience machine
 

1491
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:47,940
want to go into the experience machine
if that's if that's what you feel and

1492
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:47,950
if that's if that's what you feel and
 

1493
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,520
if that's if that's what you feel and
what one interesting observation

1494
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:50,530
what one interesting observation
 

1495
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,650
what one interesting observation
regarding this Nozick thought experiment

1496
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:52,660
regarding this Nozick thought experiment
 

1497
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,000
regarding this Nozick thought experiment
and the conclusions he wanted to draw

1498
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,010
and the conclusions he wanted to draw
 

1499
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,490
and the conclusions he wanted to draw
from it is how much is a kind of a

1500
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:56,500
from it is how much is a kind of a
 

1501
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,370
from it is how much is a kind of a
status quo effect so a lot of people

1502
00:31:59,370 --> 00:31:59,380
status quo effect so a lot of people
 

1503
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:03,180
status quo effect so a lot of people
might not want to jettison card reality

1504
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,190
might not want to jettison card reality
 

1505
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:07,230
might not want to jettison card reality
to plug in to this dream machine but if

1506
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:07,240
to plug in to this dream machine but if
 

1507
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:10,680
to plug in to this dream machine but if
they instead we're told well what you've

1508
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:10,690
they instead we're told well what you've
 

1509
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:14,030
they instead we're told well what you've
experienced up to this point was a dream

experienced up to this point was a dream
 

1511
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,049

now

1512
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:16,059
now
 

1513
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,870
now
do you want to disconnect from this and

1514
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:18,880
do you want to disconnect from this and
 

1515
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,850
do you want to disconnect from this and
enter the real world when you have no

1516
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:20,860
enter the real world when you have no
 

1517
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,040
enter the real world when you have no
idea maybe what the real world is or

idea maybe what the real world is or
 

1519
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,180
idea maybe what the real world is or
maybe you could say well you're actually

00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:24,190
maybe you could say well you're actually
 

1521
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:27,510
maybe you could say well you're actually

yeah it might not be so much the the

1548
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:02,290
yeah it might not be so much the the
 

1549
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:04,710
yeah it might not be so much the the
reality itself that we're after but it's

00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:04,720
reality itself that we're after but it's
 

1551
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,720
reality itself that we're after but it's
more that we are maybe involved in

more that we are maybe involved in
 

1553
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,760
more that we are maybe involved in
certain projects and relationships and

1554
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:08,770
certain projects and relationships and
 

1555
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:11,760
certain projects and relationships and
we have you know a self-identity and

we have you know a self-identity and
 

1557

we have you know a self-identity and
these things that's our values are kind

1558
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:13,600
these things that's our values are kind
 

1559
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,060
these things that's our values are kind
of connected with carrying that forward

1560
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,070
of connected with carrying that forward
 

1561
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:17,039
of connected with carrying that forward
and then whether

1562
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:17,049
and then whether
 

1563
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:20,850
and then whether
it's inside a tank or outside a tank in

1564
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:20,860
it's inside a tank or outside a tank in
 

1565
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,710
it's inside a tank or outside a tank in
Peru or whether inside a computer

1566
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720
Peru or whether inside a computer
 

1567
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,159
Peru or whether inside a computer
outside a computer that's kind of less

1568
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:25,169
outside a computer that's kind of less
 

1569
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:28,139
outside a computer that's kind of less
important to what what we ultimately

1570
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:28,149
important to what what we ultimately
 

1571
00:33:28,149 --> 00:33:32,190
important to what what we ultimately
care about yeah but still so just linger

1572
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:32,200
care about yeah but still so just linger
 

1573
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,789
care about yeah but still so just linger
on it it is interesting I find maybe

1574
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:35,799
on it it is interesting I find maybe
 

1575
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,229
on it it is interesting I find maybe
people are different but I find myself

1576
00:33:37,229 --> 00:33:37,239
people are different but I find myself
 

1577
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:39,659
people are different but I find myself
quite willing to take the leap to the

1578
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:39,669
quite willing to take the leap to the
 

1579
00:33:39,669 --> 00:33:43,259
quite willing to take the leap to the
farmer in Peru especially as the virtual

1580
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:43,269
farmer in Peru especially as the virtual
 

1581
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:46,889
farmer in Peru especially as the virtual
reality system become more realistic I

1582
00:33:46,889 --> 00:33:46,899
reality system become more realistic I
 

1583
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,049
reality system become more realistic I
I find that possibility and I think more

1584
00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:49,059
I find that possibility and I think more
 

1585
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,090
I find that possibility and I think more
people would take that leap but so in

1586
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:51,100
people would take that leap but so in
 

1587
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,320
people would take that leap but so in
this in this thought experiment just to

1588
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,330
this in this thought experiment just to
 

1589
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,489
this in this thought experiment just to
make sure we are understand so in this

1590
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:53,499
make sure we are understand so in this
 

1591
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:56,310
make sure we are understand so in this
case that the farmer in Peru would not

1592
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:56,320
case that the farmer in Peru would not
 

1593
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,139
case that the farmer in Peru would not
be a virtual reality that would be the

1594
00:33:58,139 --> 00:33:58,149
be a virtual reality that would be the
 

1595
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,149
be a virtual reality that would be the
real the real that really real that your

1596
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:00,159
real the real that really real that your
 

1597
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,330
real the real that really real that your
life like before this whole experience

1598
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:03,340
life like before this whole experience

00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,639
life like before this whole experience
machine started well I kind of assumed

1600
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:05,649
machine started well I kind of assumed
 

1601
00:34:05,649 --> 00:34:06,720
machine started well I kind of assumed
from that description

1602
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:06,730
from that description
 

1603
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:09,599
from that description
you're being very specific but that kind

1604
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:09,609
you're being very specific but that kind
 

1605
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:12,659
you're being very specific but that kind
of idea just like washes away the

1606
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:12,669
of idea just like washes away the
 

1607
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:15,930
of idea just like washes away the
concept of what's real I mean I'm still

1608
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:15,940
concept of what's real I mean I'm still
 

1609
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,270
concept of what's real I mean I'm still
a little hesitant about your kind of

1610
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:18,280
a little hesitant about your kind of
 

1611
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,280
a little hesitant about your kind of
distinction between real and illusion

1612
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:22,290
distinction between real and illusion
 

1613
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,530
distinction between real and illusion
because when you can have an illusion

1614
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:25,540
because when you can have an illusion
 

1615
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,770
because when you can have an illusion
that's feels I mean that looks real and

1616
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:28,780
that's feels I mean that looks real and
 

1617
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,589
that's feels I mean that looks real and
you know what III don't know how you can

1618
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,599
you know what III don't know how you can
 

1619
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:33,359
you know what III don't know how you can
definitively say something is real or

1620
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:33,369
definitively say something is real or
 

1621
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,010
definitively say something is real or
not like what's what's a good way to

1622
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:35,020
not like what's what's a good way to
 

1623
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,750
not like what's what's a good way to
prove that something is real in that

1624
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:36,760
prove that something is real in that
 

1625
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,839
prove that something is real in that
context well so I guess in this case

1626
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:39,849
context well so I guess in this case
 

1627
00:34:39,849 --> 00:34:41,549
context well so I guess in this case
it's Morris depression in one case

1628
00:34:41,549 --> 00:34:41,559
it's Morris depression in one case
 

1629
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,250
it's Morris depression in one case
you're floating in a tank with these

1630
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:44,260
you're floating in a tank with these
 

1631
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,099
you're floating in a tank with these

Friedman experiences in the other you're

1636
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:52,929
Friedman experiences in the other you're
 

1637
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,809
Friedman experiences in the other you're
actually tilling the soil in Peru

1638
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:54,819
actually tilling the soil in Peru
 

1639
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:57,539
actually tilling the soil in Peru
growing peanuts and then those peanuts

1640
00:34:57,539 --> 00:34:57,549
growing peanuts and then those peanuts
 

1641
00:34:57,549 --> 00:34:59,039
growing peanuts and then those peanuts
are being eaten by other people all

1642
00:34:59,039 --> 00:34:59,049
are being eaten by other people all
 

1643
00:34:59,049 --> 00:35:01,380
are being eaten by other people all
around the world by the exports and this

1644
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,390
around the world by the exports and this
 

1645
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,569
around the world by the exports and this
that's two different possible situations

1646
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:03,579
that's two different possible situations
 

1647
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:06,870
that's two different possible situations
in the one and the same real world that

1648
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:06,880
in the one and the same real world that
 

1649
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,349
in the one and the same real world that
that you could choose to occupy but just

1650
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:10,359
that you could choose to occupy but just
 

1651
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:12,359
that you could choose to occupy but just
to be clear when you're in a vat with

1652
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:12,369
to be clear when you're in a vat with
 

1653
00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,390
to be clear when you're in a vat with
wires and the neuroscientists you can

1654
00:35:15,390 --> 00:35:15,400
wires and the neuroscientists you can
 

1655
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,109
wires and the neuroscientists you can
still go farming in Peru right mmm but

1656
00:35:19,109 --> 00:35:19,119
still go farming in Peru right mmm but
 

1657
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,930
still go farming in Peru right mmm but
like well you could you could if you

1658
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:21,940
like well you could you could if you
 

1659
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,190
like well you could you could if you
wanted to you could have the experience

1660
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,200
wanted to you could have the experience
 

1661
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,140
wanted to you could have the experience
of farming in Peru but what that

1662
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,150
of farming in Peru but what that
 

1663
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,470
of farming in Peru but what that
wouldn't actually be any peanuts grown

1664
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:27,480
wouldn't actually be any peanuts grown
 

1665
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,650
wouldn't actually be any peanuts grown
well but what makes a peanut so

1666
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:30,660
well but what makes a peanut so
 

1667
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,410
well but what makes a peanut so
so peanut could be grown and you could

1668
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:34,420
so peanut could be grown and you could
 

1669
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,910
so peanut could be grown and you could
feed things with that peanut and why

1670
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:38,920
feed things with that peanut and why
 

1671
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,350
feed things with that peanut and why
can't all of that be done in a

1672
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:40,360
can't all of that be done in a
 

1673
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,160
can't all of that be done in a
simulation

1674
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,170
simulation
 

1675
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:42,780
simulation
I hope first of all that they actually

1676
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:42,790
I hope first of all that they actually
 

1677
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,600
I hope first of all that they actually
have peanut farms in Peru I guess we'll

1678
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:45,610
have peanut farms in Peru I guess we'll
 

1679
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:50,010
have peanut farms in Peru I guess we'll
get a lot of comments otherwise angry I

1680
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:50,020
get a lot of comments otherwise angry I
 

1681
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:53,370
get a lot of comments otherwise angry I
was way up to the point you should know

1682
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:53,380
was way up to the point you should know
 

1683
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:58,140
was way up to the point you should know
you can't realize in that climate now I

1684
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,150
you can't realize in that climate now I
 

1685
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:02,100
you can't realize in that climate now I
mean I I think I mean I I in the

1686
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,110
mean I I think I mean I I in the
 

1687
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,470
mean I I think I mean I I in the
simulation I think there's a sense the

1688
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:04,480
simulation I think there's a sense the
 

1689
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,850
simulation I think there's a sense the
important sense in which it should all

1690
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:05,860
important sense in which it should all
 

1691
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,240
important sense in which it should all
be real nevertheless there is a

1692
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,250
be real nevertheless there is a
 

1693
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,620
be real nevertheless there is a
distinction between inside the

1694
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:10,630
distinction between inside the
 

1695
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:13,620
distinction between inside the
simulation and outside the simulation or

1696
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:13,630
simulation and outside the simulation or
 

1697
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,570
simulation and outside the simulation or
in the case of no.6 thought experiment

1698
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:15,580
in the case of no.6 thought experiment
 

1699
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:18,660
in the case of no.6 thought experiment
whether you're in the VAT or outside the

1700
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:18,670
whether you're in the VAT or outside the
 

1701
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:21,630
whether you're in the VAT or outside the
VAT and some of those differences may or

1702
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:21,640
VAT and some of those differences may or
 

1703
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,920
VAT and some of those differences may or
may not be important I mean that that

1704
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:22,930
may not be important I mean that that
 

1705
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,930
may not be important I mean that that
comes down to your values and

1706
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:24,940
comes down to your values and
 

1707
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:29,250
comes down to your values and
preferences so if they if the experience

1708
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:29,260
preferences so if they if the experience
 

1709
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,350
preferences so if they if the experience
machine only gives you the experience of

1710
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:31,360
machine only gives you the experience of
 

1711
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,600
machine only gives you the experience of
growing peanuts but you're the only one

1712
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:33,610
growing peanuts but you're the only one
 

1713
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:36,210
growing peanuts but you're the only one
in in the experience machines there's

1714
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:36,220
in in the experience machines there's
 

1715
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,760
in in the experience machines there's
other you can within the experience

1716
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:38,770
other you can within the experience
 

1717
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:41,880
other you can within the experience
machine others can plug in well they're

1718
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:41,890
machine others can plug in well they're
 

1719
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:44,040
machine others can plug in well they're
versions of the experience machine so in

1720
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,050
versions of the experience machine so in
 

1721
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,020
versions of the experience machine so in
fact you might want to have distinguish

1722
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:46,030
fact you might want to have distinguish
 

1723
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,280
fact you might want to have distinguish
different thought experiments different

1724
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:47,290
different thought experiments different
 

1725
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:49,680
different thought experiments different
versions of it so in in like in the

1726
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:49,690
versions of it so in in like in the
 

1727
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:50,970
versions of it so in in like in the
original thought experiment maybe it's

1728
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:50,980
original thought experiment maybe it's
 

1729
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,040
original thought experiment maybe it's
only right just you so and you think I

1730
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:53,050
only right just you so and you think I
 

1731
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,720
only right just you so and you think I
wouldn't want to go in there well that

1732
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:54,730
wouldn't want to go in there well that
 

1733
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:56,370
wouldn't want to go in there well that
tells you something interesting about

1734
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:56,380
tells you something interesting about
 

1735
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,540
tells you something interesting about
what you value and what you care about

1736
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,550
what you value and what you care about
 

1737
00:36:57,550 --> 00:37:00,390
what you value and what you care about
then you could say well what if you add

1738
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
then you could say well what if you add
 

1739
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,650
then you could say well what if you add
the fact that there would be other

1740
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:01,660
the fact that there would be other
 

1741
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,940
the fact that there would be other
people in there and you would interact

1742
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:02,950
people in there and you would interact
 

1743
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:04,620
people in there and you would interact
with them well it starts to make it more

1744
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:04,630
with them well it starts to make it more
 

1745
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:07,470
with them well it starts to make it more
attractive right then you can add in

1746
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:07,480
attractive right then you can add in
 

1747
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,760
attractive right then you can add in
well what if you could also have

1748
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:08,770
well what if you could also have
 

1749
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:10,950
well what if you could also have
important long-term effects on human

1750
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:10,960
important long-term effects on human
 

1751
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,120
important long-term effects on human
history in the world and you could

1752
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,130
history in the world and you could
 

1753
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,610
history in the world and you could
actually do something useful even though

1754
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:14,620
actually do something useful even though
 

1755
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,650
actually do something useful even though
you were in there that makes it maybe

1756
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:16,660
you were in there that makes it maybe
 

1757
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,060
you were in there that makes it maybe
even more attractive like you could

1758
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:18,070
even more attractive like you could
 

1759
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,030
even more attractive like you could
actually have a life that had a purpose

1760
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
actually have a life that had a purpose
 

1761
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,090
actually have a life that had a purpose
and consequences and so as you sort of

1762
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:24,100
and consequences and so as you sort of
 

1763
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:27,090
and consequences and so as you sort of
add more into it it becomes more similar

1764
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:27,100
add more into it it becomes more similar
 

1765
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:31,920
add more into it it becomes more similar
to the the baseline reality that that

1766
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:31,930
to the the baseline reality that that
 

1767
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,420
to the the baseline reality that that
you were comparing it to yeah but I just

1768
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:33,430
you were comparing it to yeah but I just
 

1769
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,960
you were comparing it to yeah but I just
think inside the experience machine and

1770
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:35,970
think inside the experience machine and
 

1771
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,920
think inside the experience machine and
without taking those steps you just

1772
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:37,930
without taking those steps you just
 

1773
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,610
without taking those steps you just
mentioned you you you still have an

1774
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:41,620
mentioned you you you still have an
 

1775
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,820
mentioned you you you still have an
impact on long-term history

1776
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:43,830
impact on long-term history
 

1777

00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:46,500
of the creatures that live inside that
 

1779
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,730
of the creatures that live inside that
of the quote-unquote fake creatures that

1780
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:49,740
of the quote-unquote fake creatures that
 

1781
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:52,850
of the quote-unquote fake creatures that
live inside that experience machine and

1782
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:52,860
live inside that experience machine and
 

1783
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:58,040
live inside that experience machine and
that like at a certain point you know if

1784
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,050
that like at a certain point you know if
 

1785
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,780
that like at a certain point you know if
there's a person waiting for you inside

1786
00:37:59,780 --> 00:37:59,790
there's a person waiting for you inside
 

1787
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,210
there's a person waiting for you inside
that experience machine maybe your newly

1788
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:02,220
that experience machine maybe your newly
 

1789
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,650
that experience machine maybe your newly
found wife and she dies she has fears

1790
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:06,660
found wife and she dies she has fears
 

1791
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,920
found wife and she dies she has fears
she has hopes and she exists in that

1792
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:09,930
she has hopes and she exists in that
 

1793
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:12,020
she has hopes and she exists in that
machine when you plug out when you

1794
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,030
machine when you plug out when you
 

1795
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,850
machine when you plug out when you
unplug yourself and plug back in she's

1796
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:13,860
unplug yourself and plug back in she's
 

1797
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,950
unplug yourself and plug back in she's
still there going on about her life oh

1798
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:15,960
still there going on about her life oh
 

1799
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,990
still there going on about her life oh
well in that case yeah she starts to

1800
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
well in that case yeah she starts to
 

1801
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,030
well in that case yeah she starts to
have more of an independent existence i

1802
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,040
have more of an independent existence i
 

1803
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
have more of an independent existence i
independent existence but it depends I

1804
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:22,050
independent existence but it depends I
 

1805
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,530
independent existence but it depends I
think on how she's implemented in the

1806
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:24,540
think on how she's implemented in the
 

1807
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,470
think on how she's implemented in the
experience machine take one the mid case

1808
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:27,480
experience machine take one the mid case
 

1809
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,340
experience machine take one the mid case
where all she is is a static picture on

1810
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:31,350
where all she is is a static picture on
 

1811
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,290
where all she is is a static picture on
the wall of photograph right so you

1812
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,300
the wall of photograph right so you
 

1813
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,020
the wall of photograph right so you
think well I can look at her right but

1814
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:36,030
think well I can look at her right but
 

1815
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,480
think well I can look at her right but
that's it there's no that then you think

1816
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,490
that's it there's no that then you think
 

1817
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:40,460
that's it there's no that then you think
well it doesn't really matter much what

1818
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:40,470
well it doesn't really matter much what
 

1819
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,020
well it doesn't really matter much what
happens to that and any more than a

1820
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:42,030
happens to that and any more than a
 

1821
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,610
happens to that and any more than a
normal photographs if you tear it up

1822
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:43,620
normal photographs if you tear it up
 

1823
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:45,980
normal photographs if you tear it up
right it means you can't see it anymore

1824
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:45,990
right it means you can't see it anymore
 

1825
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,890
right it means you can't see it anymore
but you haven't harmed the person whose

1826
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:48,900
but you haven't harmed the person whose
 

1827
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,280
but you haven't harmed the person whose
picture you tore up to go home but but

1828
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:52,290
picture you tore up to go home but but
 

1829
00:38:52,290 --> 00:38:55,160
picture you tore up to go home but but
if she's actually implemented say at a

1830
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:55,170
if she's actually implemented say at a
 

1831
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,710
if she's actually implemented say at a
neural level of details so that she's a

1832
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:57,720
neural level of details so that she's a
 

1833
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,270
neural level of details so that she's a
fully realized digital mind with the

1834
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:02,280
fully realized digital mind with the
 

1835
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
fully realized digital mind with the
same behavioral repertoire as you have

1836
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:04,290
same behavioral repertoire as you have
 

1837
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,620
same behavioral repertoire as you have
then very plausibly she would be a

1838
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:06,630
then very plausibly she would be a
 

1839
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,350
then very plausibly she would be a
conscious person like you are and then

1840
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:09,360
conscious person like you are and then
 

1841
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,270
conscious person like you are and then
you would what you do in in this

1842
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,280
you would what you do in in this
 

1843
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,740
you would what you do in in this
experience machine would have real

1844
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:12,750
experience machine would have real
 

1845
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,080
experience machine would have real
consequences for how this other mind

1846
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,090
consequences for how this other mind
 

1847
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:19,040
consequences for how this other mind
felt so you have to like specify which

1848
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,050
felt so you have to like specify which
 

1849
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:20,300
felt so you have to like specify which
of these experience machines you're

1850
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:20,310
of these experience machines you're
 

1851
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,820
of these experience machines you're
talking about I think it's not entirely

1852
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:22,830
talking about I think it's not entirely
 

1853
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:26,600
talking about I think it's not entirely
obvious that it will be possible to have

1854
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:26,610
obvious that it will be possible to have
 

1855
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,880
obvious that it will be possible to have
an experience machine that gave you a

1856
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:28,890
an experience machine that gave you a
 

1857
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:32,570
an experience machine that gave you a
normal set of human experiences which

1858
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:32,580
normal set of human experiences which
 

1859
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:34,250
normal set of human experiences which
include experiences of interacting with

1860
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:34,260
include experiences of interacting with
 

1861
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,740
include experiences of interacting with
other people without that also

1862
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:36,750
other people without that also
 

1863
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:40,190
other people without that also
generating consciousnesses corresponding

1864
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:40,200
generating consciousnesses corresponding
 

1865
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,320
generating consciousnesses corresponding
to those other people that is if you

1866
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:42,330
to those other people that is if you
 

1867
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:45,770
to those other people that is if you
create another entity that you perceive

1868
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:45,780
create another entity that you perceive
 

1869
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,750
create another entity that you perceive
and interact with that to you looks

1870
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:47,760
and interact with that to you looks
 

1871
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,030
and interact with that to you looks
entirely realistic not just when you say

1872
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:50,040
entirely realistic not just when you say
 

1873
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,500
entirely realistic not just when you say
hello they say hello back but you have a

1874
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:51,510
hello they say hello back but you have a
 

1875
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:53,540
hello they say hello back but you have a
rich interaction many days deep

1876
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:53,550
rich interaction many days deep
 

1877
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,360
rich interaction many days deep
conversations like it might be that the

1878
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,370
conversations like it might be that the
 

1879
00:39:56,370 --> 00:39:57,969
conversations like it might be that the
only

1880
00:39:57,969 --> 00:39:57,979
only
 

1881
00:39:57,979 --> 00:40:00,049
only
possible way of implementing that would

1882
00:40:00,049 --> 00:40:00,059
possible way of implementing that would
 

1883
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:01,749
possible way of implementing that would
be one that also has a side effect

1884
00:40:01,749 --> 00:40:01,759
be one that also has a side effect
 

1885
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:04,069
be one that also has a side effect
instantiated this other person in enough

1886
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:04,079
instantiated this other person in enough
 

1887
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,620
instantiated this other person in enough
detail that you would have a second

1888
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:06,630
detail that you would have a second
 

1889
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,449
detail that you would have a second
consciousness there I think that's to

1890
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:08,459
consciousness there I think that's to
 

1891
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:12,259
consciousness there I think that's to
some extent an open question so you

1892
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:12,269
some extent an open question so you
 

1893
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:13,609
some extent an open question so you
don't think it's possible to fake

1894
00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:13,619
don't think it's possible to fake
 

1895
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,979
don't think it's possible to fake
consciousness and say well it might be I

1896
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:15,989
consciousness and say well it might be I
 

1897
00:40:15,989 --> 00:40:18,099
consciousness and say well it might be I
mean I think you can certainly fake if

1898
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:18,109
mean I think you can certainly fake if
 

1899
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:20,389
mean I think you can certainly fake if
you have a very limited interaction with

1900
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:20,399
you have a very limited interaction with
 

1901
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:22,449
you have a very limited interaction with
somebody you could certainly fake that

1902
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:22,459
somebody you could certainly fake that
 

1903
00:40:22,459 --> 00:40:25,370
somebody you could certainly fake that
that is if all you have to go on is

1904
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:25,380
that is if all you have to go on is
 

1905
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,259
that is if all you have to go on is
somebody said hello to you that's not

1906
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:27,269
somebody said hello to you that's not
 

1907
00:40:27,269 --> 00:40:29,179
somebody said hello to you that's not
enough for you to tell whether that was

1908
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:29,189
enough for you to tell whether that was
 

1909
00:40:29,189 --> 00:40:31,309
enough for you to tell whether that was
a real person there or a pre-recorded

1910
00:40:31,309 --> 00:40:31,319
a real person there or a pre-recorded
 

1911
00:40:31,319 --> 00:40:34,339
a real person there or a pre-recorded
message or you know like a very

1912
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:34,349
message or you know like a very
 

1913
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,870
message or you know like a very
superficial simulation that has no

1914
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:35,880
superficial simulation that has no
 

1915
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,479
superficial simulation that has no
conscious Ness because that's something

1916
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:38,489
conscious Ness because that's something
 

1917
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,099
conscious Ness because that's something
easy to fake we could already fake it

1918
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:40,109
easy to fake we could already fake it
 

1919
00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:41,899
easy to fake we could already fake it
now you can record a voice recording and

1920
00:40:41,899 --> 00:40:41,909
now you can record a voice recording and
 

1921
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:44,629
now you can record a voice recording and
you know but but if you have a richer

1922
00:40:44,629 --> 00:40:44,639
you know but but if you have a richer
 

1923
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,099
you know but but if you have a richer
set of interactions where you're allowed

1924
00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:46,109
set of interactions where you're allowed
 

1925
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:49,459
set of interactions where you're allowed
to answer ask open-ended questions and

1926
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:49,469
to answer ask open-ended questions and
 

1927
00:40:49,469 --> 00:40:51,499
to answer ask open-ended questions and
probe from different angles that

1928
00:40:51,499 --> 00:40:51,509
probe from different angles that
 

1929
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:53,629
probe from different angles that
couldn't sort of be you could give can't

1930
00:40:53,629 --> 00:40:53,639
couldn't sort of be you could give can't
 

1931
00:40:53,639 --> 00:40:55,429
couldn't sort of be you could give can't
answer to all of the possible ways that

1932
00:40:55,429 --> 00:40:55,439
answer to all of the possible ways that
 

1933
00:40:55,439 --> 00:40:58,279
answer to all of the possible ways that
you could probe it then it starts to

1934
00:40:58,279 --> 00:40:58,289
you could probe it then it starts to
 

1935
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,319
you could probe it then it starts to
become more plausible that the only way

1936
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:00,329
become more plausible that the only way
 

1937
00:41:00,329 --> 00:41:02,809
become more plausible that the only way
to realize this thing in such a way that

1938
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:02,819
to realize this thing in such a way that
 

1939
00:41:02,819 --> 00:41:04,939
to realize this thing in such a way that
you would get the right answer for many

1940
00:41:04,939 --> 00:41:04,949
you would get the right answer for many
 

1941
00:41:04,949 --> 00:41:07,609
you would get the right answer for many
which angle you probe it would be a way

1942
00:41:07,609 --> 00:41:07,619
which angle you probe it would be a way
 

1943
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:08,779
which angle you probe it would be a way
of instance ating it we also

1944
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:08,789
of instance ating it we also
 

1945
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:11,149
of instance ating it we also
instantiated a conscious mind yeah movie

1946
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:11,159
instantiated a conscious mind yeah movie
 

1947
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:12,829
instantiated a conscious mind yeah movie
on the intelligence part but there's

1948
00:41:12,829 --> 00:41:12,839
on the intelligence part but there's
 

1949
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:13,999
on the intelligence part but there's
something about me that says

1950
00:41:13,999 --> 00:41:14,009
something about me that says
 

1951
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:16,159
something about me that says
consciousness is easier to fake like I

1952
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:16,169
consciousness is easier to fake like I
 

1953
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:18,559
consciousness is easier to fake like I
I've recently gotten my hands on a lot

1954
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:18,569
I've recently gotten my hands on a lot
 

1955
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:22,669
I've recently gotten my hands on a lot
of rubas don't ask me why or how but and

1956
00:41:22,669 --> 00:41:22,679
of rubas don't ask me why or how but and
 

1957
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:25,939
of rubas don't ask me why or how but and
I've made them there's just a nice

1958
00:41:25,939 --> 00:41:25,949
I've made them there's just a nice
 

1959
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:28,159
I've made them there's just a nice
robotic mobile platform for experiments

1960
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:28,169
robotic mobile platform for experiments
 

1961
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:31,729
robotic mobile platform for experiments
and I made them scream and/or moan in

1962
00:41:31,729 --> 00:41:31,739
and I made them scream and/or moan in
 

1963
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,039
and I made them scream and/or moan in
pain so on just to see when they're

1964
00:41:34,039 --> 00:41:34,049
pain so on just to see when they're
 

1965
00:41:34,049 --> 00:41:36,949
pain so on just to see when they're
responding to me and it's just a sort of

1966
00:41:36,949 --> 00:41:36,959
responding to me and it's just a sort of
 

1967
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:39,439
responding to me and it's just a sort of
psychological experiment myself and I

1968
00:41:39,439 --> 00:41:39,449
psychological experiment myself and I
 

1969
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:41,209
psychological experiment myself and I
think they appear conscious to me pretty

1970
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:41,219
think they appear conscious to me pretty
 

1971
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:44,239
think they appear conscious to me pretty
quickly my guy to me at least my brain

1972
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:44,249
quickly my guy to me at least my brain
 

1973
00:41:44,249 --> 00:41:47,059
quickly my guy to me at least my brain
can be tricked quite easily right I said

1974
00:41:47,059 --> 00:41:47,069
can be tricked quite easily right I said
 

1975
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:50,509
can be tricked quite easily right I said
if I introspect and they it's harder for

1976
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:50,519
if I introspect and they it's harder for
 

1977
00:41:50,519 --> 00:41:52,159
if I introspect and they it's harder for
me to be tricked that something is

1978
00:41:52,159 --> 00:41:52,169
me to be tricked that something is
 

1979
00:41:52,169 --> 00:41:54,889
me to be tricked that something is
intelligent so I just have this feeling

1980
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:54,899
intelligent so I just have this feeling
 

1981
00:41:54,899 --> 00:41:58,099
intelligent so I just have this feeling
that inside this experience machine just

1982
00:41:58,099 --> 00:41:58,109
that inside this experience machine just
 

1983
00:41:58,109 --> 00:42:00,370
that inside this experience machine just
saying that you're conscious and having

1984
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:00,380
saying that you're conscious and having
 

1985
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:03,289
saying that you're conscious and having
certain qualities of the interaction

1986
00:42:03,289 --> 00:42:03,299
certain qualities of the interaction
 

1987
00:42:03,299 --> 00:42:05,329
certain qualities of the interaction
like being able to suffer like being

1988
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:05,339
like being able to suffer like being
 

1989
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:08,809
like being able to suffer like being
able to hurt like being able to wander

1990
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:08,819
able to hurt like being able to wander
 

1991
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,330
able to hurt like being able to wander
about the essence of your own existence

1992
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:11,340
about the essence of your own existence
 

1993
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:14,870
about the essence of your own existence
not actually I mean you know the

1994
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
not actually I mean you know the
 

1995
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,340
not actually I mean you know the
creating the illusion that you're

1996
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:16,350
creating the illusion that you're
 

1997
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:18,320
creating the illusion that you're
wandering about it is enough to create

1998
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:18,330
wandering about it is enough to create
 

1999
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:20,870
wandering about it is enough to create
the fit of consciousness and be create

2000
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:20,880
the fit of consciousness and be create
 

2001
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,120
the fit of consciousness and be create
the illusion of consciousness and

2002
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:23,130
the illusion of consciousness and
 

2003
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:24,470
the illusion of consciousness and
because of that create a really

2004
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:24,480
because of that create a really
 

2005
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,780
because of that create a really
immersive experience to where you feel

2006
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:26,790
immersive experience to where you feel
 

2007
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:28,520
immersive experience to where you feel
like that is the real world so you think

2008
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:28,530
like that is the real world so you think
 

2009
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,040
like that is the real world so you think
there's a big gap between appearing

2010
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:31,050
there's a big gap between appearing
 

2011
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:33,680
there's a big gap between appearing
conscious and being conscious or is it

2012
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:33,690
conscious and being conscious or is it
 

2013
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,120
conscious and being conscious or is it
not just that gets very easy to be

2014
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,130
not just that gets very easy to be
 

2015
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:37,070
not just that gets very easy to be
conscious I'm not actually sure what it

2016
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:37,080
conscious I'm not actually sure what it
 

2017
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,830
conscious I'm not actually sure what it
means to be conscious all I'm saying is

2018
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:38,840
means to be conscious all I'm saying is
 

2019
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,400
means to be conscious all I'm saying is
the illusion of consciousness is enough

2020
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,410
the illusion of consciousness is enough
 

2021
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:46,900
the illusion of consciousness is enough
for this to create a social interaction

2022
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:46,910
for this to create a social interaction
 

2023
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:49,520
for this to create a social interaction
that's as good as if the thing was

2024
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:49,530
that's as good as if the thing was
 

2025
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,800
that's as good as if the thing was
conscious meaning I'm making it about

2026
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:51,810
conscious meaning I'm making it about
 

2027
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:54,140
conscious meaning I'm making it about
myself right yeah I mean I guess there

2028
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,150
myself right yeah I mean I guess there
 

2029
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,670
myself right yeah I mean I guess there
are a few differences one is how good

2030
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
are a few differences one is how good
 

2031
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,200
are a few differences one is how good
the interaction is which might mean if

2032
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,210
the interaction is which might mean if
 

2033
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,260
the interaction is which might mean if
you don't really care about like probing

2034
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:00,270
you don't really care about like probing
 

2035
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:01,670
you don't really care about like probing
hard for whether the thing is conscious

2036
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:01,680
hard for whether the thing is conscious
 

2037
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,940
hard for whether the thing is conscious
maybe maybe it would be a satisfactory

2038
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:04,950
maybe maybe it would be a satisfactory
 

2039
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:08,840
maybe maybe it would be a satisfactory
interaction whether or not you really

2040
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:08,850
interaction whether or not you really
 

2041
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:11,960
interaction whether or not you really
thought it was conscious now if you

2042
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:11,970
thought it was conscious now if you
 

2043
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,650
thought it was conscious now if you
really care about it being contrasting

2044
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:15,660
really care about it being contrasting
 

2045
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,720
really care about it being contrasting
in like inside this experience machine

2046
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:17,730
in like inside this experience machine
 

2047
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:21,740
in like inside this experience machine
yes how easy would it be to fake it and

2048
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:21,750
yes how easy would it be to fake it and
 

2049
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:24,860
yes how easy would it be to fake it and
you say it sounds easy easy yeah then

2050
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:24,870
you say it sounds easy easy yeah then
 

2051
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,320
you say it sounds easy easy yeah then
the question is would that also mean

2052
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,330
the question is would that also mean
 

2053
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:28,760
the question is would that also mean
it's very easy to instantiate

2054
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:28,770
it's very easy to instantiate
 

2055
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,760
it's very easy to instantiate
consciousness like it's much more widely

2056
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:31,770
consciousness like it's much more widely
 

2057
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:34,190
consciousness like it's much more widely
spread in the world and we have thought

2058
00:43:34,190 --> 00:43:34,200
spread in the world and we have thought
 

2059
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,020
spread in the world and we have thought
it doesn't require a big human brain

2060
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,030
it doesn't require a big human brain
 

2061
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,310
it doesn't require a big human brain

to me yeah I mean for some of these

2152
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:41,670
to me yeah I mean for some of these
 

2153
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:44,329
to me yeah I mean for some of these
reasons we alluded to earlier in terms

orders of magnitude than the human brain
 

2161
00:45:54,510 --> 00:45:56,329
orders of magnitude than the human brain
yeah but it could be that the

2162
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:56,339
yeah but it could be that the
 

2163
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:59,210
yeah but it could be that the

intelligence so the more the more

2168
00:46:03,890 --> 00:46:03,900
intelligence so the more the more
 

2169
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:05,780
intelligence so the more the more
powerful you make the computer the less

2170
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:05,790
powerful you make the computer the less
 

2171
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:08,410
powerful you make the computer the less
likely is to become super intelligent

2172
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:08,420

this is where I say dumb things to push

2174
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,040
this is where I say dumb things to push
 

2175
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,730
this is where I say dumb things to push
back and uh yeah I'm not sure I father

2176
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:13,740
back and uh yeah I'm not sure I father
 

2177
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:15,020
back and uh yeah I'm not sure I father
we might you know I mean so there are

2178
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:15,030
we might you know I mean so there are
 

2179
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:17,510
we might you know I mean so there are
different dimensions of intolerance yeah

2180
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:17,520
different dimensions of intolerance yeah
 

2181
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,480
different dimensions of intolerance yeah
a simple one is just speed like if you

2182
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:20,490
a simple one is just speed like if you
 

2183
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,970
a simple one is just speed like if you
could solve the same challenge faster in

2184
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:22,980
could solve the same challenge faster in
 

2185
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,400
could solve the same challenge faster in
some sense yes you're like smarter so

2186
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:25,410
some sense yes you're like smarter so
 

2187
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,920
some sense yes you're like smarter so
there I think we have very strong

2188
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:27,930
there I think we have very strong
 

2189
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,839
there I think we have very strong
evidence for thinking that you could

2190
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:29,849
evidence for thinking that you could
 

2191
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:33,710
evidence for thinking that you could
have a computer in this universe that

2192
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:33,720
have a computer in this universe that
 

2193
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:35,180
have a computer in this universe that
would be much faster than the human

2194
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:35,190
would be much faster than the human
 

2195
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:38,150
would be much faster than the human
brain and therefore have speed super

2196
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:38,160
brain and therefore have speed super
 

2197
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:38,460

00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:43,440
it's like be completely superior maybe a
million times faster then maybe there

2202
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:43,450
million times faster then maybe there
 

2203
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:44,760
million times faster then maybe there
are other ways in which you could be

2204
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:44,770
are other ways in which you could be
 

2205
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,010
are other ways in which you could be
smarter as well maybe more qualitative

2206
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:47,020
smarter as well maybe more qualitative
 

2207
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:49,500
smarter as well maybe more qualitative
ways right and there

2208
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:49,510
ways right and there
 

2209
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,030
ways right and there
the concepts are a little bit less

00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:51,040
the concepts are a little bit less
 

2211
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,910
the concepts are a little bit less
clear-cut so it's harder to make a very

2221
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:06,480
thinks that we're faster although I
still think it's very plausible and for

2222
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:06,490
still think it's very plausible and for
 

2223
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,859
still think it's very plausible and for
various reasons that that are less than

2224
00:47:07,859 --> 00:47:07,869
various reasons that that are less than
 

2225
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:09,599
various reasons that that are less than
watertight arguments but when you can

2226
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:09,609
watertight arguments but when you can
 

2227
00:47:09,609 --> 00:47:10,830
watertight arguments but when you can
sort of for example if you look at

2228
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:10,840
sort of for example if you look at
 

2229
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,770
sort of for example if you look at
animals and brains and even within

2230
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:13,780
animals and brains and even within
 

2231
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,810
animals and brains and even within
humans like there seems to be like

2232
00:47:15,810 --> 00:47:15,820
humans like there seems to be like
 

2233
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,960
humans like there seems to be like
Einstein versus random person like it's

2234
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:18,970
Einstein versus random person like it's
 

2235
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,280
Einstein versus random person like it's
not just that Einstein was a little bit

2236
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:20,290
not just that Einstein was a little bit
 

2237
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:23,250
not just that Einstein was a little bit
faster but like how long would it take a

2238
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:23,260
faster but like how long would it take a
 

2239
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:25,020
faster but like how long would it take a
normal person to invent general

2240
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:25,030
normal person to invent general
 

2241
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,720
normal person to invent general
relativity it's like it's not twenty

2242
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:27,730

2243
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:29,310
relativity it's like it's not twenty
percent longer than it took Einstein or

2244
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:29,320
percent longer than it took Einstein or
 

2245
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,660
percent longer than it took Einstein or
something like that it's like I don't

2246
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:30,670
something like that it's like I don't
 

2247
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:32,099
something like that it's like I don't
know whether that we do it at all or it

2248
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:32,109
know whether that we do it at all or it
 

2249
00:47:32,109 --> 00:47:33,630
know whether that we do it at all or it
would take millions of years or some

2250
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:33,640
would take millions of years or some
 

2251
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,500
would take millions of years or some
totally bizarre so well you put your

00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:37,510
totally bizarre so well you put your
 

2253
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,210
totally bizarre so well you put your
tuition is that the computer size will

2254
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:39,220
tuition is that the computer size will
 

2255
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:42,150
tuition is that the computer size will
get you go the increasing the size of

2256
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:42,160
get you go the increasing the size of
 

2257
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:44,130
get you go the increasing the size of
the computer and the speed of the

2258
00:47:44,130 --> 00:47:44,140
the computer and the speed of the
 

2259
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:48,000
the computer and the speed of the
computer might create some much more

2260
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:48,010
computer might create some much more
 

2261
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,650
computer might create some much more
powerful levels of intelligence that

2262
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:49,660
powerful levels of intelligence that
 

2263
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,180
powerful levels of intelligence that
would that enable some of the things

2264
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:51,190
would that enable some of the things
 

2265
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,380
would that enable some of the things
we've been talking about would like the

2266
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:52,390
we've been talking about would like the
 

2267
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:54,780
we've been talking about would like the
simulation being able to simulate an

2268
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:54,790
simulation being able to simulate an
 

2269
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:57,120
simulation being able to simulate an
ultra realistic environment ultra

2270
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,130
ultra realistic environment ultra
 

2271
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,829
ultra realistic environment ultra
realistic yes ception of reality yeah I

2272
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
realistic yes ception of reality yeah I
 

2273
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,210
realistic yes ception of reality yeah I
mean it's like they're speaking it would

2274
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:03,220
mean it's like they're speaking it would
 

2275
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,770
mean it's like they're speaking it would
not be necessary to have super

2276
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:04,780
not be necessary to have super
 

2277
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,810
not be necessary to have super
intelligence in order to he'll say the

2278
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:06,820
intelligence in order to he'll say the
 

2279
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:09,030
intelligence in order to he'll say the
technology to make these simulations

2280
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:09,040
technology to make these simulations
 

2281
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,920
technology to make these simulations
ancestor simulations or other kinds of

2282
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:10,930
ancestor simulations or other kinds of
 

2283
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,180
ancestor simulations or other kinds of
simulations and as a matter of fact that

2284
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:15,190
simulations and as a matter of fact that
 

2285
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,960
simulations and as a matter of fact that
thing if if there are if we are in a

2286
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:18,970
thing if if there are if we are in a
 

2287
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:20,790
thing if if there are if we are in a
simulation it would most likely be one

2288
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:20,800
simulation it would most likely be one
 

2289
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,070
simulation it would most likely be one
built by a civilization that had super

2290
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:23,080
built by a civilization that had super
 

2291
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:27,359
built by a civilization that had super
intelligence it certainly would help a

2292
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:27,369
intelligence it certainly would help a
 

2293
00:48:27,369 --> 00:48:28,920
intelligence it certainly would help a
lot I mean it could build more efficient

2294
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:28,930
lot I mean it could build more efficient
 

2295
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,839
lot I mean it could build more efficient
large-scale structures if you had super

2296
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:30,849
large-scale structures if you had super
 

2297
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:32,339
large-scale structures if you had super
intelligence I also think that if you

2298
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:32,349
intelligence I also think that if you
 

2299
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:33,599
intelligence I also think that if you
had the technology to build these

2300
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:33,609
had the technology to build these
 

2301
00:48:33,609 --> 00:48:35,550
had the technology to build these
simulations that's like a very advanced

2302
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:35,560
simulations that's like a very advanced
 

2303
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:37,380
simulations that's like a very advanced
technology it seems kind of easier to

2304
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:37,390
technology it seems kind of easier to
 

2305
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:39,060
technology it seems kind of easier to
get technology to super intelligence

2306
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,070
get technology to super intelligence
 

2307
00:48:39,070 --> 00:48:41,760
get technology to super intelligence
yeah so I'd expect by the time that

2308
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:41,770
yeah so I'd expect by the time that
 

2309
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:43,609
yeah so I'd expect by the time that
could make these fully realistic

2310
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:43,619
could make these fully realistic
 

2311
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,750
could make these fully realistic
simulations of human history with human

2312
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:45,760
simulations of human history with human
 

2313
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,880
simulations of human history with human
brains in there like before that they

2314
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:47,890
brains in there like before that they
 

2315
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,109
brains in there like before that they
got to that stage I would have figured

2316
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:49,119
got to that stage I would have figured
 

2317
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:52,170
got to that stage I would have figured
out how to create machines super tall

2318
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:52,180
out how to create machines super tall
 

2319
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:55,380
out how to create machines super tall
or maybe biological enhancements of

2320
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:55,390
or maybe biological enhancements of
 

2321
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,519
or maybe biological enhancements of
their own brains if there were

2322
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:56,529
their own brains if there were
 

2323
00:48:56,529 --> 00:48:59,400
their own brains if there were
biological creatures to start with so we

2324
00:48:59,400 --> 00:48:59,410
biological creatures to start with so we
 

2325
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,089
biological creatures to start with so we
talked about the the three parts of the

2326
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:03,099
talked about the the three parts of the
 

2327
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:05,279
talked about the the three parts of the
simulation argument one we destroy

2328
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:05,289
simulation argument one we destroy
 

2329
00:49:05,289 --> 00:49:06,569
simulation argument one we destroy
ourselves before we ever create the

2330
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:06,579
ourselves before we ever create the
 

2331
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:09,779
ourselves before we ever create the
simulation two we somehow everybody

2332
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:09,789
simulation two we somehow everybody
 

2333
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,700
simulation two we somehow everybody
somehow loses interest in creating

2334
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:11,710
somehow loses interest in creating
 

2335
00:49:11,710 --> 00:49:14,460
somehow loses interest in creating
simulation three we're living in a

2336
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:14,470
simulation three we're living in a
 

2337
00:49:14,470 --> 00:49:18,960
simulation three we're living in a
simulation so you've kind of I don't

2338
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:18,970
simulation so you've kind of I don't
 

2339
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,819
simulation so you've kind of I don't
know if your thinking has evolved on

2340
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:20,829
know if your thinking has evolved on
 

2341
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:22,349
know if your thinking has evolved on
this point but you kind of said that we

2342
00:49:22,349 --> 00:49:22,359
this point but you kind of said that we
 

2343
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,740
this point but you kind of said that we
know so little that these three cases

2344
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:25,750
know so little that these three cases
 

2345
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:27,809
know so little that these three cases
might as well be equally probable

2346
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:27,819
might as well be equally probable
 

2347
00:49:27,819 --> 00:49:30,720
might as well be equally probable
so probabilistically speaking where do

2348
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:30,730
so probabilistically speaking where do
 

2349
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:32,519
so probabilistically speaking where do
you stand on this yeah I know I mean I

2350
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:32,529
you stand on this yeah I know I mean I
 

2351
00:49:32,529 --> 00:49:35,309
you stand on this yeah I know I mean I
don't think equal necessarily would be

2352
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:35,319
don't think equal necessarily would be
 

2353
00:49:35,319 --> 00:49:40,079
don't think equal necessarily would be
the most supported probability

2354
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:40,089
the most supported probability
 

2355
00:49:40,089 --> 00:49:42,599
the most supported probability
assignment so how would you without

2356
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:42,609
assignment so how would you without
 

2357
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:44,819
assignment so how would you without
assigning actual numbers wait wait

2358
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:44,829
assigning actual numbers wait wait
 

2359
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:47,160
assigning actual numbers wait wait
what's more or less likely in your in

2360
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:47,170
what's more or less likely in your in
 

2361
00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:49,769
what's more or less likely in your in
your well I mean historically tended to

2362
00:49:49,769 --> 00:49:49,779
your well I mean historically tended to
 

2363
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:54,059
your well I mean historically tended to
punt on the question of like has between

2364
00:49:54,059 --> 00:49:54,069
punt on the question of like has between
 

2365
00:49:54,069 --> 00:49:57,000
punt on the question of like has between
these three so maybe you ask me another

2366
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:57,010
these three so maybe you ask me another
 

2367
00:49:57,010 --> 00:49:59,880
these three so maybe you ask me another
way is which kind of things would make

2368
00:49:59,880 --> 00:49:59,890
way is which kind of things would make
 

2369
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:02,450
way is which kind of things would make
it each of these more or less likely

2370
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:02,460
it each of these more or less likely
 

2371
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,029
it each of these more or less likely
what cried VI certainly in general terms

2372
00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:06,039
what cried VI certainly in general terms
 

2373
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:09,150
what cried VI certainly in general terms
if you think anything that say increases

2374
00:50:09,150 --> 00:50:09,160
if you think anything that say increases
 

2375
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,430
if you think anything that say increases
or reduces the probability of one of

2376
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:11,440
or reduces the probability of one of
 

2377
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,480
or reduces the probability of one of
these we tend to slosh probability

2378
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:15,490
these we tend to slosh probability
 

2379
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,849
these we tend to slosh probability
around on the other so if if one becomes

2380
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:17,859
around on the other so if if one becomes
 

2381
00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:19,500
around on the other so if if one becomes
less probable like the other would have

2382
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:19,510
less probable like the other would have
 

2383
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:21,900
less probable like the other would have
to cuz gotta add up to one yes

2384
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:21,910
to cuz gotta add up to one yes
 

2385
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,960
to cuz gotta add up to one yes
so if we consider the first hypothesis

2386
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:24,970
so if we consider the first hypothesis
 

2387
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,010
so if we consider the first hypothesis
the first alternative that there's this

2388
00:50:28,010 --> 00:50:28,020
the first alternative that there's this
 

2389
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:31,109
the first alternative that there's this
filter that makes it so that virtually

2390
00:50:31,109 --> 00:50:31,119
filter that makes it so that virtually
 

2391
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,529
filter that makes it so that virtually
no civilization reaches technological

2392
00:50:34,529 --> 00:50:34,539
no civilization reaches technological
 

2393
00:50:34,539 --> 00:50:39,269
no civilization reaches technological
maturity in particular our own

2394
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:39,279
maturity in particular our own
 

2395
00:50:39,279 --> 00:50:41,130
maturity in particular our own
civilization if that's true then it's

2396
00:50:41,130 --> 00:50:41,140
civilization if that's true then it's
 

2397
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,480
civilization if that's true then it's
like very unlikely that we would reach

2398
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:42,490
like very unlikely that we would reach
 

2399
00:50:42,490 --> 00:50:44,730
like very unlikely that we would reach
technical maturity just because if

2400
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:44,740
technical maturity just because if
 

2401
00:50:44,740 --> 00:50:46,559
technical maturity just because if
almost no civilization at our stage does

2402
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:46,569
almost no civilization at our stage does
 

2403
00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:49,200
almost no civilization at our stage does
it then it's unlikely that we do it so

2404
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,210
it then it's unlikely that we do it so
 

2405
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:50,880
it then it's unlikely that we do it so
hang on sorry again longer than that for

2406
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:50,890
hang on sorry again longer than that for
 

2407
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,260
hang on sorry again longer than that for
a second well if it's the case that

2408
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:52,270
a second well if it's the case that
 

2409
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:54,539
a second well if it's the case that
almost all civilizations at our current

2410
00:50:54,539 --> 00:50:54,549
almost all civilizations at our current
 

2411
00:50:54,549 --> 00:50:56,609
almost all civilizations at our current
stage of technological maturity fails at

2412
00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:56,619
stage of technological maturity fails at
 

2413
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:59,039
stage of technological maturity fails at
failed at our current stage of technical

2414
00:50:59,039 --> 00:50:59,049
failed at our current stage of technical
 

2415
00:50:59,049 --> 00:51:02,000
failed at our current stage of technical
development failed to reach maturity

2416
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:02,010
development failed to reach maturity
 

2417
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:04,829
development failed to reach maturity
that would give us very strong reason

2418
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:04,839
that would give us very strong reason
 

2419
00:51:04,839 --> 00:51:05,819
that would give us very strong reason
for thinking we will

2420
00:51:05,819 --> 00:51:05,829
for thinking we will
 

2421
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:08,309
for thinking we will
to reach technical material and also so

2422
00:51:08,309 --> 00:51:08,319
to reach technical material and also so
 

2423
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:10,319
to reach technical material and also so
the flipside of that is the fact that

2424
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:10,329
the flipside of that is the fact that
 

2425
00:51:10,329 --> 00:51:12,479
the flipside of that is the fact that
we've reached it means that many other

2426
00:51:12,479 --> 00:51:12,489
we've reached it means that many other
 

2427
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:14,640
we've reached it means that many other
civilizations yeah so that means if we

2428
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:14,650
civilizations yeah so that means if we
 

2429
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,140
civilizations yeah so that means if we
get closer and closer to actually

2430
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:16,150
get closer and closer to actually
 

2431
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:20,190
get closer and closer to actually
reaching technological maturity there's

2432
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:20,200
reaching technological maturity there's
 

2433
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,870
reaching technological maturity there's
less and less distance left where we

2434
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:21,880
less and less distance left where we
 

2435
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:25,769
less and less distance left where we
could go extinct before we are there and

2436
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:25,779
could go extinct before we are there and
 

2437
00:51:25,779 --> 00:51:27,449
could go extinct before we are there and
therefore the probability that we will

2438
00:51:27,449 --> 00:51:27,459
therefore the probability that we will
 

2439
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,930
therefore the probability that we will
reach increases as we get closer and

2440
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:30,940
reach increases as we get closer and
 

2441
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:32,579
reach increases as we get closer and
that would make it less likely to be

2442
00:51:32,579 --> 00:51:32,589
that would make it less likely to be
 

2443
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,099
that would make it less likely to be
true that almost all civilizations at

2444
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:35,109
true that almost all civilizations at
 

2445
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:36,599
true that almost all civilizations at
our current stage failed to get there

2446
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:36,609
our current stage failed to get there
 

2447
00:51:36,609 --> 00:51:39,120
our current stage failed to get there
like we would have this what the one

2448
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:39,130
like we would have this what the one
 

2449
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,609
like we would have this what the one
case we started ourselves would be very

2450
00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:41,619
case we started ourselves would be very
 

2451
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:43,049
case we started ourselves would be very
close to getting there that would be

2452
00:51:43,049 --> 00:51:43,059
close to getting there that would be
 

2453
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:44,729
close to getting there that would be
strong evidence it's not so hard to get

2454
00:51:44,729 --> 00:51:44,739
strong evidence it's not so hard to get
 

2455
00:51:44,739 --> 00:51:47,370
strong evidence it's not so hard to get
too technical maturity so to the extent

2456
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:47,380
too technical maturity so to the extent
 

2457
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:49,349
too technical maturity so to the extent
that we you know feel we are moving

2458
00:51:49,349 --> 00:51:49,359
that we you know feel we are moving
 

2459
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:52,019
that we you know feel we are moving
nearer to technology maturity that that

2460
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:52,029
nearer to technology maturity that that
 

2461
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:54,269
nearer to technology maturity that that
would tend to reduce the probability of

2462
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:54,279
would tend to reduce the probability of
 

2463
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:57,239
would tend to reduce the probability of
the first alternative and increase the

2464
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:57,249
the first alternative and increase the
 

2465
00:51:57,249 --> 00:51:59,789
the first alternative and increase the
probability of the other - it doesn't

2466
00:51:59,789 --> 00:51:59,799
probability of the other - it doesn't
 

2467
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,219
probability of the other - it doesn't
need to be a monotonic change like if

2468
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:02,229
need to be a monotonic change like if
 

2469
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:04,979
need to be a monotonic change like if
every once in a while some new threat

2470
00:52:04,979 --> 00:52:04,989
every once in a while some new threat
 

2471
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,289
every once in a while some new threat
comes into view some bad news thing you

2472
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:07,299
comes into view some bad news thing you
 

2473
00:52:07,299 --> 00:52:10,229
comes into view some bad news thing you
could do with some novel technology for

2474
00:52:10,229 --> 00:52:10,239
could do with some novel technology for
 

2475
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:11,699
could do with some novel technology for
example you know that that could change

2476
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:11,709
example you know that that could change
 

2477
00:52:11,709 --> 00:52:14,150
example you know that that could change
our probabilities in the other direction

2478
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:14,160
our probabilities in the other direction
 

2479
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:17,099
our probabilities in the other direction
but that the technology again you have

2480
00:52:17,099 --> 00:52:17,109
but that the technology again you have
 

2481
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:19,949
but that the technology again you have
to think about as that technology has to

2482
00:52:19,949 --> 00:52:19,959
to think about as that technology has to
 

2483
00:52:19,959 --> 00:52:23,160
to think about as that technology has to
be able to equally in an even way affect

2484
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:23,170
be able to equally in an even way affect
 

2485
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:26,880
be able to equally in an even way affect
every civilization out there yeah pretty

2486
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:26,890
every civilization out there yeah pretty
 

2487
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:30,420
every civilization out there yeah pretty
much I mean that strictly speaking is

2488
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:30,430
much I mean that strictly speaking is
 

2489
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,499
much I mean that strictly speaking is
not real I mean that could that could be

2490
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:31,509
not real I mean that could that could be
 

2491
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:34,259
not real I mean that could that could be
two different existential risk and every

2492
00:52:34,259 --> 00:52:34,269
two different existential risk and every
 

2493
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:37,019
two different existential risk and every
civilization you know you know one or

2494
00:52:37,019 --> 00:52:37,029
civilization you know you know one or
 

2495
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,259
civilization you know you know one or
the other like but none of them kills

2496
00:52:40,259 --> 00:52:40,269
the other like but none of them kills
 

2497
00:52:40,269 --> 00:52:44,150
the other like but none of them kills
more than 50% like yeah but that

2498
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:44,160
more than 50% like yeah but that
 

2499
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,370
more than 50% like yeah but that
incidentally so in some of my the work I

2500
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:47,380
incidentally so in some of my the work I
 

2501
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:49,109
incidentally so in some of my the work I
mean on machine super intelligence like

2502
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
mean on machine super intelligence like
 

2503
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,390
mean on machine super intelligence like
so I wanted some existential risks where

2504
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:51,400
so I wanted some existential risks where
 

2505
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,670
so I wanted some existential risks where
they did sort of super intelligence AI

2506
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:53,680
they did sort of super intelligence AI
 

2507
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,249
they did sort of super intelligence AI
and how we must make sure you know to

2508
00:52:56,249 --> 00:52:56,259
and how we must make sure you know to
 

2509
00:52:56,259 --> 00:52:59,849
and how we must make sure you know to
handle that wisely and carefully it's

2510
00:52:59,849 --> 00:52:59,859
handle that wisely and carefully it's
 

2511
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:02,779
handle that wisely and carefully it's
not the right kind of existential

2512
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:02,789
not the right kind of existential
 

2513
00:53:02,789 --> 00:53:07,670
not the right kind of existential
catastrophe to make

2514
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:07,680

 

2515
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,040

first alternative true though like it

2516
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,050
first alternative true though like it
 

2517
00:53:10,050 --> 00:53:13,250
first alternative true though like it
might be bad for us if the future lost a

2518
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:13,260
might be bad for us if the future lost a
 

2519
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:14,960
might be bad for us if the future lost a
lot of value as a result of it being

2520
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:14,970
lot of value as a result of it being
 

2521
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:18,200
lot of value as a result of it being
shaped by some process that optimized

2522
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:18,210
shaped by some process that optimized
 

2523
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:21,670
shaped by some process that optimized
for some completely non human value but

2524
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:21,680
for some completely non human value but
 

2525
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,710
for some completely non human value but
even if we got killed by machine

2526
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:24,720
even if we got killed by machine
 

2527
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,020
even if we got killed by machine
superintendence is that machine super

2528
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:27,030
superintendence is that machine super
 

2529
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:28,280
superintendence is that machine super
intelligence might still attain

2530
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:28,290
intelligence might still attain
 

2531
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:31,160
intelligence might still attain
technical maturity so I see so you're

2532
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:31,170
technical maturity so I see so you're
 

2533
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:33,589
technical maturity so I see so you're
not very you're not human exclusive this

2534
00:53:33,589 --> 00:53:33,599
not very you're not human exclusive this
 

2535
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:35,599
not very you're not human exclusive this
could be any intelligent species that

2536
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:35,609
could be any intelligent species that
 

2537
00:53:35,609 --> 00:53:37,640
could be any intelligent species that
achieves like it's all about the

2538
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:37,650
achieves like it's all about the
 

2539
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,410
achieves like it's all about the
technological maturity it's not that the

2540
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:39,420
technological maturity it's not that the
 

2541
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,430
technological maturity it's not that the
humans have to attain it right like

2542
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:43,440
humans have to attain it right like
 

2543
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,890
humans have to attain it right like
super intelligence replace us and that's

2544
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:45,900
super intelligence replace us and that's
 

2545
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,839
super intelligence replace us and that's
just as well fascination as well yeah

2546
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:47,849
just as well fascination as well yeah
 

2547
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:49,849
just as well fascination as well yeah
yeah I mean it could interact with the

2548
00:53:49,849 --> 00:53:49,859
yeah I mean it could interact with the
 

2549
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,980
yeah I mean it could interact with the
second high pop foul turn ative like if

2550
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:51,990
second high pop foul turn ative like if
 

2551
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:53,540
second high pop foul turn ative like if
the thing that replaced us was either

2552
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:53,550
the thing that replaced us was either
 

2553
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,359
the thing that replaced us was either
more likely or less likely than we would

2554
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:56,369
more likely or less likely than we would
 

2555
00:53:56,369 --> 00:53:58,130
more likely or less likely than we would
be to have an interest in creating

2556
00:53:58,130 --> 00:53:58,140
be to have an interest in creating
 

2557
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:01,730
be to have an interest in creating
ancestor simulations you know that that

2558
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:01,740
ancestor simulations you know that that
 

2559
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,290
ancestor simulations you know that that
could affect probabilities but yeah to a

2560
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:03,300
could affect probabilities but yeah to a
 

2561
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:07,339
could affect probabilities but yeah to a
first-order like if we all just die then

2562
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:07,349
first-order like if we all just die then
 

2563
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:10,430
first-order like if we all just die then
yeah we won't produce any simulations

2564
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:10,440
yeah we won't produce any simulations
 

2565
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:14,000
yeah we won't produce any simulations
because we are dead but if we all die

2566
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,010
because we are dead but if we all die
 

2567
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,109
because we are dead but if we all die
and get replaced by some other

2568
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:15,119
and get replaced by some other
 

2569
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:17,599
and get replaced by some other
intelligent thing that then gets the

2570
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:17,609
intelligent thing that then gets the
 

2571
00:54:17,609 --> 00:54:19,250
intelligent thing that then gets the
technical maturity the question remains

2572
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:19,260
technical maturity the question remains
 

2573
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:21,349
technical maturity the question remains
of course if my not that thing that

2574
00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:21,359
of course if my not that thing that
 

2575
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:23,990
of course if my not that thing that
needs some of its resources to to do

2576
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:24,000
needs some of its resources to to do
 

2577
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,140
needs some of its resources to to do
this stuff so can you reason about this

2578
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:27,150
this stuff so can you reason about this
 

2579
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:28,789
this stuff so can you reason about this
stuff this is given how little we know

2580
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:28,799
stuff this is given how little we know
 

2581
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:33,670
stuff this is given how little we know
about the universe is it reasonable to

2582
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:33,680
about the universe is it reasonable to
 

2583
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,740
about the universe is it reasonable to
to reason about these probabilities so

2584
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:36,750
to reason about these probabilities so
 

2585
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,950
to reason about these probabilities so
like how little

2586
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:38,960
like how little
 

2587
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,470
like how little
well maybe you can disagree but to me

2588
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:42,480
well maybe you can disagree but to me
 

2589
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,410
well maybe you can disagree but to me
it's not trivial to figure out how

2590
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:45,420
it's not trivial to figure out how
 

2591
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,539
it's not trivial to figure out how
difficult it is to build a simulation we

2592
00:54:47,539 --> 00:54:47,549
difficult it is to build a simulation we
 

2593
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:49,640
difficult it is to build a simulation we
kind of talked about it a little bit we

2594
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:49,650
kind of talked about it a little bit we
 

2595
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,270
kind of talked about it a little bit we
also don't know like as we tried to

2596
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
also don't know like as we tried to
 

2597
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,370
also don't know like as we tried to
start building it like start creating

2598
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,380
start building it like start creating
 

2599
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:57,140
start building it like start creating
virtual worlds and so on how that

2600
00:54:57,140 --> 00:54:57,150
virtual worlds and so on how that
 

2601
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,170
virtual worlds and so on how that
changes the fabric of society like

2602
00:54:59,170 --> 00:54:59,180
changes the fabric of society like
 

2603
00:54:59,180 --> 00:55:01,370
changes the fabric of society like
there's all these things along the way

2604
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:01,380
there's all these things along the way
 

2605
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:03,710
there's all these things along the way
that can fundamentally change just so

2606
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:03,720
that can fundamentally change just so
 

2607
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,260
that can fundamentally change just so
many aspects of our society about our

2608
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:06,270
many aspects of our society about our
 

2609
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,510
many aspects of our society about our
existence that we don't know anything

2610
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:08,520
existence that we don't know anything
 

2611
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,730
existence that we don't know anything
about like the kind of things we might

2612
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:10,740
about like the kind of things we might
 

2613
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:14,960
about like the kind of things we might
discover when we understand to a greater

2614
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:14,970
discover when we understand to a greater
 

2615
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:19,400
discover when we understand to a greater
degree the fundamental the physics like

2616
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:19,410
degree the fundamental the physics like
 

2617
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:21,410
degree the fundamental the physics like
the theory if we have a

2618
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:21,420
the theory if we have a
 

2619
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,339
the theory if we have a
break through have a theory and

2620
00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:22,349
break through have a theory and
 

2621
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:23,960
break through have a theory and
everything how that changes stuff how

2622
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:23,970
everything how that changes stuff how
 

2623
00:55:23,970 --> 00:55:26,630
everything how that changes stuff how
that changes deep space exploration and

2624
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:26,640
that changes deep space exploration and
 

2625
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:30,170
that changes deep space exploration and
so on so like is it still possible to

2626
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:30,180
so on so like is it still possible to
 

2627
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,700
so on so like is it still possible to
reason about probabilities given how

2628
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:31,710
reason about probabilities given how
 

2629
00:55:31,710 --> 00:55:35,150
reason about probabilities given how
little we know yes I think though there

2630
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:35,160
little we know yes I think though there

00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:38,680
little we know yes I think though there
will be a large residual of uncertainty

00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,109
that we'll just have to acknowledge and
I think that's true for most of these

2636
00:55:45,109 --> 00:55:45,119
I think that's true for most of these
 

2637
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,480
I think that's true for most of these
big-picture questions that we might

00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:47,490
big-picture questions that we might
 

2639
00:55:47,490 --> 00:55:52,270
big-picture questions that we might
wonder about it's just we are small

2640
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:52,280
wonder about it's just we are small

much as we can really about the cosmos

2692
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:05,599
alternative which has to do with the
 

2693
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,680
alternative which has to do with the
motivations and interest of

2694
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:08,690
motivations and interest of
 

2695
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:12,289
motivations and interest of
technologically mature civilizations I

2696
00:57:12,289 --> 00:57:12,299
technologically mature civilizations I
 

2697
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:14,539
technologically mature civilizations I
think there is much we don't understand

2698
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:14,549
think there is much we don't understand
 

2699
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:17,960
think there is much we don't understand
about that can you talk about that a

2700
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:17,970
about that can you talk about that a
 

2701
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,190
about that can you talk about that a
little bit what do you think I mean this

2702
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:19,200
little bit what do you think I mean this
 

2703
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,809
little bit what do you think I mean this
question that pops up when you have when

2704
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:20,819
question that pops up when you have when
 

2705
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:23,059
question that pops up when you have when
you build an AGI system or build the

2706
00:57:23,059 --> 00:57:23,069
you build an AGI system or build the
 

2707
00:57:23,069 --> 00:57:26,539
you build an AGI system or build the
general intelligence or how does that

2708
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:26,549
general intelligence or how does that
 

2709
00:57:26,549 --> 00:57:28,280
general intelligence or how does that
change our motivations do you think of

2710
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:28,290
change our motivations do you think of
 

2711
00:57:28,290 --> 00:57:30,640
change our motivations do you think of
fundamentally transform our motivations

2712
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:30,650
fundamentally transform our motivations
 

2713
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,780
fundamentally transform our motivations
well it doesn't seem that implausible

2714
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:32,790
well it doesn't seem that implausible
 

2715
00:57:32,790 --> 00:57:35,150
well it doesn't seem that implausible
that once you

2716
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:35,160
that once you
 

2717
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,170
that once you
take this leap to the technological

2718
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:39,180
take this leap to the technological
 

2719
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:41,210
take this leap to the technological
maturity I mean I think like it involves

2720
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:41,220
maturity I mean I think like it involves
 

2721
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:44,210
maturity I mean I think like it involves
creating machine superintelligence

2722
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:44,220
creating machine superintelligence
 

2723
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:46,040
creating machine superintelligence
possibly that would be sort of on the

2724
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:46,050
possibly that would be sort of on the
 

2725
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:49,220
possibly that would be sort of on the
path for basically all civilizations

2726
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:49,230
path for basically all civilizations
 

2727
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:51,200
path for basically all civilizations
maybe before they are able to create

2728
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,210
maybe before they are able to create
 

2729
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:53,420
maybe before they are able to create
large numbers of ancestor simulations

2730
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:53,430
large numbers of ancestor simulations
 

2731
00:57:53,430 --> 00:57:55,970
large numbers of ancestor simulations
they would that possibly could be one of

2732
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:55,980
they would that possibly could be one of
 

2733
00:57:55,980 --> 00:57:58,460
they would that possibly could be one of
these things that quite radically

2734
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:58,470
these things that quite radically
 

2735
00:57:58,470 --> 00:58:01,310
these things that quite radically
changes the orientation of what a

2736
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:01,320
changes the orientation of what a
 

2737
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:05,440
changes the orientation of what a
civilization is in fact optimizing for

2738
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:05,450
civilization is in fact optimizing for
 

2739
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:10,700
civilization is in fact optimizing for
there are other things as well so at the

2740
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:10,710
there are other things as well so at the
 

2741
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:16,370
there are other things as well so at the
moment we have not perfect control over

2742
00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:16,380
moment we have not perfect control over
 

2743
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:20,150
moment we have not perfect control over
our own being our own mental states our

2744
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:20,160
our own being our own mental states our
 

2745
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:22,610
our own being our own mental states our
own experiences are not under our direct

2746
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:22,620
own experiences are not under our direct
 

2747
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:28,510
own experiences are not under our direct
control so for example if if you want to

2748
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:28,520
control so for example if if you want to
 

2749
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:33,320
control so for example if if you want to
experience a pleasure and happiness you

2750
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:33,330
experience a pleasure and happiness you
 

2751
00:58:33,330 --> 00:58:35,090
experience a pleasure and happiness you
might have to do a whole host of things

2752
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:35,100
might have to do a whole host of things
 

2753
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,150
might have to do a whole host of things
in the external world to try to get into

2754
00:58:38,150 --> 00:58:38,160
in the external world to try to get into
 

2755
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,550
in the external world to try to get into
the stage into the mental state where

2756
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:40,560
the stage into the mental state where
 

2757
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:42,740
the stage into the mental state where
you experience pleasure you look like

2758
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:42,750
you experience pleasure you look like
 

2759
00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:44,000
you experience pleasure you look like
some people get some pleasure from

2760
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,010
some people get some pleasure from
 

2761
00:58:44,010 --> 00:58:45,950
some people get some pleasure from
eating great food well they can just

2762
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:45,960
eating great food well they can just
 

2763
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,750
eating great food well they can just
turn that on they have to kind of

2764
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:47,760
turn that on they have to kind of
 

2765
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,030
turn that on they have to kind of
actually go to a nice restaurant and

2766
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:50,040
actually go to a nice restaurant and
 

2767
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:51,440
actually go to a nice restaurant and
then they have to make money too so

2768
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:51,450
then they have to make money too so
 

2769
00:58:51,450 --> 00:58:53,030
then they have to make money too so
there's like all this kind of activity

2770
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:53,040
there's like all this kind of activity
 

2771
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,530
there's like all this kind of activity
that maybe arises from the fact that we

2772
00:58:57,530 --> 00:58:57,540
that maybe arises from the fact that we
 

2773
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,580
that maybe arises from the fact that we
are trying to ultimately produce mental

2774
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:01,590
are trying to ultimately produce mental
 

2775
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:03,710
are trying to ultimately produce mental
states but the only way to do that is by

2776
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:03,720
states but the only way to do that is by
 

2777
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:05,450
states but the only way to do that is by
a whole host of complicated activities

2778
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:05,460
a whole host of complicated activities
 

2779
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,120
a whole host of complicated activities
in the external world now at some level

2780
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:08,130
in the external world now at some level
 

2781
00:59:08,130 --> 00:59:09,410
in the external world now at some level
of technological development I think

2782
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:09,420
of technological development I think
 

2783
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:11,720
of technological development I think
will become other potent in the sense of

2784
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:11,730
will become other potent in the sense of
 

2785
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:15,740
will become other potent in the sense of
gaining direct ability to choose our own

2786
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:15,750
gaining direct ability to choose our own
 

2787
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,020
gaining direct ability to choose our own
internal configuration and enough

2788
00:59:18,020 --> 00:59:18,030
internal configuration and enough
 

2789
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:20,180
internal configuration and enough
knowledge and insight to be able to

2790
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:20,190
knowledge and insight to be able to
 

2791
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,880
knowledge and insight to be able to
actually do that in a meaningful way so

2792
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:22,890
actually do that in a meaningful way so
 

2793
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:24,770
actually do that in a meaningful way so
then it could turn out that there are a

2794
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:24,780
then it could turn out that there are a
 

2795
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,710
then it could turn out that there are a
lot of instrumental goals that would

2796
00:59:27,710 --> 00:59:27,720
lot of instrumental goals that would
 

2797
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,900
lot of instrumental goals that would
drop out of the picture and be replaced

2798
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:29,910
drop out of the picture and be replaced
 

2799
00:59:29,910 --> 00:59:31,850
drop out of the picture and be replaced
by other instrumental goals because we

2800
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:31,860
by other instrumental goals because we
 

2801
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:35,420
by other instrumental goals because we
could now serve some of these final

2802
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:35,430
could now serve some of these final
 

2803
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:37,550
could now serve some of these final
goals in more direct ways and who knows

2804
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:37,560
goals in more direct ways and who knows
 

2805
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,090
goals in more direct ways and who knows
how all of that shakes out after

2806
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:43,100
how all of that shakes out after
 

2807
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:45,050
how all of that shakes out after
civilizations reflect on that and

2808
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:45,060
civilizations reflect on that and
 

2809
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,180
civilizations reflect on that and
converge and different attractors and so

2810
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:47,190
converge and different attractors and so
 

2811
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,590
converge and different attractors and so
on and so forth

2812
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:48,600
on and so forth
 

2813
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,560
on and so forth
and and that that could be new new

2814
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:51,570
and and that that could be new new
 

2815
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:54,770
and and that that could be new new
instrumental considerations that come

2816
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:54,780
instrumental considerations that come
 

2817
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,020
instrumental considerations that come
into view as well that that we are just

2818
00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:57,030
into view as well that that we are just
 

2819
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:59,810
into view as well that that we are just
oblivious to that would maybe have a

00:59:59,810 --> 00:59:59,820
oblivious to that would maybe have a
 

2821
00:59:59,820 --> 01:00:03,800
oblivious to that would maybe have a
strong shaping effect on actions like

2822
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:03,810
strong shaping effect on actions like
 

2823
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,540
strong shaping effect on actions like
very strong reasons to do something or

2824
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:05,550
very strong reasons to do something or
 

2825
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:07,370
very strong reasons to do something or
not to do something and we just don't

2826
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:07,380
not to do something and we just don't
 

2827
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,900
not to do something and we just don't
realize they're there because we are so

2828
01:00:08,900 --> 01:00:08,910
realize they're there because we are so
 

2829
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:11,120
realize they're there because we are so
dumb tumbling through the universe but

other simulations you do have this

2836
01:00:18,710 --> 01:00:18,720
other simulations you do have this
 

2837
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,050
other simulations you do have this

maybe there's like this additional set

2842
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:24,870
maybe there's like this additional set
 

2843
01:00:24,870 --> 01:00:26,450
maybe there's like this additional set
of considerations coming into view and

2844
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:26,460
of considerations coming into view and
 

2845
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,700
of considerations coming into view and
yesterday I it's obvious that the thing

2846
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:28,710
yesterday I it's obvious that the thing
 

2847
01:00:28,710 --> 01:00:30,890
yesterday I it's obvious that the thing
that makes sense is to do X whereas

2848
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:30,900
that makes sense is to do X whereas
 

2849
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:32,780
that makes sense is to do X whereas
right now it seems so you could X Y or Z

2850
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:32,790
right now it seems so you could X Y or Z
 

2851
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,190
right now it seems so you could X Y or Z
and different people will do different

2852
01:00:34,190 --> 01:00:34,200
and different people will do different
 

2853
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,790
and different people will do different
things and we're kind of random in that

2854
01:00:37,790 --> 01:00:37,800
things and we're kind of random in that
 

2855
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:41,390
things and we're kind of random in that
sense yeah because at this time with our

2856
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:41,400
sense yeah because at this time with our
 

2857
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,610
sense yeah because at this time with our
limited technology the impact of our

2858
01:00:43,610 --> 01:00:43,620
limited technology the impact of our
 

2859
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,620
limited technology the impact of our
decisions is minor I mean that's

2860
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:45,630
decisions is minor I mean that's
 

2861
01:00:45,630 --> 01:00:48,490
decisions is minor I mean that's
starting to change some in some ways but

2862
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:48,500
starting to change some in some ways but
 

2863
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:51,590
starting to change some in some ways but
well I'm not sure it follows that the

2864
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:51,600
well I'm not sure it follows that the
 

2865
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,750
well I'm not sure it follows that the
impacts of our decisions is minor

2866
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:53,760
impacts of our decisions is minor
 

2867
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:55,880
impacts of our decisions is minor
well it's starting to change I mean I

2868
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:55,890
well it's starting to change I mean I
 

2869
01:00:55,890 --> 01:00:58,730
well it's starting to change I mean I
suppose 100 years ago was minor it's

2870
01:00:58,730 --> 01:00:58,740
suppose 100 years ago was minor it's
 

2871
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:02,180
suppose 100 years ago was minor it's
starting to so it depends on how you

2872
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:02,190
starting to so it depends on how you
 

2873
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:05,200
starting to so it depends on how you
viewed so what people did 100 years ago

2874
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:05,210
viewed so what people did 100 years ago
 

2875
01:01:05,210 --> 01:01:08,540
viewed so what people did 100 years ago
still have effects on the world today Oh

2876
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:08,550
still have effects on the world today Oh
 

2877
01:01:08,550 --> 01:01:13,310
still have effects on the world today Oh
as a I see as a as a civilization or in

2878
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:13,320
as a I see as a as a civilization or in
 

2879
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:16,180
as a I see as a as a civilization or in
the together yeah so it might be that

2880
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:16,190
the together yeah so it might be that
 

2881
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,950
the together yeah so it might be that
the greatest impact of individuals is

2882
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:18,960
the greatest impact of individuals is
 

2883
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,520
the greatest impact of individuals is
not at technical maturity or very far

2884
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:22,530
not at technical maturity or very far
 

2885
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:25,220
not at technical maturity or very far
down it might be earlier on when there

2886
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:25,230
down it might be earlier on when there
 

2887
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:26,720
down it might be earlier on when there
are different tracks civilization could

2888
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:26,730
are different tracks civilization could
 

2889
01:01:26,730 --> 01:01:29,210
are different tracks civilization could
go down I mean maybe the population is

2890
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:29,220
go down I mean maybe the population is
 

2891
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:32,290
go down I mean maybe the population is
smaller things still haven't settled out

2892
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:32,300
smaller things still haven't settled out
 

2893
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:37,640
smaller things still haven't settled out
if you count indirect effects that that

2894
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:37,650
if you count indirect effects that that
 

2895
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:39,800
if you count indirect effects that that
that those could be bigger than the

2896
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:39,810
that those could be bigger than the
 

2897
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:42,430
that those could be bigger than the
direct effects that people have later on

2898
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:42,440
direct effects that people have later on
 

2899
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:46,370
direct effects that people have later on
so part 3 of the argument says that so

2900
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:46,380
so part 3 of the argument says that so
 

2901
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,910
so part 3 of the argument says that so
that leads us to a place where

2902
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:48,920
that leads us to a place where
 

2903
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,420
that leads us to a place where
eventually somebody creates a simulation

2904
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:52,430
eventually somebody creates a simulation
 

2905
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,740
eventually somebody creates a simulation
that I think you you had a conversation

2906
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:54,750
that I think you you had a conversation
 

2907
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:57,110
that I think you you had a conversation
Joe Rogan's I think there's some aspect

2908
01:01:57,110 --> 01:01:57,120
Joe Rogan's I think there's some aspect
 

2909
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:00,230
Joe Rogan's I think there's some aspect
here where you got stuck a little bit

2910
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:00,240
here where you got stuck a little bit
 

2911
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,890
here where you got stuck a little bit
how does that lead to were likely living

2912
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:04,900
how does that lead to were likely living
 

2913
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,700
how does that lead to were likely living
in a simulation so this kind of

2914
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:07,710
in a simulation so this kind of
 

2915
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,069
in a simulation so this kind of
probability argument if somebody

2916
01:02:11,069 --> 01:02:11,079
probability argument if somebody
 

2917
01:02:11,079 --> 01:02:12,960
probability argument if somebody
eventually creates a simulation why does

2918
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:12,970
eventually creates a simulation why does
 

2919
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:14,549
eventually creates a simulation why does
that mean that we're now in a simulation

2920
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
that mean that we're now in a simulation
 

2921
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,039
that mean that we're now in a simulation
but what you get to if you accept

2922
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:17,049
but what you get to if you accept
 

2923
01:02:17,049 --> 01:02:20,309
but what you get to if you accept
alternative three first is that would be

2924
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:20,319
alternative three first is that would be
 

2925
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:24,030
alternative three first is that would be
more simulated people with our kinds of

2926
01:02:24,030 --> 01:02:24,040
more simulated people with our kinds of
 

2927
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,460
more simulated people with our kinds of
experiences than on simulated ones like

2928
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:26,470
experiences than on simulated ones like
 

2929
01:02:26,470 --> 01:02:30,240
experiences than on simulated ones like
if in n kind of if you look at the world

2930
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:30,250
if in n kind of if you look at the world
 

2931
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:33,539
if in n kind of if you look at the world
as a whole by the end of time as it were

2932
01:02:33,539 --> 01:02:33,549
as a whole by the end of time as it were
 

2933
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:37,200
as a whole by the end of time as it were
you just count it up that would be more

2934
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:37,210
you just count it up that would be more
 

2935
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:39,150
you just count it up that would be more
simulated once than on simulated ones

2936
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:39,160
simulated once than on simulated ones
 

2937
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:42,599
simulated once than on simulated ones
then there is a an extra step to get

2938
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:42,609
then there is a an extra step to get
 

2939
01:02:42,609 --> 01:02:44,400
then there is a an extra step to get
from that if you assume that suppose for

2940
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:44,410
from that if you assume that suppose for
 

2941
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:45,500
from that if you assume that suppose for
the sake of the argument that that's

2942
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:45,510
the sake of the argument that that's
 

2943
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:50,730
the sake of the argument that that's
true how do you get from that to this

2944
01:02:50,730 --> 01:02:50,740
true how do you get from that to this
 

2945
01:02:50,740 --> 01:02:53,849
true how do you get from that to this
statement we are probably in a

2946
01:02:53,849 --> 01:02:53,859
statement we are probably in a
 

2947
01:02:53,859 --> 01:02:58,650
statement we are probably in a
simulation so here you are introducing

2948
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:58,660
simulation so here you are introducing
 

2949
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:02,750
simulation so here you are introducing
an indexical statement like it's that

2950
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:02,760
an indexical statement like it's that
 

2951
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,329
an indexical statement like it's that
this person right now is in a simulation

2952
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:06,339
this person right now is in a simulation
 

2953
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:08,880
this person right now is in a simulation
they're all these other people you know

2954
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:08,890
they're all these other people you know
 

2955
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:10,620
they're all these other people you know
that are in simulation so some that are

2956
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:10,630
that are in simulation so some that are
 

2957
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:13,710
that are in simulation so some that are
not in the simulation but what

2958
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:13,720
not in the simulation but what
 

2959
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,690
not in the simulation but what
probability should you have that you

2960
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:15,700
probability should you have that you
 

2961
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:19,589
probability should you have that you
yourself is one of the simulated ones in

2962
01:03:19,589 --> 01:03:19,599
yourself is one of the simulated ones in
 

2963
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:22,319
yourself is one of the simulated ones in
a setup so so yeah so I call it the

2964
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:22,329
a setup so so yeah so I call it the
 

2965
01:03:22,329 --> 01:03:24,240
a setup so so yeah so I call it the
bland principle of indifference which is

2966
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:24,250
bland principle of indifference which is
 

2967
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:28,500
bland principle of indifference which is
that in in cases like this when you have

2968
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:28,510
that in in cases like this when you have
 

2969
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:33,390
that in in cases like this when you have
to I guess sets of observers one of

2970
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:33,400
to I guess sets of observers one of
 

2971
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,599
to I guess sets of observers one of
which is much larger than the other and

2972
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:35,609
which is much larger than the other and
 

2973
01:03:35,609 --> 01:03:38,670
which is much larger than the other and
you can't from any internal evidence you

2974
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:38,680
you can't from any internal evidence you
 

2975
01:03:38,680 --> 01:03:43,849
you can't from any internal evidence you
have tell which that you belong to you

2976
01:03:43,849 --> 01:03:43,859
have tell which that you belong to you
 

2977
01:03:43,859 --> 01:03:46,710
have tell which that you belong to you
should design a probability that's

2978
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
should design a probability that's
 

2979
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:49,859
should design a probability that's
proportional to the size of these sets

2980
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:49,869
proportional to the size of these sets
 

2981
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:51,930
proportional to the size of these sets
so that if there are ten times more

2982
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:51,940
so that if there are ten times more
 

2983
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,420
so that if there are ten times more
simulated people with your kinds of

2984
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,430
simulated people with your kinds of
 

2985
01:03:54,430 --> 01:03:56,190
simulated people with your kinds of
experiences you would be ten times more

2986
01:03:56,190 --> 01:03:56,200
experiences you would be ten times more
 

2987
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,980
experiences you would be ten times more
likely to be one of those is that as

2988
01:03:58,980 --> 01:03:58,990
likely to be one of those is that as
 

2989
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,890
likely to be one of those is that as
intuitive as it sounds in that that

2990
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:01,900
intuitive as it sounds in that that
 

2991
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,079
intuitive as it sounds in that that
seems kind of if you don't have enough

2992
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:04,089
seems kind of if you don't have enough
 

2993
01:04:04,089 --> 01:04:06,510
seems kind of if you don't have enough
information you should rationally just

2994
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:06,520
information you should rationally just
 

2995
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,059
information you should rationally just
assign the same probability as the yeah

2996
01:04:09,059 --> 01:04:09,069
assign the same probability as the yeah
 

2997
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:12,349
assign the same probability as the yeah
kind of the size of the set it seems

2998
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:12,359
kind of the size of the set it seems
 

2999
01:04:12,359 --> 01:04:15,890
kind of the size of the set it seems
seems pretty plausible to me were the

3000
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:15,900
seems pretty plausible to me were the
 

3001
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:19,099
seems pretty plausible to me were the
holes in this is it at the at the very

3002
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:19,109
holes in this is it at the at the very
 

3003
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:21,259
holes in this is it at the at the very
beginning the assumption that everything

3004

stretches sort of you have infinite time
 

3007
01:04:24,089 --> 01:04:26,269
stretches sort of you have infinite time
essentially you don't need infinite time

3008
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:26,279
essentially you don't need infinite time
 

3009
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,660
essentially you don't need infinite time
you need what how long this is the time

3010
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:29,670
you need what how long this is the time
 

3011
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:31,819
you need what how long this is the time
what however long it takes I guess for a

creating simulations kind of like yeah I

01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:48,930
creating simulations kind of like yeah I
 

3029
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:51,470
creating simulations kind of like yeah I

different planets and some subset of
 

3035
01:04:56,190 --> 01:04:58,700
different planets and some subset of
them have life and then some subset of

them have life and then some subset of
 

3037
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:01,279

those get to intelligent life and some
 

3039
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:03,620

of those maybe eventually start creating

3043
01:05:06,089 --> 01:05:08,749

quite different times like maybe on some

3044
01:05:08,749 --> 01:05:08,759
quite different times like maybe on some

you get even bacteria then on another

you get even bacteria then on another
 

3051
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:20,049
you get even bacteria then on another

wrong with this doomsday argument that
 

3117
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:52,740
wrong with this doomsday argument that
it doesn't really hold it's like there's

it doesn't really hold it's like there's

01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:54,840
it doesn't really hold it's like there's
something wrong with it but it's proved

01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:54,850
something wrong with it but it's proved
 

3121
01:06:54,850 --> 01:06:56,730
something wrong with it but it's proved
hard to say exactly what is wrong with

01:06:56,730 --> 01:06:56,740
hard to say exactly what is wrong with
 

3123
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:56,880
hard to say exactly what is wrong with
it

3124
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:56,890
it
 

3125
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:58,200
it
and different people have different

3126
01:06:58,200 --> 01:06:58,210
and different people have different
 

3127
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:02,460
and different people have different
accounts my own view is it seems

3128
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:02,470
accounts my own view is it seems
 

3129
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:05,820
accounts my own view is it seems
inconclusive but and I can say what the

3130
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:05,830
inconclusive but and I can say what the
 

3131
01:07:05,830 --> 01:07:08,970
inconclusive but and I can say what the
argument is yeah yeah so maybe it's

3132
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:08,980
argument is yeah yeah so maybe it's
 

3133
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:15,140
argument is yeah yeah so maybe it's
easiest to explain via an analogy to

3134
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:15,150
easiest to explain via an analogy to
 

3135
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:18,420
easiest to explain via an analogy to
sampling from urns so imagine you have a

3136
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:18,430
sampling from urns so imagine you have a
 

3137
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:22,530
sampling from urns so imagine you have a
big imagine you have two urns in front

3138
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:22,540
big imagine you have two urns in front
 

3139
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:24,150
big imagine you have two urns in front
of you and they have balls in them that

3140
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:24,160
of you and they have balls in them that
 

3141
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,540
of you and they have balls in them that
have numbers so there's the tourist look

3142
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:27,550
have numbers so there's the tourist look
 

3143
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:28,860
have numbers so there's the tourist look
the same but inside one there are ten

3144
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:28,870
the same but inside one there are ten
 

3145
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:31,650
the same but inside one there are ten
balls ball number 1 2 3 up to ball

3146
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:31,660
balls ball number 1 2 3 up to ball
 

3147
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,040
balls ball number 1 2 3 up to ball
number 10 and then in the other urn you

3148
01:07:35,040 --> 01:07:35,050
number 10 and then in the other urn you
 

3149
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:39,090
number 10 and then in the other urn you
have a million balls numbered one to a

3150
01:07:39,090 --> 01:07:39,100
have a million balls numbered one to a
 

3151
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:42,390
have a million balls numbered one to a
million and somebody puts one of these

3152
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
million and somebody puts one of these
 

3153
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,230
million and somebody puts one of these
urns in front of you and asked you to

3154
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
urns in front of you and asked you to
 

3155
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:48,540
urns in front of you and asked you to
guess what what's the chance it's the 10

3156
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:48,550
guess what what's the chance it's the 10
 

3157
01:07:48,550 --> 01:07:50,730
guess what what's the chance it's the 10
ball and you say 50/50 they you know I

3158
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:50,740
ball and you say 50/50 they you know I
 

3159
01:07:50,740 --> 01:07:53,430
ball and you say 50/50 they you know I

01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,050
yeah we each have a number wait wait
wait we would each have a number in this

I mean obviously the exact number will

3266
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:03,760
I mean obviously the exact number will
 

3267
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,190
I mean obviously the exact number will
depend on where you started counting

are not really important - they're
 

3275
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,790
are not really important - they're
relatively few of those so yeah so

3276
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:14,800
relatively few of those so yeah so
 

3277
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,470
relatively few of those so yeah so
you're roughly a hundred billion now if

that you should be human number one

3296
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
that you should be human number one
 

3297
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,580

hundred billion that seems it would have

3299
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:44,700

so analogously taha in the urn case you

3313
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,979
species having a lower total number of
members that is doom soon you said doom

3314
01:11:04,979 --> 01:11:04,989
members that is doom soon you said doom
 

3315
01:11:04,989 --> 01:11:07,709
members that is doom soon you said doom
soon that's yeah well that would be the

3316
01:11:07,709 --> 01:11:07,719
soon that's yeah well that would be the
 

3317
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:09,810
soon that's yeah well that would be the
hypothesis in this case that it will end

3318
01:11:09,810 --> 01:11:09,820
hypothesis in this case that it will end
 

3319
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,270
hypothesis in this case that it will end
just a hundred billion I just like that

3320
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:12,280
just a hundred billion I just like that
 

3321
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:16,439
just a hundred billion I just like that
term for the hypothec and of crucially

3322
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:16,449
term for the hypothec and of crucially
 

3323
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:18,330
term for the hypothec and of crucially
relies on the Doomsday argument it's the

3324
01:11:18,330 --> 01:11:18,340
relies on the Doomsday argument it's the
 

3325
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:22,169
relies on the Doomsday argument it's the
idea that you should reason as if you

3326
01:11:22,169 --> 01:11:22,179
idea that you should reason as if you
 

3327
01:11:22,179 --> 01:11:24,569
idea that you should reason as if you
were a random sample from the set of all

3328
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:24,579
were a random sample from the set of all
 

3329
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:27,450
were a random sample from the set of all
humans that will ever have existed if

3330
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:27,460
humans that will ever have existed if
 

3331
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,950
humans that will ever have existed if
you have that assumption then I think

3332
01:11:28,950 --> 01:11:28,960
you have that assumption then I think
 

3333
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,529
you have that assumption then I think
the rest kind of follows the question is

3334
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:31,539
the rest kind of follows the question is
 

3335
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:34,319
the rest kind of follows the question is
why should you make that assumption in

3336
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:34,329
why should you make that assumption in
 

3337
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:36,479
why should you make that assumption in
fact you know you're 100 billion so so

3338
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:36,489
fact you know you're 100 billion so so
 

3339
01:11:36,489 --> 01:11:39,000
fact you know you're 100 billion so so
where do you get this prior and then

3340
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:39,010
where do you get this prior and then
 

3341
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:40,500
where do you get this prior and then
there is like a literature on that with

3342
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:40,510
there is like a literature on that with
 

3343
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:42,779
there is like a literature on that with
different ways of supporting that or

3344
01:11:42,779 --> 01:11:42,789
different ways of supporting that or
 

3345
01:11:42,789 --> 01:11:45,689
different ways of supporting that or
something and it that's just one example

3346
01:11:45,689 --> 01:11:45,699
something and it that's just one example
 

3347
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:47,609
something and it that's just one example
of a topic reasoning right there yeah

3348
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:47,619
of a topic reasoning right there yeah
 

3349
01:11:47,619 --> 01:11:49,979
of a topic reasoning right there yeah
that seems to be kind of convenient when

3350
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:49,989
that seems to be kind of convenient when
 

3351
01:11:49,989 --> 01:11:53,100
that seems to be kind of convenient when
you think about humanity when you when

3352
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:53,110
you think about humanity when you when
 

3353
01:11:53,110 --> 01:11:54,750
you think about humanity when you when
you think about us of even like

3354
01:11:54,750 --> 01:11:54,760
you think about us of even like
 

3355
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:57,390
you think about us of even like
existential threats and so on as it

3356
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:57,400
existential threats and so on as it
 

3357
01:11:57,400 --> 01:12:00,390
existential threats and so on as it
seems that quite naturally that you

3358
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:00,400
seems that quite naturally that you
 

3359
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:01,830
seems that quite naturally that you
should assume that you're just an

3360
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:01,840
should assume that you're just an
 

3361
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:06,149
should assume that you're just an
average case yeah that you're a kind of

3362
01:12:06,149 --> 01:12:06,159
average case yeah that you're a kind of
 

3363
01:12:06,159 --> 01:12:08,520
average case yeah that you're a kind of
a typical or randomly sampled now in the

3364
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:08,530
a typical or randomly sampled now in the
 

3365
01:12:08,530 --> 01:12:09,719
a typical or randomly sampled now in the
case of the Doomsday argument it seems

3366
01:12:09,719 --> 01:12:09,729
case of the Doomsday argument it seems
 

3367
01:12:09,729 --> 01:12:12,359
case of the Doomsday argument it seems
to lead to what intuitively we think is

3368
01:12:12,359 --> 01:12:12,369
to lead to what intuitively we think is
 

3369
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,009
to lead to what intuitively we think is
the wrong conclusion or at least many

3370
01:12:14,009 --> 01:12:14,019
the wrong conclusion or at least many
 

3371
01:12:14,019 --> 01:12:16,350
the wrong conclusion or at least many
people have this reaction that there's

3372
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:16,360
people have this reaction that there's
 

3373
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:18,540
people have this reaction that there's
got to be something fishy about this

3374
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:18,550
got to be something fishy about this
 

3375
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:20,160
got to be something fishy about this
argument because from very very weak

3376
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:20,170
argument because from very very weak
 

3377
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:23,509
argument because from very very weak
premises it gets this very striking

3378
01:12:23,509 --> 01:12:23,519
premises it gets this very striking
 

3379
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:26,399
premises it gets this very striking

humans in the future and how can we
 

3385
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:34,140
humans in the future and how can we
possibly get there just by reflecting on

possibly get there just by reflecting on

possibly get there just by reflecting on
when we were born it seems you would

3388
01:12:35,969 --> 01:12:35,979
when we were born it seems you would
 

3389
01:12:35,979 --> 01:12:37,890
when we were born it seems you would
need sophisticated arguments about the

sampling assumption the idea that you

01:12:46,090 --> 01:12:47,370
sampling assumption the idea that you
should reason as if you were a random

should reason as if you were a random

01:12:47,380 --> 01:12:49,950
should reason as if you were a random

01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:06,999
contemporary cosmology for example you
 

3415
01:13:06,999 --> 01:13:07,140
contemporary cosmology for example you
have

3416
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:07,150
have
 

3417
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:09,840
have
these multiverse theories and according

3418
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:09,850
these multiverse theories and according
 

3419
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:13,860

01:13:13,870 --> 01:13:15,330
to a lot of those all possible human
observations are made so I mean if you

3422
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:15,340
observations are made so I mean if you
 

3423
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,520
observations are made so I mean if you
have a sufficiently large universe you

3424
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:17,530
have a sufficiently large universe you
 

3425
01:13:17,530 --> 01:13:18,930
have a sufficiently large universe you
will have a lot of people observing all

3426
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:18,940
will have a lot of people observing all
 

3427
01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:22,410
will have a lot of people observing all
kinds of different things so if you have

3428
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:22,420
kinds of different things so if you have
 

3429
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:24,450
kinds of different things so if you have
two competing theories say about some

3430
01:13:24,450 --> 01:13:24,460
two competing theories say about some
 

3431
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:30,030
two competing theories say about some
the value of some constant it could be

3432
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:30,040
the value of some constant it could be
 

3433
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:32,040
the value of some constant it could be
true according to both of these theories

3434
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:32,050
true according to both of these theories
 

3435
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:34,040
true according to both of these theories
that there will be some observers

3436
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,050
that there will be some observers
 

3437
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:38,010
that there will be some observers
observing the value that corresponds to

3438
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:38,020
observing the value that corresponds to
 

3439
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:40,200
observing the value that corresponds to
the other theory because there will be

3440
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:40,210
the other theory because there will be
 

3441
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:43,200
the other theory because there will be
some observers that have elucidation so

3442
01:13:43,200 --> 01:13:43,210
some observers that have elucidation so
 

3443
01:13:43,210 --> 01:13:45,350
some observers that have elucidation so
there is a local fluctuation or an

3444
01:13:45,350 --> 01:13:45,360
there is a local fluctuation or an
 

3445
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,430
there is a local fluctuation or an
statistically anomalous measurement

3446
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:47,440
statistically anomalous measurement
 

3447
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,860
statistically anomalous measurement
these things will happen and if in us

3448
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:49,870
these things will happen and if in us
 

3449
01:13:49,870 --> 01:13:51,689
these things will happen and if in us
observers making us different

3450
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:51,699
observers making us different
 

3451
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:52,919
observers making us different
observations that would be something

3452
01:13:52,919 --> 01:13:52,929
observations that would be something
 

3453
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:54,410
observations that would be something
that sort of by chance make these

3454
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:54,420
that sort of by chance make these
 

3455
01:13:54,420 --> 01:13:56,970
that sort of by chance make these
different ones and so what we would want

3456
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:56,980
different ones and so what we would want
 

3457
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:02,790
different ones and so what we would want
to say is well many more observers a

3458
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:02,800
to say is well many more observers a
 

3459
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:04,979
to say is well many more observers a
larger proportion of the observers will

3460
01:14:04,979 --> 01:14:04,989
larger proportion of the observers will
 

3461
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:08,669
larger proportion of the observers will
observe as it were the true value and a

3462
01:14:08,669 --> 01:14:08,679
observe as it were the true value and a
 

3463
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:11,040
observe as it were the true value and a
few will observe the wrong value if we

3464
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:11,050
few will observe the wrong value if we
 

3465
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,780
few will observe the wrong value if we
think of ourselves as a random sample we

3466
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:12,790
think of ourselves as a random sample we
 

3467
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:14,669
think of ourselves as a random sample we
should expect with a very improper

3468
01:14:14,669 --> 01:14:14,679
should expect with a very improper
 

3469
01:14:14,679 --> 01:14:16,260
should expect with a very improper

bility to observe the true value on that
 

3471
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,500
bility to observe the true value on that
well then allow us to conclude that the

3472
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:19,510
well then allow us to conclude that the
 

3473
01:14:19,510 --> 01:14:21,419
well then allow us to conclude that the
evidence we actually have is evidence

3474
01:14:21,419 --> 01:14:21,429
evidence we actually have is evidence
 

3475

it kind of done is a way of making sense

3478
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:29,020
it kind of done is a way of making sense
 

3479
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,780
it kind of done is a way of making sense
of these inferences that clearly seem

3480
01:14:30,780 --> 01:14:30,790
of these inferences that clearly seem
 

3481
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:33,479
of these inferences that clearly seem
correct that we can you know make

correct that we can you know make
various observations and infer what the

3484
01:14:36,470 --> 01:14:36,480
various observations and infer what the
 

3485
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:38,669
various observations and infer what the
temperature of the cosmic background is

3486
01:14:38,669 --> 01:14:38,679
temperature of the cosmic background is
 

3487
01:14:38,679 --> 01:14:41,340
temperature of the cosmic background is
and and the the fine-structure constant

3488
01:14:41,340 --> 01:14:41,350
and and the the fine-structure constant
 

3489
01:14:41,350 --> 01:14:44,459
and and the the fine-structure constant
and all of this but it seems that

3490
01:14:44,459 --> 01:14:44,469
and all of this but it seems that
 

3491
01:14:44,469 --> 01:14:46,229
and all of this but it seems that

without rolling in some assumption
 

3493
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:49,380

similar to the self sampling assumption

3494
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:49,390
similar to the self sampling assumption

this inference just doesn't go through

01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:51,340
this inference just doesn't go through
 

3497
01:14:51,340 --> 01:14:53,399
this inference just doesn't go through
and there are the examples so so there

3498
01:14:53,399 --> 01:14:53,409
and there are the examples so so there
 

3499
01:14:53,409 --> 01:14:55,080
and there are the examples so so there
are these scientific context so it looks

3500
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:55,090
are these scientific context so it looks
 

3501
01:14:55,090 --> 01:14:56,850
are these scientific context so it looks
like this kind of anthropic reasoning is

3502
01:14:56,850 --> 01:14:56,860
like this kind of anthropic reasoning is
 

3503
01:14:56,860 --> 01:14:59,310
like this kind of anthropic reasoning is
needed and makes perfect sense and yet

3504
01:14:59,310 --> 01:14:59,320

3507
01:15:01,270 --> 01:15:03,000
in the case of the dupes argument it has
this weird consequence and people might

01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:03,010
this weird consequence and people might
 

3509
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,140
this weird consequence and people might
think there is something wrong with it

3510
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:04,150
think there is something wrong with it
 

3511
01:15:04,150 --> 01:15:09,890
think there is something wrong with it
there so there's done this project that

01:15:09,890 --> 01:15:09,900
there so there's done this project that
 

3513

much weaker than the self sampling
 

3537
01:15:40,999 --> 01:15:44,500
much weaker than the self sampling
assumption so if you think about in the

assumption so if you think about in the
 

3539
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:47,739

01:16:07,689 --> 01:16:11,560

kind of uniform probability yeah yeah

3560
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:11,570
kind of uniform probability yeah yeah

01:16:11,570 --> 01:16:13,000
kind of uniform probability yeah yeah
your role is the observer in the

your role is the observer in the
 

3563
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:14,500
your role is the observer in the
simulation argument is different it

simulation argument is different it
 

3565
01:16:14,510 --> 01:16:17,649

seems like who is the observer I mean I

3566
01:16:17,649 --> 01:16:17,659
seems like who is the observer I mean I
 

3567
01:16:17,659 --> 01:16:18,879
seems like who is the observer I mean I
keep assigning the individual

3568
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:18,889
keep assigning the individual
 

3569
01:16:18,889 --> 01:16:20,739
keep assigning the individual
consciousness yeah I mean when I say you

3570
01:16:20,739 --> 01:16:20,749
consciousness yeah I mean when I say you
 

3571
01:16:20,749 --> 01:16:22,329
consciousness yeah I mean when I say you
want a lot of observers in the

3572
01:16:22,329 --> 01:16:22,339
want a lot of observers in the
 

3573
01:16:22,339 --> 01:16:24,279
want a lot of observers in the

simulation in the context of the
 

3575
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:25,479
simulation in the context of the
simulation argument but they're all

3576
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:25,489
simulation argument but they're all
 

3577
01:16:25,489 --> 01:16:27,969
simulation argument but they're all
irrelevant the server's would be a the

3578
01:16:27,969 --> 01:16:27,979
irrelevant the server's would be a the
 

3579
01:16:27,979 --> 01:16:31,029
irrelevant the server's would be a the
people in original histories and be the

3580
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:31,039
people in original histories and be the
 

3581
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:34,029
people in original histories and be the
people in simulations so this would be

3582
01:16:34,029 --> 01:16:34,039
people in simulations so this would be
 

3583
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:36,009
people in simulations so this would be
the class of observers that we need I

3584
01:16:36,009 --> 01:16:36,019
the class of observers that we need I
 

3585
01:16:36,019 --> 01:16:37,299
the class of observers that we need I
mean there also may be the simulators

3586
01:16:37,299 --> 01:16:37,309
mean there also may be the simulators
 

3587
01:16:37,309 --> 01:16:40,329
mean there also may be the simulators
but we can set those aside for this so

3588
01:16:40,329 --> 01:16:40,339
but we can set those aside for this so
 

3589
01:16:40,339 --> 01:16:42,189
but we can set those aside for this so
the question is given that class of

3590
01:16:42,189 --> 01:16:42,199
the question is given that class of
 

3591
01:16:42,199 --> 01:16:45,040
the question is given that class of
observers a small set of original

observers a small set of original
 

3593
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,109
observers a small set of original
history observers and a large class of

01:16:47,109 --> 01:16:47,119
history observers and a large class of
 

3595
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:49,179
history observers and a large class of
simulated observers which one should you

3596
01:16:49,179 --> 01:16:49,189
simulated observers which one should you
 

3597
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:52,419
simulated observers which one should you
think is you where are you amongst this

3598
01:16:52,419 --> 01:16:52,429
think is you where are you amongst this
 

3599
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:55,719
think is you where are you amongst this
well observers I'm maybe having a little

3600
01:16:55,719 --> 01:16:55,729
well observers I'm maybe having a little
 

3601
01:16:55,729 --> 01:16:57,819
well observers I'm maybe having a little
bit trouble wrapping my head head around

3602
01:16:57,819 --> 01:16:57,829
bit trouble wrapping my head head around
 

3603
01:16:57,829 --> 01:17:00,459
bit trouble wrapping my head head around
the intricacies of what it means to be

3604
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:00,469
the intricacies of what it means to be
 

3605
01:17:00,469 --> 01:17:03,189
the intricacies of what it means to be
an observer and this and this in the

3606
01:17:03,189 --> 01:17:03,199
an observer and this and this in the
 

3607
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:06,369
an observer and this and this in the
different instantiations of the

3608
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:06,379
different instantiations of the
 

3609
01:17:06,379 --> 01:17:08,679
different instantiations of the
anthropic reasoning cases that we

3610
01:17:08,679 --> 01:17:08,689
anthropic reasoning cases that we
 

3611
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:13,060
anthropic reasoning cases that we
mention right now it I mean it may be an

3612
01:17:13,060 --> 01:17:13,070
mention right now it I mean it may be an
 

3613
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,310
mention right now it I mean it may be an
easier way of putting it is just like

3614
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:15,320
easier way of putting it is just like
 

3615
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,719
easier way of putting it is just like
are you simulated or you're not

3616
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:16,729
are you simulated or you're not
 

3617
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:19,029
are you simulated or you're not
simulated you've given this assumption

3618
01:17:19,029 --> 01:17:19,039
simulated you've given this assumption
 

3619
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:21,099
simulated you've given this assumption
that these two groups of people exist

3620
01:17:21,099 --> 01:17:21,109
that these two groups of people exist
 

3621
01:17:21,109 --> 01:17:22,689
that these two groups of people exist
yeah in the simulation case it seems

3622
01:17:22,689 --> 01:17:22,699
yeah in the simulation case it seems
 

3623
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:24,790
yeah in the simulation case it seems
pretty straightforward it's yeah so

3624
01:17:24,790 --> 01:17:24,800
pretty straightforward it's yeah so
 

3625
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:26,489
pretty straightforward it's yeah so
that's right they think the key point is

3626
01:17:26,489 --> 01:17:26,499

maybe the dune star government is sound

to run infinite demand yeah I mean if we

3732
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:53,890
to run infinite demand yeah I mean if we
 

3733
01:19:53,890 --> 01:19:57,810
to run infinite demand yeah I mean if we
take say the observed the physics in the

01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,350
you know maybe protons decay other

something like like a heat death of the

01:21:01,630 --> 01:21:03,600
something like like a heat death of the

01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:20,750
be Elon Musk right it seems like maybe
that would be more interested in

3940
01:24:20,750 --> 01:24:20,760
that would be more interested in
 

3941
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:24,439
that would be more interested in
simulating the lives of very unusual and

3942
01:24:24,439 --> 01:24:24,449
simulating the lives of very unusual and
 

3943
01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:27,620
simulating the lives of very unusual and
remarkable people so if you consider not

3944
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:27,630
remarkable people so if you consider not
 

3945
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:31,189
remarkable people so if you consider not
just assimilations where all of human

3946
01:24:31,189 --> 01:24:31,199
just assimilations where all of human
 

3947
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,540
just assimilations where all of human
history or the whole of human

3948
01:24:32,540 --> 01:24:32,550
history or the whole of human
 

3949
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:34,729
history or the whole of human
civilization are simulated but also

3950
01:24:34,729 --> 01:24:34,739
civilization are simulated but also
 

3951
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:36,640
civilization are simulated but also
other kinds of simulations which only

3952
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:36,650
other kinds of simulations which only
 

3953
01:24:36,650 --> 01:24:40,760
other kinds of simulations which only
include some subset of people like in

3954
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:40,770
include some subset of people like in
 

3955
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,680
include some subset of people like in
the industry in those simulations that

3956
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:42,690
the industry in those simulations that
 

3957
01:24:42,690 --> 01:24:44,240
the industry in those simulations that
only include a subset it might be more

3958
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:44,250
only include a subset it might be more
 

3959
01:24:44,250 --> 01:24:45,860
only include a subset it might be more
likely that that would include subsets

3960
01:24:45,860 --> 01:24:45,870
likely that that would include subsets
 

3961
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:48,379
likely that that would include subsets
of people with unusually interesting or

3962
01:24:48,379 --> 01:24:48,389
of people with unusually interesting or
 

3963
01:24:48,389 --> 01:24:50,600
of people with unusually interesting or
consequential like your Elon Musk

3964
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:50,610
consequential like your Elon Musk
 

3965
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:52,640
consequential like your Elon Musk
you got a wonder right more like yeah or

3966
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:52,650
you got a wonder right more like yeah or
 

3967
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:55,610
you got a wonder right more like yeah or
if you're like if you're Donald Trump or

3968
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:55,620
if you're like if you're Donald Trump or
 

3969
01:24:55,620 --> 01:24:57,439
if you're like if you're Donald Trump or
if you are Bill Gates or you're like

3970
01:24:57,439 --> 01:24:57,449
if you are Bill Gates or you're like
 

3971
01:24:57,449 --> 01:25:01,729
if you are Bill Gates or you're like
some particularly yeah like distinctive

3972
01:25:01,729 --> 01:25:01,739
some particularly yeah like distinctive
 

3973
01:25:01,739 --> 01:25:04,129
some particularly yeah like distinctive
character you might think that that ad I

3974
01:25:04,129 --> 01:25:04,139
character you might think that that ad I
 

3975
01:25:04,139 --> 01:25:06,350
character you might think that that ad I
mean if you just think of yourself into

3976
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:06,360
mean if you just think of yourself into
 

3977
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:08,390
mean if you just think of yourself into
the shoes right it's got to be like an

3978
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:08,400
the shoes right it's got to be like an
 

3979
01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:11,419
the shoes right it's got to be like an
extra reason to think that's kind of so

3980
01:25:11,419 --> 01:25:11,429
extra reason to think that's kind of so
 

3981
01:25:11,429 --> 01:25:15,110
extra reason to think that's kind of so
interesting so on a scale of like farmer

3982
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:15,120
interesting so on a scale of like farmer
 

3983
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:18,080
interesting so on a scale of like farmer
in Peru to you a musk the more you get

3984
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:18,090
in Peru to you a musk the more you get
 

3985
01:25:18,090 --> 01:25:19,640
in Peru to you a musk the more you get
towards the almost the higher the

3986
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:19,650
towards the almost the higher the
 

3987
01:25:19,650 --> 01:25:21,379
towards the almost the higher the
probability you're dividing that would

3988
01:25:21,379 --> 01:25:21,389
probability you're dividing that would
 

3989
01:25:21,389 --> 01:25:25,459
probability you're dividing that would
be some extra boost from that there's an

3990
01:25:25,459 --> 01:25:25,469
be some extra boost from that there's an
 

3991
01:25:25,469 --> 01:25:27,169
be some extra boost from that there's an
extra boost so he also asked the

3992
01:25:27,169 --> 01:25:27,179
extra boost so he also asked the
 

3993
01:25:27,179 --> 01:25:29,810
extra boost so he also asked the
question of what he would ask an AGI

3994
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:29,820
question of what he would ask an AGI
 

3995
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:32,720
question of what he would ask an AGI
saying the question being what's outside

3996
01:25:32,720 --> 01:25:32,730
saying the question being what's outside
 

3997
01:25:32,730 --> 01:25:36,229
saying the question being what's outside
the simulation do you think about the

3998
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:36,239
the simulation do you think about the
 

3999
01:25:36,239 --> 01:25:38,360
the simulation do you think about the
answer to this question if we are living

4000
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:38,370
answer to this question if we are living
 

4001
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:40,340
answer to this question if we are living
a simulation what is outside the

4002
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:40,350
a simulation what is outside the
 

4003
01:25:40,350 --> 01:25:43,760
a simulation what is outside the
simulation so the programmer of the

4004
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:43,770
simulation so the programmer of the
 

4005
01:25:43,770 --> 01:25:46,220
simulation so the programmer of the
simulation yeah I mean I think it

4006
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:46,230
simulation yeah I mean I think it
 

4007
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:47,840
simulation yeah I mean I think it
connects to the question of what's

4008
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:47,850
connects to the question of what's
 

4009
01:25:47,850 --> 01:25:50,959
connects to the question of what's
inside the simulation in that if you had

4010
01:25:50,959 --> 01:25:50,969
inside the simulation in that if you had
 

4011
01:25:50,969 --> 01:25:53,360
inside the simulation in that if you had
views about the Craters of the

4012
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:53,370
views about the Craters of the
 

4013
01:25:53,370 --> 01:25:56,570
views about the Craters of the
simulation it might help you make

4014
01:25:56,570 --> 01:25:56,580
simulation it might help you make
 

4015
01:25:56,580 --> 01:25:57,620
simulation it might help you make
predictions about what kind of

4016
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:57,630
predictions about what kind of
 

4017
01:25:57,630 --> 01:26:00,020
predictions about what kind of
simulation it is what what might what

4018
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:00,030
simulation it is what what might what
 

4019
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:02,870
simulation it is what what might what
might happen what you know happens after

4020
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:02,880
might happen what you know happens after
 

4021
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:04,280
might happen what you know happens after
the simulation if there is some after

4022
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:04,290
the simulation if there is some after
 

4023
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:06,860
the simulation if there is some after
but also like the kind of setup so these

4024
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:06,870
but also like the kind of setup so these
 

4025
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,590
but also like the kind of setup so these
these two questions would be quite

4026
01:26:08,590 --> 01:26:08,600
these two questions would be quite
 

4027
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:12,950
these two questions would be quite
closely intertwined but do you think

4028
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:12,960
closely intertwined but do you think
 

4029
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:15,439
closely intertwined but do you think
you'll be very surprising to it like is

4030
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:15,449
you'll be very surprising to it like is
 

4031
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:18,080
you'll be very surprising to it like is
the stuff inside the simulation is it

4032
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:18,090
the stuff inside the simulation is it
 

4033
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:19,430
the stuff inside the simulation is it
possible for it to be fundamentally

4034
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:19,440
possible for it to be fundamentally
 

4035
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:22,010
possible for it to be fundamentally
different than the stuff outside yeah

4036
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:22,020
different than the stuff outside yeah
 

4037
01:26:22,020 --> 01:26:25,310
different than the stuff outside yeah
like I got another way to put it can the

4038
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:25,320
like I got another way to put it can the
 

4039
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,020
like I got another way to put it can the
creatures inside the simulation

4040
01:26:27,020 --> 01:26:27,030
creatures inside the simulation
 

4041
01:26:27,030 --> 01:26:30,049
creatures inside the simulation
and be smart enough to even understand

4042
01:26:30,049 --> 01:26:30,059
and be smart enough to even understand
 

4043
01:26:30,059 --> 01:26:31,939
and be smart enough to even understand
or have the cognitive capabilities or

4044
01:26:31,939 --> 01:26:31,949
or have the cognitive capabilities or

01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,700
capabilities enough to understand the
mechanism that created them they might

4050
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:40,710
mechanism that created them they might
 

4051
01:26:40,710 --> 01:26:44,299
mechanism that created them they might
understand some aspects of it I mean

4052
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:44,309
understand some aspects of it I mean
 

4053
01:26:44,309 --> 01:26:47,049
understand some aspects of it I mean
it's a love all of its kind of there are

4054
01:26:47,049 --> 01:26:47,059
it's a love all of its kind of there are
 

4055
01:26:47,059 --> 01:26:50,149
it's a love all of its kind of there are
levels of explanation like degrees to

4056
01:26:50,149 --> 01:26:50,159
levels of explanation like degrees to
 

4057
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:51,500
levels of explanation like degrees to
which you can understand so does your

4058
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:51,510
which you can understand so does your
 

4059
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:53,750
which you can understand so does your
dog understand what it is to be human

4060
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:53,760
dog understand what it is to be human
 

4061
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:55,549
dog understand what it is to be human
well it's got some idea like humans are

4062
01:26:55,549 --> 01:26:55,559
well it's got some idea like humans are
 

4063
01:26:55,559 --> 01:26:57,770
well it's got some idea like humans are
these physical objects that move around

4064
01:26:57,770 --> 01:26:57,780
these physical objects that move around
 

4065
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:01,970
these physical objects that move around
and do things and I a normal human would

4066
01:27:01,970 --> 01:27:01,980
and do things and I a normal human would
 

4067
01:27:01,980 --> 01:27:04,220
and do things and I a normal human would
have a deeper understanding of what it

4068
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:04,230
have a deeper understanding of what it
 

4069
01:27:04,230 --> 01:27:08,140
have a deeper understanding of what it
is to be a human and maybe some very

4070
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:08,150
is to be a human and maybe some very
 

4071
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,370
is to be a human and maybe some very
experienced psychic psychologist or

4072
01:27:10,370 --> 01:27:10,380
experienced psychic psychologist or
 

4073
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,109
experienced psychic psychologist or
great novelist might understand a little

4074
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:12,119
great novelist might understand a little
 

4075
01:27:12,119 --> 01:27:13,459
great novelist might understand a little
bit more about what it is to be human

4076
01:27:13,459 --> 01:27:13,469
bit more about what it is to be human
 

4077
01:27:13,469 --> 01:27:16,250
bit more about what it is to be human
and maybe super intelligence could see

4078
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:16,260
and maybe super intelligence could see
 

4079
01:27:16,260 --> 01:27:20,299
and maybe super intelligence could see
right through your soul so similarly I I

4080
01:27:20,299 --> 01:27:20,309
right through your soul so similarly I I
 

4081
01:27:20,309 --> 01:27:24,919
right through your soul so similarly I I
do think that that we are quite limited

4082
01:27:24,919 --> 01:27:24,929
do think that that we are quite limited
 

4083
01:27:24,929 --> 01:27:27,140
do think that that we are quite limited
in our ability to understand all of the

4084
01:27:27,140 --> 01:27:27,150
in our ability to understand all of the
 

4085
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:29,870
in our ability to understand all of the
relevant aspects of the larger context

4086
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:29,880
relevant aspects of the larger context
 

4087
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,660
relevant aspects of the larger context
that we exist in but there might be hope

4088
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:32,670
that we exist in but there might be hope
 

4089
01:27:32,670 --> 01:27:35,330
that we exist in but there might be hope
first I think we understand some aspects

4090
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:35,340
first I think we understand some aspects
 

4091
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:37,939
first I think we understand some aspects
of it but you know how much good is that

4092
01:27:37,939 --> 01:27:37,949
of it but you know how much good is that
 

4093
01:27:37,949 --> 01:27:41,930
of it but you know how much good is that
if there's like one key aspect that

4094
01:27:41,930 --> 01:27:41,940
if there's like one key aspect that
 

4095
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,580
if there's like one key aspect that
changes the significance of all the

4096
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:43,590
changes the significance of all the
 

4097
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,979
changes the significance of all the
other aspects so we understand maybe

4098
01:27:45,979 --> 01:27:45,989
other aspects so we understand maybe
 

4099
01:27:45,989 --> 01:27:49,010
other aspects so we understand maybe
it's seven out of ten key insights that

4100
01:27:49,010 --> 01:27:49,020
it's seven out of ten key insights that
 

4101
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:52,870
it's seven out of ten key insights that
you need but but the answer actually

4102
01:27:52,870 --> 01:27:52,880
you need but but the answer actually
 

4103
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:56,600
you need but but the answer actually
like varies completely depending on what

4104
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:56,610
like varies completely depending on what
 

4105
01:27:56,610 --> 01:27:58,459
like varies completely depending on what
like number eight nine and ten insight

4106
01:27:58,459 --> 01:27:58,469
like number eight nine and ten insight
 

4107
01:27:58,469 --> 01:28:04,430
like number eight nine and ten insight
is it's like whether you wanna suppose

4108
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:04,440
is it's like whether you wanna suppose
 

4109
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:06,649
is it's like whether you wanna suppose
that the big tasks were to guess whether

4110
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:06,659
that the big tasks were to guess whether
 

4111
01:28:06,659 --> 01:28:10,189
that the big tasks were to guess whether
a certain number was odd or even like a

4112
01:28:10,189 --> 01:28:10,199
a certain number was odd or even like a
 

4113
01:28:10,199 --> 01:28:12,950
a certain number was odd or even like a
ten digit number and if it's if it's

4114
01:28:12,950 --> 01:28:12,960
ten digit number and if it's if it's
 

4115
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:15,200
ten digit number and if it's if it's
even the best thing for you to do in

4116
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:15,210
even the best thing for you to do in
 

4117
01:28:15,210 --> 01:28:17,180
even the best thing for you to do in
life is to go north and if it's odd the

4118
01:28:17,180 --> 01:28:17,190
life is to go north and if it's odd the
 

4119
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:21,169
life is to go north and if it's odd the
best thing for you to go south now we

4120
01:28:21,169 --> 01:28:21,179
best thing for you to go south now we
 

4121
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:22,819
best thing for you to go south now we
are in a situation where maybe through

4122
01:28:22,819 --> 01:28:22,829
are in a situation where maybe through
 

4123
01:28:22,829 --> 01:28:24,680
are in a situation where maybe through
our science and philosophy we figured

4124
01:28:24,680 --> 01:28:24,690
our science and philosophy we figured
 

4125
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:27,049
our science and philosophy we figured
out what the first seven digits are so

4126
01:28:27,049 --> 01:28:27,059
out what the first seven digits are so
 

4127
01:28:27,059 --> 01:28:28,640
out what the first seven digits are so
we have a lot of information right most

4128
01:28:28,640 --> 01:28:28,650
we have a lot of information right most
 

4129
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:32,029
we have a lot of information right most
of it we figured out but we are clueless

4130
01:28:32,029 --> 01:28:32,039
of it we figured out but we are clueless
 

4131
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:34,399
of it we figured out but we are clueless
about what the last three digits are so

4132
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:34,409
about what the last three digits are so
 

4133
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,740
about what the last three digits are so
we are still completely clueless about

4134
01:28:36,740 --> 01:28:36,750
we are still completely clueless about
 

4135
01:28:36,750 --> 01:28:38,359
we are still completely clueless about
whether the number is odd or even and

4136
01:28:38,359 --> 01:28:38,369
whether the number is odd or even and
 

4137
01:28:38,369 --> 01:28:40,170
whether the number is odd or even and
therefore whether we should go nor

4138
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:40,180
therefore whether we should go nor
 

4139
01:28:40,180 --> 01:28:42,570
therefore whether we should go nor
go south I feel that's that's an analogy

4140
01:28:42,570 --> 01:28:42,580
go south I feel that's that's an analogy
 

4141
01:28:42,580 --> 01:28:44,790
go south I feel that's that's an analogy
but I feel we're somewhat in that

4142
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
but I feel we're somewhat in that
 

4143
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:47,010
but I feel we're somewhat in that
predicament we know a lot about the

4144
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:47,020
predicament we know a lot about the
 

4145
01:28:47,020 --> 01:28:50,460
predicament we know a lot about the
universe we've come maybe more than half

4146
01:28:50,460 --> 01:28:50,470
universe we've come maybe more than half
 

4147
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:51,900

completely change the overall upshot of
 

4155
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,290
completely change the overall upshot of
the thing and including change our

yeah I think your analogy of us being

4164
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,000
yeah I think your analogy of us being
 

4165
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,540
yeah I think your analogy of us being
the dog trying to understand human

4166
01:29:12,540 --> 01:29:12,550
the dog trying to understand human
 

4167
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:15,750
the dog trying to understand human
beings as a as an entertaining one and

01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:15,760
beings as a as an entertaining one and
 

4169
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:16,830
beings as a as an entertaining one and
probably correct

4170
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:16,840
probably correct
 

4171
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:20,250
probably correct
the closer the understanding tends from

4172
01:29:20,250 --> 01:29:20,260
the closer the understanding tends from
 

4173
01:29:20,260 --> 01:29:22,890
the closer the understanding tends from
the dog's viewpoint to us human

01:29:27,450 --> 01:29:27,460
the way there will have completely
 

4179
01:29:27,460 --> 01:29:29,400
the way there will have completely
transformative ideas of what it means to

01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:29,410
transformative ideas of what it means to
 

4181
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:32,250
transformative ideas of what it means to
be human so the dog has a very shallow

4182
01:29:32,250 --> 01:29:32,260
be human so the dog has a very shallow
 

4183
01:29:32,260 --> 01:29:34,950

understanding it's interesting to think

4184
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:34,960
understanding it's interesting to think
 

4185
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,310
understanding it's interesting to think
that and analogize that a dog's

4186
01:29:38,310 --> 01:29:38,320
that and analogize that a dog's
 

4187
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,110
that and analogize that a dog's
understanding of a human being is the

4188
01:29:40,110 --> 01:29:40,120
understanding of a human being is the
 

4189
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:42,600
understanding of a human being is the
same as our current understanding of the

4190
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:42,610
same as our current understanding of the
 

4191
01:29:42,610 --> 01:29:44,310

universe man okay we spent an hour 40

4194
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:50,050
universe man okay we spent an hour 40
 

4195
01:29:50,050 --> 01:29:51,570
universe man okay we spent an hour 40
minutes talking about the simulation I

4196
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:51,580
minutes talking about the simulation I
 

4197
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,820
minutes talking about the simulation I
like it let's talk about super

4198
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:53,830
like it let's talk about super
 

4199
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:55,880
like it let's talk about super
intelligence at least for a little bit

4200
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:55,890
intelligence at least for a little bit
 

4201
01:29:55,890 --> 01:29:59,340
intelligence at least for a little bit
and let's start at the basics what tu is

4202
01:29:59,340 --> 01:29:59,350
and let's start at the basics what tu is
 

4203
01:29:59,350 --> 01:30:03,600
and let's start at the basics what tu is
intelligence yeah I didn't not to get

4204
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:03,610
intelligence yeah I didn't not to get
 

4205
01:30:03,610 --> 01:30:05,970
intelligence yeah I didn't not to get
too stuck with the definitional question

4206
01:30:05,970 --> 01:30:05,980
too stuck with the definitional question
 

4207
01:30:05,980 --> 01:30:08,280
too stuck with the definitional question
I mean I the common sense understanding

4208
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:08,290
I mean I the common sense understanding
 

4209
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:10,140
I mean I the common sense understanding
like the ability to solve complex

4210
01:30:10,140 --> 01:30:10,150
like the ability to solve complex
 

4211
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:12,930
like the ability to solve complex
problems to learn from experience to

4212
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:12,940
problems to learn from experience to
 

4213
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:17,460
problems to learn from experience to
plan to reason some combination of

4214
01:30:17,460 --> 01:30:17,470
plan to reason some combination of
 

4215
01:30:17,470 --> 01:30:19,950
plan to reason some combination of
things like that it's got this mixed up

4216
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:19,960
things like that it's got this mixed up
 

4217
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:22,140
things like that it's got this mixed up
into that or no it's consciousness mixed

4218
01:30:22,140 --> 01:30:22,150
into that or no it's consciousness mixed
 

4219
01:30:22,150 --> 01:30:23,940
into that or no it's consciousness mixed
up into that as well I don't think I

4220
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:23,950
up into that as well I don't think I
 

4221
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:26,190
up into that as well I don't think I
think it could be fairly intelligent at

4222
01:30:26,190 --> 01:30:26,200
think it could be fairly intelligent at
 

4223
01:30:26,200 --> 01:30:28,950
think it could be fairly intelligent at
least without being conscious probably

4224
01:30:28,950 --> 01:30:28,960
least without being conscious probably
 

4225
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,850
least without being conscious probably
and so then what is super intelligence

4226
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:32,860
and so then what is super intelligence
 

4227
01:30:32,860 --> 01:30:34,650
and so then what is super intelligence
so yeah that would be like something

4228
01:30:34,650 --> 01:30:34,660
so yeah that would be like something
 

4229
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:38,700
so yeah that would be like something
that was much more had much more general

4230
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:38,710
that was much more had much more general
 

4231
01:30:38,710 --> 01:30:41,040
that was much more had much more general
cognitive capacity than we humans have

4232
01:30:41,040 --> 01:30:41,050
cognitive capacity than we humans have
 

4233
01:30:41,050 --> 01:30:44,610
cognitive capacity than we humans have
so if we talk about general super

4234
01:30:44,610 --> 01:30:44,620
so if we talk about general super
 

4235
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:46,670
so if we talk about general super
intelligence it would be much faster

4236
01:30:46,670 --> 01:30:46,680
intelligence it would be much faster
 

4237
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,500
intelligence it would be much faster
learner be able to recent much better

4238
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:49,510
learner be able to recent much better
 

4239
01:30:49,510 --> 01:30:51,630
learner be able to recent much better

super intelligence do you think super

4250
01:31:04,949 --> 01:31:04,959
super intelligence do you think super

01:31:04,959 --> 01:31:07,620
super intelligence do you think super

intelligence has to exist in the
 

4253
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:09,949
intelligence has to exist in the
physical world or can it be digital only

01:31:09,949 --> 01:31:09,959
physical world or can it be digital only
 

4255
01:31:09,959 --> 01:31:12,629
physical world or can it be digital only
sort of we think of our general

4256
01:31:12,629 --> 01:31:12,639
sort of we think of our general
 

4257
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:16,069
sort of we think of our general
intelligence as us humans as an

01:31:16,069 --> 01:31:16,079
intelligence as us humans as an
 

4259

intelligence as us humans as an
intelligence that's associated with the

01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:19,799
intelligence that's associated with the
body that's able to interact with the

directly with physically I mean digital

4266
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:24,550
directly with physically I mean digital
 

4267
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,399
directly with physically I mean digital
always perfectly fine I think I mean you

4268
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:26,409
always perfectly fine I think I mean you
 

4269
01:31:26,409 --> 01:31:28,199
always perfectly fine I think I mean you
you could you it's physical in the sense

4270
01:31:28,199 --> 01:31:28,209
you could you it's physical in the sense
 

4271
01:31:28,209 --> 01:31:30,959
you could you it's physical in the sense
that obviously the computers and the

4272
01:31:30,959 --> 01:31:30,969
that obviously the computers and the
 

4273
01:31:30,969 --> 01:31:32,909
that obviously the computers and the
memories are physical but its capability

4274
01:31:32,909 --> 01:31:32,919
memories are physical but its capability
 

4275
01:31:32,919 --> 01:31:35,069
memories are physical but its capability
to affect the world sort of could be

4276
01:31:35,069 --> 01:31:35,079
to affect the world sort of could be
 

4277
01:31:35,079 --> 01:31:39,390
to affect the world sort of could be
very strong even if it has a limited set

4278
01:31:39,390 --> 01:31:39,400
very strong even if it has a limited set
 

4279
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:42,209
very strong even if it has a limited set
of actuators if it can types text on the

4280
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:42,219
of actuators if it can types text on the
 

4281
01:31:42,219 --> 01:31:43,890
of actuators if it can types text on the
screen or something like that that would

4282
01:31:43,890 --> 01:31:43,900
screen or something like that that would
 

4283
01:31:43,900 --> 01:31:47,759
screen or something like that that would
be I think ample so in terms of the

4284
01:31:47,759 --> 01:31:47,769
be I think ample so in terms of the
 

4285
01:31:47,769 --> 01:31:51,029
be I think ample so in terms of the
concerns of existential threat of AI how

4286
01:31:51,029 --> 01:31:51,039
concerns of existential threat of AI how
 

4287
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:53,669
concerns of existential threat of AI how
can any AI system that's in the digital

4288
01:31:53,669 --> 01:31:53,679
can any AI system that's in the digital
 

4289
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:58,560
can any AI system that's in the digital
world have existential risk sort of what

4290
01:31:58,560 --> 01:31:58,570
world have existential risk sort of what
 

4291
01:31:58,570 --> 01:32:00,689
world have existential risk sort of what
what are the attack vectors for a

4292
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:00,699
what are the attack vectors for a
 

4293
01:32:00,699 --> 01:32:02,819
what are the attack vectors for a
digital system well I mean I guess maybe

4294
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:02,829
digital system well I mean I guess maybe
 

4295
01:32:02,829 --> 01:32:04,830
digital system well I mean I guess maybe
to take one step back so I should

4296
01:32:04,830 --> 01:32:04,840
to take one step back so I should
 

4297
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:08,129
to take one step back so I should
emphasize that I also think there's this

4298
01:32:08,129 --> 01:32:08,139
emphasize that I also think there's this
 

4299
01:32:08,139 --> 01:32:11,129
emphasize that I also think there's this
huge positive potential from machine

4300
01:32:11,129 --> 01:32:11,139
huge positive potential from machine
 

4301
01:32:11,139 --> 01:32:12,689
huge positive potential from machine
intelligence including super

intelligence including super
 

4303
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:15,750
intelligence including super
intelligence and I want to stress that

4304
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:15,760
intelligence and I want to stress that
 

4305
01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:17,969
intelligence and I want to stress that
because like some of my write writing

4306
01:32:17,969 --> 01:32:17,979
because like some of my write writing
 

4307
01:32:17,979 --> 01:32:20,429
because like some of my write writing
has focused on what can go wrong and

4308
01:32:20,429 --> 01:32:20,439
has focused on what can go wrong and
 

4309
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:22,890
has focused on what can go wrong and
when I wrote the book super intelligence

4310
01:32:22,890 --> 01:32:22,900
when I wrote the book super intelligence
 

4311
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:27,089
when I wrote the book super intelligence
at that point I felt that was a kind of

4312
01:32:27,089 --> 01:32:27,099
at that point I felt that was a kind of
 

4313
01:32:27,099 --> 01:32:30,899
at that point I felt that was a kind of
neglect of what would happen if AI

4314
01:32:30,899 --> 01:32:30,909
neglect of what would happen if AI
 

4315
01:32:30,909 --> 01:32:33,359
neglect of what would happen if AI
succeeds and in particular a need to get

4316
01:32:33,359 --> 01:32:33,369
succeeds and in particular a need to get
 

4317
01:32:33,369 --> 01:32:35,159
succeeds and in particular a need to get
a more granular understanding of where

4318
01:32:35,159 --> 01:32:35,169
a more granular understanding of where
 

4319
01:32:35,169 --> 01:32:38,189
a more granular understanding of where
the pitfalls are so we can avoid them I

4320
01:32:38,189 --> 01:32:38,199
the pitfalls are so we can avoid them I
 

4321
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:40,919
the pitfalls are so we can avoid them I
think that since since the book came out

4322
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:40,929
think that since since the book came out
 

4323
01:32:40,929 --> 01:32:44,759
think that since since the book came out
in 2014 there has been a much wider

4324
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:44,769
in 2014 there has been a much wider
 

4325
01:32:44,769 --> 01:32:47,129
in 2014 there has been a much wider
recognition of that and a number of

4326
01:32:47,129 --> 01:32:47,139
recognition of that and a number of
 

4327
01:32:47,139 --> 01:32:48,870
recognition of that and a number of
research groups are not actually working

4328
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:48,880
research groups are not actually working
 

4329
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:51,149
research groups are not actually working
on developing say AI alignments

4330
01:32:51,149 --> 01:32:51,159
on developing say AI alignments
 

4331
01:32:51,159 --> 01:32:52,909
on developing say AI alignments
techniques and so on and so forth so

4332
01:32:52,909 --> 01:32:52,919
techniques and so on and so forth so
 

4333
01:32:52,919 --> 01:32:55,949
techniques and so on and so forth so
that's I'd I'd like yeah I think now

4334
01:32:55,949 --> 01:32:55,959
that's I'd I'd like yeah I think now
 

4335
01:32:55,959 --> 01:33:00,239
that's I'd I'd like yeah I think now
it's important to make sure we bring

4336
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:00,249
it's important to make sure we bring
 

4337
01:33:00,249 --> 01:33:02,040
it's important to make sure we bring
back onto the table the upside as well

4338
01:33:02,040 --> 01:33:02,050
back onto the table the upside as well
 

4339
01:33:02,050 --> 01:33:03,899
back onto the table the upside as well
and there's a little bit of a neglect

4340
01:33:03,899 --> 01:33:03,909
and there's a little bit of a neglect
 

4341
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:06,899
and there's a little bit of a neglect
now on the upside which is I mean if you

4342
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:06,909
now on the upside which is I mean if you
 

4343
01:33:06,909 --> 01:33:07,690
now on the upside which is I mean if you
look at

4344
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:07,700
look at
 

4345
01:33:07,700 --> 01:33:09,460
look at
talking to a friend if you look at the

4346
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:09,470
talking to a friend if you look at the
 

4347
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:11,140
talking to a friend if you look at the
amount of information there's available

4348
01:33:11,140 --> 01:33:11,150
amount of information there's available
 

4349
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:13,150
amount of information there's available
or people talking and people being

01:33:13,150 --> 01:33:13,160
or people talking and people being
 

4351
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,040
or people talking and people being

4352
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:15,050

these two different contexts of thinking

4372
01:33:45,130 --> 01:33:45,140
these two different contexts of thinking
 

4373
01:33:45,140 --> 01:33:48,040
these two different contexts of thinking
about AI and high impacts they're kind

01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:48,050
about AI and high impacts they're kind

01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:49,570
about AI and high impacts they're kind
of near term and long term if you want

4376
01:33:49,570 --> 01:33:49,580
of near term and long term if you want
 

4377
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:52,300
of near term and long term if you want
both of which I think are legitimate

4378
01:33:52,300 --> 01:33:52,310
both of which I think are legitimate
 

4379
01:33:52,310 --> 01:33:54,970
both of which I think are legitimate
things to think about and people should

4380
01:33:54,970 --> 01:33:54,980
things to think about and people should
 

4381
01:33:54,980 --> 01:33:58,420
things to think about and people should
you know discuss both of them but but

4382
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:58,430
you know discuss both of them but but
 

4383
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:00,600
you know discuss both of them but but
they are different and they often get

4384
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:00,610
they are different and they often get
 

4385
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:04,420
they are different and they often get
mixed up and then then I get you get

4386
01:34:04,420 --> 01:34:04,430
mixed up and then then I get you get
 

4387
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:05,680
mixed up and then then I get you get
confusion like I think you get

4388
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:05,690
confusion like I think you get
 

4389
01:34:05,690 --> 01:34:06,700
confusion like I think you get
simultaneously I've maybe been

4390
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:06,710
simultaneously I've maybe been
 

4391
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:08,680
simultaneously I've maybe been
overhyping of the near term and and

4392
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:08,690
overhyping of the near term and and
 

4393
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:10,720
overhyping of the near term and and
under hyping of the long term and so I

4394
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:10,730
under hyping of the long term and so I
 

4395
01:34:10,730 --> 01:34:12,250
under hyping of the long term and so I
think as long as we keep them apart we

4396
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:12,260
think as long as we keep them apart we
 

4397
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:15,420
think as long as we keep them apart we
can have like two good conversations but

4398
01:34:15,420 --> 01:34:15,430
can have like two good conversations but
 

4399
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:17,620
can have like two good conversations but
or we can mix them together and have one

4400
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:17,630
or we can mix them together and have one
 

4401
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:19,810
or we can mix them together and have one
bad conversation can you clarify just oh

4402
01:34:19,810 --> 01:34:19,820
bad conversation can you clarify just oh
 

4403
01:34:19,820 --> 01:34:21,700
bad conversation can you clarify just oh
the two things we were talking about the

4404
01:34:21,700 --> 01:34:21,710
the two things we were talking about the
 

4405
01:34:21,710 --> 01:34:23,560
the two things we were talking about the
near term and long term yeah and what

4406
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:23,570
near term and long term yeah and what
 

4407
01:34:23,570 --> 01:34:26,620
near term and long term yeah and what
are the distinction well it's a blurry

4408
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:26,630
are the distinction well it's a blurry
 

4409
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:29,110
are the distinction well it's a blurry
distinction but say the things I wrote

4410
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:29,120
distinction but say the things I wrote
 

4411
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,500
distinction but say the things I wrote
about in this book super intelligence

4412
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:31,510
about in this book super intelligence
 

4413
01:34:31,510 --> 01:34:35,260
about in this book super intelligence
long term things people are worrying

4414
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:35,270
long term things people are worrying
 

4415
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:37,870
long term things people are worrying
about today with I don't know

4416
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:37,880
about today with I don't know
 

4417
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,480
about today with I don't know
algorithmic discrimination or even

4418
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:40,490
algorithmic discrimination or even
 

4419
01:34:40,490 --> 01:34:43,600
algorithmic discrimination or even
things self-driving cars and drones and

4420
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:43,610
things self-driving cars and drones and
 

4421
01:34:43,610 --> 01:34:47,560
things self-driving cars and drones and
stuff more near term and then then of

4422
01:34:47,560 --> 01:34:47,570
stuff more near term and then then of
 

4423
01:34:47,570 --> 01:34:49,780
stuff more near term and then then of
course you could you button some medium

4424
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:49,790
course you could you button some medium
 

4425
01:34:49,790 --> 01:34:51,490
course you could you button some medium
term where that kind of overlap and they

4426
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:51,500
term where that kind of overlap and they
 

4427
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:55,420
term where that kind of overlap and they
want evolves into the other but I don't

4428
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:55,430
want evolves into the other but I don't
 

4429
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:57,700
want evolves into the other but I don't
write I think both yeah the dishes look

4430
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:57,710
write I think both yeah the dishes look
 

4431
01:34:57,710 --> 01:35:00,160
write I think both yeah the dishes look
kind of somewhat different depending on

4432
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:00,170
kind of somewhat different depending on
 

4433
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,620
kind of somewhat different depending on
which of these contexts so I think I

4434
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:02,630
which of these contexts so I think I
 

4435
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,510
which of these contexts so I think I
think it'd be nice if we can talk about

4436
01:35:04,510 --> 01:35:04,520
think it'd be nice if we can talk about
 

4437
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:09,540
think it'd be nice if we can talk about
the long term mm-hm and think about a

4438
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:09,550
the long term mm-hm and think about a
 

4439
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:13,870
the long term mm-hm and think about a
positive impact or a better world

4440
01:35:13,870 --> 01:35:13,880
positive impact or a better world
 

4441
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:16,030
positive impact or a better world
because of the existence of the long

4442
01:35:16,030 --> 01:35:16,040
because of the existence of the long
 

4443
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:17,950
because of the existence of the long
term super intelligent now do you have

4444
01:35:17,950 --> 01:35:17,960
term super intelligent now do you have
 

4445
01:35:17,960 --> 01:35:19,960
term super intelligent now do you have
the use of such a war yeah I mean it I

4446
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:19,970
the use of such a war yeah I mean it I
 

4447
01:35:19,970 --> 01:35:21,850
the use of such a war yeah I mean it I
guess it's a little harder

4448
01:35:21,850 --> 01:35:21,860
guess it's a little harder
 

4449
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:23,979
guess it's a little harder
chicklet because it seems obvious that

4450
01:35:23,979 --> 01:35:23,989
chicklet because it seems obvious that
 

4451
01:35:23,989 --> 01:35:26,620
chicklet because it seems obvious that
the world has a lot of problems as it

4452
01:35:26,620 --> 01:35:26,630
the world has a lot of problems as it
 

4453
01:35:26,630 --> 01:35:31,270
the world has a lot of problems as it
currently stands and it's hard to think

4454
01:35:31,270 --> 01:35:31,280
currently stands and it's hard to think
 

4455
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:33,939
currently stands and it's hard to think
of any one of those which it wouldn't be

4456
01:35:33,939 --> 01:35:33,949
of any one of those which it wouldn't be
 

4457
01:35:33,949 --> 01:35:37,209
of any one of those which it wouldn't be
useful to have like a friendly aligned

4458
01:35:37,209 --> 01:35:37,219
useful to have like a friendly aligned
 

4459
01:35:37,219 --> 01:35:41,050
useful to have like a friendly aligned
super intelligence working on so from

4460
01:35:41,050 --> 01:35:41,060
super intelligence working on so from
 

4461
01:35:41,060 --> 01:35:44,859
super intelligence working on so from
health you know to the economic system

4462
01:35:44,859 --> 01:35:44,869
health you know to the economic system
 

4463
01:35:44,869 --> 01:35:47,100
health you know to the economic system
to be able to sort of improve the

4464
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:47,110
to be able to sort of improve the
 

4465
01:35:47,110 --> 01:35:49,870
to be able to sort of improve the
investment and trade and foreign policy

4466
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:49,880
investment and trade and foreign policy
 

4467
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:52,180

decisions all that kind of stuff all

4468
01:35:52,180 --> 01:35:52,190
decisions all that kind of stuff all
 

4469
01:35:52,190 --> 01:35:56,530
decisions all that kind of stuff all
that kind of stuff and a lot more I mean

4470
01:35:56,530 --> 01:35:56,540
that kind of stuff and a lot more I mean
 

4471
01:35:56,540 --> 01:35:58,840
that kind of stuff and a lot more I mean
what's the killer app well I don't think

4472
01:35:58,840 --> 01:35:58,850
what's the killer app well I don't think
 

4473
01:35:58,850 --> 01:36:02,680
what's the killer app well I don't think
there is one I think AI I especially

4474
01:36:02,680 --> 01:36:02,690
there is one I think AI I especially
 

4475
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:04,300
there is one I think AI I especially
artificial general intelligence is

4476
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:04,310
artificial general intelligence is
 

4477
01:36:04,310 --> 01:36:06,340
artificial general intelligence is
really the ultimate general purpose

4478
01:36:06,340 --> 01:36:06,350
really the ultimate general purpose
 

4479
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:08,530
really the ultimate general purpose
technology so it's not that there is

4480
01:36:08,530 --> 01:36:08,540
technology so it's not that there is
 

4481
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,660
technology so it's not that there is
this one problem this one area where it

4482
01:36:10,660 --> 01:36:10,670
this one problem this one area where it
 

4483
01:36:10,670 --> 01:36:13,479
this one problem this one area where it
will have a big impact but if and when

4484
01:36:13,479 --> 01:36:13,489
will have a big impact but if and when
 

4485
01:36:13,489 --> 01:36:16,990
will have a big impact but if and when
it succeeds it will really apply across

4486
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:17,000
it succeeds it will really apply across
 

4487
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,300
it succeeds it will really apply across
the board in all fields where human

4488
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:19,310

creativity and intelligence and

4490
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:21,350
creativity and intelligence and
 

4491
01:36:21,350 --> 01:36:22,750
creativity and intelligence and
problem-solving is useful which is

4492
01:36:22,750 --> 01:36:22,760
problem-solving is useful which is
 

4493
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:25,300
problem-solving is useful which is
pretty much all fields right there the

4494
01:36:25,300 --> 01:36:25,310
pretty much all fields right there the
 

4495
01:36:25,310 --> 01:36:28,689
pretty much all fields right there the
thing that it would do is give us a lot

4496
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:28,699
thing that it would do is give us a lot
 

4497
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:31,149
thing that it would do is give us a lot
more control over nature it wouldn't

4498
01:36:31,149 --> 01:36:31,159
more control over nature it wouldn't
 

4499
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:32,950
more control over nature it wouldn't
automatically solve the problems that

4500
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:32,960
automatically solve the problems that
 

4501
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,240
automatically solve the problems that
arise from conflict between humans

4502
01:36:36,240 --> 01:36:36,250
arise from conflict between humans
 

4503
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:38,260
arise from conflict between humans
fundamentally political problems some

4504
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:38,270
fundamentally political problems some
 

4505
01:36:38,270 --> 01:36:39,729
fundamentally political problems some
subset of those might go away if you

4506
01:36:39,729 --> 01:36:39,739
subset of those might go away if you
 

4507
01:36:39,739 --> 01:36:42,010
subset of those might go away if you
just had more resources and cooler tech

4508
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:42,020
just had more resources and cooler tech
 

4509
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:47,160
just had more resources and cooler tech
but some subset would require

4510
01:36:47,160 --> 01:36:47,170

 

4511
01:36:47,170 --> 01:36:49,629

coordination that is not automatically

4512
01:36:49,629 --> 01:36:49,639
coordination that is not automatically
 

4513
01:36:49,639 --> 01:36:51,520
coordination that is not automatically
achieved just by having more technical

4514
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:51,530
achieved just by having more technical
 

4515
01:36:51,530 --> 01:36:53,890
achieved just by having more technical
capability but but anything that's not

4516
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:53,900
capability but but anything that's not
 

4517
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,810
capability but but anything that's not
of that sort I think you just get like

4518
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:55,820
of that sort I think you just get like
 

4519
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:59,649
of that sort I think you just get like
an enormous boost with this kind of

4520
01:36:59,649 --> 01:36:59,659
an enormous boost with this kind of
 

4521
01:36:59,659 --> 01:37:02,200
an enormous boost with this kind of
cognitive technology what once it goes

4522
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:02,210
cognitive technology what once it goes
 

4523
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:03,370
cognitive technology what once it goes
all the way not again

4524
01:37:03,370 --> 01:37:03,380
all the way not again
 

4525
01:37:03,380 --> 01:37:07,350
all the way not again
that doesn't mean I'm like thinking or

4526
01:37:07,350 --> 01:37:07,360
that doesn't mean I'm like thinking or
 

4527
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,510
that doesn't mean I'm like thinking or
people don't recognize what's possible

4528
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:10,520
people don't recognize what's possible
 

4529
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,580
people don't recognize what's possible
with current technology and like

4530
01:37:12,580 --> 01:37:12,590
with current technology and like
 

4531
01:37:12,590 --> 01:37:14,229
with current technology and like
sometimes things get over height but I

4532
01:37:14,229 --> 01:37:14,239
sometimes things get over height but I
 

4533
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:15,640
sometimes things get over height but I
mean those are perfectly consistent

4534
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:15,650
mean those are perfectly consistent
 

4535
01:37:15,650 --> 01:37:17,680
mean those are perfectly consistent
views to hold the ultimate potential

4536
01:37:17,680 --> 01:37:17,690
views to hold the ultimate potential
 

4537
01:37:17,690 --> 01:37:21,100
views to hold the ultimate potential
being enormous and then it's a very

4538
01:37:21,100 --> 01:37:21,110
being enormous and then it's a very
 

4539
01:37:21,110 --> 01:37:22,479
being enormous and then it's a very
different question of how far are we

4540
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:22,489
different question of how far are we
 

4541
01:37:22,489 --> 01:37:24,010
different question of how far are we
from that or what can we do with

4542
01:37:24,010 --> 01:37:24,020
from that or what can we do with
 

4543
01:37:24,020 --> 01:37:25,930
from that or what can we do with
near-term technology so what's your

4544
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:25,940
near-term technology so what's your
 

4545
01:37:25,940 --> 01:37:28,030
near-term technology so what's your
intuition about the idea of intelligence

4546
01:37:28,030 --> 01:37:28,040
intuition about the idea of intelligence
 

4547
01:37:28,040 --> 01:37:31,330
intuition about the idea of intelligence
explosion so there's this

4548
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:31,340
explosion so there's this
 

4549
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,160
explosion so there's this
you know when you start to think about

4550
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:33,170
you know when you start to think about
 

4551
01:37:33,170 --> 01:37:35,470
you know when you start to think about
that leap from the near term to the long

4552
01:37:35,470 --> 01:37:35,480
that leap from the near term to the long
 

4553
01:37:35,480 --> 01:37:38,680
that leap from the near term to the long
term the natural inclination like for me

4554
01:37:38,680 --> 01:37:38,690
term the natural inclination like for me
 

4555
01:37:38,690 --> 01:37:40,180
term the natural inclination like for me
sort of building machine learning

4556
01:37:40,180 --> 01:37:40,190
sort of building machine learning
 

4557
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:42,459
sort of building machine learning
systems today it seems like it's a lot

4558
01:37:42,459 --> 01:37:42,469
systems today it seems like it's a lot
 

4559
01:37:42,469 --> 01:37:44,260
systems today it seems like it's a lot
of work to get the general intelligence

4560
01:37:44,260 --> 01:37:44,270
of work to get the general intelligence
 

4561
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:46,000
of work to get the general intelligence
but there's some intuition of

4562
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:46,010
but there's some intuition of
 

4563
01:37:46,010 --> 01:37:47,800
but there's some intuition of

can you maybe try to elucidate to try to
talk about what's your intuition about

talk about what's your intuition about

01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:17,169
how explosive it will be I think for

01:38:49,390 --> 01:38:49,400
intelligence expulsion like does it have
 

4607
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:51,550

to be like overnight literally or a few

to be like overnight literally or a few
 

4609
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,479
to be like overnight literally or a few

4611
01:38:55,489 --> 01:38:57,189

this is a special moment and it says

this is a special moment and it says

4670
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:15,160
system that's beyond our intelligence so
 

4671
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:18,550

maybe you can step back and and say like

4672
01:40:18,550 --> 01:40:18,560
maybe you can step back and and say like
 

4673
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,790
maybe you can step back and and say like
how does that possibly make you feel

4674
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:20,800
how does that possibly make you feel
 

4675
01:40:20,800 --> 01:40:24,790
how does that possibly make you feel
that we can create something it feels

4676
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:24,800
that we can create something it feels
 

4677
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:27,070
that we can create something it feels
like there's a line beyond which it

4678
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:27,080
like there's a line beyond which it
 

4679
01:40:27,080 --> 01:40:30,730
like there's a line beyond which it
steps you'll be able to outsmart you and

4680
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:30,740
steps you'll be able to outsmart you and
 

4681
01:40:30,740 --> 01:40:33,850
steps you'll be able to outsmart you and
therefore it feels like a step where we

4682
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:33,860
therefore it feels like a step where we
 

4683
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:37,360
therefore it feels like a step where we
lose control well I don't think that a

4684
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:37,370
lose control well I don't think that a
 

4685
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:40,870
lose control well I don't think that a

01:40:45,650 --> 01:40:48,400
people are working towards making sure
that we could ultimately the project

that we could ultimately the project

control problem is an interesting thing

4720
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:27,860
control problem is an interesting thing
 

4721
01:41:27,860 --> 01:41:31,120
control problem is an interesting thing
and I think we the hope is at least we

4722
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:31,130
and I think we the hope is at least we
 

4723
01:41:31,130 --> 01:41:33,130
and I think we the hope is at least we
should be able to maintain control over

4724
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:33,140
should be able to maintain control over
 

4725
01:41:33,140 --> 01:41:35,440
should be able to maintain control over
systems that are smarter than us but

4726
01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:35,450
systems that are smarter than us but
 

4727
01:41:35,450 --> 01:41:39,780
systems that are smarter than us but
they're they we do lose our specialness

4728
01:41:39,780 --> 01:41:39,790
they're they we do lose our specialness
 

4729
01:41:39,790 --> 01:41:44,920
they're they we do lose our specialness
it's sort of we'll lose our place as the

4730
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:44,930
it's sort of we'll lose our place as the
 

4731
01:41:44,930 --> 01:41:49,410
it's sort of we'll lose our place as the
smartest coolest thing on earth and

4732
01:41:49,410 --> 01:41:49,420
smartest coolest thing on earth and
 

4733
01:41:49,420 --> 01:41:52,270
smartest coolest thing on earth and
there's an ego involved that that humans

4734
01:41:52,270 --> 01:41:52,280
there's an ego involved that that humans
 

4735
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:56,200
there's an ego involved that that humans
are very good at dealing with I mean I I

4736
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:56,210
are very good at dealing with I mean I I
 

4737
01:41:56,210 --> 01:41:58,540
are very good at dealing with I mean I I
value my intelligence

4738
01:41:58,540 --> 01:41:58,550
value my intelligence
 

4739
01:41:58,550 --> 01:42:00,939
value my intelligence
human being it seems like a big

4740
01:42:00,939 --> 01:42:00,949
human being it seems like a big
 

4741
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:03,129
human being it seems like a big
transformative step to realize you

4742
01:42:03,129 --> 01:42:03,139
transformative step to realize you
 

4743
01:42:03,139 --> 01:42:04,990
transformative step to realize you
there's something out there that's more

4744
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:05,000
there's something out there that's more
 

4745
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:08,490
there's something out there that's more
intelligent I mean you don't see that

4746
01:42:08,490 --> 01:42:08,500
intelligent I mean you don't see that
 

4747
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:11,950
intelligent I mean you don't see that
today I think yes a lot I think it

4748
01:42:11,950 --> 01:42:11,960
today I think yes a lot I think it
 

4749
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:13,750
today I think yes a lot I think it
really small I mean I think there

4750
01:42:13,750 --> 01:42:13,760
really small I mean I think there
 

4751
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,600
really small I mean I think there
already a lot of things out there that

4752
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:15,610
already a lot of things out there that
 

4753
01:42:15,610 --> 01:42:18,220
already a lot of things out there that
are I mean certainly if you think the

4754
01:42:18,220 --> 01:42:18,230
are I mean certainly if you think the
 

4755
01:42:18,230 --> 01:42:19,330
are I mean certainly if you think the
universe is big there's going to be

4756
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:19,340
universe is big there's going to be
 

4757
01:42:19,340 --> 01:42:21,220
universe is big there's going to be
other civilizations that already have

4758
01:42:21,220 --> 01:42:21,230
other civilizations that already have
 

4759
01:42:21,230 --> 01:42:23,410
other civilizations that already have
super intelligences or that just

4760
01:42:23,410 --> 01:42:23,420
super intelligences or that just
 

4761
01:42:23,420 --> 01:42:26,169
super intelligences or that just
naturally have brains the size of beach

4762
01:42:26,169 --> 01:42:26,179
naturally have brains the size of beach
 

4763
01:42:26,179 --> 01:42:28,450
naturally have brains the size of beach
balls and they're like completely

4764
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:28,460
balls and they're like completely
 

4765
01:42:28,460 --> 01:42:32,470
balls and they're like completely
leaving us in the dust and we haven't

4766
01:42:32,470 --> 01:42:32,480
leaving us in the dust and we haven't
 

4767
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:34,299
leaving us in the dust and we haven't
our face to face we have some face to

4768
01:42:34,299 --> 01:42:34,309
our face to face we have some face to
 

4769
01:42:34,309 --> 01:42:36,060
our face to face we have some face to
face but I mean that's not my question

4770
01:42:36,060 --> 01:42:36,070
face but I mean that's not my question
 

4771
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:39,959
face but I mean that's not my question
what what would happen in in a kind of

4772
01:42:39,959 --> 01:42:39,969
what what would happen in in a kind of
 

4773
01:42:39,969 --> 01:42:44,049
what what would happen in in a kind of
posthuman world like how much day-to-day

4774
01:42:44,049 --> 01:42:44,059
posthuman world like how much day-to-day
 

4775
01:42:44,059 --> 01:42:47,919
posthuman world like how much day-to-day
would these super intelligences be

4776
01:42:47,919 --> 01:42:47,929
would these super intelligences be
 

4777
01:42:47,929 --> 01:42:50,169
would these super intelligences be
involved in the lives of ordinary men

4778
01:42:50,169 --> 01:42:50,179
involved in the lives of ordinary men
 

4779
01:42:50,179 --> 01:42:52,689
involved in the lives of ordinary men
I you could imagine some scenario where

4780
01:42:52,689 --> 01:42:52,699
I you could imagine some scenario where
 

4781
01:42:52,699 --> 01:42:54,129
I you could imagine some scenario where
it would be more like a background thing

4782
01:42:54,129 --> 01:42:54,139
it would be more like a background thing
 

4783
01:42:54,139 --> 01:42:55,930
it would be more like a background thing
that would help protect against some

4784
01:42:55,930 --> 01:42:55,940
that would help protect against some
 

4785
01:42:55,940 --> 01:42:58,600
that would help protect against some
things but you wouldn't like that there

4786
01:42:58,600 --> 01:42:58,610
things but you wouldn't like that there
 

4787
01:42:58,610 --> 01:43:00,939
things but you wouldn't like that there
wouldn't be this intrusive kind of like

4788
01:43:00,939 --> 01:43:00,949
wouldn't be this intrusive kind of like
 

4789
01:43:00,949 --> 01:43:03,370
wouldn't be this intrusive kind of like
making you feel bad by like making

4790
01:43:03,370 --> 01:43:03,380
making you feel bad by like making
 

4791
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,839
making you feel bad by like making
clever jokes on your ex but like there's

4792
01:43:04,839 --> 01:43:04,849
clever jokes on your ex but like there's
 

4793
01:43:04,849 --> 01:43:06,640
clever jokes on your ex but like there's
all sorts of things that maybe in the

4794
01:43:06,640 --> 01:43:06,650
all sorts of things that maybe in the
 

4795
01:43:06,650 --> 01:43:09,280
all sorts of things that maybe in the
human context would feel awkward about

4796
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:09,290
human context would feel awkward about
 

4797
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:11,709
human context would feel awkward about
that you don't want to be the dumbest

4798
01:43:11,709 --> 01:43:11,719
that you don't want to be the dumbest
 

4799
01:43:11,719 --> 01:43:13,270
that you don't want to be the dumbest
kid in your class everybody picks it

4800
01:43:13,270 --> 01:43:13,280
kid in your class everybody picks it
 

4801
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:15,339
kid in your class everybody picks it
like a lot of those things maybe you

4802
01:43:15,339 --> 01:43:15,349
like a lot of those things maybe you
 

4803
01:43:15,349 --> 01:43:18,250
like a lot of those things maybe you
need to abstract away from if you're

4804
01:43:18,250 --> 01:43:18,260
need to abstract away from if you're
 

4805
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:19,660
need to abstract away from if you're
thinking about this context where we

4806
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:19,670
thinking about this context where we
 

4807
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:21,310
thinking about this context where we
have infrastructure that is in some

4808
01:43:21,310 --> 01:43:21,320
have infrastructure that is in some
 

4809
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:27,399
have infrastructure that is in some
sense beyond any or all humans I mean

4810
01:43:27,399 --> 01:43:27,409
sense beyond any or all humans I mean
 

4811
01:43:27,409 --> 01:43:28,330
sense beyond any or all humans I mean
it's a little bit like say the

4812
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:28,340
it's a little bit like say the
 

4813
01:43:28,340 --> 01:43:30,339
it's a little bit like say the
scientific community as a whole if you

4814
01:43:30,339 --> 01:43:30,349
scientific community as a whole if you
 

4815
01:43:30,349 --> 01:43:32,620
scientific community as a whole if you
think of that as in a mind it's a little

4816
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:32,630
think of that as in a mind it's a little
 

4817
01:43:32,630 --> 01:43:33,910
think of that as in a mind it's a little
bit of metaphor but I mean obviously

4818
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:33,920
bit of metaphor but I mean obviously
 

4819
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,540
bit of metaphor but I mean obviously
it's going to be like way more capacious

4820
01:43:37,540 --> 01:43:37,550
it's going to be like way more capacious
 

4821
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:40,180
it's going to be like way more capacious
than any individual so in some sense

4822
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:40,190
than any individual so in some sense
 

4823
01:43:40,190 --> 01:43:42,850
than any individual so in some sense
there is this mind like thing already

4824
01:43:42,850 --> 01:43:42,860
there is this mind like thing already
 

4825
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:46,200
there is this mind like thing already
out there that's that just vastly more

4826
01:43:46,200 --> 01:43:46,210
out there that's that just vastly more
 

4827
01:43:46,210 --> 01:43:49,240
out there that's that just vastly more
intolerant and than a new individual is

4828
01:43:49,240 --> 01:43:49,250
intolerant and than a new individual is
 

4829
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:53,350
intolerant and than a new individual is
and we think okay that's you just accept

4830
01:43:53,350 --> 01:43:53,360
and we think okay that's you just accept
 

4831
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,500
and we think okay that's you just accept
that as a fact that's the basic fabric

4832
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:56,510
that as a fact that's the basic fabric
 

4833
01:43:56,510 --> 01:43:59,290
that as a fact that's the basic fabric
of our existence intelligent yeah you

4834
01:43:59,290 --> 01:43:59,300
of our existence intelligent yeah you
 

4835
01:43:59,300 --> 01:44:00,939
of our existence intelligent yeah you
get used to a lot of I mean there's

4836
01:44:00,939 --> 01:44:00,949
get used to a lot of I mean there's
 

4837
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:03,430
get used to a lot of I mean there's
already Google and Twitter and Facebook

4838
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,440
already Google and Twitter and Facebook
 

4839
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:06,760
already Google and Twitter and Facebook
these sister recommender systems that

4840
01:44:06,760 --> 01:44:06,770
these sister recommender systems that
 

4841
01:44:06,770 --> 01:44:11,020
these sister recommender systems that
are the basic fabric of our and I could

4842
01:44:11,020 --> 01:44:11,030
are the basic fabric of our and I could
 

4843
01:44:11,030 --> 01:44:12,370
are the basic fabric of our and I could
see them becoming

4844
01:44:12,370 --> 01:44:12,380
see them becoming
 

4845
01:44:12,380 --> 01:44:14,320
see them becoming
I mean do you think of the collective

4846
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:14,330
I mean do you think of the collective
 

4847
01:44:14,330 --> 01:44:16,420
I mean do you think of the collective
intelligence of these systems as already

4848
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:16,430
intelligence of these systems as already
 

4849
01:44:16,430 --> 01:44:18,340
intelligence of these systems as already
perhaps reaching super intelligence

4850
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:18,350
perhaps reaching super intelligence
 

4851
01:44:18,350 --> 01:44:21,700
perhaps reaching super intelligence
level well means I hear it comes to this

4852
01:44:21,700 --> 01:44:21,710
level well means I hear it comes to this
 

4853
01:44:21,710 --> 01:44:23,800
level well means I hear it comes to this
the concept of intelligence and the

4854
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:23,810
the concept of intelligence and the
 

4855
01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:29,770
the concept of intelligence and the
scale and what human level means the the

4856
01:44:29,770 --> 01:44:29,780
scale and what human level means the the
 

4857
01:44:29,780 --> 01:44:31,990
scale and what human level means the the
kind of vagueness and indeterminacy of

4858
01:44:31,990 --> 01:44:32,000
kind of vagueness and indeterminacy of
 

4859
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:37,750
kind of vagueness and indeterminacy of
those concepts starts to dominate how he

4860
01:44:37,750 --> 01:44:37,760
those concepts starts to dominate how he
 

4861
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:39,790
those concepts starts to dominate how he
would answer that question so the like

4862
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:39,800
would answer that question so the like
 

4863
01:44:39,800 --> 01:44:42,160
would answer that question so the like
say the Google search engine has a very

4864
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:42,170
say the Google search engine has a very
 

4865
01:44:42,170 --> 01:44:44,860
say the Google search engine has a very
high capacity of a certain kind like

4866
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:44,870
high capacity of a certain kind like
 

4867
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:46,540
high capacity of a certain kind like

01:44:58,840 --> 01:44:58,850
of string a word string key like
 

4875
01:44:58,850 --> 01:45:02,740
of string a word string key like
obviously superhuman at that but a vast

4876
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:02,750
obviously superhuman at that but a vast
 

4877
01:45:02,750 --> 01:45:05,380
obviously superhuman at that but a vast
set of other things it can't even do at

4878
01:45:05,380 --> 01:45:05,390
set of other things it can't even do at
 

4879
01:45:05,390 --> 01:45:09,310
set of other things it can't even do at
all not just not do well but so so you

4880
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:09,320
all not just not do well but so so you
 

4881
01:45:09,320 --> 01:45:11,640
all not just not do well but so so you
have these current AI systems that are

4882
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:11,650
have these current AI systems that are
 

4883
01:45:11,650 --> 01:45:14,260
have these current AI systems that are
superhuman in some limited domain and

4884
01:45:14,260 --> 01:45:14,270
superhuman in some limited domain and
 

4885
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:17,620
superhuman in some limited domain and
then like radically subhuman in all

4886
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:17,630
then like radically subhuman in all
 

4887
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:19,510
then like radically subhuman in all
other domains so it's same way that

4888
01:45:19,510 --> 01:45:19,520
other domains so it's same way that
 

4889
01:45:19,520 --> 01:45:22,210
other domains so it's same way that
chess like are just a simple computer

4890
01:45:22,210 --> 01:45:22,220
chess like are just a simple computer
 

4891
01:45:22,220 --> 01:45:23,890
chess like are just a simple computer
that can multiply really large numbers

4892
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:23,900
that can multiply really large numbers
 

4893
01:45:23,900 --> 01:45:25,390
that can multiply really large numbers
right it's gonna have this like one

4894
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:25,400
right it's gonna have this like one
 

4895
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:27,670
right it's gonna have this like one
spike of super intelligence and then a

4896
01:45:27,670 --> 01:45:27,680
spike of super intelligence and then a
 

4897
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:29,530
spike of super intelligence and then a
kind of a zero level of capability

4898
01:45:29,530 --> 01:45:29,540
kind of a zero level of capability
 

4899
01:45:29,540 --> 01:45:32,800
kind of a zero level of capability
across all other cognitive fields and

4900
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:32,810
across all other cognitive fields and
 

4901
01:45:32,810 --> 01:45:34,720
across all other cognitive fields and
yeah I don't necessarily think the

4902
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:34,730
yeah I don't necessarily think the
 

4903
01:45:34,730 --> 01:45:36,370
yeah I don't necessarily think the
journalist I mean I'm not so attached

4904
01:45:36,370 --> 01:45:36,380
journalist I mean I'm not so attached
 

4905
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,890
journalist I mean I'm not so attached
with it but I could sort of it's a it's

4906
01:45:38,890 --> 01:45:38,900
with it but I could sort of it's a it's
 

4907
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:41,350
with it but I could sort of it's a it's
a gray area and it's a feeling but to me

4908
01:45:41,350 --> 01:45:41,360
a gray area and it's a feeling but to me
 

4909
01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:45,040
a gray area and it's a feeling but to me
sort of alpha zero it's somehow much

4910
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:45,050
sort of alpha zero it's somehow much
 

4911
01:45:45,050 --> 01:45:48,340
sort of alpha zero it's somehow much
more intelligent much much more

4912
01:45:48,340 --> 01:45:48,350
more intelligent much much more
 

4913
01:45:48,350 --> 01:45:52,150
more intelligent much much more
intelligent than deep blue hmm and just

4914
01:45:52,150 --> 01:45:52,160
intelligent than deep blue hmm and just
 

4915
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,560
intelligent than deep blue hmm and just
say which tomato you could say well

4916
01:45:53,560 --> 01:45:53,570
say which tomato you could say well
 

4917
01:45:53,570 --> 01:45:54,790
say which tomato you could say well
these are both just board game that

4918
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:54,800
these are both just board game that
 

4919
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:56,320
these are both just board game that
they're both just able to play board

4920
01:45:56,320 --> 01:45:56,330
they're both just able to play board
 

4921
01:45:56,330 --> 01:45:57,910
they're both just able to play board
games who cares if they're good do

4922
01:45:57,910 --> 01:45:57,920
games who cares if they're good do
 

4923
01:45:57,920 --> 01:45:59,770
games who cares if they're good do
better or not but there's something

4924
01:45:59,770 --> 01:45:59,780
better or not but there's something
 

4925
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:01,480
better or not but there's something
about the learning the self play

4926
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:01,490
about the learning the self play
 

4927
01:46:01,490 --> 01:46:05,200
about the learning the self play
learning yeah that makes it crosses over

4928
01:46:05,200 --> 01:46:05,210
learning yeah that makes it crosses over
 

4929
01:46:05,210 --> 01:46:07,320
learning yeah that makes it crosses over
into that land of intelligence that

4930
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:07,330
into that land of intelligence that
 

4931
01:46:07,330 --> 01:46:09,550
into that land of intelligence that
doesn't necessarily need to be general

4932
01:46:09,550 --> 01:46:09,560
doesn't necessarily need to be general
 

4933
01:46:09,560 --> 01:46:11,500
doesn't necessarily need to be general
in the same way Google is much closer to

4934
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:11,510
in the same way Google is much closer to
 

4935
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:13,960
in the same way Google is much closer to
deep blue currently in terms of its

4936
01:46:13,960 --> 01:46:13,970
deep blue currently in terms of its
 

4937
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:16,420
deep blue currently in terms of its
search engine now then it is to sort of

4938
01:46:16,420 --> 01:46:16,430
search engine now then it is to sort of
 

4939
01:46:16,430 --> 01:46:19,870
search engine now then it is to sort of
alpha zero and the moment it becomes the

4940
01:46:19,870 --> 01:46:19,880
alpha zero and the moment it becomes the
 

4941
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:21,400
alpha zero and the moment it becomes the
moment these recommender systems really

4942
01:46:21,400 --> 01:46:21,410
moment these recommender systems really
 

4943
01:46:21,410 --> 01:46:24,820
moment these recommender systems really
become more like alpha zero but being

4944
01:46:24,820 --> 01:46:24,830
become more like alpha zero but being
 

4945
01:46:24,830 --> 01:46:25,750
become more like alpha zero but being
able to learn

4946
01:46:25,750 --> 01:46:25,760
able to learn
 

4947
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:28,900
able to learn
a lot without the constraints of being

4948
01:46:28,900 --> 01:46:28,910
a lot without the constraints of being
 

4949
01:46:28,910 --> 01:46:30,910
a lot without the constraints of being
heavily constrained by human interaction

4950
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:30,920
heavily constrained by human interaction
 

4951
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:34,020
heavily constrained by human interaction
that seems like a special moment in time

4952
01:46:34,020 --> 01:46:34,030
that seems like a special moment in time
 

4953
01:46:34,030 --> 01:46:38,980
that seems like a special moment in time
certainly learning ability seems to be

4954
01:46:38,980 --> 01:46:38,990
certainly learning ability seems to be
 

4955
01:46:38,990 --> 01:46:41,830
certainly learning ability seems to be
an important facet of general

4956
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:41,840
an important facet of general
 

4957
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:44,440
an important facet of general
intelligence that you can take some new

4958
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:44,450
intelligence that you can take some new
 

4959
01:46:44,450 --> 01:46:47,170
intelligence that you can take some new
domain that you haven't seen before and

4960
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:47,180
domain that you haven't seen before and
 

4961
01:46:47,180 --> 01:46:48,850
domain that you haven't seen before and
you weren't specifically pre-programmed

4962
01:46:48,850 --> 01:46:48,860
you weren't specifically pre-programmed
 

4963
01:46:48,860 --> 01:46:51,040
you weren't specifically pre-programmed
for and then figure out what's going on

4964
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:51,050
for and then figure out what's going on
 

4965
01:46:51,050 --> 01:46:52,510
for and then figure out what's going on
there and eventually become really good

4966
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:52,520
there and eventually become really good
 

4967
01:46:52,520 --> 01:46:56,440
there and eventually become really good
at it so that's something alpha 0 it has

4968
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:56,450
at it so that's something alpha 0 it has
 

4969
01:46:56,450 --> 01:46:59,680
at it so that's something alpha 0 it has
much more often than deep blue had and

4970
01:46:59,680 --> 01:46:59,690
much more often than deep blue had and
 

4971
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:02,620
much more often than deep blue had and
in fact I mean systems like alpha zero

4972
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:02,630
in fact I mean systems like alpha zero
 

4973
01:47:02,630 --> 01:47:06,160
in fact I mean systems like alpha zero
can learn not just go but other in fact

4974
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:06,170
can learn not just go but other in fact
 

4975
01:47:06,170 --> 01:47:08,860
can learn not just go but other in fact
probably beat deep blue in chess and so

4976
01:47:08,860 --> 01:47:08,870
probably beat deep blue in chess and so
 

4977
01:47:08,870 --> 01:47:11,590
probably beat deep blue in chess and so
forth right so that you say you do just

4978
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:11,600
forth right so that you say you do just
 

4979
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:13,750
forth right so that you say you do just
general and it matches the intuition we

4980
01:47:13,750 --> 01:47:13,760
general and it matches the intuition we
 

4981
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,670
general and it matches the intuition we
feel it's more intelligent and it also

4982
01:47:15,670 --> 01:47:15,680
feel it's more intelligent and it also
 

4983
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,230
feel it's more intelligent and it also
has more of this general purpose

4984
01:47:17,230 --> 01:47:17,240
has more of this general purpose
 

4985
01:47:17,240 --> 01:47:20,800
has more of this general purpose
learning ability and if we get systems

4986
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:20,810
learning ability and if we get systems
 

4987
01:47:20,810 --> 01:47:21,760
learning ability and if we get systems
that have been more general-purpose

4988
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:21,770
that have been more general-purpose
 

4989
01:47:21,770 --> 01:47:23,590
that have been more general-purpose
learning ability it might also trigger

4990
01:47:23,590 --> 01:47:23,600
learning ability it might also trigger
 

4991
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:25,090
learning ability it might also trigger
an even stronger intuition that they are

4992
01:47:25,090 --> 01:47:25,100
an even stronger intuition that they are
 

4993
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:28,330
an even stronger intuition that they are
actually starting to get smart so if you

4994
01:47:28,330 --> 01:47:28,340
actually starting to get smart so if you
 

4995
01:47:28,340 --> 01:47:30,430
actually starting to get smart so if you
were to pick a future what would eating

4996
01:47:30,430 --> 01:47:30,440
were to pick a future what would eating
 

4997
01:47:30,440 --> 01:47:33,340
were to pick a future what would eating
a utopia looks like with a GI systems

4998
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:33,350
a utopia looks like with a GI systems
 

4999
01:47:33,350 --> 01:47:38,080
a utopia looks like with a GI systems
sort of is it the neural link brain

5000
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:38,090
sort of is it the neural link brain
 

5001
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:39,820
sort of is it the neural link brain
computer interface world where we're

5002
01:47:39,820 --> 01:47:39,830
computer interface world where we're
 

5003
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:41,710
computer interface world where we're
kind of really closely interlinked with

5004
01:47:41,710 --> 01:47:41,720
kind of really closely interlinked with
 

5005
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:45,640
kind of really closely interlinked with
AI systems is it possibly where a GI

5006
01:47:45,640 --> 01:47:45,650
AI systems is it possibly where a GI
 

5007
01:47:45,650 --> 01:47:48,130
AI systems is it possibly where a GI
systems replace us completely while

5008
01:47:48,130 --> 01:47:48,140
systems replace us completely while
 

5009
01:47:48,140 --> 01:47:51,030
systems replace us completely while
maintaining the the values and the the

5010
01:47:51,030 --> 01:47:51,040
maintaining the the values and the the
 

5011
01:47:51,040 --> 01:47:54,280
maintaining the the values and the the
consciousness is it something like it's

5012
01:47:54,280 --> 01:47:54,290
consciousness is it something like it's
 

5013
01:47:54,290 --> 01:47:56,230
consciousness is it something like it's
a completely invisible fabric like you

5014
01:47:56,230 --> 01:47:56,240
a completely invisible fabric like you
 

5015
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:58,420
a completely invisible fabric like you
mentioned a society where just AIDS and

5016
01:47:58,420 --> 01:47:58,430
mentioned a society where just AIDS and
 

5017
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:01,000
mentioned a society where just AIDS and
a lot of stuff that we do like carrying

5018
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:01,010
a lot of stuff that we do like carrying
 

5019
01:48:01,010 --> 01:48:03,070
a lot of stuff that we do like carrying
diseases and so on what does utopia if

5020
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:03,080
diseases and so on what does utopia if
 

5021
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:05,320
diseases and so on what does utopia if
you get to pick yeah I mean it's a good

5022
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:05,330
you get to pick yeah I mean it's a good
 

5023
01:48:05,330 --> 01:48:08,470
you get to pick yeah I mean it's a good
question and a deep and difficult one

5024
01:48:08,470 --> 01:48:08,480
question and a deep and difficult one
 

5025
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:10,990
question and a deep and difficult one
I'm quite interested in it I don't have

5026
01:48:10,990 --> 01:48:11,000
I'm quite interested in it I don't have
 

5027
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:14,650
I'm quite interested in it I don't have
all the answers yet but or might never

5028
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:14,660
all the answers yet but or might never
 

5029
01:48:14,660 --> 01:48:16,930
all the answers yet but or might never
have but I think there are some

5030
01:48:16,930 --> 01:48:16,940
have but I think there are some
 

5031
01:48:16,940 --> 01:48:18,910
have but I think there are some
different observations one could make

5032
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:18,920
different observations one could make
 

5033
01:48:18,920 --> 01:48:21,370
different observations one could make
one one is if this if the scenario

5034
01:48:21,370 --> 01:48:21,380
one one is if this if the scenario
 

5035
01:48:21,380 --> 01:48:24,280
one one is if this if the scenario
actually did come to pass it would open

5036
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:24,290
actually did come to pass it would open
 

5037
01:48:24,290 --> 01:48:28,510
actually did come to pass it would open
up this vast space of possible modes of

5038
01:48:28,510 --> 01:48:28,520
up this vast space of possible modes of
 

5039
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:33,130
up this vast space of possible modes of
being on one and material and resource

5040
01:48:33,130 --> 01:48:33,140
being on one and material and resource
 

5041
01:48:33,140 --> 01:48:35,260
being on one and material and resource
constraints would just be like expanded

5042
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:35,270
constraints would just be like expanded
 

5043
01:48:35,270 --> 01:48:37,810
constraints would just be like expanded
dramatically so you there would be a lot

5044
01:48:37,810 --> 01:48:37,820
dramatically so you there would be a lot
 

5045
01:48:37,820 --> 01:48:39,939
dramatically so you there would be a lot
of a big pie let's

5046
01:48:39,939 --> 01:48:39,949
of a big pie let's
 

5047
01:48:39,949 --> 01:48:44,200
of a big pie let's
right also it would enable us to to do

5048
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:44,210
right also it would enable us to to do
 

5049
01:48:44,210 --> 01:48:49,330
right also it would enable us to to do
things including to ourselves or not

5050
01:48:49,330 --> 01:48:49,340
things including to ourselves or not
 

5051
01:48:49,340 --> 01:48:51,550
things including to ourselves or not
like that do you eat it would just open

5052
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:51,560
like that do you eat it would just open
 

5053
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:54,070
like that do you eat it would just open
up this much larger design space options

5054
01:48:54,070 --> 01:48:54,080
up this much larger design space options
 

5055
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,800
up this much larger design space options
based and and we have ever had access to

5056
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:56,810
based and and we have ever had access to
 

5057
01:48:56,810 --> 01:49:00,070
based and and we have ever had access to
in in human history so I think two

5058
01:49:00,070 --> 01:49:00,080
in in human history so I think two
 

5059
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:01,720
in in human history so I think two
things follow from that what one is that

5060
01:49:01,720 --> 01:49:01,730
things follow from that what one is that
 

5061
01:49:01,730 --> 01:49:04,900
things follow from that what one is that
we probably would need to make a fairly

5062
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:04,910
we probably would need to make a fairly
 

5063
01:49:04,910 --> 01:49:07,780
we probably would need to make a fairly
fundamental rethink of what ultimately

5064
01:49:07,780 --> 01:49:07,790
fundamental rethink of what ultimately
 

5065
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:10,570
fundamental rethink of what ultimately
we value like think things through more

5066
01:49:10,570 --> 01:49:10,580
we value like think things through more
 

5067
01:49:10,580 --> 01:49:12,400
we value like think things through more
from first principles in the context

5068
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:12,410
from first principles in the context
 

5069
01:49:12,410 --> 01:49:13,450
from first principles in the context
would be so different from the familiar

5070
01:49:13,450 --> 01:49:13,460
would be so different from the familiar
 

5071
01:49:13,460 --> 01:49:15,310
would be so different from the familiar
that we could have just take what we've

5072
01:49:15,310 --> 01:49:15,320
that we could have just take what we've
 

5073
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:18,189
that we could have just take what we've
always been doing and then like oh well

5074
01:49:18,189 --> 01:49:18,199
always been doing and then like oh well
 

5075
01:49:18,199 --> 01:49:20,560
always been doing and then like oh well
we have this cleaning robot that like

5076
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:20,570
we have this cleaning robot that like
 

5077
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:23,380
we have this cleaning robot that like
cleans the dishes in the sink and a few

5078
01:49:23,380 --> 01:49:23,390
cleans the dishes in the sink and a few
 

5079
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:25,150
cleans the dishes in the sink and a few
other small things and like I think we

5080
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:25,160
other small things and like I think we
 

5081
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,140
other small things and like I think we
would have to go back to first

5082
01:49:26,140 --> 01:49:26,150
would have to go back to first
 

5083
01:49:26,150 --> 01:49:28,150
would have to go back to first
principles and so from even from the

5084
01:49:28,150 --> 01:49:28,160
principles and so from even from the
 

5085
01:49:28,160 --> 01:49:29,919
principles and so from even from the
individual level go back to the first

5086
01:49:29,919 --> 01:49:29,929
individual level go back to the first
 

5087
01:49:29,929 --> 01:49:31,600
individual level go back to the first
principles of what what is the meaning

5088
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:31,610
principles of what what is the meaning
 

5089
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:33,160
principles of what what is the meaning
of life what is happiness how it is

5090
01:49:33,160 --> 01:49:33,170
of life what is happiness how it is
 

5091
01:49:33,170 --> 01:49:36,610
of life what is happiness how it is
fulfillment yeah and then also connected

5092
01:49:36,610 --> 01:49:36,620
fulfillment yeah and then also connected
 

5093
01:49:36,620 --> 01:49:39,880
fulfillment yeah and then also connected
to this large space of of resources is

5094
01:49:39,880 --> 01:49:39,890
to this large space of of resources is
 

5095
01:49:39,890 --> 01:49:45,150
to this large space of of resources is
that it would be possible and I think

5096
01:49:45,150 --> 01:49:45,160
that it would be possible and I think
 

5097
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:48,250
that it would be possible and I think
something we should aim for is to do

5098
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:48,260
something we should aim for is to do
 

5099
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:52,780
something we should aim for is to do
well by the lights of more than one

5100
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:52,790
well by the lights of more than one
 

5101
01:49:52,790 --> 01:50:01,120
well by the lights of more than one
value system that is we wouldn't have to

5102
01:50:01,120 --> 01:50:01,130
value system that is we wouldn't have to
 

5103
01:50:01,130 --> 01:50:05,860
value system that is we wouldn't have to
choose only one value criterion and say

5104
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:05,870
choose only one value criterion and say
 

5105
01:50:05,870 --> 01:50:07,209
choose only one value criterion and say
we're gonna do something that's course

5106
01:50:07,209 --> 01:50:07,219
we're gonna do something that's course
 

5107
01:50:07,219 --> 01:50:12,160
we're gonna do something that's course
really high on the metric of say even

5108
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:12,170
really high on the metric of say even
 

5109
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:16,209
really high on the metric of say even
ISM and then is like a zero by other

5110
01:50:16,209 --> 01:50:16,219
ISM and then is like a zero by other
 

5111
01:50:16,219 --> 01:50:18,939
ISM and then is like a zero by other
criteria like kind of wire headed brains

5112
01:50:18,939 --> 01:50:18,949
criteria like kind of wire headed brains
 

5113
01:50:18,949 --> 01:50:22,060
criteria like kind of wire headed brains
innovate and it's like a lot of pleasure

5114
01:50:22,060 --> 01:50:22,070
innovate and it's like a lot of pleasure
 

5115
01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:24,280
innovate and it's like a lot of pleasure
that's good but then like no no Beauty

5116
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:24,290
that's good but then like no no Beauty
 

5117
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:26,560
that's good but then like no no Beauty
you know achievement like no III or or

5118
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:26,570
you know achievement like no III or or
 

5119
01:50:26,570 --> 01:50:29,590
you know achievement like no III or or
or pic and I think to some significant

5120
01:50:29,590 --> 01:50:29,600
or pic and I think to some significant
 

5121
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,810
or pic and I think to some significant
not unlimited sense but the significant

5122
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:31,820
not unlimited sense but the significant
 

5123
01:50:31,820 --> 01:50:34,959
not unlimited sense but the significant
sense it would be possible to do very

5124
01:50:34,959 --> 01:50:34,969
sense it would be possible to do very
 

5125
01:50:34,969 --> 01:50:36,610
sense it would be possible to do very
well by many criteria like maybe you

5126
01:50:36,610 --> 01:50:36,620
well by many criteria like maybe you
 

5127
01:50:36,620 --> 01:50:41,950
well by many criteria like maybe you
could get like 98% of the best according

5128
01:50:41,950 --> 01:50:41,960
could get like 98% of the best according
 

5129
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:43,510
could get like 98% of the best according
to several criteria at the same time

5130
01:50:43,510 --> 01:50:43,520
to several criteria at the same time
 

5131
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:48,040
to several criteria at the same time
given this this the secret expansion of

5132
01:50:48,040 --> 01:50:48,050
given this this the secret expansion of
 

5133
01:50:48,050 --> 01:50:51,040
given this this the secret expansion of
the option space and so so have

5134
01:50:51,040 --> 01:50:51,050
the option space and so so have
 

5135
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,910
the option space and so so have
competing value systems

5136
01:50:52,910 --> 01:50:52,920
competing value systems
 

5137
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:57,410
competing value systems
in criteria as a sort of firm just like

5138
01:50:57,410 --> 01:50:57,420
in criteria as a sort of firm just like
 

5139
01:50:57,420 --> 01:51:00,260
in criteria as a sort of firm just like
our Democrat versus Republican there

5140
01:51:00,260 --> 01:51:00,270
our Democrat versus Republican there
 

5141
01:51:00,270 --> 01:51:02,570
our Democrat versus Republican there
seems to be this always multiple parties

5142
01:51:02,570 --> 01:51:02,580
seems to be this always multiple parties
 

5143
01:51:02,580 --> 01:51:04,220
seems to be this always multiple parties
that are useful for our progress in

5144
01:51:04,220 --> 01:51:04,230
that are useful for our progress in
 

5145
01:51:04,230 --> 01:51:06,620
that are useful for our progress in
society even though might seem

5146
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:06,630
society even though might seem
 

5147
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:08,560
society even though might seem
dysfunctional inside the moment but

5148
01:51:08,560 --> 01:51:08,570
dysfunctional inside the moment but
 

5149
01:51:08,570 --> 01:51:11,360
dysfunctional inside the moment but
having the multiple value systems used

5150
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,370
having the multiple value systems used
 

5151
01:51:11,370 --> 01:51:14,750
having the multiple value systems used
to be beneficial for I guess a balance

5152
01:51:14,750 --> 01:51:14,760
to be beneficial for I guess a balance
 

5153
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:17,600
to be beneficial for I guess a balance
of power so that's yeah let's not not

5154
01:51:17,600 --> 01:51:17,610
of power so that's yeah let's not not
 

5155
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:19,580
of power so that's yeah let's not not
exactly what I have in mind that it's

5156
01:51:19,580 --> 01:51:19,590
exactly what I have in mind that it's
 

5157
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:21,440
exactly what I have in mind that it's
well although alchemy may be in an

5158
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:21,450
well although alchemy may be in an
 

5159
01:51:21,450 --> 01:51:26,660
well although alchemy may be in an
indirect way it is but that if you had

5160
01:51:26,660 --> 01:51:26,670
indirect way it is but that if you had
 

5161
01:51:26,670 --> 01:51:28,430
indirect way it is but that if you had
the chance to do something that scored

5162
01:51:28,430 --> 01:51:28,440
the chance to do something that scored
 

5163
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:32,870
the chance to do something that scored
well in several different isometrics our

5164
01:51:32,870 --> 01:51:32,880
well in several different isometrics our
 

5165
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,550
well in several different isometrics our
first instinct should be to do that

5166
01:51:34,550 --> 01:51:34,560
first instinct should be to do that
 

5167
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:36,710
first instinct should be to do that
rather than immediately leap to the

5168
01:51:36,710 --> 01:51:36,720
rather than immediately leap to the
 

5169
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,080
rather than immediately leap to the
thing ah which one's of these value

5170
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:39,090
thing ah which one's of these value
 

5171
01:51:39,090 --> 01:51:41,420
thing ah which one's of these value
systems are we gonna screw over like our

5172
01:51:41,420 --> 01:51:41,430
systems are we gonna screw over like our
 

5173
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:43,190
systems are we gonna screw over like our
first in let's first try to do very well

5174
01:51:43,190 --> 01:51:43,200
first in let's first try to do very well
 

5175
01:51:43,200 --> 01:51:45,050
first in let's first try to do very well
by all of them yeah then it might be

5176
01:51:45,050 --> 01:51:45,060
by all of them yeah then it might be
 

5177
01:51:45,060 --> 01:51:46,790
by all of them yeah then it might be
that you can't get a hundred percent of

5178
01:51:46,790 --> 01:51:46,800
that you can't get a hundred percent of
 

5179
01:51:46,800 --> 01:51:49,070
that you can't get a hundred percent of
all and you would have to then like have

5180
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:49,080
all and you would have to then like have
 

5181
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:50,510
all and you would have to then like have
the hard conversation about which one

5182
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:50,520
the hard conversation about which one
 

5183
01:51:50,520 --> 01:51:52,130
the hard conversation about which one
will only get ninety-seven particular

5184
01:51:52,130 --> 01:51:52,140
will only get ninety-seven particular
 

5185
01:51:52,140 --> 01:51:54,020
will only get ninety-seven particular
there's my cynicism that all of

5186
01:51:54,020 --> 01:51:54,030
there's my cynicism that all of
 

5187
01:51:54,030 --> 01:51:56,390
there's my cynicism that all of
existence is always a trade-off but you

5188
01:51:56,390 --> 01:51:56,400
existence is always a trade-off but you
 

5189
01:51:56,400 --> 01:51:58,610
existence is always a trade-off but you
say that maybe it's not such a bad trade

5190
01:51:58,610 --> 01:51:58,620
say that maybe it's not such a bad trade
 

5191
01:51:58,620 --> 01:51:59,300
say that maybe it's not such a bad trade
office first

5192
01:51:59,300 --> 01:51:59,310
office first
 

5193
01:51:59,310 --> 01:52:00,680
office first
he's right well this would be a

5194
01:52:00,680 --> 01:52:00,690
he's right well this would be a
 

5195
01:52:00,690 --> 01:52:03,430
he's right well this would be a
distinctive context in which at least

5196
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:03,440
distinctive context in which at least
 

5197
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:08,230
distinctive context in which at least
some of the constraints would be removed

5198
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:08,240
some of the constraints would be removed
 

5199
01:52:08,240 --> 01:52:10,280
some of the constraints would be removed
probably stupid trade-offs in the end

5200
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:10,290
probably stupid trade-offs in the end
 

5201
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:11,870
probably stupid trade-offs in the end
it's just that we should first make sure

5202
01:52:11,870 --> 01:52:11,880
it's just that we should first make sure
 

5203
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,440
it's just that we should first make sure
we at least take advantage of this

5204
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:14,450
we at least take advantage of this
 

5205
01:52:14,450 --> 01:52:18,080
we at least take advantage of this
abundance so in terms of thinking about

5206
01:52:18,080 --> 01:52:18,090
abundance so in terms of thinking about
 

5207
01:52:18,090 --> 01:52:20,090
abundance so in terms of thinking about
this like yeah what one should think I

5208
01:52:20,090 --> 01:52:20,100
this like yeah what one should think I
 

5209
01:52:20,100 --> 01:52:24,490
this like yeah what one should think I
think in this kind of frame of mind of

5210
01:52:24,490 --> 01:52:24,500
think in this kind of frame of mind of
 

5211
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:28,490
think in this kind of frame of mind of
generosity and a inclusiveness to

5212
01:52:28,490 --> 01:52:28,500
generosity and a inclusiveness to
 

5213
01:52:28,500 --> 01:52:30,890
generosity and a inclusiveness to
different value systems and and see how

5214
01:52:30,890 --> 01:52:30,900
different value systems and and see how
 

5215
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:33,800
different value systems and and see how
far one can get there first

5216
01:52:33,800 --> 01:52:33,810
far one can get there first
 

5217
01:52:33,810 --> 01:52:36,710
far one can get there first
and I think one could do something that

5218
01:52:36,710 --> 01:52:36,720
and I think one could do something that
 

5219
01:52:36,720 --> 01:52:38,210
and I think one could do something that
that would be very good according to

5220
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:38,220
that would be very good according to
 

5221
01:52:38,220 --> 01:52:42,260
that would be very good according to
many different criteria we kind of

5222
01:52:42,260 --> 01:52:42,270
many different criteria we kind of
 

5223
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:45,020
many different criteria we kind of
talked about AGI fundamentally

5224
01:52:45,020 --> 01:52:45,030
talked about AGI fundamentally
 

5225
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:49,190
talked about AGI fundamentally
transforming the the value system of our

5226
01:52:49,190 --> 01:52:49,200
transforming the the value system of our
 

5227
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:52,160
transforming the the value system of our
existence the mean the meaning of life

5228
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:52,170
existence the mean the meaning of life
 

5229
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:54,320
existence the mean the meaning of life
but today what do you think is the

5230
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:54,330
but today what do you think is the
 

5231
01:52:54,330 --> 01:52:56,900
but today what do you think is the
meaning of life what are you the serious

5232
01:52:56,900 --> 01:52:56,910
meaning of life what are you the serious
 

5233
01:52:56,910 --> 01:52:58,700
meaning of life what are you the serious
or perhaps the biggest question what's

5234
01:52:58,700 --> 01:52:58,710
or perhaps the biggest question what's
 

5235
01:52:58,710 --> 01:53:00,050
or perhaps the biggest question what's
the meaning of life what's the meaning

5236
01:53:00,050 --> 01:53:00,060
the meaning of life what's the meaning
 

5237
01:53:00,060 --> 01:53:03,440
the meaning of life what's the meaning
of existence what makes what gives your

5238
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:03,450
of existence what makes what gives your
 

5239
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:05,180
of existence what makes what gives your
life fulfillment purpose

5240
01:53:05,180 --> 01:53:05,190
life fulfillment purpose
 

5241
01:53:05,190 --> 01:53:09,500
life fulfillment purpose
happiness meaning yeah I think these are

5242
01:53:09,500 --> 01:53:09,510
happiness meaning yeah I think these are
 

5243
01:53:09,510 --> 01:53:13,370
happiness meaning yeah I think these are
like I guess a bunch of different but

5244
01:53:13,370 --> 01:53:13,380
like I guess a bunch of different but
 

5245
01:53:13,380 --> 01:53:15,290
like I guess a bunch of different but
related questions in there that one can

5246
01:53:15,290 --> 01:53:15,300
related questions in there that one can
 

5247
01:53:15,300 --> 01:53:19,970
related questions in there that one can
ask happiness meaning yeah I mean it

5248
01:53:19,970 --> 01:53:19,980
ask happiness meaning yeah I mean it
 

5249
01:53:19,980 --> 01:53:21,080
ask happiness meaning yeah I mean it
like he's pretty bad and somebody

5250
01:53:21,080 --> 01:53:21,090
like he's pretty bad and somebody
 

5251
01:53:21,090 --> 01:53:22,310
like he's pretty bad and somebody
getting a lot of happiness for something

5252
01:53:22,310 --> 01:53:22,320
getting a lot of happiness for something
 

5253
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:26,080
getting a lot of happiness for something
that they didn't think was meaningful

5254
01:53:26,080 --> 01:53:26,090
that they didn't think was meaningful
 

5255
01:53:26,090 --> 01:53:29,750
that they didn't think was meaningful
like mindless like watching reruns of

5256
01:53:29,750 --> 01:53:29,760
like mindless like watching reruns of
 

5257
01:53:29,760 --> 01:53:31,189
like mindless like watching reruns of
some television series avoiding junk

5258
01:53:31,189 --> 01:53:31,199
some television series avoiding junk
 

5259
01:53:31,199 --> 01:53:32,720
some television series avoiding junk
food like maybe some people that gives

5260
01:53:32,720 --> 01:53:32,730
food like maybe some people that gives
 

5261
01:53:32,730 --> 01:53:34,970
food like maybe some people that gives
pleasure but they wouldn't think it had

5262
01:53:34,970 --> 01:53:34,980
pleasure but they wouldn't think it had
 

5263
01:53:34,980 --> 01:53:36,620
pleasure but they wouldn't think it had
a lot of meaning whereas conversely

5264
01:53:36,620 --> 01:53:36,630
a lot of meaning whereas conversely
 

5265
01:53:36,630 --> 01:53:38,810
a lot of meaning whereas conversely
something that might be quite loaded

5266
01:53:38,810 --> 01:53:38,820
something that might be quite loaded
 

5267
01:53:38,820 --> 01:53:40,189
something that might be quite loaded
with meaning might not be very fun

5268
01:53:40,189 --> 01:53:40,199
with meaning might not be very fun
 

5269
01:53:40,199 --> 01:53:42,860
with meaning might not be very fun
always like some difficult achievement

5270
01:53:42,860 --> 01:53:42,870
always like some difficult achievement
 

5271
01:53:42,870 --> 01:53:44,510
always like some difficult achievement
that really helps a lot of people maybe

5272
01:53:44,510 --> 01:53:44,520
that really helps a lot of people maybe
 

5273
01:53:44,520 --> 01:53:47,420
that really helps a lot of people maybe
requires self-sacrifice and hard work

5274
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:47,430
requires self-sacrifice and hard work
 

5275
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:51,320
requires self-sacrifice and hard work
and so so these things can I think come

5276
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:51,330
and so so these things can I think come
 

5277
01:53:51,330 --> 01:53:56,570
and so so these things can I think come
apart which is something to bear in mind

5278
01:53:56,570 --> 01:53:56,580
apart which is something to bear in mind
 

5279
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,170
apart which is something to bear in mind
also when if you're thinking about these

5280
01:53:59,170 --> 01:53:59,180
also when if you're thinking about these
 

5281
01:53:59,180 --> 01:54:05,030
also when if you're thinking about these
utopia questions that you might actually

5282
01:54:05,030 --> 01:54:05,040
utopia questions that you might actually
 

5283
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,189
utopia questions that you might actually
start to do some constructive thinking

5284
01:54:07,189 --> 01:54:07,199
start to do some constructive thinking
 

5285
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:09,610
start to do some constructive thinking
about that you might have to isolate and

5286
01:54:09,610 --> 01:54:09,620
about that you might have to isolate and
 

5287
01:54:09,620 --> 01:54:12,890
about that you might have to isolate and
distinguish these different kinds of

5288
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:12,900
distinguish these different kinds of
 

5289
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,540
distinguish these different kinds of
things that might be valuable in

5290
01:54:14,540 --> 01:54:14,550
things that might be valuable in
 

5291
01:54:14,550 --> 01:54:17,090
things that might be valuable in
different ways make sure you can sort of

5292
01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:17,100
different ways make sure you can sort of
 

5293
01:54:17,100 --> 01:54:18,800
different ways make sure you can sort of
clearly perceive each one of them and

5294
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:18,810
clearly perceive each one of them and
 

5295
01:54:18,810 --> 01:54:20,510
clearly perceive each one of them and
then you can think about how you can

5296
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:20,520
then you can think about how you can
 

5297
01:54:20,520 --> 01:54:22,990
then you can think about how you can
combine them and just as you said

5298
01:54:22,990 --> 01:54:23,000
combine them and just as you said
 

5299
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,060
combine them and just as you said
hopefully come up with a way to maximize

5300
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:26,070
hopefully come up with a way to maximize
 

5301
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:30,170
hopefully come up with a way to maximize
all of them together yeah maximize or or

5302
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:30,180
all of them together yeah maximize or or
 

5303
01:54:30,180 --> 01:54:32,959
all of them together yeah maximize or or
get like a very high score on on a wide

5304
01:54:32,959 --> 01:54:32,969
get like a very high score on on a wide
 

5305
01:54:32,969 --> 01:54:34,760
get like a very high score on on a wide
range of them even if not literally all

5306
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:34,770
range of them even if not literally all
 

5307
01:54:34,770 --> 01:54:36,410
range of them even if not literally all
you can always come up with values that

5308
01:54:36,410 --> 01:54:36,420
you can always come up with values that
 

5309
01:54:36,420 --> 01:54:38,689
you can always come up with values that
are exactly opposed to one another right

5310
01:54:38,689 --> 01:54:38,699
are exactly opposed to one another right
 

5311
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:41,689
are exactly opposed to one another right
but I think for many values they're kind

5312
01:54:41,689 --> 01:54:41,699
but I think for many values they're kind
 

5313
01:54:41,699 --> 01:54:45,470
but I think for many values they're kind
of a post with m'p lace them in in a

5314
01:54:45,470 --> 01:54:45,480
of a post with m'p lace them in in a
 

5315
01:54:45,480 --> 01:54:48,770
of a post with m'p lace them in in a
certain dimensionality of your face like

5316
01:54:48,770 --> 01:54:48,780
certain dimensionality of your face like
 

5317
01:54:48,780 --> 01:54:51,620
certain dimensionality of your face like
there are shapes that are kind of you

5318
01:54:51,620 --> 01:54:51,630
there are shapes that are kind of you
 

5319
01:54:51,630 --> 01:54:54,439
there are shapes that are kind of you
can't untangle like in a given

5320
01:54:54,439 --> 01:54:54,449
can't untangle like in a given
 

5321
01:54:54,449 --> 01:54:55,939
can't untangle like in a given
dimensionality but if you start adding

5322
01:54:55,939 --> 01:54:55,949
dimensionality but if you start adding
 

5323
01:54:55,949 --> 01:54:57,950
dimensionality but if you start adding
dimensions then it might in many cases

5324
01:54:57,950 --> 01:54:57,960
dimensions then it might in many cases
 

5325
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:00,530
dimensions then it might in many cases
just be that they are easy to pull apart

5326
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:00,540
just be that they are easy to pull apart
 

5327
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:03,260
just be that they are easy to pull apart
and you could so we'll see how much

5328
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:03,270
and you could so we'll see how much
 

5329
01:55:03,270 --> 01:55:05,000
and you could so we'll see how much
space there is for that but I think that

5330
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:05,010
space there is for that but I think that
 

5331
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:07,910
space there is for that but I think that
there could be a lot in this context of

5332
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:07,920
there could be a lot in this context of
 

5333
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,459
there could be a lot in this context of
radical abundance if ever we get to that

5334
01:55:10,459 --> 01:55:10,469
radical abundance if ever we get to that
 

5335
01:55:10,469 --> 01:55:14,209
radical abundance if ever we get to that
I don't think there's a better way to

5336
01:55:14,209 --> 01:55:14,219
I don't think there's a better way to
 

5337
01:55:14,219 --> 01:55:16,550
I don't think there's a better way to
end it Nick you've influenced the huge

5338
01:55:16,550 --> 01:55:16,560
end it Nick you've influenced the huge
 

5339
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:18,500
end it Nick you've influenced the huge
