period after that word now what do we do
 

481
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,650
period after that word now what do we do
practically

482
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,660
practically

and the pain that's a good question is
 

1307
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:53,409
and the pain that's a good question is
is there a trick to it

1308
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:53,419
is there a trick to it
 

1309
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:56,269
is there a trick to it
not that I know of

1310
00:26:56,269 --> 00:26:56,279
not that I know of
 

1311
00:26:56,279 --> 00:26:58,130
not that I know of
I mean I don't

1312
00:26:58,130 --> 00:26:58,140

00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:04,380

 

1317
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,169

trying to intellectualize my way into

1318
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:06,179
trying to intellectualize my way into
 

1319
00:27:06,179 --> 00:27:09,470
trying to intellectualize my way into
the reasoning

1320
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:09,480

 

1321
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,070

and not skip over real

1322
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:13,080
and not skip over real
 

1323
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:15,049
and not skip over real
feelings and discomfort

1324
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:15,059
feelings and discomfort
 

1325
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:17,510

00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:21,600
resilient that we just dust ourselves
 

1331
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,330
resilient that we just dust ourselves

um now I was raised where you skipped
 

1347
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,549
um now I was raised where you skipped
the deeply feel and let's go

1348
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:40,559
the deeply feel and let's go
 

1349
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,409
the deeply feel and let's go

lead to having
 

1353
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:47,630
lead to having
turned into a person who is a repeat

pile of whatever 100 times and I'm fine
 

1375
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,769
pile of whatever 100 times and I'm fine
I'll do it 101st doesn't hurt hell it's

1376
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:09,779
I'll do it 101st doesn't hurt hell it's
 

1377
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,230
I'll do it 101st doesn't hurt hell it's
good luck well hang on a minute maybe we

1378
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:12,240
good luck well hang on a minute maybe we
 

1379
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,789
good luck well hang on a minute maybe we
want to stop and go what can I learn

1380
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:13,799
want to stop and go what can I learn
 

1381
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:15,669
want to stop and go what can I learn
from that

1382
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:15,679
from that
 

1383
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,250
from that
but it it it it

1384
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:19,260
but it it it it
 

1385
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:22,909
but it it it it
I don't know of a trick

1386
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:22,919

 

1387
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:24,649

I think I think that I think that I

1388
00:28:24,649 --> 00:28:24,659
I think I think that I think that I
 

1389
00:28:24,659 --> 00:28:26,149
I think I think that I think that I
think our fifth there's any trick I

1390
00:28:26,149 --> 00:28:26,159
think our fifth there's any trick I
 

1391
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:28,610
think our fifth there's any trick I
would say

1392
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:28,620

 

1393
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,130

it's just it how quickly can we admit

1394
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:31,140
it's just it how quickly can we admit
 

1395
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,289
it's just it how quickly can we admit
the inevitable

1396
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:33,299
the inevitable
 

1397
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,130
the inevitable
I just want to talk about in the book

1398
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:34,140
I just want to talk about in the book
 

1399
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,810
I just want to talk about in the book
about because I get once you once you

1400
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:35,820
about because I get once you once you
 

1401
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,430
about because I get once you once you
know it's inevitable how do we get

1402
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:37,440
know it's inevitable how do we get
 

1403
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,430
know it's inevitable how do we get
relative yeah not skip it not throw it

1404
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:40,440
relative yeah not skip it not throw it
 

1405
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,190
relative yeah not skip it not throw it
to the side not deny it which I'd love

1406
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:43,200
to the side not deny it which I'd love
 

1407
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,350
to the side not deny it which I'd love
to talk about that here sometimes too

1408
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:45,360
to talk about that here sometimes too
 

1409
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,690
to talk about that here sometimes too
about the value of denial sometimes the

1410
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:47,700
about the value of denial sometimes the
 

1411
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,210
about the value of denial sometimes the
value of denial yeah

1412
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:50,220
value of denial yeah
 

1413
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,210
value of denial yeah
um but how quickly do we do we once

1414
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:53,220
um but how quickly do we do we once
 

1415
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,310
um but how quickly do we do we once
something's inevitable go

1416
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:55,320
something's inevitable go
 

1417
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,169
something's inevitable go
okay any mind and hard time I'm spending

1418
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:00,179
okay any mind and hard time I'm spending
 

1419
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:02,390
okay any mind and hard time I'm spending
about going no I can't believe that

1420
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:02,400
about going no I can't believe that
 

1421
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,090
about going no I can't believe that
happened no did that really happen

1422
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:05,100
happened no did that really happen
 

1423
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,250
happened no did that really happen
anytime we spin it trying to deny that

1424
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:07,260
anytime we spin it trying to deny that
 

1425
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,049
anytime we spin it trying to deny that
what has already happened that seems to

1426
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:09,059
what has already happened that seems to
 

1427
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,730
what has already happened that seems to
me to be I'm not sure the value of that

1428
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:10,740
me to be I'm not sure the value of that
 

1429
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,990
me to be I'm not sure the value of that
time

1430
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:12,000
time
 

1431
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,970
time
so if any if there's any trick I would

1432
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:13,980
so if any if there's any trick I would
 

1433
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,769
so if any if there's any trick I would
say once you know something's inevitable

1434
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:15,779
say once you know something's inevitable
 

1435
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:17,750
say once you know something's inevitable
even though how painful it is or how

1436
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:17,760
even though how painful it is or how
 

1437
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,549
even though how painful it is or how
awesome it is

1438
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:19,559
awesome it is
 

1439
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:22,250
awesome it is
start getting relative with that and in

1440
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,260
start getting relative with that and in
 

1441
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,909
start getting relative with that and in
the relativity is seeing

1442
00:29:25,909 --> 00:29:25,919

 

1443
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,710

there's a gift here and if I realize

1444
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:27,720
there's a gift here and if I realize
 

1445
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,590
there's a gift here and if I realize
that gift I'm

1446
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
that gift I'm
 

1447
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,769
that gift I'm
honoring now I'm on to building up

1448
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:33,779
honoring now I'm on to building up
 

1449
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,750
honoring now I'm on to building up
the beautiful passage of my father

1450
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:35,760
the beautiful passage of my father
 

1451
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,350
the beautiful passage of my father

1452
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
leaving this life now I'm on the march
 

1453
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,010
leaving this life now I'm on the march
to go yes let's let the Legacy let this

1454
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:43,020
to go yes let's let the Legacy let this
 

1455
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,690
to go yes let's let the Legacy let this
become omnipresent let him live through

1456
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:44,700
become omnipresent let him live through
 

1457
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,210
become omnipresent let him live through
me let me become more Hamlet

1458
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:47,220
me let me become more Hamlet
 

1459
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,090
me let me become more Hamlet
it's transformed yeah so what value is

1460
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:50,100
it's transformed yeah so what value is
 

1461
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,669
it's transformed yeah so what value is
there then to uh denial

1462
00:29:52,669 --> 00:29:52,679
there then to uh denial
 

1463
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:54,370

about 80 percent of people's challenges

about 80 percent of people's challenges
 

1573
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,870
about 80 percent of people's challenges
and problems even in their life were

1574
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:14,880
and problems even in their life were
 

1575
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,909
and problems even in their life were
something in the past that they were

1576
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:16,919
something in the past that they were
 

1577
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:18,130
something in the past that they were
hung up on

1578
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:18,140
hung up on
 

1579
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,950
hung up on
that they could not seem to get past and

1580
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:21,960
that they could not seem to get past and
 

1581
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,510
that they could not seem to get past and
it was it was holding them from going

1582
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:23,520
it was it was holding them from going
 

1583
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,250
it was it was holding them from going
where they wanted to in their future and

1584
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,260
where they wanted to in their future and
 

1585
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,350
where they wanted to in their future and
so

1586
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:27,360

that light's not on Mom the lights on we
 

1783
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,230
that light's not on Mom the lights on we
just that light's not on if I say it's

1784
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:27,240
just that light's not on if I say it's
 

1785
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,670
just that light's not on if I say it's
not on sometimes you're just like that

not on sometimes you're just like that
 

1787
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,290
not on sometimes you're just like that
makes no sense you just absolutely

1788
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:30,300
makes no sense you just absolutely
 

1789
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,030
makes no sense you just absolutely
denying what just happened we even have

recording's line yeah I mean is that's
part of a coping deal with her but I

1796
00:36:37,849 --> 00:36:37,859
part of a coping deal with her but I
 

1797
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:39,530
part of a coping deal with her but I
mean what I think is more important or

more valuable is to talk about this

1800
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:41,820
more valuable is to talk about this
 

1801
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,370
more valuable is to talk about this
she didn't deny my dad

for my husband your father Jim
 

1823
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:14,390
for my husband your father Jim
McConaughey and I think I I mean we were

1824
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:14,400
McConaughey and I think I I mean we were
 

1825
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,950
McConaughey and I think I I mean we were
just

1826
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:15,960
just
 

1827
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,310
just
thought that's beautiful yes Mom go talk

1828
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:19,320
thought that's beautiful yes Mom go talk
 

1829
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,550
thought that's beautiful yes Mom go talk
about green like go

1830
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560

 

1831
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,690

now if we're hung up going

1832
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:26,700

 

1833
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,609

can't have one or the it can't have them

1834
00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:28,619
can't have one or the it can't have them
 

1835
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:29,569
can't have one or the it can't have them
both

1836
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:29,579
both
 

1837
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:31,970
both
gotta have one or the other now we start

1838
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:31,980
gotta have one or the other now we start
 

1839
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,650
gotta have one or the other now we start
to make a contradiction of the two ideas

1840
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:33,660
to make a contradiction of the two ideas
 

1841
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,770
to make a contradiction of the two ideas
again which Dawn our contradictions get

1842
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:36,780
again which Dawn our contradictions get
 

1843
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,630
again which Dawn our contradictions get
us in trouble all the time man that's

1844
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:38,640
us in trouble all the time man that's
 

1845
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,170
us in trouble all the time man that's
life though the contradictions right

1846
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:42,180
life though the contradictions right
 

1847
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,050
life though the contradictions right
but is it life if if we just admit the

1848
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:45,060
but is it life if if we just admit the
 

1849
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,370
but is it life if if we just admit the
contradictions or so much don't they

1850
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:46,380
contradictions or so much don't they
 

1851
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,569
contradictions or so much don't they
become a paradox

1852
00:37:47,569 --> 00:37:47,579
become a paradox
 

1853
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,550
become a paradox
would admit that that's part of it yeah

1854
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:49,560
would admit that that's part of it yeah
 

1855
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,010
would admit that that's part of it yeah
if if contradictions are inevitable they

1856
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,020
if if contradictions are inevitable they
 

1857
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,170
if if contradictions are inevitable they
essentially they do become a paradox

1858
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:54,180
essentially they do become a paradox
 

1859
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,370
essentially they do become a paradox
don't they

1860
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:55,380
don't they
 

1861
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:59,089
don't they
then where in the Honeywell

1862
00:37:59,089 --> 00:37:59,099
then where in the Honeywell
 

1863
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,190
then where in the Honeywell
then we're sinking and dancing

1864
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,200
then we're sinking and dancing
 

1865
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,450
then we're sinking and dancing
and have

1866
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:02,460
and have
 

1867
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,310
and have
leniency with ourself while still

1868
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
leniency with ourself while still
 

1869
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,990
leniency with ourself while still
holding our self to task and it's it's

1870
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,000
holding our self to task and it's it's
 

1871
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,870
holding our self to task and it's it's
I think it's holding on to no each

1872
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:11,880
I think it's holding on to no each
 

1873
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,270
I think it's holding on to no each
contradiction oh here it is again so

1874
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:14,280
contradiction oh here it is again so
 

1875
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,069
contradiction oh here it is again so
it's a one-off it lives on its own

1876
00:38:16,069 --> 00:38:16,079
it's a one-off it lives on its own
 

1877
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,730
it's a one-off it lives on its own
separate from the last one no it doesn't

1878
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:18,740
separate from the last one no it doesn't
 

1879
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,109
separate from the last one no it doesn't
they're connected that's why they are

1880
00:38:21,109 --> 00:38:21,119
they're connected that's why they are
 

1881
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,450
they're connected that's why they are
Paradox and then that's I think that's a

1882
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:23,460
Paradox and then that's I think that's a
 

1883
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:24,230
Paradox and then that's I think that's a
much

1884
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:24,240
much
 

1885
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,630
much
I think that's where life really is

1886
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:26,640
I think that's where life really is
 

1887
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,589
I think that's where life really is
in the Paradox yes in the dance of it uh

1888
00:38:30,589 --> 00:38:30,599
in the Paradox yes in the dance of it uh
 

1889
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,510
in the Paradox yes in the dance of it uh
I think the metaphor of red yellow green

1890
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:32,520
I think the metaphor of red yellow green
 

1891
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:36,530
I think the metaphor of red yellow green
lights is just so simple and so powerful

1892
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:36,540
lights is just so simple and so powerful
 

1893
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,390
lights is just so simple and so powerful
you write about some green lights being

1894
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:38,400
you write about some green lights being
 

1895
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,329
you write about some green lights being
engineered and some being mystical

1896
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:41,339
engineered and some being mystical
 

1897
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:43,609
engineered and some being mystical
which I love the difference of that

1898
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:43,619
which I love the difference of that
 

1899
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,010
which I love the difference of that
what's the difference of the engineered

1900
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:46,020
what's the difference of the engineered
 

1901
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,829
what's the difference of the engineered
green lights and the mystical such a

1902
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:48,839
green lights and the mystical such a
 

1903
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:51,829
green lights and the mystical such a
cool word mystical yeah well the

1904
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:51,839
cool word mystical yeah well the
 

1905
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,510
cool word mystical yeah well the
engineered ones have reason and the

1906
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:53,520
engineered ones have reason and the
 

1907
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,089
engineered ones have reason and the
mystical ones have rhyme

1908
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:56,099
mystical ones have rhyme
 

1909
00:38:56,099 --> 00:38:58,609
mystical ones have rhyme
yeah you know Life's a mystery going

1910
00:38:58,609 --> 00:38:58,619
yeah you know Life's a mystery going
 

1911
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,270
yeah you know Life's a mystery going
forward but it's a science looking back

1912
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:02,280
forward but it's a science looking back
 

1913
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,150
forward but it's a science looking back

2043
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:37,910
mean
you the significance is there but we

2044
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:37,920
you the significance is there but we
 

2045
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,770
you the significance is there but we
have to I think what we also got to

2046
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:39,780
have to I think what we also got to
 

2047
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:42,710
have to I think what we also got to
watch is again in that balance

what do we change because do we've just
 

2051
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:47,750
what do we change because do we've just
changed the engineering we miss magic if

2052
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:47,760
changed the engineering we miss magic if
 

2053
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,810
changed the engineering we miss magic if
we just chase the mystical

2054
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:50,820
we just chase the mystical
 

2055
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,609
we just chase the mystical
we find ourselves caught up in trying to

2056

we find ourselves caught up in trying to
 

2057
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,890
we find ourselves caught up in trying to
give meaning to the Lego set that was on

2058
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:54,900
give meaning to the Lego set that was on
 

2059
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,569
give meaning to the Lego set that was on
the floor that the kids didn't pick up

2060
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:56,579
the floor that the kids didn't pick up
 

2061
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,390
the floor that the kids didn't pick up
that and what color was it and and why

2062
00:41:59,390 --> 00:41:59,400
that and what color was it and and why
 

2063
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,310
that and what color was it and and why
did I walk out that that door and see

2064
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:01,320
did I walk out that that door and see
 

2065
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,589
did I walk out that that door and see
almost up on the Legos but if I'd gone

2066
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:03,599
almost up on the Legos but if I'd gone
 

2067
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,089
almost up on the Legos but if I'd gone
out the other door I used to go out of I

2068
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:05,099
out the other door I used to go out of I
 

2069
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:06,170
out the other door I used to go out of I
would have gone there I would have got

2070
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:06,180
would have gone there I would have got
 

2071
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,730
would have gone there I would have got
there early and wouldn't run into the

2072
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:07,740
there early and wouldn't run into the
 

2073
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:10,370
there early and wouldn't run into the
the boss and the the so you can start to

2074
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:10,380
the boss and the the so you can start to
 

2075
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:11,750
the boss and the the so you can start to
give too much

2076
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:11,760
give too much
 

2077
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,750
give too much
meaning on that as well I think we can

2078
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:14,760
meaning on that as well I think we can
 

2079
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,670
meaning on that as well I think we can
give significance in too many places and

2080
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:16,680
give significance in too many places and
 

2081
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,690
give significance in too many places and
all of a sudden

2082
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:17,700
all of a sudden
 

2083
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,250
all of a sudden
I think we've all been there where

2084
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:19,260
I think we've all been there where
 

2085
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:22,370
I think we've all been there where
you're seeing art in every single thing

2086
00:42:22,370 --> 00:42:22,380
you're seeing art in every single thing
 

2087
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:24,710
you're seeing art in every single thing
oh man that can be paralyzing

it's like it's hard to leave a room
 

2091
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,829
it's like it's hard to leave a room
if everything's significant you know or

2092
00:42:30,829 --> 00:42:30,839
if everything's significant you know or
 

2093
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:32,990
if everything's significant you know or
if everything's a sign

2094

2095
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,510
if everything's a sign
how much of success in life do you think

2096
00:42:35,510 --> 00:42:35,520
how much of success in life do you think
 

2097
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,849
how much of success in life do you think
is uh engineered and how much is

2098
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:37,859
is uh engineered and how much is
 

2099
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:40,490
is uh engineered and how much is
Mystical I and how much does it differ

2100
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:40,500
Mystical I and how much does it differ
 

2101
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,650
Mystical I and how much does it differ
from person to person because I for me

2102
00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:42,660
from person to person because I for me
 

2103
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:45,109
from person to person because I for me
personally maybe I enjoy it maybe I'm

2104
00:42:45,109 --> 00:42:45,119
personally maybe I enjoy it maybe I'm
 

2105
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,030
personally maybe I enjoy it maybe I'm
genetically built that way but I exist

2106
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:47,040
genetically built that way but I exist
 

2107
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,970
genetically built that way but I exist
more in the mystical so I don't make

2108
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:49,980
more in the mystical so I don't make
 

2109
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:54,290
more in the mystical so I don't make
plans I travel last summer in Ukraine

2110
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:54,300
plans I travel last summer in Ukraine
 

2111
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,370
plans I travel last summer in Ukraine
with no plan I just went there no plan

2112
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:58,380
with no plan I just went there no plan
 

2113
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:01,130
with no plan I just went there no plan
I didn't know how I'm going to meet the

2114
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:01,140
I didn't know how I'm going to meet the
 

2115
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,109
I didn't know how I'm going to meet the
president of the country I didn't know

2116
00:43:03,109 --> 00:43:03,119
president of the country I didn't know
 

2117
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,510
president of the country I didn't know
anybody and so

2118
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
anybody and so
 

2119
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,550
anybody and so
there's no plan there's no clear thing

2120
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:07,560
there's no plan there's no clear thing
 

2121
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,410
there's no plan there's no clear thing
you're just roaming around and that's

2122
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:09,420
you're just roaming around and that's
 

2123
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,530
you're just roaming around and that's
how I've existed in life and it there's

2124
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:12,540
how I've existed in life and it there's
 

2125
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,270
how I've existed in life and it there's
something about giving yourself over to

2126
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,280
something about giving yourself over to
 

2127
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,030
something about giving yourself over to
the flow of nature that I just enjoy it

2128
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
the flow of nature that I just enjoy it
 

2129
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,829
the flow of nature that I just enjoy it
makes life so much fun

2130
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:18,839
makes life so much fun
 

2131
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:20,329
makes life so much fun
it's

2132
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:20,339
it's
 

2133
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:23,030
it's
awesome when you can do it did you

2134
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:23,040
awesome when you can do it did you
 

2135
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,490
awesome when you can do it did you
engineer though I'm going to put myself

2136
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:25,500
engineer though I'm going to put myself
 

2137
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,190
engineer though I'm going to put myself
in the place when you got on the plane

2138
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:28,200
in the place when you got on the plane
 

2139
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:31,190
in the place when you got on the plane
to go to the destination that was an

2140
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:31,200
to go to the destination that was an
 

2141
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,450
to go to the destination that was an
engineered choice

2142
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:35,460

 

2143
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,790

and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into

2144
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:37,800
and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into
 

2145
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:38,990
and maybe I'll meet and I'll run into
and I can

2146
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:39,000
and I can
 

2147
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,650
and I can
work up a sit down with

2148
00:43:42,650 --> 00:43:42,660
work up a sit down with
 

2149
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,450
work up a sit down with
so the engineering Choice was putting

2150
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:44,460
so the engineering Choice was putting
 

2151
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:46,190
so the engineering Choice was putting
your shoes on proverbially get you know

2152
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:46,200
your shoes on proverbially get you know
 

2153
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,150
your shoes on proverbially get you know
I always say this the hardest part about

2154
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:47,160
I always say this the hardest part about
 

2155
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,410
I always say this the hardest part about
going to gyms putting your shoes on

2156
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:48,420
going to gyms putting your shoes on
 

2157
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:50,809
going to gyms putting your shoes on
right so to getting on the plane that

2158
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:50,819
right so to getting on the plane that
 

2159
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,609
right so to getting on the plane that
was an engineered thought with the goal

2160
00:43:52,609 --> 00:43:52,619
was an engineered thought with the goal
 

2161
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:53,569
was an engineered thought with the goal
in mind but I don't know how I'm going

2162
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:53,579
in mind but I don't know how I'm going
 

2163
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:55,430
in mind but I don't know how I'm going
to do it

2164
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:55,440
to do it
 

2165
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,650
to do it
the choice yeah putting the shoes on

2166
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:57,660
the choice yeah putting the shoes on
 

2167
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:58,790
the choice yeah putting the shoes on
yeah

2168
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,800
yeah
 

2169
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,670
yeah
but there's not a clear it's a fog what

2170
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:01,680
but there's not a clear it's a fog what
 

2171
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,589
but there's not a clear it's a fog what
happens after the shoe is gone

2172
00:44:03,589 --> 00:44:03,599
happens after the shoe is gone
 

2173
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,930
happens after the shoe is gone
yeah yeah

2174
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:04,940
yeah yeah
 

2175
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:06,970
yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

2176
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:06,980
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
 

2177
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,130
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
it's gonna take that leap so I I wonder

2178
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:10,140
it's gonna take that leap so I I wonder
 

2179
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,950
it's gonna take that leap so I I wonder
how much uh

2180
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:12,960
how much uh
 

2181
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,930
how much uh
for people who are successful in this

2182
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:14,940
for people who are successful in this
 

2183
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:17,630
for people who are successful in this
world in finding what makes them uh

2184
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:17,640
world in finding what makes them uh
 

2185
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,210
world in finding what makes them uh
truly happy and fulfilled how much of it

2186
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:20,220
truly happy and fulfilled how much of it
 

2187
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,210
truly happy and fulfilled how much of it
is engineer how much it is Mystical

2188
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:23,220
is engineer how much it is Mystical
 

2189
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,150
is engineer how much it is Mystical
how much was it for you well I'll say

2190
00:44:26,150 --> 00:44:26,160
how much was it for you well I'll say
 

2191
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,270
how much was it for you well I'll say
this like an hour at winter right

2192
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:29,280
this like an hour at winter right
 

2193
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,950
this like an hour at winter right
about green lights which is basically

2194
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:30,960
about green lights which is basically
 

2195
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,470
about green lights which is basically
the last 40 years of my life I thought

2196
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:33,480
the last 40 years of my life I thought
 

2197
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,730
the last 40 years of my life I thought
that 85 90 of my successes were going to

2198
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:37,740
that 85 90 of my successes were going to
 

2199
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,569
that 85 90 of my successes were going to
be

2200
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:38,579
be
 

2201
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:40,670
be
obviously engineered

2202
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:40,680
obviously engineered
 

2203
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,589
obviously engineered
or I could see the signs it's all the

2204
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:42,599
or I could see the signs it's all the
 

2205
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:44,329
or I could see the signs it's all the
habits here's what I did yep that add up

2206
00:44:44,329 --> 00:44:44,339
habits here's what I did yep that add up
 

2207
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:46,609
habits here's what I did yep that add up
got the solution got the conclusion

2208
00:44:46,609 --> 00:44:46,619
got the solution got the conclusion
 

2209
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:49,309
got the solution got the conclusion
I was

2210
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:49,319
I was
 

2211
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:52,250
I was
very surprised when I noticed it was

2212
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:52,260
very surprised when I noticed it was
 

2213
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:54,589
very surprised when I noticed it was
probably less than 50 percent

2214
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:54,599
probably less than 50 percent
 

2215
00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:56,450
probably less than 50 percent
and that most of the real successes of

2216
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:56,460
and that most of the real successes of
 

2217
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,270
and that most of the real successes of
my for when I

2218
00:44:59,270 --> 00:44:59,280

 

2219
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,309

trusted

2220
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:01,319
trusted
 

2221
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,710
trusted
the one I trusted

00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:03,720
the one I trusted
 

2223
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,630
the one I trusted
that I didn't have to Define it that I

2224
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:05,640
that I didn't have to Define it that I
 

2225
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,069
that I didn't have to Define it that I
only trusted that I didn't have to go

only trusted that I didn't have to go
 

2227
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,950
only trusted that I didn't have to go
what's the measurement

2228
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:09,960

 

2229
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,109

what's the score

2230
00:45:12,109 --> 00:45:12,119
what's the score
 

2231
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,690
what's the score
what this leads to what what's next

2232
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:17,700

 

2233
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:20,809

um

2234
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:20,819

 

2235
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:24,109

and I for me

2236
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:24,119
and I for me
 

2237
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:26,089
and I for me
that that's still there's still a

2238
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:26,099
that that's still there's still a
 

2239
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,530
that that's still there's still a
challenge for me

2240
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:27,540
challenge for me
 

2241
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:30,349
challenge for me
daily

2242
00:45:30,349 --> 00:45:30,359

 

2243
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:32,990

now is to trust and not be because I can

2244
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:33,000
now is to trust and not be because I can
 

2245
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,490
now is to trust and not be because I can
be I could I think I can be overly

2246
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:34,500
be I could I think I can be overly
 

2247
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,690
be I could I think I can be overly
practical

2248
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:35,700
practical
 

2249
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,550
practical
and I think I can over over compensate

2250
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:37,560
and I think I can over over compensate
 

2251
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,250
and I think I can over over compensate
and miss out on Magic

2252
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:40,260
and miss out on Magic
 

2253
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,150
and miss out on Magic
because I'm still

00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,609
are
but it's a really arrogant notion to

2896
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:04,619
but it's a really arrogant notion to
 

2897
00:59:04,619 --> 00:59:06,410
but it's a really arrogant notion to
think that

2898
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:06,420
think that
 

2899
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:08,809
think that
we are separate meaning you know people

2900
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:08,819
we are separate meaning you know people
 

2901
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:11,270
we are separate meaning you know people
talk about

2902
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:11,280

 

2903
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,210

pollution on a larger scale the the

2904
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:14,220
pollution on a larger scale the the
 

2905
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,549
pollution on a larger scale the the
climate what have you

2906
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:16,559
climate what have you
 

2907
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:19,490
climate what have you
I think Earth's gonna be just fine yeah

2908
00:59:19,490 --> 00:59:19,500
I think Earth's gonna be just fine yeah
 

2909
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:22,549
I think Earth's gonna be just fine yeah
we maybe not be here for it but

2910
00:59:22,549 --> 00:59:22,559
we maybe not be here for it but
 

2911
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:23,870
we maybe not be here for it but
I think we have a bit of arrogant

2912
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:23,880
I think we have a bit of arrogant
 

2913
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,390
I think we have a bit of arrogant
sometime to think that we

2914
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:26,400
sometime to think that we
 

2915
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,690
sometime to think that we
can Trump Mother Nature I think we have

2916
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:29,700
can Trump Mother Nature I think we have
 

2917
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:33,230
can Trump Mother Nature I think we have
more more of the natural law in us

2918
00:59:33,230 --> 00:59:33,240
more more of the natural law in us
 

2919
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:34,549
more more of the natural law in us
um

2920
00:59:34,549 --> 00:59:34,559
um
 

2921
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:37,849
um
and I sure hope so if I'm wrong

2922
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:37,859
and I sure hope so if I'm wrong
 

2923
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:39,349
and I sure hope so if I'm wrong
well there's an interesting I've

2924
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:39,359
well there's an interesting I've
 

2925
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,049
well there's an interesting I've
recently been uh there's a guy named Max

2926
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:42,059
recently been uh there's a guy named Max
 

2927
00:59:42,059 --> 00:59:44,690
recently been uh there's a guy named Max
tegmark at MIT who really worries about

2928
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:44,700
tegmark at MIT who really worries about
 

2929
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:47,390
tegmark at MIT who really worries about
nuclear war and he was part of uh

2930
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:47,400
nuclear war and he was part of uh
 

2931
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:48,890
nuclear war and he was part of uh
constructing a simulation of what

2932
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:48,900
constructing a simulation of what
 

2933
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,589
constructing a simulation of what
happens when a nuclear war happens it's

2934
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:51,599
happens when a nuclear war happens it's
 

2935
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:53,870
happens when a nuclear war happens it's
interesting to see that uh you know some

2936
00:59:53,870 --> 00:59:53,880
interesting to see that uh you know some
 

2937
00:59:53,880 --> 00:59:55,549
interesting to see that uh you know some
very large percentage of humans on Earth

2938
00:59:55,549 --> 00:59:55,559
very large percentage of humans on Earth
 

2939
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,450
very large percentage of humans on Earth
uh starve to death

2940
00:59:58,450 --> 00:59:58,460
uh starve to death
 

2941
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,710
uh starve to death
because they don't die first from the

2942
01:00:00,710 --> 01:00:00,720
because they don't die first from the
 

2943
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,270
because they don't die first from the
explosion they die from starvation

2944
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:02,280
explosion they die from starvation
 

2945
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:07,670
explosion they die from starvation
because uh basically uh dust covers the

2946
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:07,680
because uh basically uh dust covers the
 

2947
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:10,309
because uh basically uh dust covers the
entire North America and entirety of

2948
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:10,319
entire North America and entirety of
 

2949
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:11,329
entire North America and entirety of
Europe

2950
01:00:11,329 --> 01:00:11,339
Europe
 

2951
01:00:11,339 --> 01:00:13,490
Europe
and so the crops all die all the food

2952
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:13,500
and so the crops all die all the food
 

2953
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:15,710
and so the crops all die all the food
sources all die and people suffocate and

2954
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:15,720
sources all die and people suffocate and
 

2955
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,990
sources all die and people suffocate and
uh starve to death

2956
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:18,000
uh starve to death
 

2957
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,789
uh starve to death
but you know the lesson you'll learn

2958
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:19,799
but you know the lesson you'll learn
 

2959
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:21,589
but you know the lesson you'll learn
from that over a period of a few months

2960
01:00:21,589 --> 01:00:21,599
from that over a period of a few months
 

2961
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:23,150
from that over a period of a few months
even though most of the human population

2962
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:23,160
even though most of the human population
 

2963
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,190
even though most of the human population
of Earth dies

2964
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
of Earth dies
 

2965
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,450
of Earth dies
Earth

2966
01:00:26,450 --> 01:00:26,460
Earth
 

2967
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,690
Earth
finds a way life finds a way to do that

2968
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:29,700
finds a way life finds a way to do that
 

2969
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,970
finds a way life finds a way to do that
he had to adapt and it's gonna be just

2970
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:31,980
he had to adapt and it's gonna be just
 

2971
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,410
he had to adapt and it's gonna be just
fine yeah in terms of the big uh living

2972
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:36,420
fine yeah in terms of the big uh living
 

2973
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:39,349
fine yeah in terms of the big uh living
ecosystem that is life on Earth

2974
01:00:39,349 --> 01:00:39,359
ecosystem that is life on Earth
 

2975
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,510
ecosystem that is life on Earth
and yeah it's humbling to think about

2976
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:41,520
and yeah it's humbling to think about
 

2977
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:44,450
and yeah it's humbling to think about
well maybe we're just the stepping stone

2978
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:44,460
well maybe we're just the stepping stone
 

2979
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:47,089
well maybe we're just the stepping stone
same thing with we've talked offline

2980
01:00:47,089 --> 01:00:47,099
same thing with we've talked offline
 

2981
01:00:47,099 --> 01:00:49,250
same thing with we've talked offline
about artificial intelligence maybe

2982
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:49,260
about artificial intelligence maybe
 

2983
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:51,589
about artificial intelligence maybe
humans are just a stepping stone to the

2984
01:00:51,589 --> 01:00:51,599
humans are just a stepping stone to the
 

2985
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:53,510
humans are just a stepping stone to the
development of these other

2986
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:53,520
development of these other
 

2987
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,829
development of these other
super intelligent entities yeah

2988
01:00:57,829 --> 01:00:57,839
super intelligent entities yeah
 

2989
01:00:57,839 --> 01:00:59,930
super intelligent entities yeah
yeah

2990
01:00:59,930 --> 01:00:59,940

 

2991
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:03,309

and is it

2992
01:01:03,309 --> 01:01:03,319

 

2993
01:01:03,319 --> 01:01:05,870

unconsciously in our nature that that's

2994
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:05,880
unconsciously in our nature that that's
 

2995
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,710
unconsciously in our nature that that's
just

2996
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:06,720
just
 

2997
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:10,309
just
part of the evolution and adaptation

2998
01:01:10,309 --> 01:01:10,319
part of the evolution and adaptation
 

2999
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,410
part of the evolution and adaptation
of our species and we'll because we're

3000
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:12,420
of our species and we'll because we're
 

3001
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,430

01:01:13,430 --> 01:01:13,440
gonna
 

3003
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,410
gonna
we were talking about earlier what AI

3004
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:15,420
we were talking about earlier what AI
 

3005
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:18,410
we were talking about earlier what AI
becomes

3006
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:18,420

 

3007
01:01:18,420 --> 01:01:25,430

is completely 100 based on Who We Are

3008
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:25,440
is completely 100 based on Who We Are
 

3009
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:28,490
is completely 100 based on Who We Are
and we get to see it for some time a

3010
01:01:28,490 --> 01:01:28,500
and we get to see it for some time a
 

3011
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,770
and we get to see it for some time a
mirror to ourselves okay this is what

3012
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:30,780
mirror to ourselves okay this is what
 

3013
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,829
mirror to ourselves okay this is what
human civilization is like these uh

3014
01:01:33,829 --> 01:01:33,839
human civilization is like these uh
 

3015
01:01:33,839 --> 01:01:36,170
human civilization is like these uh
AI systems large language models are

3016
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:36,180
AI systems large language models are
 

3017
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,410
AI systems large language models are
trained on human communication and you

3018
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:39,420
trained on human communication and you
 

3019
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:41,030

01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:45,059
wow this is what
 

3025
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:47,510
wow this is what
the uh the collective intelligence of

the paradoxes all that is in there yeah

3036
01:02:00,770 --> 01:02:00,780
the paradoxes all that is in there yeah
 

3037
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:01,670
the paradoxes all that is in there yeah
um

3038
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:01,680
um
 

3039
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,650
um
the contradictions

3040
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:03,660
the contradictions
 

3041
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,930
the contradictions
you can even convince those models you

3042
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:05,940
you can even convince those models you
 

3043
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:07,370
you can even convince those models you
can you can tell them they're lying and

3044
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:07,380
can you can tell them they're lying and
 

3045
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:08,990
can you can tell them they're lying and
they're going to start changing their

3046
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:09,000
they're going to start changing their
 

3047
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,470
they're going to start changing their
mind it's interesting to play with them

3048
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:12,480
mind it's interesting to play with them
 

3049
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,730
mind it's interesting to play with them
um it's also interesting to consider

3050
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:13,740
um it's also interesting to consider
 

3051
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,010
um it's also interesting to consider
that maybe they uh

3052
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:16,020
that maybe they uh
 

3053
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,250
that maybe they uh
they become smarter than us and

3054
01:02:19,250 --> 01:02:19,260
they become smarter than us and
 

3055
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:23,270
they become smarter than us and
uh become almost life forms that live

3056
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:23,280
uh become almost life forms that live
 

3057
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,670
uh become almost life forms that live
among us and maybe one day

3058
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:25,680
among us and maybe one day
 

3059
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:27,530
among us and maybe one day
kind of we merge with them there's all

3060
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:27,540
kind of we merge with them there's all
 

3061
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,329
kind of we merge with them there's all
kinds of possible

3062
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:29,339
kinds of possible
 

3063
01:02:29,339 --> 01:02:31,010
kinds of possible
trajectories that we take here how much

3064
01:02:31,010 --> 01:02:31,020
trajectories that we take here how much
 

3065
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,329
trajectories that we take here how much
did that excite you how much of it

3066
01:02:32,329 --> 01:02:32,339
did that excite you how much of it
 

3067
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:33,530
did that excite you how much of it
scares you

3068
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:33,540
scares you
 

3069
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:35,690
scares you
is it possible to exist in a place where

3070
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:35,700
is it possible to exist in a place where
 

3071
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:38,210
is it possible to exist in a place where
it is both exciting and scary but to

3072
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:38,220
it is both exciting and scary but to
 

3073
01:02:38,220 --> 01:02:40,069
it is both exciting and scary but to
exist in that dance

3074
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:40,079
exist in that dance
 

3075
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:43,069
exist in that dance
mostly I'm really excited

3076
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:43,079
mostly I'm really excited
 

3077
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:46,549
mostly I'm really excited
because

3078
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:46,559

 

3079
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,510

I see human beings as deeply lonely like

3080
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:50,520
I see human beings as deeply lonely like
 

3081
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,130
I see human beings as deeply lonely like
there's a deep loneliness at all this is

3082
01:02:52,130 --> 01:02:52,140
there's a deep loneliness at all this is
 

3083
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,630
there's a deep loneliness at all this is
how we seek connection

3084
01:02:53,630 --> 01:02:53,640
how we seek connection
 

3085
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,609
how we seek connection
that's why we see Connection in others

3086
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:55,619
that's why we see Connection in others
 

3087
01:02:55,619 --> 01:02:57,289
that's why we see Connection in others
that's why love is so beautiful when we

3088
01:02:57,289 --> 01:02:57,299
that's why love is so beautiful when we
 

3089
01:02:57,299 --> 01:02:59,150
that's why love is so beautiful when we
find other people we're connected with

3090
01:02:59,150 --> 01:02:59,160
find other people we're connected with
 

3091
01:02:59,160 --> 01:03:01,970
find other people we're connected with
and I just think AI can add to that you

3092
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:01,980
and I just think AI can add to that you
 

3093
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:03,650
and I just think AI can add to that you
can add

3094
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:03,660
can add
 

3095
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,870
can add
friends that you can have

3096
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:05,880
friends that you can have
 

3097
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,809
friends that you can have
great conversations with

3098
01:03:08,809 --> 01:03:08,819
great conversations with
 

3099
01:03:08,819 --> 01:03:10,849
great conversations with
and then some of those friends would be

3100
01:03:10,849 --> 01:03:10,859
and then some of those friends would be
 

3101
01:03:10,859 --> 01:03:14,390
and then some of those friends would be
AI systems

3102
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:14,400

 

3103
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,890

that

3114
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:24,839
that
 

3115
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:30,109
that
is that different and if so how from

3116
01:03:30,109 --> 01:03:30,119
is that different and if so how from
 

3117
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:34,010
is that different and if so how from
the internet and Facebooks and these

3118
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:34,020
the internet and Facebooks and these
 

3119
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,349
the internet and Facebooks and these
groups and communities that

3120
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:38,359
groups and communities that
 

3121
01:03:38,359 --> 01:03:41,450
groups and communities that
were I think it's fair to say set out to

3122
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:41,460
were I think it's fair to say set out to
 

3123
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,609
were I think it's fair to say set out to
say this all access of information and

3124
01:03:43,609 --> 01:03:43,619
say this all access of information and
 

3125
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,130
say this all access of information and
people will help us find more common

3126
01:03:46,130 --> 01:03:46,140
people will help us find more common
 

3127
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:48,289
people will help us find more common
denominators than

3128
01:03:48,289 --> 01:03:48,299
denominators than
 

3129
01:03:48,299 --> 01:03:50,150
denominators than
divisive ones

3130
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:50,160
divisive ones
 

3131
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:53,569
divisive ones
um is is it do you see it similar yeah

3132
01:03:53,569 --> 01:03:53,579
um is is it do you see it similar yeah
 

3133
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:56,030
um is is it do you see it similar yeah
it's similar but further into that

3134
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:56,040
it's similar but further into that
 

3135
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,490
it's similar but further into that
direction I think the internet has done

3136
01:03:58,490 --> 01:03:58,500
direction I think the internet has done
 

3137
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,530
direction I think the internet has done
an amazing thing in connecting us and

3138
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:00,540
an amazing thing in connecting us and
 

3139
01:04:00,540 --> 01:04:02,569
an amazing thing in connecting us and
expanding our minds and helping us find

3140
01:04:02,569 --> 01:04:02,579
expanding our minds and helping us find
 

3141
01:04:02,579 --> 01:04:04,069
expanding our minds and helping us find
community

3142
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
community
 

3143
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,230
community
that feels like our community and then

3144
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:06,240
that feels like our community and then
 

3145
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:07,250
that feels like our community and then
the communities that are totally

3146
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:07,260
the communities that are totally
 

3147
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,170
the communities that are totally
different you can learn from them I mean

3148
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:09,180
different you can learn from them I mean
 

3149
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,150
different you can learn from them I mean
Wikipedia alone one of my favorite

3150
01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:11,160
Wikipedia alone one of my favorite
 

3151
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,890
Wikipedia alone one of my favorite
websites

3152
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:12,900
websites
 

3153
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:15,710
websites
just oh opens your mind to all kinds of

3154
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:15,720
just oh opens your mind to all kinds of
 

3155
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,049
just oh opens your mind to all kinds of
cool stuff yeah it does

3156
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:18,059
cool stuff yeah it does
 

3157
01:04:18,059 --> 01:04:20,569
cool stuff yeah it does
and not doing the awesome system anymore

3158
01:04:20,569 --> 01:04:20,579
and not doing the awesome system anymore
 

3159
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:25,549
and not doing the awesome system anymore
no and so uh I think AI just open makes

3160
01:04:25,549 --> 01:04:25,559
no and so uh I think AI just open makes
 

3161
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,650
no and so uh I think AI just open makes
that even easier because Wikipedia have

3162
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:27,660
that even easier because Wikipedia have
 

3163
01:04:27,660 --> 01:04:30,170
that even easier because Wikipedia have
to like read and have to do a lot of

3164
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:30,180
to like read and have to do a lot of
 

3165
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,190
to like read and have to do a lot of
work

3166
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:31,200
work
 

3167
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,650
work
uh with an AI system like a large

3168
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:33,660
uh with an AI system like a large
 

3169
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:35,030
uh with an AI system like a large
language model you can just shoot the

3170
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:35,040
language model you can just shoot the
 

3171
01:04:35,040 --> 01:04:37,030
language model you can just shoot the
[\h__\h] it's more like drinking a beer

3172
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:37,040
[\h__\h] it's more like drinking a beer
 

3173
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:40,609
[\h__\h] it's more like drinking a beer
versus like uh doing homework yeah yeah

3174
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:40,619
versus like uh doing homework yeah yeah
 

3175
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,770
versus like uh doing homework yeah yeah
yeah yeah

3176

about that becoming the new family to
where

where
 

3183
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:51,530
where
you know you said you know marriage you

3184
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:51,540
you know you said you know marriage you
 

3185

you know you said you know marriage you
don't have kids could you see a future

3186
01:04:53,089 --> 01:04:53,099
don't have kids could you see a future
 

3187
01:04:53,099 --> 01:04:54,589
don't have kids could you see a future
for yourself whether you have a

3188
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:54,599
for yourself whether you have a
 

3189
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:58,069
for yourself whether you have a
relationship with AI and that is your

3190
01:04:58,069 --> 01:04:58,079
relationship with AI and that is your
 

3191
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,650
relationship with AI and that is your
family and that's the main that's the

3192
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:00,660
family and that's the main that's the
 

3193

um it's I wonder how much that now that

3206
01:05:22,069 --> 01:05:22,079
um it's I wonder how much that now that
 

3207
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:24,230
um it's I wonder how much that now that
takes us back to the Amazon in nature

3208
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:24,240
takes us back to the Amazon in nature
 

3209
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:26,450
takes us back to the Amazon in nature
how much we still need the human touch

3210
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:26,460
how much we still need the human touch
 

3211
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,789
how much we still need the human touch
yeah and whatever magic there is between

3212
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:28,799
yeah and whatever magic there is between
 

3213
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,030
yeah and whatever magic there is between
two humans which takes the leap into the

3214
01:05:32,030 --> 01:05:32,040
two humans which takes the leap into the
 

3215
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,470
two humans which takes the leap into the
romantic

3216
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:33,480
romantic
 

3217
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,270
romantic

mentor and friend just like uh now
there's AI systems that play chess far

3268
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:35,760
there's AI systems that play chess far
 

3269
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,270
there's AI systems that play chess far
far far better than humans and we humans

3270
01:06:38,270 --> 01:06:38,280
far far better than humans and we humans
 

3271
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:40,490
far far better than humans and we humans
still play chess with each other

3272
01:06:40,490 --> 01:06:40,500
still play chess with each other
 

3273
01:06:40,500 --> 01:06:42,650
still play chess with each other
or did they chess is still a game that's

3274
01:06:42,650 --> 01:06:42,660
or did they chess is still a game that's
 

3275
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:45,230
or did they chess is still a game that's
fun for us humans right and then we use

3276
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:45,240
fun for us humans right and then we use
 

3277
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,210
fun for us humans right and then we use
the AI systems to get better at just to

3278
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:47,220
the AI systems to get better at just to
 

3279
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,309
the AI systems to get better at just to
learn to train

3280
01:06:49,309 --> 01:06:49,319
learn to train
 

3281
01:06:49,319 --> 01:06:52,130
learn to train
to discover new ideas but ultimately

3282
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:52,140
to discover new ideas but ultimately
 

3283
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:54,529
to discover new ideas but ultimately
return to the chess board between two

3284
01:06:54,529 --> 01:06:54,539
return to the chess board between two
 

3285
01:06:54,539 --> 01:06:56,750
return to the chess board between two
humans

3286
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:56,760
humans
 

3287
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:59,329
humans
uh but of course this world is full of

3288
01:06:59,329 --> 01:06:59,339
uh but of course this world is full of
 

3289
01:06:59,339 --> 01:07:01,849
uh but of course this world is full of
dangerous people and so those same AI

3290
01:07:01,849 --> 01:07:01,859
dangerous people and so those same AI
 

3291
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:04,849
dangerous people and so those same AI
systems can be used to um

3292
01:07:04,849 --> 01:07:04,859
systems can be used to um
 

3293
01:07:04,859 --> 01:07:09,049
systems can be used to um
to harm to create false narratives to do

3294
01:07:09,049 --> 01:07:09,059
to harm to create false narratives to do
 

3295
01:07:09,059 --> 01:07:10,910
to harm to create false narratives to do
social engineering and manipulate the

3296
01:07:10,910 --> 01:07:10,920
social engineering and manipulate the
 

3297
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,309
social engineering and manipulate the
masses in terms of what they believe and

3298
01:07:13,309 --> 01:07:13,319
masses in terms of what they believe and
 

3299
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:16,490
masses in terms of what they believe and
all that kind of stuff that's scary yeah

3300
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:16,500
all that kind of stuff that's scary yeah
 

3301
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,510
all that kind of stuff that's scary yeah
well and I I get it when we and I have

3302
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:20,520
well and I I get it when we and I have
 

3303
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:25,250
well and I I get it when we and I have
my own fear and distrust is

3304
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:25,260
my own fear and distrust is
 

3305
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:27,650
my own fear and distrust is
of AI is based on my own fear and

3306
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:27,660
of AI is based on my own fear and
 

3307
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:31,910
of AI is based on my own fear and
distrust of myself and others

3308
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:31,920

 

3309
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,010

there's something it's so very simple

3310
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:34,020
there's something it's so very simple
 

3311
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:37,190
there's something it's so very simple
but I think it's it's a really fun

3312
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:37,200
but I think it's it's a really fun
 

3313
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:38,990
but I think it's it's a really fun
sort of

3314
01:07:38,990 --> 01:07:39,000
sort of
 

3315
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,270
sort of
way to just set up this reality and

3316
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:41,280
way to just set up this reality and
 

3317
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:43,730
way to just set up this reality and
everyone it's kind of a duh but still

3318
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:43,740
everyone it's kind of a duh but still
 

3319
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,549
everyone it's kind of a duh but still
needs to be said that

3320
01:07:45,549 --> 01:07:45,559
needs to be said that
 

3321
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:48,950
needs to be said that
AI is a prompt is there it doesn't do

3322
01:07:48,950 --> 01:07:48,960
AI is a prompt is there it doesn't do
 

3323
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:51,829
AI is a prompt is there it doesn't do
anything unless we ask it

3324
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:51,839
anything unless we ask it
 

3325
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:53,930
anything unless we ask it
so

3326
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:53,940
so
 

3327
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:55,849
so
what questions

3328
01:07:55,849 --> 01:07:55,859
what questions
 

3329
01:07:55,859 --> 01:07:58,370
what questions
yeah are we gonna ask is a question is

3330
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:58,380
yeah are we gonna ask is a question is
 

3331

01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,390
what those are
yeah I think uh some of that is manually

yeah I think uh some of that is manually
uh those are constraints put on by it by

basically
 

3461
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,030
basically
not letting the systems have an identity

3462
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:47,040
not letting the systems have an identity
 

3463

yet but I believe that we'll have
 

3469
01:10:52,820 --> 01:10:55,970
yet but I believe that we'll have
systems that have an identity have a

3470
01:10:55,970 --> 01:10:55,980
systems that have an identity have a
 

3471
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:58,310
systems that have an identity have a
belief have a set of opinions like that

of having them
 

3759
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,209
of having them
because it's

instead of Judge but I don't want to be
so puritanical as to go and admit it and

01:17:13,250 --> 01:17:13,260
so puritanical as to go and admit it and
 

3781

3789
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:28,490
saying this and I'm
doing something different

3790
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:28,500

 

3791
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,010

and when we admit it
 

3957
01:20:33,060 --> 01:20:36,169
and when we admit it
then we go when we admit a lie

3958

there's a honesty to that it just seems
of course it's dangerous because uh it's

a slippery slope uh that because of the
 

5207
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:57,950
a slippery slope uh that because of the
power in that power corrupts it can be a

power in that power corrupts it can be a
 

5209
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,229
power in that power corrupts it can be a
slippery slope or you completely

5210
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:00,239
slippery slope or you completely
 

5211
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:01,910
slippery slope or you completely
disregard the law and you can hurt a lot

disregard the law and you can hurt a lot
 

5213
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:02,750
disregard the law and you can hurt a lot
of people

5214

of people
 

5215
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:05,930
of people
but when done right you know

but when done right you know
 

5217
01:46:05,940 --> 01:46:09,109
but when done right you know
there feels to be a

there feels to be a
something really uh authentic and human

5220

something really uh authentic and human
 

5221

look I you know

5226
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:23,460

 

5227
01:46:23,460 --> 01:46:25,370

this is a broader question but I'm going

5228
01:46:25,370 --> 01:46:25,380
this is a broader question but I'm going
 

5229
01:46:25,380 --> 01:46:32,990
this is a broader question but I'm going
to piggyback it off this

5230
01:46:32,990 --> 01:46:33,000

 

5231
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:36,729

back to the dreams and reality and then

5232
01:46:36,729 --> 01:46:36,739
back to the dreams and reality and then
 

5233
01:46:36,739 --> 01:46:39,290
back to the dreams and reality and then
evolved species and how what can we do

5234
01:46:39,290 --> 01:46:39,300
evolved species and how what can we do
 

5235
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,750
evolved species and how what can we do
in creating a digital God and Ai and

5236
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:41,760
in creating a digital God and Ai and
 

5237
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:44,390
in creating a digital God and Ai and
these communities and friends that

5238
01:46:44,390 --> 01:46:44,400
these communities and friends that
 

5239
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,430
these communities and friends that
challenge us and think like us we like

challenge us and think like us we like
to hang out with our

5242
01:46:50,570 --> 01:46:50,580

 

5243
01:46:50,580 --> 01:46:53,510

do you think we're less evolved

5244
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:53,520
do you think we're less evolved
 

5245
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,010
do you think we're less evolved
species than we give ourselves credit

5246
01:46:55,010 --> 01:46:55,020
species than we give ourselves credit
 

5247
01:46:55,020 --> 01:46:56,510
species than we give ourselves credit
for do you think we give ourselves

5248
01:46:56,510 --> 01:46:56,520
for do you think we give ourselves
 

5249
01:46:56,520 --> 01:46:58,490
for do you think we give ourselves
credit for being more involved

5250
01:46:58,490 --> 01:46:58,500
credit for being more involved
 

5251
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,590
credit for being more involved
than we actually are

5252
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:00,600
than we actually are
 

5253
01:47:00,600 --> 01:47:04,189
than we actually are
I think we do I do

5254
01:47:04,189 --> 01:47:04,199

 

5255
01:47:04,199 --> 01:47:06,350

I think we need to admit that

5256
01:47:06,350 --> 01:47:06,360
I think we need to admit that
 

5257
01:47:06,360 --> 01:47:08,870

5261
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,910

and that's why it's so appealing to

5262
01:47:16,910 --> 01:47:16,920
and that's why it's so appealing to
 

5263
01:47:16,920 --> 01:47:18,229
and that's why it's so appealing to
people

5264

people
 

5265
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,330
people
it kind of wakes them up to realize that

5266
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:20,340
it kind of wakes them up to realize that
 

5267

important
um

5276

01:51:44,050 --> 01:51:44,060

 

5461
01:51:44,060 --> 01:51:48,470

politics is it's

5462
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:48,480

 

5463
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,970

I'm not going to say it's it's because

5464
01:51:49,970 --> 01:51:49,980
I'm not going to say it's it's because
 

5465
01:51:49,980 --> 01:51:53,330
I'm not going to say it's it's because
it's not it's not small and I'm not I

5466
01:51:53,330 --> 01:51:53,340
it's not it's not small and I'm not I
 

5467

it's not it's not small and I'm not I
don't I don't that's that's why I say

that out loud it's not small I do think

5470
01:51:57,290 --> 01:51:57,300
that out loud it's not small I do think
 

5471
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:00,290
that out loud it's not small I do think
it needs to re-engineer and re-define

5472
01:52:00,290 --> 01:52:00,300
it needs to re-engineer and re-define
 

5473
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:03,590
it needs to re-engineer and re-define
what its purpose is before because it's

5474
01:52:03,590 --> 01:52:03,600
what its purpose is before because it's
 

5475
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:05,810
what its purpose is before because it's
just chasing its own tail right now with

5476
01:52:05,810 --> 01:52:05,820
just chasing its own tail right now with
 

5477
01:52:05,820 --> 01:52:07,790
just chasing its own tail right now with
the with the with the with the two

5478
01:52:07,790 --> 01:52:07,800
the with the with the with the two
 

5479
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:10,370
the with the with the with the two
parties uh that are seem to me to be

5480
01:52:10,370 --> 01:52:10,380
parties uh that are seem to me to be
 

5481
01:52:10,380 --> 01:52:12,350
parties uh that are seem to me to be
completely about just invalidation of

5482
01:52:12,350 --> 01:52:12,360
completely about just invalidation of
 

5483
01:52:12,360 --> 01:52:14,689
completely about just invalidation of
the opposition instead of vision of

5484
01:52:14,689 --> 01:52:14,699
the opposition instead of vision of
 

5485
01:52:14,699 --> 01:52:17,090
the opposition instead of vision of
themselves

5486
01:52:17,090 --> 01:52:17,100
themselves
 

5487
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,709
themselves
um

5488
01:52:18,709 --> 01:52:18,719
um
 

5489
01:52:18,719 --> 01:52:21,470
um
so I think it needs redefinition of what

5490
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:21,480
so I think it needs redefinition of what
 

5491
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:22,729
so I think it needs redefinition of what
it is because it is important that's

5492
01:52:22,729 --> 01:52:22,739
it is because it is important that's
 

5493
01:52:22,739 --> 01:52:23,990
it is because it is important that's
what I mean that's why I said I don't

5494
01:52:23,990 --> 01:52:24,000
what I mean that's why I said I don't
 

5495
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,270
what I mean that's why I said I don't
mean small it's it's it needs to think

5496
01:52:26,270 --> 01:52:26,280
mean small it's it's it needs to think
 

5497
01:52:26,280 --> 01:52:28,729
mean small it's it's it needs to think
bigger about what it is and how it's

5498
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:28,739
bigger about what it is and how it's
 

5499
01:52:28,739 --> 01:52:31,310
bigger about what it is and how it's
useful when it seeks to invalidate it's

5500
01:52:31,310 --> 01:52:31,320
useful when it seeks to invalidate it's
 

5501
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:34,550
useful when it seeks to invalidate it's
small when it seeks vision

5502
01:52:34,550 --> 01:52:34,560
small when it seeks vision
 

5503
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,189
small when it seeks vision

that oh it's going to be about ownership
 

5937
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:31,189
that oh it's going to be about ownership
and we would be trespassing I think it

5938
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:31,199
and we would be trespassing I think it
 

5939
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:34,070
and we would be trespassing I think it
would be I don't think they're

5940
02:01:34,070 --> 02:01:34,080
would be I don't think they're
 

5941
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:36,530
would be I don't think they're
would have a sense of borders as we do I

5942
02:01:36,530 --> 02:01:36,540
would have a sense of borders as we do I
 

5943
02:01:36,540 --> 02:01:38,709
would have a sense of borders as we do I

just hope we humans are smart enough to
 

5945
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:43,010
just hope we humans are smart enough to
detect and to see aliens

5946
02:01:43,010 --> 02:01:43,020
detect and to see aliens
 

5947
02:01:43,020 --> 02:01:44,870

and he's just speculating how hard it

6090
02:04:46,370 --> 02:04:46,380
and he's just speculating how hard it
 

6091
02:04:46,380 --> 02:04:47,810
and he's just speculating how hard it
could be much harder in different ways

6092
02:04:47,810 --> 02:04:47,820
could be much harder in different ways
 

6093
02:04:47,820 --> 02:04:49,790
could be much harder in different ways

we have an innate ability but we don't
 

6153
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:10,850
we have an innate ability but we don't
want to work for it we take it for

6154
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:10,860
want to work for it we take it for
 

6155
02:06:10,860 --> 02:06:13,250
want to work for it we take it for
granted

6156
02:06:13,250 --> 02:06:13,260

 

6157
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:15,709

and we end up doing something that may

6158
02:06:15,709 --> 02:06:15,719
and we end up doing something that may
 

6159
02:06:15,719 --> 02:06:18,109
and we end up doing something that may
work I pay the bills make it a spy day

6160
02:06:18,109 --> 02:06:18,119
work I pay the bills make it a spy day

to day
 

6163
02:06:19,500 --> 02:06:21,169
to day
but we don't really like it we have

6164
02:06:21,169 --> 02:06:21,179
but we don't really like it we have
 

6165
02:06:21,179 --> 02:06:23,450
but we don't really like it we have
trouble finding a way to enjoy it

6166
02:06:23,450 --> 02:06:23,460
trouble finding a way to enjoy it
 

6167
02:06:23,460 --> 02:06:26,390
trouble finding a way to enjoy it
definitely don't love it

definitely don't love it
 

6169
02:06:26,400 --> 02:06:28,550
definitely don't love it
and then sometimes

6170
02:06:28,550 --> 02:06:28,560
and then sometimes
 

6171
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:30,589
and then sometimes
we don't know what our innate ability is

6172
02:06:30,589 --> 02:06:30,599
we don't know what our innate ability is
 

6173
02:06:30,599 --> 02:06:32,030
we don't know what our innate ability is
and we're hustling and working our tail

6174
02:06:32,030 --> 02:06:32,040
and we're hustling and working our tail
 

6175
02:06:32,040 --> 02:06:33,830
and we're hustling and working our tail
off and breaking a sweat to do something

6176
02:06:33,830 --> 02:06:33,840
off and breaking a sweat to do something
 

6177
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:36,410
off and breaking a sweat to do something
that we really aren't that

6178
02:06:36,410 --> 02:06:36,420
that we really aren't that
 

6179
02:06:36,420 --> 02:06:39,649
that we really aren't that
good at

6180
02:06:39,649 --> 02:06:39,659

 

6181
02:06:39,659 --> 02:06:42,410

on an n a level

6182
02:06:42,410 --> 02:06:42,420
on an n a level
 

6183
02:06:42,420 --> 02:06:45,649
on an n a level
and that's a good challenge

6184
02:06:45,649 --> 02:06:45,659

 

6185
02:06:45,659 --> 02:06:47,149

and you can

6186
02:06:47,149 --> 02:06:47,159
and you can
 

6187
02:06:47,159 --> 02:06:50,629
and you can
work and become good at something

6188
02:06:50,629 --> 02:06:50,639

 

6189
02:06:50,639 --> 02:06:53,390

that you don't have an innate ability

6190
02:06:53,390 --> 02:06:53,400
that you don't have an innate ability
 

6191
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:55,070
that you don't have an innate ability
for but

for but
 

6193
02:06:55,080 --> 02:06:57,649
for but
if you can match those two what do you

6194
02:06:57,649 --> 02:06:57,659
if you can match those two what do you
 

6195
02:06:57,659 --> 02:06:59,030
if you can match those two what do you
have an innate ability because we have

6196
02:06:59,030 --> 02:06:59,040
have an innate ability because we have
 

6197
02:06:59,040 --> 02:07:00,589
have an innate ability because we have
an innate ability to do when we do that

6198
02:07:00,589 --> 02:07:00,599
an innate ability to do when we do that
 

6199
02:07:00,599 --> 02:07:03,830
an innate ability to do when we do that
well we do kind of enjoy it yeah and one

6200
02:07:03,830 --> 02:07:03,840
well we do kind of enjoy it yeah and one
 

6201
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:05,930
well we do kind of enjoy it yeah and one
of the things that requires is to kind

6202
02:07:05,930 --> 02:07:05,940
of the things that requires is to kind
 

6203
02:07:05,940 --> 02:07:07,850
of the things that requires is to kind

of be really honest with yourself
 

6205
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:10,129
of be really honest with yourself
at what your innate ability is because

at what your innate ability is because
 

6207

at what your innate ability is because
oftentimes there's a lot of noise when

6208
02:07:12,290 --> 02:07:12,300
oftentimes there's a lot of noise when
 

6209
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,669
oftentimes there's a lot of noise when
you're growing up people telling you

6210
02:07:13,669 --> 02:07:13,679
you're growing up people telling you
 

6211
02:07:13,679 --> 02:07:15,169
you're growing up people telling you
what you're good at not good at like

6212
02:07:15,169 --> 02:07:15,179
what you're good at not good at like
 

6213
02:07:15,179 --> 02:07:16,910
what you're good at not good at like
really you have to look at yourself

6214
02:07:16,910 --> 02:07:16,920
really you have to look at yourself
 

6215
02:07:16,920 --> 02:07:20,209
really you have to look at yourself
listen to yourself that inner

6216
02:07:20,209 --> 02:07:20,219
listen to yourself that inner
 

6217
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:23,450
listen to yourself that inner
like a deep rigorous self-analysis of

6218
02:07:23,450 --> 02:07:23,460
like a deep rigorous self-analysis of
 

6219
02:07:23,460 --> 02:07:25,430
like a deep rigorous self-analysis of
what am I actually good at not what I

6220
02:07:25,430 --> 02:07:25,440
what am I actually good at not what I
 

6221
02:07:25,440 --> 02:07:27,050
what am I actually good at not what I
hope to be good at but what I'm actually

6222
02:07:27,050 --> 02:07:27,060
hope to be good at but what I'm actually
 

6223
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:29,510
hope to be good at but what I'm actually
good at right

6224
02:07:29,510 --> 02:07:29,520
good at right
 

6225
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,689
good at right
and then if you look at that and you can

6226
02:07:32,689 --> 02:07:32,699
and then if you look at that and you can
 

6227
02:07:32,699 --> 02:07:36,709
and then if you look at that and you can
define those two

6228
02:07:36,709 --> 02:07:36,719

 

6229
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:39,350

hopefully

hopefully
 

6231
02:07:39,360 --> 02:07:42,709
hopefully
there's you can you can activate it in a

6232
02:07:42,709 --> 02:07:42,719
there's you can you can activate it in a
 

6233
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:45,410
there's you can you can activate it in a
way where there's a demand for what you
