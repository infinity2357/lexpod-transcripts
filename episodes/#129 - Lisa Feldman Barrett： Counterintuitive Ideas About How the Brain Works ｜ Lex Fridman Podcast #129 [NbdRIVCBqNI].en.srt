talk a lot about the brain today do you
 

169
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,470
talk a lot about the brain today do you
think

170
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:48,480
think
 

171
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,309
think
let's ask the craziest question do you

172
00:02:50,309 --> 00:02:50,319
let's ask the craziest question do you
 

173
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,990
let's ask the craziest question do you
think there is other intelligent life

174
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,000
think there is other intelligent life
 

175
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,790
think there is other intelligent life
out there in the

176
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:52,800
out there in the
 

177
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,509
out there in the
universe honestly i've been asking

178
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:55,519
universe honestly i've been asking
 

179
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,190
universe honestly i've been asking
myself lately if there's intelligent

180
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:57,200
myself lately if there's intelligent
 

181
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,270
myself lately if there's intelligent
life on this planet

182
00:02:59,270 --> 00:02:59,280
life on this planet
 

183
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,949
life on this planet
uh you know i ha i i have to

184
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:02,959
uh you know i ha i i have to
 

185
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,070
uh you know i ha i i have to
think probabilities suggest yes and

186
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,080
think probabilities suggest yes and
 

187
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,949
think probabilities suggest yes and
also secretly i think i just hope that's

188
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:08,959
also secretly i think i just hope that's
 

189
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,430
also secretly i think i just hope that's
true

190
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:09,440
true
 

191
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,390
true
it would be really um i know scientists

192
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:12,400
it would be really um i know scientists
 

193
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,070
it would be really um i know scientists
aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams

194
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:14,080
aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams
 

195
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,390
aren't supposed to have hopes and dreams
but

196
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:14,400
but
 

197
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,589
but
uh i i think it would be really cool and

198
00:03:17,589 --> 00:03:17,599
uh i i think it would be really cool and
 

199
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,790
uh i i think it would be really cool and
i also

200
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:18,800
i also
 

201
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,550
i also
think it would be really sad if it if it

202
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:20,560
think it would be really sad if it if it
 

203
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,710
think it would be really sad if it if it
wasn't the case if we really were alone

204
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:22,720
wasn't the case if we really were alone
 

205
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,630
wasn't the case if we really were alone
that would be

206
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:24,640
that would be
 

207
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,990
that would be
that that would seem

208
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,000

 

209
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,470

so um i'm learning all about mushrooms

222
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,080
so um i'm learning all about mushrooms
 

223
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:48,470

and

224
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
and
 

225
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,110
and
uh octopuses and you know all kinds of

226
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:51,120
uh octopuses and you know all kinds of
 

227
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,990

stuff
 

229
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,869
stuff
um and so for me this counts i think in

230
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:54,879
um and so for me this counts i think in
 

231
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:55,270
um and so for me this counts i think in

the
 

233
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,830
the
realm of awe but also i think i'm

realm of awe but also i think i'm
 

235
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,869
realm of awe but also i think i'm
somebody who

236
00:03:58,869 --> 00:03:58,879
somebody who
 

237
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,270
somebody who
cultivates awe deliberately on purpose

238
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:01,280
cultivates awe deliberately on purpose
 

239
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,869

241
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,470
to feel like a speck
you know i i find it a relief

242
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,480
you know i i find it a relief
 

243
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,030
you know i i find it a relief
occasionally it feels small to feel

244
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:09,040
occasionally it feels small to feel
 

245
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,589
occasionally it feels small to feel
small

so maybe to dig more technically

252
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,040
so maybe to dig more technically
 

253
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,110
so maybe to dig more technically
on the question of intelligence do you

254
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:19,120
on the question of intelligence do you
 

255
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,030
on the question of intelligence do you
think it's difficult for intelligent

256
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:21,040
think it's difficult for intelligent
 

257
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,590
think it's difficult for intelligent
life to arise like it did on earth

258
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:23,600
life to arise like it did on earth
 

259
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,430
life to arise like it did on earth
from everything you've written and

260
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:25,440
from everything you've written and
 

261
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,510
from everything you've written and
studied about the brain

262
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:27,520
studied about the brain
 

263
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,629
studied about the brain
how magical of a thing is it

264
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,639
how magical of a thing is it
 

265
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,670
how magical of a thing is it
in terms of the odds it takes to arise

266
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:33,680
in terms of the odds it takes to arise
 

267
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,790
in terms of the odds it takes to arise
yeah so you know magic is just

268
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
yeah so you know magic is just
 

269
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,030
yeah so you know magic is just
don't get me wrong i mean i like i like

270
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,040
don't get me wrong i mean i like i like
 

271
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,430
don't get me wrong i mean i like i like
a magic shirt as much as the next person

272
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:43,440
a magic shirt as much as the next person
 

273
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,670
a magic shirt as much as the next person
my husband was a magician at one time

274
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:45,680
my husband was a magician at one time
 

275
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,710
my husband was a magician at one time
but

276
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:46,720
but
 

277
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,550
but
you know magic is just a bunch of stuff

278
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:48,560
you know magic is just a bunch of stuff
 

279
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,070
you know magic is just a bunch of stuff
that we don't really understand how it

280
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
that we don't really understand how it
 

281
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,990
that we don't really understand how it
works yet so i would say from what i

282
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,000
works yet so i would say from what i
 

283
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,510
works yet so i would say from what i
understand

284
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:53,520
understand
 

285
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,870
understand
there are some major steps in the course

286
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:56,880
there are some major steps in the course
 

287
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,150
there are some major steps in the course
of evolution that at the beginning of

288
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
of evolution that at the beginning of
 

289
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,710
of evolution that at the beginning of
life

290
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:00,720
life
 

291
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,550

the step from single cell to

292
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
the step from single cell to
 

293
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,629
the step from single cell to
multicellular organisms things like that

294
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:04,639
multicellular organisms things like that
 

295
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,590
multicellular organisms things like that
which are

296
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:05,600
which are
 

297
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,110
which are
really not known i think for me the

298
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,120
really not known i think for me the
 

299
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,070
really not known i think for me the
question is not so much um

300
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,080

 

301
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,070

could it you know what's the likelihood

302
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
could it you know what's the likelihood
 

303
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,510
could it you know what's the likelihood
that it would happen again

304
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:17,520
that it would happen again
 

305
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,830
that it would happen again
as much as um

306
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:21,840

 

307
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,430

what are the steps and how long would it

308
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:23,440
what are the steps and how long would it
 

309
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,070
what are the steps and how long would it
take and if it were to happen again on

310
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,080
take and if it were to happen again on
 

311
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,590
take and if it were to happen again on
earth

312
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:27,600
earth
 

313
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,189
earth
would would we end up with the same

314
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:31,199
would would we end up with the same
 

315
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,430
would would we end up with the same
you know menu of life forms that we

316
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,440
you know menu of life forms that we
 

317
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,950
you know menu of life forms that we
currently have now and i think the

318
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:34,960
currently have now and i think the
 

319
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,150
currently have now and i think the
answer is probably no

320
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:36,160
answer is probably no
 

321
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,230
answer is probably no
right there's just so much about

322
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,240
right there's just so much about
 

323
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,110
right there's just so much about
evolution that is stochastic and

324
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,120
evolution that is stochastic and
 

325
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,830
evolution that is stochastic and
driven by chance but the question is

326
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:43,840
driven by chance but the question is
 

327
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,350
driven by chance but the question is
whether that menu would be equally

328
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:45,360
whether that menu would be equally
 

329
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,310
whether that menu would be equally
delicious

330
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:46,320
delicious
 

331
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,790
delicious
meaning like there'd be rich complexity

332
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:48,800
meaning like there'd be rich complexity
 

333
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,909
meaning like there'd be rich complexity
of the kind of

334
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:49,919

weirdly intelligent
 

341
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,230
weirdly intelligent
seemingly intelligent however we define

342
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:00,240
seemingly intelligent however we define
 

343
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,189
seemingly intelligent however we define
that

344
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
that
 

345
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,830
that
well i think that has to be true if you

346
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:03,840
well i think that has to be true if you
 

347
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,830
well i think that has to be true if you
just look at the range of creatures

348
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:05,840
just look at the range of creatures
 

349
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,029
just look at the range of creatures
who've gone extinct

350
00:06:07,029 --> 00:06:07,039
who've gone extinct
 

351
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,029
who've gone extinct
i mean but if you look at the range of

352
00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:09,039
i mean but if you look at the range of
 

353
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,749
i mean but if you look at the range of
creatures that are on the earth now it's

354
00:06:11,749 --> 00:06:11,759
creatures that are on the earth now it's

evolutionary arguments well it does fit

398
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
evolutionary arguments well it does fit
 

399
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,150
evolutionary arguments well it does fit
well it depends right so

400
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,160
well it depends right so

answer i actually think there probably

470
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:13,680
answer i actually think there probably
 

471
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,270
answer i actually think there probably
is natural i think there is an aspect of

472
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:15,280
is natural i think there is an aspect of
 

473
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,950
is natural i think there is an aspect of
natural selection to it which he maybe

474
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
natural selection to it which he maybe
 

475
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,469
natural selection to it which he maybe
hasn't considered

476
00:08:18,469 --> 00:08:18,479
hasn't considered
 

477
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,070
hasn't considered
but you were saying the reason we

478
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:20,080
but you were saying the reason we
 

479
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,909
but you were saying the reason we
brought up birds is the

480
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:21,919
brought up birds is the
 

481
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,070
brought up birds is the
the life we got now seems to be quite

482
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,080
the life we got now seems to be quite
 

483
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,189
the life we got now seems to be quite
yeah so you

484
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:25,199
yeah so you
 

485
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,990
yeah so you
peek into the ocean peek into the sky

486
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:28,000
peek into the ocean peek into the sky
 

487
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,589
peek into the ocean peek into the sky
there are miraculous creatures

488
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:29,599
there are miraculous creatures
 

489
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,909
there are miraculous creatures
look at creatures who've gone extinct

490
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:31,919
look at creatures who've gone extinct
 

491
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:32,790
look at creatures who've gone extinct
and

492
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:32,800
and
 

493
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,190
and
you know in science fiction uh stories

494
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:35,200
you know in science fiction uh stories
 

495
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,949

you couldn't dream up something as

496
00:08:36,949 --> 00:08:36,959
you couldn't dream up something as
 

497
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,709
you couldn't dream up something as
interesting so my guess is that

498
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:40,719
interesting so my guess is that
 

499
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,230
interesting so my guess is that
you know intelligent life evolves in

500
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:44,240
you know intelligent life evolves in
 

501
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,150
you know intelligent life evolves in
in many different ways even on this

502
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:46,160
in many different ways even on this
 

503
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,310
in many different ways even on this
planet uh there isn't one form of

504
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:48,320
planet uh there isn't one form of
 

505
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,990
planet uh there isn't one form of
intelligence there's not one brain that

506
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
intelligence there's not one brain that
 

507
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,110
intelligence there's not one brain that
gives you intelligence

508
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:51,120
gives you intelligence
 

509
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,310
gives you intelligence
there are lots of different brain

510
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:52,320
there are lots of different brain
 

511
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,269
there are lots of different brain
structures that can give you

512
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
structures that can give you
 

513
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,949
structures that can give you
intelligence

514
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:54,959
intelligence
 

515
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,550
intelligence
so my guess is that the

516
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:58,560
so my guess is that the
 

517
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,710
so my guess is that the
menagerie might not look exactly the way

518
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:00,720
menagerie might not look exactly the way
 

519
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,389
menagerie might not look exactly the way
that it looks now but it would certainly

520
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:02,399
that it looks now but it would certainly
 

521
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:02,790
that it looks now but it would certainly
be

522
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:02,800
be
 

523
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,350
be
as as interesting but if we look at

524
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:07,360
as as interesting but if we look at
 

525
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,990
as as interesting but if we look at
the human brain versus the brains or

526
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
the human brain versus the brains or
 

527
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,430
the human brain versus the brains or
whatever you call them

528
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:11,440
whatever you call them
 

529
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,430
whatever you call them
the mechanisms of intelligence in our

530
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:13,440
the mechanisms of intelligence in our
 

531
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,910
the mechanisms of intelligence in our
ancestors even early ancestors

532
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:15,920
ancestors even early ancestors
 

533
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,829
ancestors even early ancestors
that you write about for example in your

534
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:17,839
that you write about for example in your
 

535
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,750
that you write about for example in your
new book

536
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:19,760
new book
 

537
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,870
new book
what what's the difference between

538
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:22,880
what what's the difference between
 

539
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,829
what what's the difference between
the the fanciest brain we got which is

540
00:09:25,829 --> 00:09:25,839
the the fanciest brain we got which is
 

541
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,190
the the fanciest brain we got which is
the human brain

542
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:27,200
the human brain
 

543
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,389
the human brain
and uh the ancestor brains that it came

544
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:30,399
and uh the ancestor brains that it came
 

545
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,509
and uh the ancestor brains that it came
from

546
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:31,519
from
 

547
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,269
from
yeah i think it depends on how far back

548
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:33,279
yeah i think it depends on how far back
 

549
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,630
yeah i think it depends on how far back
you want to go

550
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:34,640
you want to go
 

551
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,350
you want to go
you go all the way back right in your

552
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:37,360
you go all the way back right in your
 

553
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,630
you go all the way back right in your
book

554
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:38,640
book
 

555
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,230
book
so what's the interesting comparison

556
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,240
so what's the interesting comparison
 

557
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,910
so what's the interesting comparison
would you say well first of all i

558
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:41,920
would you say well first of all i
 

559
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,670
would you say well first of all i
wouldn't say that the human brain is the

560
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:43,680
wouldn't say that the human brain is the
 

561
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,030
wouldn't say that the human brain is the
fanciest brain we've got

562
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,040
fanciest brain we've got
 

563
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,590
fanciest brain we've got
i mean an octopus brain is pretty

564
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:47,600
i mean an octopus brain is pretty
 

565
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,350
i mean an octopus brain is pretty
different and pretty fancy and they can

566
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:49,360
different and pretty fancy and they can
 

567
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,389
different and pretty fancy and they can
do some pretty

568
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:50,399
do some pretty
 

569
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,870
do some pretty
amazing things that we cannot do you

570
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:52,880
amazing things that we cannot do you
 

571
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,949
amazing things that we cannot do you
know we can't grow back limbs we can't

572
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:54,959
know we can't grow back limbs we can't
 

573
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,590
know we can't grow back limbs we can't
change color and texture we can't

574
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
change color and texture we can't
 

575
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,750
change color and texture we can't
comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves

576
00:09:59,750 --> 00:09:59,760
comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves
 

577
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,190
comport ourselves and squeeze ourselves
into a little crevice

578
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,200
into a little crevice
 

579
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,030
into a little crevice
i mean these are things that we invent

580
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,040
i mean these are things that we invent
 

581
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,790
i mean these are things that we invent
these are like superhero abilities that

582
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
these are like superhero abilities that
 

583
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,550
these are like superhero abilities that
we invent in stories right we can't do

584
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:06,560
we invent in stories right we can't do
 

585
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,069
we invent in stories right we can't do
any of those things

586
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:08,079
any of those things
 

587
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,110
any of those things
and so the human brain is certainly um

588
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:11,120
and so the human brain is certainly um
 

589
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,710
and so the human brain is certainly um
we can certainly do some things that

590
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:12,720
we can certainly do some things that
 

591
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,430
we can certainly do some things that
other animals can't do

592
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:15,440
other animals can't do
 

593
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,230
other animals can't do
that seem pretty impressive to us but

594
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:18,240
that seem pretty impressive to us but
 

595
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:18,710
that seem pretty impressive to us but
but

596
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:18,720
but
 

597
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,030
but
i would say that there there are a

598
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:21,040
i would say that there there are a
 

599
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,949
i would say that there there are a
number of animal brains which

600
00:10:22,949 --> 00:10:22,959
number of animal brains which
 

601
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,030
number of animal brains which
seem pretty impressive to me that can do

602
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,040
seem pretty impressive to me that can do
 

603
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,389
seem pretty impressive to me that can do
interesting things and

604
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:26,399
interesting things and
 

605
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,990
interesting things and
really impressive things that we can't

606
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:28,000
really impressive things that we can't
 

607
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,870
really impressive things that we can't
do i mean with your work on how emotions

608
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:30,880
do i mean with your work on how emotions
 

609
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,150
do i mean with your work on how emotions
are made and so on you

610
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:32,160
are made and so on you
 

611
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,790
are made and so on you
you kind of repaint the the view of the

612
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:34,800
you kind of repaint the the view of the
 

613
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,269
you kind of repaint the the view of the
brain

614
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:35,279
brain
 

615
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,470
brain
as um as less glamorous

616
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
as um as less glamorous
 

617
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,990
as um as less glamorous
i suppose than you would otherwise

618
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,000
i suppose than you would otherwise
 

619
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,470
i suppose than you would otherwise
think or like i guess you draw a thread

620
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:44,480
think or like i guess you draw a thread
 

621
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,389
think or like i guess you draw a thread
that connects all brains

622
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:46,399
that connects all brains
 

623
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,710
that connects all brains
uh together in terms of homeostasis and

624
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:48,720
uh together in terms of homeostasis and
 

625
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,910
uh together in terms of homeostasis and
all that kind of stuff

626
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:49,920
all that kind of stuff
 

627
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,949
all that kind of stuff
i yeah i wouldn't say that the that the

628
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
i yeah i wouldn't say that the that the
 

629
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,910
i yeah i wouldn't say that the that the
human brain is

630
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
human brain is
 

631
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,630
human brain is
any less miraculous than anybody else

632
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:56,640
any less miraculous than anybody else
 

633
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,110
any less miraculous than anybody else
would say

634
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
would say
 

635
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,670
would say
i just think that there are other brain

636
00:10:59,670 --> 00:10:59,680
i just think that there are other brain
 

637
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,150
i just think that there are other brain
structures which are also miraculous

638
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,160
structures which are also miraculous
 

639
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,750
structures which are also miraculous
and i also think that there are a number

640
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:03,760
and i also think that there are a number
 

641
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,470
and i also think that there are a number
of things about the human brain which

642
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:06,480
of things about the human brain which
 

643
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,990
of things about the human brain which
we share with other other vertebrates

644
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:10,000
we share with other other vertebrates
 

645
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,150
we share with other other vertebrates
other animals with backbones

646
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,160
other animals with backbones
 

647
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,750
other animals with backbones
but um that are that we share these

648
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:15,760
but um that are that we share these
 

649
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,269
but um that are that we share these
miraculous things but we can do

650
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:17,279
miraculous things but we can do
 

651
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,750
miraculous things but we can do
some things in abundance and we can also

652
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:19,760
some things in abundance and we can also
 

653
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,030
some things in abundance and we can also
do some things

654
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:21,040
do some things
 

655
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,150
do some things
with our brains together working

656
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:24,160
with our brains together working
 

657
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,389
with our brains together working
together that other animals

658
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:26,399
together that other animals
 

659
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,509
together that other animals
can't do or at least we haven't

660
00:11:29,509 --> 00:11:29,519
can't do or at least we haven't
 

661
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,269
can't do or at least we haven't
discovered their ability to do it

662
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:31,279
discovered their ability to do it
 

663
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,430
discovered their ability to do it
yeah this social thing how i mean that's

664
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
yeah this social thing how i mean that's
 

665
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,190
yeah this social thing how i mean that's
one of the things you write about

666
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:35,200
one of the things you write about
 

667
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,949
one of the things you write about
uh what's uh how do you make sense

668
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:38,959
uh what's uh how do you make sense
 

669
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,630
uh what's uh how do you make sense
of the fact uh like the book sapiens and

670
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:42,640
of the fact uh like the book sapiens and
 

671
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,389
of the fact uh like the book sapiens and
the fact that we're able to kind of

672
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
the fact that we're able to kind of
 

673
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,269
the fact that we're able to kind of
connect like network our brains together

674
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,279
connect like network our brains together
 

675
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,509
connect like network our brains together
like you write about i'll try i'll try

676
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
like you write about i'll try i'll try
 

677
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,910
like you write about i'll try i'll try
to stop saying that

678
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:51,920
to stop saying that
 

679
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,910
to stop saying that
uh is that is that like some kind of

680
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:55,920
uh is that is that like some kind of
 

681
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:56,629
uh is that is that like some kind of
feature

682
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
feature
 

683
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,269
feature
that's built into there is that unique

684
00:11:59,269 --> 00:11:59,279
that's built into there is that unique
 

685
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,790
that's built into there is that unique
to our human brains like how do you make

686
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:00,800
to our human brains like how do you make
 

687
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,069
to our human brains like how do you make
sense of that

688
00:12:02,069 --> 00:12:02,079
sense of that
 

689
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,870
sense of that
what i would say is that our ability to

690
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
what i would say is that our ability to
 

691
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,310
what i would say is that our ability to
coordinate with each other is not unique

692
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:08,320
coordinate with each other is not unique
 

693
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,509
coordinate with each other is not unique
um to humans there are lots of animals

694
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
um to humans there are lots of animals
 

695
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,790
um to humans there are lots of animals
who can do that and we um

696
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:14,800
who can do that and we um
 

697
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,949
who can do that and we um
but what we do with that coordination

698
00:12:18,949 --> 00:12:18,959
but what we do with that coordination
 

699
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,990
but what we do with that coordination
is unique because of some of the

700
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:22,000
is unique because of some of the
 

701
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,430
is unique because of some of the
structural features

702
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:23,440
structural features
 

703
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,350
structural features
in our brains and

704
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
in our brains and
 

705
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,430
in our brains and
it's not that other animals don't have

706
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:29,440
it's not that other animals don't have
 

707
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,629
it's not that other animals don't have
those structural features

708
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:30,639
those structural features
 

709
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,389
those structural features
it's we have them in abundance so

710
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:34,399
it's we have them in abundance so
 

711
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,069
it's we have them in abundance so
you know the human brain is not larger

712
00:12:38,069 --> 00:12:38,079
you know the human brain is not larger
 

713
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,949
you know the human brain is not larger
than you would expect it to be for a

714
00:12:40,949 --> 00:12:40,959
than you would expect it to be for a
 

715
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,629
than you would expect it to be for a
primate of our size

716
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:42,639
primate of our size
 

717
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,750
primate of our size
if you took a chimpanzee and you

718
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:45,760
if you took a chimpanzee and you
 

719
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,190
if you took a chimpanzee and you
ex grew it to the size of a human

720
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:49,200
ex grew it to the size of a human
 

721
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,750
ex grew it to the size of a human
that chimpanzee would have a brain that

722
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:51,760
that chimpanzee would have a brain that
 

723
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,670
that chimpanzee would have a brain that
was the size of a human brain

724
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:53,680
was the size of a human brain
 

725
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,590
was the size of a human brain
so there's nothing special about our

726
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:55,600
so there's nothing special about our
 

727
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,430
so there's nothing special about our
brain in terms of its size

728
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:57,440
brain in terms of its size
 

729
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,750
brain in terms of its size
there's nothing special about our brain

730
00:12:59,750 --> 00:12:59,760
there's nothing special about our brain
 

731
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,030
there's nothing special about our brain
in terms of

732
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:01,040
in terms of
 

733
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,629
in terms of
the um the basic blueprint that

734
00:13:04,629 --> 00:13:04,639
the um the basic blueprint that
 

735
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,389
the um the basic blueprint that
builds our brain from an embryo is the

736
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:08,399
builds our brain from an embryo is the
 

737
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,230
builds our brain from an embryo is the
basic blueprint that builds all

738
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:10,240
basic blueprint that builds all
 

739
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,150
basic blueprint that builds all
mammalian brains and maybe even all

740
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,160
mammalian brains and maybe even all
 

741
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,069
mammalian brains and maybe even all
vertebrate brains

742
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:14,079
vertebrate brains
 

743
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,910
vertebrate brains
um it's just that because of its size

744
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:17,920
um it's just that because of its size
 

745
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,750
um it's just that because of its size
and particularly because of the size of

746
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:19,760
and particularly because of the size of
 

747
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,310
and particularly because of the size of
the cerebral cortex which is the

748
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,320
the cerebral cortex which is the
 

749
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,629
the cerebral cortex which is the
um a part um that people mistakenly

750
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
um a part um that people mistakenly
 

751
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,829
um a part um that people mistakenly
attribute to rationality yeah mistakenly

752
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
attribute to rationality yeah mistakenly
 

753
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,470
attribute to rationality yeah mistakenly
is that

754
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:30,480
is that
 

755
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,550
is that
where all the clever stuff happens well

756
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:32,560
where all the clever stuff happens well
 

757
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,150
where all the clever stuff happens well
no it really isn't

758
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:34,160
no it really isn't
 

759
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,150
no it really isn't
and i will also say that lots of clever

760
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,160
and i will also say that lots of clever
 

761
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,910
and i will also say that lots of clever
stuff happens in animals who

762
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:37,920
stuff happens in animals who
 

763
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,990
stuff happens in animals who
don't have a cerebral cortex but right

764
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:40,000
don't have a cerebral cortex but right
 

765
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,949
don't have a cerebral cortex but right
um but

766
00:13:40,949 --> 00:13:40,959
um but
 

767
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,430
um but
uh but because of the size of the

768
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,440
uh but because of the size of the
 

769
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,629
uh but because of the size of the
cerebral cortex

770
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:44,639
cerebral cortex
 

771
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,110
cerebral cortex
and because of some of the features that

772
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
and because of some of the features that
 

773
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,949
and because of some of the features that
are enhanced

774
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
are enhanced
 

775
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,910
are enhanced
by that size that gives us the capacity

776
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:51,920
by that size that gives us the capacity
 

777
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,629
by that size that gives us the capacity
to

778
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:52,639
to
 

779
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,310
to
do things like build civilizations um

780
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,320
do things like build civilizations um
 

781
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,870
do things like build civilizations um
and coordinate with each other not just

782
00:13:58,870 --> 00:13:58,880
and coordinate with each other not just
 

783
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,470
and coordinate with each other not just
to

784
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:00,480
to
 

785
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,430
to
manipulate the physical world but to add

786
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
manipulate the physical world but to add
 

787
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,710
manipulate the physical world but to add
to it

788
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:04,720
to it
 

789
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,509
to it
in very profound ways like you know

790
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:07,519
in very profound ways like you know
 

791
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,350
in very profound ways like you know
other animals can cooperate with each

792
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:09,360
other animals can cooperate with each
 

793
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,269
other animals can cooperate with each
other and use tools

794
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:11,279
other and use tools
 

795
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,910
other and use tools
um we draw a line in the sand and we

796
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:13,920
um we draw a line in the sand and we
 

797
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,150
um we draw a line in the sand and we
make countries and we even then we

798
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:16,160
make countries and we even then we
 

799
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,829
make countries and we even then we
create you know uh we create citizens

800
00:14:19,829 --> 00:14:19,839
create you know uh we create citizens
 

801
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,790
create you know uh we create citizens
and immigrants

802
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:20,800
and immigrants
 

803
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,509
and immigrants
but also ideas i mean the countries are

804
00:14:23,509 --> 00:14:23,519
but also ideas i mean the countries are
 

805
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,269
but also ideas i mean the countries are
centered around the concept of

806
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:25,279
centered around the concept of
 

807
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,269
centered around the concept of
like ideas well my well what do you

808
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:27,279
like ideas well my well what do you
 

809
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,550
like ideas well my well what do you
think a citizen is and

810
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:28,560
think a citizen is and
 

811
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,790
think a citizen is and
and an immigrant those are ideas those

812
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:30,800
and an immigrant those are ideas those
 

813
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,750
and an immigrant those are ideas those
are ideas

814
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:31,760
are ideas
 

815
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,629
are ideas
that we um impose on reality and make

816
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:34,639
that we um impose on reality and make
 

817
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,350
that we um impose on reality and make
them real

818
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:35,360
them real
 

819
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,829
them real
and then they have very very serious and

820
00:14:37,829 --> 00:14:37,839
and then they have very very serious and
 

821
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,269
and then they have very very serious and
real effects

822
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:39,279
real effects
 

823
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,189
real effects
physical effects on people what do you

824
00:14:41,189 --> 00:14:41,199
physical effects on people what do you
 

825
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,710
physical effects on people what do you
think about the idea

826
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:42,720
think about the idea
 

827
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,910
think about the idea
that a bunch of people have written

828
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:43,920
that a bunch of people have written
 

829
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,990
that a bunch of people have written
about dawkins with memes

830
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:46,000
about dawkins with memes
 

831

you know evolutionary purposes which is
kind of interesting you can

872
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:34,320
kind of interesting you can
 

873
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,710
kind of interesting you can
think about a human gut in a sense as a

know tomatoes and what
 

879
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,910
know tomatoes and what
what have you so it's kind of cool um so

880
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:45,920
what have you so it's kind of cool um so
 

881
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,470
what have you so it's kind of cool um so
i think

882
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:46,480
i think
 

883
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,230
i think
i think rhetorically it's an interesting

884
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,240
i think rhetorically it's an interesting
 

885
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,590
i think rhetorically it's an interesting
device but you know

886
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,600
device but you know
 

887
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,590
device but you know
ideas are as far as i know

888
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:53,600
ideas are as far as i know
 

889
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,189
ideas are as far as i know
invented by humans propagated by humans

890
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
invented by humans propagated by humans
 

891
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,310
invented by humans propagated by humans
um so you know i i don't think they're

892
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:00,320
um so you know i i don't think they're
 

893
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,069
um so you know i i don't think they're
separate from human brains in

894
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:02,079
separate from human brains in
 

895
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,069
separate from human brains in
in any way although it would it is

896
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:04,079
in any way although it would it is
 

897
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,189
in any way although it would it is
interesting to

898
00:16:05,189 --> 00:16:05,199
interesting to
 

899
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,110
interesting to
to think about it that way well of

900
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,120
to think about it that way well of
 

901
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,030
to think about it that way well of
course the ideas that are using your

902
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:09,040
course the ideas that are using your
 

903
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,590
course the ideas that are using your
brain

904
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
brain
 

905
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,629
brain
to communicate and write excellent books

906
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
to communicate and write excellent books
 

907
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,670
to communicate and write excellent books
uh and they basically picked you

908
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
uh and they basically picked you
 

909
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,949
uh and they basically picked you
uh lisa as an effective communicator

910
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:18,959
uh lisa as an effective communicator
 

911
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,910
uh lisa as an effective communicator
and and thereby are winning so that's an

912
00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:21,920
and and thereby are winning so that's an
 

913
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,069
and and thereby are winning so that's an
interesting world view

914
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:24,079
interesting world view
 

915
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,069
interesting world view
to think that there's particular aspects

916
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
to think that there's particular aspects
 

917
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,150
to think that there's particular aspects
of your brain

918
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:28,160
of your brain
 

919
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,470
of your brain
that are conducive to certain sets of

920
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:30,480
that are conducive to certain sets of
 

921
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,189
that are conducive to certain sets of
ideas

922
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:31,199
ideas
 

923
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,670
ideas
and maybe those ideas will win out yeah

924
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:33,680
and maybe those ideas will win out yeah
 

925
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,870
and maybe those ideas will win out yeah
i think the way that i would say it

926
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:34,880
i think the way that i would say it
 

927
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,470
i think the way that i would say it
really though is that

928
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:36,480
really though is that
 

929
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,150
really though is that
there are many species of animals that

930
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
there are many species of animals that
 

931
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,150
there are many species of animals that
influence each other's nervous systems

932
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
influence each other's nervous systems
 

933
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,509
influence each other's nervous systems
that regulate each other's nervous

934
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:41,519
that regulate each other's nervous
 

935
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,389
that regulate each other's nervous
systems

936
00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:42,399
systems
 

937
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,470
systems
and they mainly do it by physical means

938
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:44,480
and they mainly do it by physical means
 

939
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,670
and they mainly do it by physical means
they do it by

940
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:45,680
they do it by
 

941
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,550
they do it by
chemicals scent they do it by you know

942
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:48,560
chemicals scent they do it by you know
 

943
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,030
chemicals scent they do it by you know
so

944
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
so
 

945
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,990
so
so termites and ants and bees for

946
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:52,000
so termites and ants and bees for
 

947
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,949
so termites and ants and bees for
example

948
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:52,959
example
 

949
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,629
example
use chemical scents mammals like

950
00:16:56,629 --> 00:16:56,639
use chemical scents mammals like
 

951
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,230
use chemical scents mammals like
um like rodents use scent and they also

952
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:00,240
um like rodents use scent and they also
 

953
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,030
um like rodents use scent and they also
use uh hearing audition and that little

954
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
use uh hearing audition and that little
 

955
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,309
use uh hearing audition and that little
bit of vision

956
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:04,319
bit of vision
 

957
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,949
bit of vision
um primates you know non-human primates

958
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:06,959
um primates you know non-human primates
 

959

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,669
say that obviously but
how do i control your heart rate how do

998
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
how do i control your heart rate how do
 

999
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,950
how do i control your heart rate how do
i control your breathing how do i

1000
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
i control your breathing how do i
 

1001
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,110
i control your breathing how do i
control your actions

1002
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:49,120
control your actions
 

1003
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,270
control your actions
with words it's because those words are

1004
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:51,280
with words it's because those words are
 

1005
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,070
with words it's because those words are
communicating ideas

1006
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:54,080
communicating ideas
 

1007
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,870
communicating ideas
so you also write i think let's go back

1008
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:56,880
so you also write i think let's go back
 

1009
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,669
so you also write i think let's go back
to the brain

1010
00:17:57,669 --> 00:17:57,679
to the brain
 

1011
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,909
to the brain
you write that plato gave us the idea

1012
00:17:59,909 --> 00:17:59,919
you write that plato gave us the idea
 

1013
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,150
you write that plato gave us the idea
that the human brain has

1014
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:02,160
that the human brain has
 

1015
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,350
that the human brain has
three brains in it three forces

1016
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,360
three brains in it three forces
 

1017
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,230
three brains in it three forces
which is kind of a compelling notion uh

1018
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
which is kind of a compelling notion uh
 

1019
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,350
which is kind of a compelling notion uh
you disagree

1020
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,360
you disagree
 

1021
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,510
you disagree
first of all what are the three parts of

1022
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:11,520
first of all what are the three parts of
 

1023
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,630
first of all what are the three parts of
the brain

1024
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:12,640
the brain
 

1025
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,990
the brain
and uh why do you disagree

1026
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:16,000
and uh why do you disagree
 

1027
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,549
and uh why do you disagree
so plato's description of the psyche

1028
00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:20,559
so plato's description of the psyche
 

1029
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,789
so plato's description of the psyche
which for the moment we'll just assume

1030
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
which for the moment we'll just assume
 

1031
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,549
which for the moment we'll just assume
is the same as a mind

1032
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:24,559
is the same as a mind
 

1033
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,070
is the same as a mind
there are some scholars who would say

1034
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:26,080
there are some scholars who would say
 

1035
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,990
there are some scholars who would say
you know a soul a psyche a mind

1036
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
you know a soul a psyche a mind
 

1037
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,669
you know a soul a psyche a mind
those aren't actually all the same thing

1038
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
those aren't actually all the same thing
 

1039
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,669
those aren't actually all the same thing
in ancient greece but we'll just

1040
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:31,679
in ancient greece but we'll just
 

1041
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,950
in ancient greece but we'll just
for now gloss over that so plato's idea

1042
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:34,960
for now gloss over that so plato's idea
 

1043
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,230
for now gloss over that so plato's idea
was that

1044
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:36,240
was that
 

1045
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,270
was that
and it was a it was a description of

1046
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:39,280
and it was a it was a description of
 

1047
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,990
and it was a it was a description of
really about moral behavior and moral

1048
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:42,000
really about moral behavior and moral
 

1049
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,909
really about moral behavior and moral
responsibility in humans

1050
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:43,919
responsibility in humans
 

1051
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,070
responsibility in humans
so the idea was that you know the human

1052
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,080
so the idea was that you know the human
 

1053
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,669
so the idea was that you know the human
psyche can be described with an

1054
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:47,679
psyche can be described with an
 

1055
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,430
psyche can be described with an
um a metaphor of

1056
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:51,440
um a metaphor of
 

1057
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,190
um a metaphor of
two horses and a charioteer so one horse

1058
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:55,200
two horses and a charioteer so one horse
 

1059
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,710
two horses and a charioteer so one horse
for instincts like

1060
00:18:58,710 --> 00:18:58,720
for instincts like
 

1061
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,350
for instincts like
feeding and fighting and fleeing and

1062
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,360
feeding and fighting and fleeing and
 

1063

00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:10,960
which apparently they print in england
 

1069
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,710
which apparently they print in england
like i actually tossed off of

1073
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,750
f s yeah f f okay yeah yeah i was like
you printed that i couldn't believe you

1074
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:19,760
you printed that i couldn't believe you
 

1075
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,310
you printed that i couldn't believe you
printed that

1076
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:20,320
printed that
 

1077
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,310
printed that
without like the stars or whatever no no

1078
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,320
without like the stars or whatever no no
 

1079
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,590
without like the stars or whatever no no
no there was full print

1080
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:23,600
no there was full print
 

1081
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,470
no there was full print
yeah they also printed the a b word and

1082
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:26,480
yeah they also printed the a b word and
 

1083
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,430
yeah they also printed the a b word and
it was really

1084
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:27,440
it was really
 

1085
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,390
it was really
quite yeah anyways we should we should

1086
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,400
quite yeah anyways we should we should
 

1087
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,230
quite yeah anyways we should we should
uh learn something from england

1088
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:32,240
uh learn something from england
 

1089
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,549
uh learn something from england
indeed anyways but instincts and then

00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:34,559
indeed anyways but instincts and then

couple of centuries and uh

in the middle of the 20th century there
 

1107
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,190
in the middle of the 20th century there
was a very

1108
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:55,200
was a very
 

1109
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,390
was a very
popular view of brain evolution which

1110
00:19:58,390 --> 00:19:58,400
popular view of brain evolution which
 

1111
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,669
popular view of brain evolution which
suggested that you have this uh

1112
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:01,679
suggested that you have this uh
 

1113
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,549
suggested that you have this uh
reptilian core like a lizard bra an

1114
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:04,559
reptilian core like a lizard bra an
 

1115
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:05,990

brain for instincts and then wrapped

1118
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:08,960
brain for instincts and then wrapped
 

1119
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,750

evolved on layer on top of that evolved
 

1123
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,310

a limbic system

1124
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:14,320
a limbic system
 

1125
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,350
a limbic system
for uh in mammals so the novelty was in

1126
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,360
for uh in mammals so the novelty was in
 

1127
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,630

a mammalian brain
 

1129
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,390
a mammalian brain
which uh bestowed mammals with uh gave

which uh bestowed mammals with uh gave
 

1131
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,549
which uh bestowed mammals with uh gave
them emotions the capacitive emotions

and then um on top of that
 

1135
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,750
and then um on top of that
uh evolved uh a cerebral cortex

1136
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:31,760
uh evolved uh a cerebral cortex
 

1137
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,870
uh evolved uh a cerebral cortex
um which in

um which in
 

1139
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,149

it's not that i personally disagree

it's not that i personally disagree
 

1147

it's not that i personally disagree
it's that as far back as the 1960s but

00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:04,000
molecular makeup of genes that the brain
 

1161
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,830
molecular makeup of genes that the brain
did not evolve that way

1162
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:05,840
did not evolve that way
 

1163
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,190
did not evolve that way
and the irony is that

1164
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:09,200
and the irony is that
 

1165
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,909
and the irony is that
um you know the the idea of the

1166
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:13,919
um you know the the idea of the
 

1167
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,390
um you know the the idea of the
the three-layered brain with an inner

1168
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:16,400
the three-layered brain with an inner
 

1169
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,669
the three-layered brain with an inner
lizard you know that

1170
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:17,679
lizard you know that
 

1171
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,630
lizard you know that
hijacks your uh hijacks your behavior

1172
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:20,640
hijacks your uh hijacks your behavior
 

1173
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,549
hijacks your uh hijacks your behavior
and causes you to do and say things

1174
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:22,559
and causes you to do and say things
 

1175
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,270
and causes you to do and say things
that uh you would otherwise not or maybe

1176
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:25,280
that uh you would otherwise not or maybe
 

1177
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,029
that uh you would otherwise not or maybe
that you will regret later

1178
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:27,039
that you will regret later
 

1179
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,070
that you will regret later
that idea um became

1180
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,080
that idea um became
 

1181
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,669
that idea um became
very popular was popularized by

1182
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:33,679
very popular was popularized by
 

1183
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,789
very popular was popularized by
uh carl sagan in the dragons of eden

1184
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:36,799
uh carl sagan in the dragons of eden
 

1185
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,390
uh carl sagan in the dragons of eden
which won a pulitzer prize

1186
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:38,400
which won a pulitzer prize
 

1187
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,230
which won a pulitzer prize
in 1977 when it was already known pretty

1188
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:42,240
in 1977 when it was already known pretty
 

1189
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:42,630
in 1977 when it was already known pretty
much

1190
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:42,640
much
 

1191
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,630
much
in evolutionary neuroscience that the

1192
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:44,640
in evolutionary neuroscience that the
 

1193
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,669
in evolutionary neuroscience that the
whole uh narrative was a myth

1194
00:21:47,669 --> 00:21:47,679
whole uh narrative was a myth
 

1195
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,750
whole uh narrative was a myth
so well the narrative is on the the way

1196
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
so well the narrative is on the the way
 

1197
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,310
so well the narrative is on the the way
it evolved but do you

1198
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,320
it evolved but do you
 

1199
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,190
it evolved but do you
i mean again it's that problem of it

1200
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
i mean again it's that problem of it
 

1201
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,430
i mean again it's that problem of it
being a useful

1202
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:57,440
being a useful
 

1203
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,950
being a useful
tool of conversation to say like there's

1204
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:00,960
tool of conversation to say like there's
 

1205
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,230
tool of conversation to say like there's
a lizard brain

1206
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:02,240
a lizard brain
 

1207
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,549
a lizard brain
and there's a like if i get overly

1208
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
and there's a like if i get overly
 

1209
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,750
and there's a like if i get overly
emotional on twitter

1210
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:05,760
emotional on twitter
 

1211
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,270
emotional on twitter
that was the lizard brain and so on uh

1212
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:09,280
that was the lizard brain and so on uh
 

1213
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,669
that was the lizard brain and so on uh
but do you no i don't think it's useful

1214
00:22:11,669 --> 00:22:11,679
but do you no i don't think it's useful
 

1215
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,470
but do you no i don't think it's useful
i think it's a

1216
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:12,480
i think it's a
 

1217
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,350
i think it's a
i think that is it is is it uh is it

1218
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:15,360
i think that is it is is it uh is it
 

1219
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,870
i think that is it is is it uh is it
useful is it accurate

1220
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:16,880
useful is it accurate
 

1221
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,390
useful is it accurate
i don't think it's accurate and

1222
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:18,400
i don't think it's accurate and
 

1223
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,870
i don't think it's accurate and
therefore i don't think it's useful

1224
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:20,880
therefore i don't think it's useful
 

1225
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,190
therefore i don't think it's useful
so i here's what i would say you know i

1226
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:23,200
so i here's what i would say you know i
 

1227
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,909
so i here's what i would say you know i
think that

1228
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:23,919
think that
 

1229
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,950
think that
um the way i think about

1230
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:26,960
um the way i think about
 

1231
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,149
um the way i think about
philosophy and science

1232
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:30,159
philosophy and science
 

1233
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,310
philosophy and science
is that they are useful tools for living

1234
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:34,320
is that they are useful tools for living
 

1235
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,789
is that they are useful tools for living
and in order to be useful tools for

1236
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:36,799
and in order to be useful tools for
 

1237
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,110
and in order to be useful tools for
living

1238
00:22:39,110 --> 00:22:39,120
living
 

1239
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,870
living
they have to

1240
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:42,880

 

1241
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,630

help you make good decisions

1242
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:46,640

 

1243
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,630

the try and brain as it's called this

1244
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:48,640
the try and brain as it's called this
 

1245
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,230
the try and brain as it's called this
this three-layer brain the idea that

1246
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:50,240
this three-layer brain the idea that
 

1247
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,630
this three-layer brain the idea that
your brain is like an already baked cake

1248
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:52,640
your brain is like an already baked cake
 

1249
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,029
your brain is like an already baked cake
in and you know the cortex cerebral

1250
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:55,039
in and you know the cortex cerebral
 

1251
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,750
in and you know the cortex cerebral
cortex is just layered on top like icing

1252
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:57,760
cortex is just layered on top like icing
 

1253
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,029
cortex is just layered on top like icing
the idea that idea is the foundation

1254
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:01,039
the idea that idea is the foundation
 

1255
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,149
the idea that idea is the foundation
of the law in

1256
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:04,159
of the law in
 

1257
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,390
of the law in
most western countries it's the

1258
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:06,400
most western countries it's the
 

1259
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,230
most western countries it's the
foundation of uh

1260
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:08,240
foundation of uh
 

1261
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,510
foundation of uh
economic theory and it

1262
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:11,520
economic theory and it
 

1263
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,430
economic theory and it
largely and it's a great narrative it

1264
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
largely and it's a great narrative it
 

1265
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,710
largely and it's a great narrative it
sort of fits our

1266
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:14,720
sort of fits our
 

1267
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,350
sort of fits our
intuitions about how we work but it also

1268
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:19,360
intuitions about how we work but it also
 

1269
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,789
intuitions about how we work but it also
um it's in addition to being wrong

1270
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:22,799
um it's in addition to being wrong
 

1271
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,990
um it's in addition to being wrong
it lets people off the hook for uh

1272
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:26,000
it lets people off the hook for uh
 

1273
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,110
it lets people off the hook for uh
for nasty behavior you know um

1274
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:29,120
for nasty behavior you know um
 

1275
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,230
for nasty behavior you know um
and it also suggests that emotions can't

1276
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:32,240
and it also suggests that emotions can't
 

1277
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,590
and it also suggests that emotions can't
be a source of wisdom

1278
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
be a source of wisdom
 

1279
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,789
be a source of wisdom
which they often are in fact you

1280
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:36,799
which they often are in fact you
 

1281
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,950
which they often are in fact you
you would not want to be around someone

1282
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:38,960
you would not want to be around someone
 

1283
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,430
you would not want to be around someone
who didn't have emotions that would be

1284
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:41,440
who didn't have emotions that would be
 

1285
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,990
who didn't have emotions that would be
that's a psychopath right i mean that's

1286
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,000
that's a psychopath right i mean that's
 

1287
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,430
that's a psychopath right i mean that's
not someone you

1288
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:45,440
not someone you
 

1289
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,190
not someone you
you know want to want to really uh have

1290
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,200
you know want to want to really uh have
 

1291
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,710
you know want to want to really uh have
have that person deciding your outcome

1292
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:50,720
have that person deciding your outcome
 

1293
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,310
have that person deciding your outcome
so i guess my

1294
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:52,320
so i guess my
 

1295
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,990
so i guess my
and i could sort of go on and on and on

1296
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
and i could sort of go on and on and on
 

1297
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,590
and i could sort of go on and on and on
but my point is that

1298
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:55,600
but my point is that
 

1299
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,190
but my point is that
um i don't think

1300
00:23:59,190 --> 00:23:59,200
um i don't think
 

1301
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,669
um i don't think
i don't think it's a useful narrative in

1302
00:24:01,669 --> 00:24:01,679
i don't think it's a useful narrative in
 

1303
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,350
i don't think it's a useful narrative in
the end

1304
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:03,360
the end
 

1305
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,590
the end
what's the more accurate view of the

1306
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:05,600
what's the more accurate view of the
 

1307
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,590
what's the more accurate view of the
brain that we should use when we're

1308
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:07,600
brain that we should use when we're
 

1309
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,630
brain that we should use when we're
thinking about it

1310
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:08,640
thinking about it
 

1311
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,909
thinking about it
i'll answer that in a second but i'll

1312
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:09,919
i'll answer that in a second but i'll
 

1313
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,669
i'll answer that in a second but i'll
say that even our notion of what an

1314
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
say that even our notion of what an
 

1315
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,110
say that even our notion of what an
instinct is or what a reflex is is not

1316
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
instinct is or what a reflex is is not
 

1317
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,590
instinct is or what a reflex is is not
quite right right so if you look at

1318
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:17,600
quite right right so if you look at
 

1319
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,149
quite right right so if you look at
evidence

1320
00:24:18,149 --> 00:24:18,159
evidence
 

1321
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,549
evidence
from um ecology for example and you look

1322
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:22,559
from um ecology for example and you look
 

1323
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,510
from um ecology for example and you look
at animals in their ecological context

1324
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:25,520
at animals in their ecological context
 

1325
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,350
at animals in their ecological context
what you can see is that even things

1326
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:27,360
what you can see is that even things
 

1327
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,549
what you can see is that even things
which are

1328
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:28,559
which are
 

1329
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,870
which are
reflexes are very context-sensitive

1330
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:32,880
reflexes are very context-sensitive
 

1331
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,669
reflexes are very context-sensitive
um the the brains of those animals are

1332
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:35,679
um the the brains of those animals are
 

1333
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,950
um the the brains of those animals are
executing

1334
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:36,960
executing
 

1335
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,830
executing
so-called instinctual actions in a very

1336
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:39,840
so-called instinctual actions in a very
 

1337
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,070
so-called instinctual actions in a very
very context-sensitive way

1338
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,080
very context-sensitive way
 

1339
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,110
very context-sensitive way
and so you know even when

1340
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,120
and so you know even when
 

1341
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,789
and so you know even when
a physician you know takes the you know

1342
00:24:46,789 --> 00:24:46,799
a physician you know takes the you know
 

1343
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,390
a physician you know takes the you know
it's like the idea of your patellar

1344
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:48,400
it's like the idea of your patellar
 

1345
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,549
it's like the idea of your patellar
uh reflex where they hit you know your

1346
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:50,559
uh reflex where they hit you know your
 

1347
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,149
uh reflex where they hit you know your
patellar tendon on your knee

1348
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:52,159
patellar tendon on your knee
 

1349
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,029
patellar tendon on your knee
and you you kick the the force with

1350
00:24:55,029 --> 00:24:55,039
and you you kick the the force with
 

1351
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,230
and you you kick the the force with
which you kick

1352
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
which you kick
 

1353
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,870
which you kick
and so on in is influenced by all kinds

1354
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:58,880
and so on in is influenced by all kinds
 

1355
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,230
and so on in is influenced by all kinds
of things it's it's

1356
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:00,240
of things it's it's
 

1357
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,430
of things it's it's
a reflex isn't like a robotic

1358
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:03,440
a reflex isn't like a robotic
 

1359
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,549
a reflex isn't like a robotic
uh response and um

1360
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:06,559
uh response and um
 

1361
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,149
uh response and um
so i think a better way is a way that

1362
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
so i think a better way is a way that
 

1363
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,630
so i think a better way is a way that
to think about how brains work is the

1364
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
to think about how brains work is the
 

1365
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,789
to think about how brains work is the
way that um

1366
00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:14,799
way that um
 

1367
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,789
way that um
matches our best understanding our best

1368
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:16,799
matches our best understanding our best
 

1369
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,549
matches our best understanding our best
scientific understanding which i think

1370
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:18,559
scientific understanding which i think
 

1371
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:19,430
scientific understanding which i think
is

1372
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:19,440
is
 

1373
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,950
is
really cool uh because it's really

1374
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
really cool uh because it's really
 

1375
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,669
really cool uh because it's really
counterintuitive so how i came to this

1376
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
counterintuitive so how i came to this
 

1377
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,149
counterintuitive so how i came to this
view

1378
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
view
 

1379
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,669
view
and i'm certainly not the only one who

1380
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:27,679
and i'm certainly not the only one who
 

1381
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,510
and i'm certainly not the only one who
holds this view i was reading

1382
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:29,520
holds this view i was reading
 

1383
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,710
holds this view i was reading
work in on neuroanatomy and the

1384
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:32,720
work in on neuroanatomy and the
 

1385
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,710
work in on neuroanatomy and the
the view that i'm about to tell you was

1386
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:34,720
the view that i'm about to tell you was
 

1387
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,110
the view that i'm about to tell you was
sugges strongly suggested by that and

1388
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:37,120
sugges strongly suggested by that and
 

1389
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,630
sugges strongly suggested by that and
then i was reading work and signal

1390
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:38,640
then i was reading work and signal
 

1391
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,549
then i was reading work and signal
processing like by engineer electrical

1392
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:40,559
processing like by engineer electrical
 

1393
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:41,590
processing like by engineer electrical
engineering

1394
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:41,600
engineering
 

1395
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,029
engineering
and similarly it the work suggested

1396
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
and similarly it the work suggested
 

1397
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:47,110
and similarly it the work suggested
that that the research suggested that

1398
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
that that the research suggested that
 

1399
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,710
that that the research suggested that
the brain worked this way and

1400
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
the brain worked this way and
 

1401
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,549
the brain worked this way and
i'll just say that i was reading across

1402
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:50,559
i'll just say that i was reading across
 

1403
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,230
i'll just say that i was reading across
multiple literatures and they were

1404
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:52,240
multiple literatures and they were
 

1405
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,149
multiple literatures and they were
who don't speak to each other and they

1406
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:54,159
who don't speak to each other and they
 

1407
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,110
who don't speak to each other and they
were all pointing in this direction

1408
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
were all pointing in this direction
 

1409
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,789
were all pointing in this direction
and so far although some of the details

1410
00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:00,799
and so far although some of the details
 

1411
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,350
and so far although some of the details
are still

1412
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:01,360
are still
 

1413
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:05,110
are still
up for grabs the general gist i think is

1414
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
up for grabs the general gist i think is
 

1415
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,470
up for grabs the general gist i think is
i've not come across anything yet which

1416
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:08,480
i've not come across anything yet which
 

1417
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,990
i've not come across anything yet which
really violates and i'm looking um

1418
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:12,000
really violates and i'm looking um
 

1419
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,590
really violates and i'm looking um
and so the idea is something like this

1420
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
and so the idea is something like this
 

1421
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,350
and so the idea is something like this
it's very counterintuitive

1422
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:15,360
it's very counterintuitive
 

1423
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,870
it's very counterintuitive
um so the way to describe it is to say

1424
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:18,880
um so the way to describe it is to say
 

1425
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,909
um so the way to describe it is to say
that your brain doesn't react to things

1426
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:21,919
that your brain doesn't react to things
 

1427
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:22,789
that your brain doesn't react to things
in the world

1428
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:22,799
in the world
 

1429
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,350
in the world
it's not it to us it feels like our eyes

1430
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
it's not it to us it feels like our eyes
 

1431
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,470
it's not it to us it feels like our eyes
and our um

1432
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:26,480
and our um
 

1433
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,470
and our um
our windows on the world we see things

1434
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:28,480
our windows on the world we see things
 

1435
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,669
our windows on the world we see things
we hear things

1436
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:29,679
we hear things
 

1437
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,590
we hear things
we we react to them um in psychology we

1438
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:33,600
we we react to them um in psychology we
 

1439
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,350
we we react to them um in psychology we
call this stimulus response

1440
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:35,360
call this stimulus response
 

1441
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,029
call this stimulus response
so your face is your voice is a stimulus

1442
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:39,039
so your face is your voice is a stimulus
 

1443
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:39,830
so your face is your voice is a stimulus
to me

1444
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:39,840
to me
 

1445
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,310
to me
i receive input and then i react to it

1446
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:44,320
i receive input and then i react to it
 

1447
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,350
i receive input and then i react to it
uh and i might react very automatically

1448
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:47,360
uh and i might react very automatically
 

1449
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,789
uh and i might react very automatically
you know system one uh and uh oh

1450
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:50,799
you know system one uh and uh oh
 

1451
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,310
you know system one uh and uh oh
but i also might execute some control

1452
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,320
but i also might execute some control
 

1453
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,110
but i also might execute some control
where i

1454
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:55,120
where i
 

1455
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,750
where i
maybe stop myself from saying something

1456
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:57,760
maybe stop myself from saying something
 

1457
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,190
maybe stop myself from saying something
or doing something

1458
00:26:59,190 --> 00:26:59,200
or doing something
 

1459
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,950
or doing something
and um more in a more reflective way

1460
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:02,960
and um more in a more reflective way
 

1461
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,870
and um more in a more reflective way
execute a different action right that's

1462
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:04,880
execute a different action right that's
 

1463
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,710
execute a different action right that's
system two

1464
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:06,720
system two
 

1465
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,269
system two
the way the brain works though is it's

1466
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:09,279
the way the brain works though is it's
 

1467
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,630
the way the brain works though is it's
predicting all the time

1468
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:10,640
predicting all the time
 

1469
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,190
predicting all the time
it's constantly talking to itself

1470
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:13,200
it's constantly talking to itself
 

1471
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,149
it's constantly talking to itself
constantly

1472
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:14,159
constantly
 

1473
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,430
constantly
uh talking to your body uh and it's

1474
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:17,440
uh talking to your body uh and it's
 

1475
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,549
uh talking to your body uh and it's
constantly

1476
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:18,559
constantly
 

1477
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,789
constantly
um predicting what's going on in the

1478
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:20,799
um predicting what's going on in the
 

1479
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,070
um predicting what's going on in the
body and what's going on

1480
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,080
body and what's going on
 

1481
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,710
body and what's going on
in the world and making predictions and

1482
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:26,720
in the world and making predictions and
 

1483
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,549
in the world and making predictions and
the information from your body and from

1484
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:28,559
the information from your body and from
 

1485
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,470
the information from your body and from
the world really

1486
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:30,480
the world really
 

1487
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,950
the world really
confirm or correct those predictions so

1488
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:32,960
confirm or correct those predictions so
 

1489
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,389
confirm or correct those predictions so
fundamentally the thing

1490
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
fundamentally the thing
 

1491
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,590
fundamentally the thing
that the brain does most of the time is

1492
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:37,600
that the brain does most of the time is
 

1493
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,230
that the brain does most of the time is
just

1494
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
just
 

1495
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,990
just
predict like talking to yourself and

1496
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,000
predict like talking to yourself and
 

1497
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,830
predict like talking to yourself and
predicting stuff about the world not

1498
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:41,840
predicting stuff about the world not
 

1499
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,110
predicting stuff about the world not
like this dumb thing that just senses in

1500
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:45,120
like this dumb thing that just senses in
 

1501
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,070
like this dumb thing that just senses in
response senses

1502
00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:46,080
response senses
 

1503
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,510
response senses
yeah so the way the way to think about

1504
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:47,520
yeah so the way the way to think about
 

1505
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,909
yeah so the way the way to think about
it is like this you know your brain is

1506
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:49,919
it is like this you know your brain is
 

1507
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,870
it is like this you know your brain is
uh trapped in a dark silent box yeah

1508
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:52,880
uh trapped in a dark silent box yeah
 

1509
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,590
uh trapped in a dark silent box yeah
that's very

1510
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:53,600
that's very
 

1511
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,190
that's very
romantic of you um which is your skull

1512
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:57,200
romantic of you um which is your skull
 

1513
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,990
romantic of you um which is your skull
and the only information that it

1514
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
and the only information that it
 

1515
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,269
and the only information that it
receives

1516
00:28:01,269 --> 00:28:01,279
receives
 

1517
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,310
receives
from your body and from the world right

1518
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:04,320
from your body and from the world right
 

1519
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,389
from your body and from the world right
is through the senses through the sense

1520
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:06,399
is through the senses through the sense
 

1521
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,350
is through the senses through the sense

1523
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,710

00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:10,720
your eyes your ears and you have
 

1525
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,110
your eyes your ears and you have
a sense sensory data that comes from

1526

00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:17,279
that you're largely unaware of uh to
 

1531
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,070
that you're largely unaware of uh to
your brain which we call interroceptive

1532
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,080
your brain which we call interroceptive
 

1533
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,149
your brain which we call interroceptive
as opposed to exteroceptive which is the

as opposed to exteroceptive which is the
 

1535
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,590
as opposed to exteroceptive which is the
world around you

1536
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
world around you
 

1537
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,190
world around you
and but your brain is receiving

1538
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,200
and but your brain is receiving
 

1539
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,190
and but your brain is receiving
sense data continuously

1540

sense data continuously
 

1541
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,870
sense data continuously
which are the effect of some set of

1542
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:34,880
which are the effect of some set of
 

1543
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,950
which are the effect of some set of

causes
 

1545
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,590
causes
your brain doesn't know the cause of

1546
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
your brain doesn't know the cause of
 

1547
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,549
your brain doesn't know the cause of
these

1548
00:28:40,549 --> 00:28:40,559
these
 

1549
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,029
these
sense data it's only receiving the

1550
00:28:43,029 --> 00:28:43,039
sense data it's only receiving the
 

1551
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,789
sense data it's only receiving the
effects of those causes which are the

1552
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
effects of those causes which are the
 

1553
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,230
effects of those causes which are the
data themselves

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:46,240
data themselves
 

1555
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,310

and so your brain has to solve what

1556
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:48,320
and so your brain has to solve what
 

1557
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,230
and so your brain has to solve what

how do you know when you only receive
 

1563
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,870
how do you know when you only receive
the effects of something how do you know

1564

the effects of something how do you know
 

1565
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,470
the effects of something how do you know
what caused those effects so

1566
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:56,480
what caused those effects so
 

1567
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,510
what caused those effects so
when there's a flash of light or a

1568
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
when there's a flash of light or a
 

1569
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,870
when there's a flash of light or a
change in air pressure

1570

or a tug somewhere in your body
 

1573
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,269
or a tug somewhere in your body
how does your brain know what caused

1574
00:29:07,269 --> 00:29:07,279
how does your brain know what caused
 

1575
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,029
how does your brain know what caused
those

1576

those
 

1577
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,230
those
events so that it knows what to do next

to keep you alive and well
 

1581
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,669
to keep you alive and well
and the answer is that your brain has

1582
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:17,679
and the answer is that your brain has
 

1583
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,190
and the answer is that your brain has
one other source of information

1584

and then when that those data come in

1646
00:30:38,149 --> 00:30:38,159
and then when that those data come in
 

1647
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:38,630
and then when that those data come in
they

1648
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:38,640
they
 

1649
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,710
they
either confirm that prediction and your

1650
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:40,720
either confirm that prediction and your
 

1651
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,389
either confirm that prediction and your
action executes

1652
00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:42,399
action executes
 

1653
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,870
action executes
because the plan has already been made

1654
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:44,880
because the plan has already been made
 

1655
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,070
because the plan has already been made
or

1656
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,080
or
 

1657
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,510
or
um it where there's some uh sense data

1658
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:49,520
um it where there's some uh sense data
 

1659
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,549
um it where there's some uh sense data
that your brain

1660
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:50,559
that your brain
 

1661
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,630
that your brain
didn't predict that's unexpected and

1662
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:52,640
didn't predict that's unexpected and
 

1663
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,909
didn't predict that's unexpected and
your brain takes it in

1664
00:30:53,909 --> 00:30:53,919
your brain takes it in
 

1665
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,389
your brain takes it in
we say encodes it we have a fancy name

1666
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:56,399
we say encodes it we have a fancy name
 

1667
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:57,029
we say encodes it we have a fancy name
for

1668
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:57,039
for
 

1669
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,269
for
that we call it learning your brain

1670
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
that we call it learning your brain
 

1671
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:00,389
that we call it learning your brain
learns

1672
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
learns
 

1673
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,350
learns
and it updates its storehouse of

1674
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:03,360
and it updates its storehouse of
 

1675
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,470
and it updates its storehouse of
knowledge which we call an

1676
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:04,480
knowledge which we call an
 

1677
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,350
knowledge which we call an
internal model and uh that you so that

1678
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:07,360
internal model and uh that you so that
 

1679
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,710
internal model and uh that you so that
you can predict better next time

1680
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:08,720
you can predict better next time
 

1681
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,630
you can predict better next time
and it turns out that predicting and

1682
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:10,640
and it turns out that predicting and
 

1683
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,190
and it turns out that predicting and
correcting predicting and correcting

1684
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:13,200
correcting predicting and correcting
 

1685
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,110
correcting predicting and correcting
is a much more metabolically efficient

1686
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:15,120
is a much more metabolically efficient
 

1687
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,630
is a much more metabolically efficient
way to run a system

1688
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:16,640
way to run a system
 

1689
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,630
way to run a system
than constantly reacting all the time

1690
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:18,640
than constantly reacting all the time
 

1691
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,070
than constantly reacting all the time
because if you're constantly reacting it

1692
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,080
because if you're constantly reacting it
 

1693
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,190
because if you're constantly reacting it
means you have no

1694
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:21,200
means you have no
 

1695
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,950
means you have no
you can't anticipate in any way what's

1696
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:22,960
you can't anticipate in any way what's
 

1697
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,710
you can't anticipate in any way what's
going to happen and so the

1698
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:24,720
going to happen and so the
 

1699
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,470
going to happen and so the
the amount of uncertainty that you have

1700
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:26,480
the amount of uncertainty that you have
 

1701
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,990
the amount of uncertainty that you have
to deal with is

1702
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,000
to deal with is
 

1703
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,789
to deal with is
uh overwhelming to a nervous system

1704
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:30,799
uh overwhelming to a nervous system
 

1705
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,789
uh overwhelming to a nervous system
metabolically costly i like it

1706
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:32,799
metabolically costly i like it
 

1707
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,830
metabolically costly i like it
and so what is a reflex a reflex is when

1708
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:35,840
and so what is a reflex a reflex is when
 

1709
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,029
and so what is a reflex a reflex is when
your brain doesn't check against

1710
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:39,039
your brain doesn't check against
 

1711
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,110
your brain doesn't check against
the sense data that the potential cost

1712
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:43,120
the sense data that the potential cost
 

1713
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,389
the sense data that the potential cost
to you is so great maybe because

1714
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:46,399
to you is so great maybe because
 

1715
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,950
to you is so great maybe because
you know your life is threatened that

1716
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:48,960
you know your life is threatened that
 

1717
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,590
you know your life is threatened that
your brain

1718
00:31:49,590 --> 00:31:49,600
your brain
 

1719
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,830
your brain
makes the prediction and executes the

1720
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:51,840
makes the prediction and executes the
 

1721
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,029
makes the prediction and executes the
action

1722
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,039
action
 

1723
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,149
action
without checking yeah so but prediction

1724
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:56,159
without checking yeah so but prediction
 

1725
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,669
without checking yeah so but prediction
is still at the core that's a beautiful

1726
00:31:57,669 --> 00:31:57,679
is still at the core that's a beautiful
 

1727
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,669
is still at the core that's a beautiful
vision of the brain i wonder

1728
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
vision of the brain i wonder
 

1729
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,389
vision of the brain i wonder
from almost an ai perspective but just

1730
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:02,399
from almost an ai perspective but just
 

1731
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:03,750
from almost an ai perspective but just
computationally

1732
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:03,760
computationally
 

1733
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,669
computationally
is the brain just mostly a prediction

1734
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:05,679
is the brain just mostly a prediction
 

1735
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:06,870
is the brain just mostly a prediction
machine then

1736
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:06,880
machine then
 

1737
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,149
machine then
like is the perception just the

1738
00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:10,159
like is the perception just the
 

1739
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:12,389
like is the perception just the
nice little feature added on top like

00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:20,960
i wonder how big of an impressive system
 

1749
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,990
i wonder how big of an impressive system
is that relative to just the big

1750
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
is that relative to just the big

one answer
 

1759
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,509
one answer
which is that when you go back you know

1760
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:32,519
which is that when you go back you know
 

1761

and that animal had no brain
 

1811
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,230
and that animal had no brain
it had some cells that would later turn

1812
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:30,240
it had some cells that would later turn
 

1813
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,830
it had some cells that would later turn
into a brain but in that animal there's

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:31,840
into a brain but in that animal there's
 

1815

1821
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,149
and it had no eyes and it had no ears
and it had really

00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:38,159
and it had really
 

1823
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:40,950
and it had really
really no senses for the most part it

really no senses for the most part it
 

1825
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,669
really no senses for the most part it
had

1826
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:41,679
had
 

1827
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,789
had
very very limited sense of touch it had

1828
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:44,799
very very limited sense of touch it had
 

1829
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,590
very very limited sense of touch it had
an eye spot for um not for seeing but

1830
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:47,600
an eye spot for um not for seeing but
 

1831
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,149
an eye spot for um not for seeing but
just for

1832
00:33:48,149 --> 00:33:48,159
just for
 

1833
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,950
just for

and it had no hearing it had a
 

1839
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,909
and it had no hearing it had a
vestibular cell

1840
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:55,919
vestibular cell
 

1841
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,350
vestibular cell
so that it could keep upright in the

1842
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,360
so that it could keep upright in the
 

1843
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,110
so that it could keep upright in the
water

1844

at the time approx we're talking

1846
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:01,440
at the time approx we're talking
 

1847
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,190
at the time approx we're talking
evolutionary scale here so

1848
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,200
evolutionary scale here so
 

1849
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,830
evolutionary scale here so
you know give or take some 100 million

1850
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:05,840
you know give or take some 100 million
 

1851
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,789
you know give or take some 100 million
years or something

1852
00:34:06,789 --> 00:34:06,799
years or something
 

1853
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,310
years or something
but at the time you know what are the

1854
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:08,320
but at the time you know what are the
 

1855
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,869
but at the time you know what are the
vertebrate like when of when a backbone

1856
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:10,879
vertebrate like when of when a backbone
 

1857
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:11,829
vertebrate like when of when a backbone
evolved

1858
00:34:11,829 --> 00:34:11,839
evolved
 

1859
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,950
evolved
and a brain evolved a full brain

1860
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:14,960
and a brain evolved a full brain
 

1861
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,510
and a brain evolved a full brain
that was when a head evolved with sense

1862
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:17,520
that was when a head evolved with sense
 

1863
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,149
that was when a head evolved with sense
with

1864
00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:18,159
with
 

1865
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,109
with
sense organs and when um that's when

1866
00:34:21,109 --> 00:34:21,119
sense organs and when um that's when
 

1867
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,270
sense organs and when um that's when
your viscera like internal systems

1868
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:23,280
your viscera like internal systems
 

1869
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,310
your viscera like internal systems
involved so

1870
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:24,320
involved so
 

1871
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,510
involved so
the answer i would say is that um that

1872
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,520
the answer i would say is that um that
 

1873
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,589
the answer i would say is that um that
senses

1874
00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:29,599
senses
 

1875
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,270
senses
nurse motor neuroscientists people who

1876
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:31,280
nurse motor neuroscientists people who
 

1877
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,790
nurse motor neuroscientists people who
study the control of motor behavior

1878
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:34,800
study the control of motor behavior
 

1879
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,470
study the control of motor behavior
believe that senses evolved in the

1880
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:38,480
believe that senses evolved in the
 

1881
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,430
believe that senses evolved in the
service of motor action

1882
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:41,440
service of motor action
 

1883
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,710
service of motor action
so the idea is that like

1884
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:44,720
so the idea is that like
 

1885
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,190
so the idea is that like
what triggered the what triggered what

1886
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,200
what triggered the what triggered what
 

1887
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,750
what triggered the what triggered what
was what was the big evolutionary change

1888
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:49,760
was what was the big evolutionary change
 

1889
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,629
was what was the big evolutionary change
what was the big

1890
00:34:50,629 --> 00:34:50,639
what was the big
 

1891
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,829
what was the big
pressure uh that made it useful

1892
00:34:53,829 --> 00:34:53,839
pressure uh that made it useful
 

1893
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,869
pressure uh that made it useful
to have eyes and ears and a visual

1894
00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
to have eyes and ears and a visual
 

1895
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,630
to have eyes and ears and a visual
system and an auditory system and a

1896
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:58,640
system and an auditory system and a
 

1897
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,150
system and an auditory system and a
brain basically and

1898
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:00,160
brain basically and
 

1899
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,589
brain basically and
you know and the answer that um is

1900
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
you know and the answer that um is
 

1901
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,829
you know and the answer that um is
you know commonly entertained right now

1902
00:35:05,829 --> 00:35:05,839
you know commonly entertained right now
 

1903
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,069
you know commonly entertained right now
is that it was predation

1904
00:35:08,069 --> 00:35:08,079
is that it was predation
 

1905
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,430
is that it was predation
that when at some point an

1906
00:35:11,430 --> 00:35:11,440
that when at some point an
 

1907
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,069
that when at some point an
animal evolved that deliberately ate

1908
00:35:14,069 --> 00:35:14,079
animal evolved that deliberately ate
 

1909
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,069
animal evolved that deliberately ate
another animal

1910
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
another animal
 

1911
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,190
another animal
and this launched an arms race between

1912
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
and this launched an arms race between
 

1913
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,270
and this launched an arms race between
predators and prey

1914
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:21,280
predators and prey
 

1915
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,710
predators and prey
and it became very useful to have senses

1916
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
and it became very useful to have senses
 

1917
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,870
and it became very useful to have senses
right so these these little antioxidants

1918
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:26,880
right so these these little antioxidants
 

1919
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,670
right so these these little antioxidants
these little amphioxy

1920
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
these little amphioxy
 

1921
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,430
these little amphioxy
you know don't really have they

1922
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:33,440
you know don't really have they
 

1923
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,510
you know don't really have they
they don't have an um they're not aware

1924
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
they don't have an um they're not aware
 

1925
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,030
they don't have an um they're not aware
of their environment very much

1926
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,040
of their environment very much
 

1927
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,470
of their environment very much
really they um uh

1928
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:40,480
really they um uh
 

1929
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,069
really they um uh
and so being able to

1930
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:44,079
and so being able to
 

1931
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,109
and so being able to
look up ahead and you know

1932
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
look up ahead and you know
 

1933
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,589
look up ahead and you know
ask yourself you know is that you know

1934
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:49,599
ask yourself you know is that you know
 

1935
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,990
ask yourself you know is that you know
should i eat that or will it eat me

1936
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:52,000
should i eat that or will it eat me
 

1937
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,910
should i eat that or will it eat me
um is is a very useful thing so the idea

1938
00:35:55,910 --> 00:35:55,920
um is is a very useful thing so the idea
 

1939
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,190
um is is a very useful thing so the idea
um is that sense sense sense data

1940
00:35:59,190 --> 00:35:59,200
um is that sense sense sense data
 

1941
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,589
um is that sense sense sense data
is not there for consciousness it didn't

1942
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:01,599
is not there for consciousness it didn't
 

1943
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,829
is not there for consciousness it didn't
evolve for the purposes of consciousness

1944
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839
evolve for the purposes of consciousness
 

1945
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,750
evolve for the purposes of consciousness
it didn't evolve for the purposes of

1946
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:05,760
it didn't evolve for the purposes of
 

1947
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,589
it didn't evolve for the purposes of
experiencing anything

1948
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
experiencing anything
 

1949
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,950
experiencing anything
um it evolved uh in the cert

1950
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
um it evolved uh in the cert
 

1951
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,270
um it evolved uh in the cert
to be in the service of motor control

1952
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:13,280
to be in the service of motor control
 

1953
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,510
to be in the service of motor control
however

1954
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
however
 

1955
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,710
however
maybe it's useful um this is why

1956
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:18,720
maybe it's useful um this is why
 

1957
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,150
maybe it's useful um this is why
you know scientists sometimes uh

1958
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,160
you know scientists sometimes uh
 

1959
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,109
you know scientists sometimes uh
avoid questions about why things evolved

00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:29,920
might be able to say something about
 

1967
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,270
might be able to say something about

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,109
know the why
that's all speculation but the y is kind

1974
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:41,119
that's all speculation but the y is kind
 

1975
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:41,990
that's all speculation but the y is kind
of nice here this

1976
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:42,000
of nice here this
 

1977
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,710
of nice here this
the interesting thing is uh that was the

1978
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:44,720
the interesting thing is uh that was the
 

1979
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,270
the interesting thing is uh that was the
first

1980
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:45,280

element of social interaction is am i

1982
00:36:47,589 --> 00:36:47,599
element of social interaction is am i
 

1983
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,230
element of social interaction is am i
gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me

1984
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me
 

1985
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:53,510
gonna eat you or are you gonna eat me
and for that

1986
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:53,520

 

1987
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,510

it's useful to be able to see each other

1988
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:55,520
it's useful to be able to see each other
 

1989
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,589
it's useful to be able to see each other
sense each other

1990
00:36:57,589 --> 00:36:57,599
sense each other
 

1991
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:59,990
sense each other
that's kind of fascinating that there

1992
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:00,000
that's kind of fascinating that there
 

1993
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,670
that's kind of fascinating that there
was a time when life didn't eat each

1994
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:01,680
was a time when life didn't eat each
 

1995
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,950
was a time when life didn't eat each
other

1996
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:02,960
other
 

1997
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,030
other
or they did by accident right so an

1998
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,040
or they did by accident right so an
 

1999
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,030
or they did by accident right so an
amphioxus for example

2000
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:07,040
amphioxus for example
 

2001
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:10,710
amphioxus for example
well um it kind of like gyrates in the

2002
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:10,720
well um it kind of like gyrates in the
 

2003
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,270
well um it kind of like gyrates in the
water

2004
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:11,280
water
 

2005
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,550
water
and then it plants itself in the sand

2006
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:14,560
and then it plants itself in the sand
 

2007
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,550
and then it plants itself in the sand
like a blade of like a living blade of

2008
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:16,560
like a blade of like a living blade of
 

2009
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,589
like a blade of like a living blade of
grass and then it just

2010
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
grass and then it just
 

2011
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,109
grass and then it just
filters uh whatever comes into its mouth

2012
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
filters uh whatever comes into its mouth
 

2013
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,990
filters uh whatever comes into its mouth
right so it is it is eating but it's not

2014
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:24,000
right so it is it is eating but it's not
 

2015
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,870
right so it is it is eating but it's not
actively

2016
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
actively
 

2017
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,990
actively
hunting and when um

2018
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,000
hunting and when um
 

2019
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,750
hunting and when um
the concentration of food decreases

2020
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:31,760
the concentration of food decreases
 

2021
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,190
the concentration of food decreases
it the amphioxus can sense this

2022
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,200
it the amphioxus can sense this
 

2023
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,270
it the amphioxus can sense this
and so it basically wriggles itself

2024
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:39,280
and so it basically wriggles itself
 

2025
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,630
and so it basically wriggles itself
randomly to some other spot which

2026
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:42,640
randomly to some other spot which
 

2027
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,630
randomly to some other spot which
probabilistically will have more food

2028
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
probabilistically will have more food
 

2029
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,910
probabilistically will have more food
than wherever it is

2030
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:45,920
than wherever it is
 

2031
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,710
than wherever it is
so it's not really you know it's not

2032
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:48,720
so it's not really you know it's not
 

2033
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,310
so it's not really you know it's not
guiding its actions

2034
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
guiding its actions
 

2035
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,950
guiding its actions
um on the basis of it's not we would say

2036
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:52,960
um on the basis of it's not we would say
 

2037
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,589
um on the basis of it's not we would say
there's no real intentional action

2038
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:55,599
there's no real intentional action
 

2039
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,589
there's no real intentional action
um in that in that in the traditional

2040
00:37:57,589 --> 00:37:57,599
um in that in that in the traditional
 

2041
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,310
um in that in that in the traditional
sense speaking of intentional action

2042
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:00,320
sense speaking of intentional action
 

2043
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,349
sense speaking of intentional action
and if the brain is put if prediction is

2044
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:03,359
and if the brain is put if prediction is
 

2045
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:04,470
and if the brain is put if prediction is
indeed

2046
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:04,480
indeed
 

2047
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,390
indeed
a core component of the brain let me ask

2048
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
a core component of the brain let me ask
 

2049
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,510
a core component of the brain let me ask
you a question that scientists also hate

2050
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:09,520
you a question that scientists also hate
 

2051
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,510
you a question that scientists also hate
is uh about free will so how does uh

2052
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:13,520
is uh about free will so how does uh
 

2053
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,910
is uh about free will so how does uh
do you think about free will much how

2054
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:15,920
do you think about free will much how
 

2055
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,990
do you think about free will much how
does that fit into this

2056
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,000
does that fit into this
 

2057
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,910
does that fit into this
into your view of the brain why does it

2058
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:19,920
into your view of the brain why does it
 

2059
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,230
into your view of the brain why does it
feel like

2060
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:22,240
feel like
 

2061
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,270
feel like
we make decisions in this world this is

scientists hate this because it's a hard
 

2067

one thing we know about the brain for

2082
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:42,160
one thing we know about the brain for
 

2083
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,150
one thing we know about the brain for
sure is that the brain creates

2084
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:44,160
sure is that the brain creates
 

2085
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,310
sure is that the brain creates
experiences for us

2086
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,320
experiences for us
 

2087
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,069
experiences for us
my brain creates experiences for me your

2088
00:38:48,069 --> 00:38:48,079
my brain creates experiences for me your
 

2089
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,910
my brain creates experiences for me your
brain creates experiences for you

2090
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:49,920
brain creates experiences for you
 

2091
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,150
brain creates experiences for you
in a way that lures you to believe that

2092
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:52,160
in a way that lures you to believe that
 

2093
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,670
in a way that lures you to believe that
those experiences

2094
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:53,680
those experiences
 

2095
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,990
those experiences
actually reveals the way that it works

2096
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:56,000
actually reveals the way that it works
 

2097
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,589
actually reveals the way that it works
right but it doesn't

2098
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
right but it doesn't
 

2099
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,030
right but it doesn't
so so you don't trust your own intuition

2100
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:01,040
so so you don't trust your own intuition
 

2101
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:01,589
so so you don't trust your own intuition
about

think dan dennett wrote at one point
 

2111
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,550
think dan dennett wrote at one point
like um uh you know the philosopher dan

2112
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:12,560
like um uh you know the philosopher dan

dennett wrote at one point that
 

2115
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,670
dennett wrote at one point that
um it it's i can't say it as eloquently

2116
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:17,680
um it it's i can't say it as eloquently
 

2117

people obviously have free will they are

obviously making choices so
 

2123
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,790
obviously making choices so
it's you know and so there is this

2124
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:24,800
it's you know and so there is this
 

2125
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,230
it's you know and so there is this
observation

2126

observation
 

2127
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,950
observation
that we're not robots and we can do some

2128
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
that we're not robots and we can do some
 

2129
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,630
that we're not robots and we can do some
things like a little more sophisticated

2130
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,640
things like a little more sophisticated
 

2131
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,030
things like a little more sophisticated
than an amphioxus so

than an amphioxus so
 

2133
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,349
than an amphioxus so
um so here's what i would say i would

2134
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:35,359
um so here's what i would say i would
 

2135
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,550
um so here's what i would say i would
say

2136
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:36,560
say
 

2137
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,230
say
that your predictions your internal

2138
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,240
that your predictions your internal
 

2139
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,270
that your predictions your internal
model

2140
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:41,280
model
 

2141
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,750
model
that's running right now right that your

2142
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:43,760
that's running right now right that your
 

2143
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:44,630
that's running right now right that your
ability to

2144
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:44,640
ability to
 

2145
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,790
ability to
understand the sounds that i'm making

2146
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:46,800
understand the sounds that i'm making
 

2147
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,710
understand the sounds that i'm making
and attach them to ideas

2148
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:48,720
and attach them to ideas
 

2149
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,990
and attach them to ideas
is based on the fact that you

2150
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:52,000
is based on the fact that you
 

2151
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,710
is based on the fact that you
have years of experience knowing what

2152
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:54,720
have years of experience knowing what
 

2153
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,790
have years of experience knowing what
these sounds mean in a particular

2154
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:56,800
these sounds mean in a particular
 

2155
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,230
these sounds mean in a particular
statistical uh pattern

2156
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:00,240
statistical uh pattern
 

2157
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,829
statistical uh pattern
right i mean that's how you can

2158
00:40:01,829 --> 00:40:01,839
right i mean that's how you can
 

2159
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:03,910
right i mean that's how you can
understand the words that are coming out

2160
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:03,920
understand the words that are coming out
 

2161
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,670
understand the words that are coming out
of my

2162
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
of my
 

2163
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,150
of my
mouth right i think we did this once

2164
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
mouth right i think we did this once
 

2165
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,990
mouth right i think we did this once
before too didn't we when we were

2166
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,000
before too didn't we when we were
 

2167
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,430
before too didn't we when we were
i don't know i would have to access my

2168
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:11,440
i don't know i would have to access my
 

2169
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,670
i don't know i would have to access my
memory module i think when i was in your

2170
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:13,680
memory module i think when i was in your
 

2171
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,990
memory module i think when i was in your
glen classic yeah i think we did it just

2172
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:16,000
glen classic yeah i think we did it just
 

2173
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,309
glen classic yeah i think we did it just
like that actually so bravo

2174
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:18,319
like that actually so bravo
 

2175
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:20,790
like that actually so bravo
wow yeah i have to go look look back to

2176
00:40:20,790 --> 00:40:20,800
wow yeah i have to go look look back to
 

2177
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,430
wow yeah i have to go look look back to
the tape

2178
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:21,440
the tape
 

2179
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,510
the tape
yeah anyways the um the idea though

2180
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:25,520
yeah anyways the um the idea though
 

2181
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,390
yeah anyways the um the idea though
is that your brain is using past

2182
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:28,400
is that your brain is using past
 

2183
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,510
is that your brain is using past
experience and it can

2184
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:29,520
experience and it can
 

2185
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,430
experience and it can
and it can use past experience in um

2186
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:33,440
and it can use past experience in um
 

2187
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,109
and it can use past experience in um
so it's remembering but you're not

2188
00:40:35,109 --> 00:40:35,119
so it's remembering but you're not
 

2189
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:36,870
so it's remembering but you're not
consciously remembering it's basically

2190
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:36,880
consciously remembering it's basically
 

2191
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,990
consciously remembering it's basically
re-implementing prior experiences

2192
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:40,000
re-implementing prior experiences
 

2193
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,270
re-implementing prior experiences
as a way of predicting what's going to

2194
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:41,280
as a way of predicting what's going to
 

2195
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,030
as a way of predicting what's going to
happen next and it can do something

2196
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:43,040
happen next and it can do something
 

2197
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,270
happen next and it can do something
called conceptual combination which is

2198
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,280
called conceptual combination which is
 

2199
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,150
called conceptual combination which is
it can take bits and pieces of the past

2200
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:48,160
it can take bits and pieces of the past
 

2201
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,309
it can take bits and pieces of the past
and combine it in new ways

2202
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:50,319
and combine it in new ways
 

2203
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,270
and combine it in new ways
so you can experience and make sense of

2204
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:55,280
so you can experience and make sense of
 

2205
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,030
so you can experience and make sense of
things that you've never encountered

2206
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:57,040
things that you've never encountered
 

2207
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,790
things that you've never encountered
before because you've encountered

2208
00:40:58,790 --> 00:40:58,800
before because you've encountered
 

2209
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,510
before because you've encountered
something

2210
00:40:59,510 --> 00:40:59,520
something
 

2211
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,030
something
similar to them

2212
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,040

 

2213
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,230

um and so a brain

2214
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,240
um and so a brain
 

2215
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,510
um and so a brain
in a sense is not um

2216
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
in a sense is not um
 

2217
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,950
in a sense is not um
just um doesn't just contain information

2218
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:12,960
just um doesn't just contain information
 

2219
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,670
just um doesn't just contain information
it is information gaining meaning it can

2220
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:15,680
it is information gaining meaning it can
 

2221
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,829
it is information gaining meaning it can
create it new information

2222
00:41:17,829 --> 00:41:17,839
create it new information
 

2223
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,150
create it new information
by this generative process so in a sense

2224
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:20,160
by this generative process so in a sense
 

2225
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,510
by this generative process so in a sense
you could say well that maybe that's

2226
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:21,520
you could say well that maybe that's
 

2227
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,910
you could say well that maybe that's
that's a source of free will but i think

2228
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:23,920
that's a source of free will but i think
 

2229
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,990
that's a source of free will but i think
really where free will comes from or the

2230
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:26,000
really where free will comes from or the
 

2231
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,910
really where free will comes from or the
kind of free will that i think is worth

2232
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:27,920
kind of free will that i think is worth
 

2233
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:32,230
kind of free will that i think is worth
having a conversation about is um

2234
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:32,240
having a conversation about is um
 

2235
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,190
having a conversation about is um
involves cultivating experiences for

2236
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,200
involves cultivating experiences for
 

2237
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,390
involves cultivating experiences for
yourself

2238
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:36,400
yourself
 

2239
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,150
yourself
that change your internal model

2240
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:40,160
that change your internal model
 

2241
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,790
that change your internal model
when you were born and you were raised

2242
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:42,800
when you were born and you were raised
 

2243
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,309
when you were born and you were raised
in a particular

2244
00:41:44,309 --> 00:41:44,319
in a particular
 

2245
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:47,510
in a particular
context that your mod your brain wired

2246
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:47,520
context that your mod your brain wired
 

2247
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,630
context that your mod your brain wired
itself

2248
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:48,640
itself
 

2249
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,950
itself
to your surroundings to your physical

2250
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:50,960
to your surroundings to your physical
 

2251
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,470
to your surroundings to your physical
surroundings and also to your social

2252
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:52,480
surroundings and also to your social
 

2253
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,430
surroundings and also to your social
surroundings

2254
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:53,440
surroundings
 

2255
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,390
surroundings
so you were handed an internal model

2256
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:56,400
so you were handed an internal model
 

2257
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,510
so you were handed an internal model
basically

2258
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:57,520
basically
 

2259
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,430
basically
um but uh when you grow up

2260
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:01,440
um but uh when you grow up
 

2261
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,870
um but uh when you grow up
the more control you have over your

2262
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:04,880
the more control you have over your
 

2263
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,550
the more control you have over your
where you are and what you do um

2264
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:08,560
where you are and what you do um
 

2265
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,309
where you are and what you do um
you can cultivate new experiences for

2266
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:10,319
you can cultivate new experiences for
 

2267
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,870
you can cultivate new experiences for
yourself and those new experiences

2268
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:14,880
yourself and those new experiences
 

2269
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,870
yourself and those new experiences
can change your internal model and you

2270
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:16,880
can change your internal model and you
 

2271
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,230
can change your internal model and you
can actually

2272
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:18,240
can actually
 

2273
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,990
can actually
um practice those experiences in a way

2274
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:22,000
um practice those experiences in a way
 

2275
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,790
um practice those experiences in a way
that makes them automatic meaning it

2276
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:24,800
that makes them automatic meaning it
 

2277
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,710
that makes them automatic meaning it
makes it easier for the brain

2278
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:26,720
makes it easier for the brain
 

2279
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,990
makes it easier for the brain
your brain to make them again and

2280
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:30,000
your brain to make them again and
 

2281
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,430
your brain to make them again and
i think that that is something like

2282
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:33,440
i think that that is something like
 

2283
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,390
i think that that is something like
what you would call free will you aren't

2284
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:36,400
what you would call free will you aren't
 

2285
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,829
what you would call free will you aren't
responsible

2286
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:37,839
responsible
 

2287
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,109
responsible
for the model that you were handed that

2288
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,119
for the model that you were handed that
 

2289
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,390
for the model that you were handed that
someone you know your your caregivers

2290
00:42:44,390 --> 00:42:44,400
someone you know your your caregivers
 

2291
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,670
someone you know your your caregivers
uh cultivated a model in your brain

2292
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:47,680
uh cultivated a model in your brain
 

2293
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,750
uh cultivated a model in your brain
you're not responsible for that model

2294
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:49,760
you're not responsible for that model
 

2295
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,270
you're not responsible for that model
but you are responsible for the one you

2296
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:51,280
but you are responsible for the one you
 

2297
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,950
but you are responsible for the one you
have now

2298
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:52,960
have now
 

2299
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,270
have now
you can choose you choose what you

2300
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:55,280
you can choose you choose what you
 

2301
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,870
you can choose you choose what you
expose yourself to

2302
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
expose yourself to
 

2303
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,829
expose yourself to
you choose uh how you spend your time

2304
00:42:59,829 --> 00:42:59,839
you choose uh how you spend your time
 

2305
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,230
you choose uh how you spend your time
not everybody has choice over everything

2306
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:02,240
not everybody has choice over everything
 

2307
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,230
not everybody has choice over everything
right but everybody has a little bit of

2308
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:04,240
right but everybody has a little bit of
 

2309
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,510
right but everybody has a little bit of
choice

2310
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:05,520
choice
 

2311
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,950
choice
um and and so i think

2312
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:08,960
um and and so i think
 

2313
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,750
um and and so i think
that is uh something that i think is

2314
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:11,760
that is uh something that i think is
 

2315
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,430
that is uh something that i think is
arguably called free will

2316
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:13,440
arguably called free will
 

2317
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,829
arguably called free will
yeah there's this like the the ripple

2318
00:43:15,829 --> 00:43:15,839
yeah there's this like the the ripple
 

2319
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,190
yeah there's this like the the ripple
effects of the

2320
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:17,200
effects of the
 

2321
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,109
effects of the
billions of decisions you make early on

2322
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:19,119
billions of decisions you make early on
 

2323
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,390
billions of decisions you make early on
in life

2324
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:20,400
in life
 

2325
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,670
in life
have are so great

2326
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,680
have are so great
 

2327
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,589
have are so great
that uh even if it's not

2328
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:27,599
that uh even if it's not
 

2329
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,790
that uh even if it's not
even if it's like all deterministic just

2330
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:30,800
even if it's like all deterministic just
 

2331
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,870
even if it's like all deterministic just
the amount of possibilities that are

2332
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:34,880
the amount of possibilities that are
 

2333
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,750
the amount of possibilities that are
created and then the focusing of those

2334
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:37,760
created and then the focusing of those
 

2335
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,030
created and then the focusing of those
possibilities into a single trajectory

2336
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
possibilities into a single trajectory
 

2337
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,230
possibilities into a single trajectory
uh that somewhere within that that's

2338
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:44,240
uh that somewhere within that that's
 

2339
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,190
uh that somewhere within that that's
free will even if it's all deterministic

2340
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:47,200
free will even if it's all deterministic
 

2341
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:49,349
free will even if it's all deterministic
that might as well be

2342
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:49,359
that might as well be
 

2343
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,069
that might as well be
of just the number of choices that are

2344
00:43:52,069 --> 00:43:52,079
of just the number of choices that are
 

2345
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,750
of just the number of choices that are
possible and the fact that you just make

2346
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:53,760
possible and the fact that you just make
 

2347
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:54,069
possible and the fact that you just make
one

2348
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:54,079
one
 

2349
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,390
one
trajectory to those set of choices seems

2350
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:56,400
trajectory to those set of choices seems
 

2351
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,510
trajectory to those set of choices seems
to be like

2352
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:57,520
to be like
 

2353
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,950
to be like
something like they'll be called free

2354
00:43:58,950 --> 00:43:58,960
something like they'll be called free
 

2355
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,109
something like they'll be called free
will but it's still kind of sad to think

2356
00:44:01,109 --> 00:44:01,119
will but it's still kind of sad to think
 

2357
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:02,230
will but it's still kind of sad to think
like

2358
00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:02,240
like
 

2359
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,910
like
there doesn't seem to be a place where

2360
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:03,920
there doesn't seem to be a place where
 

2361
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,670
there doesn't seem to be a place where
there's magic in there

2362
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:05,680
there's magic in there
 

2363
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,150
there's magic in there
where it is all just a computer well

2364
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:08,160
where it is all just a computer well
 

2365
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,349
where it is all just a computer well
there's lots of magic

2366
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:09,359
there's lots of magic
 

2367
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,430
there's lots of magic
i would say so far because we don't

2368
00:44:11,430 --> 00:44:11,440
i would say so far because we don't
 

2369
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,030
i would say so far because we don't
really understand

2370
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:13,040
really understand
 

2371
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,109
really understand
uh how all of this is exactly

2372
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:17,119
uh how all of this is exactly
 

2373
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,630
uh how all of this is exactly
played out at a

2374
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:20,640

 

2375
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,109

i mean scientists are working hard and

2376
00:44:23,109 --> 00:44:23,119
i mean scientists are working hard and
 

2377
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:23,829
i mean scientists are working hard and
disagree

2378
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:23,839
disagree
 

2379
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,870
disagree
about some of the details under the hood

2380
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
about some of the details under the hood
 

2381
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,430
about some of the details under the hood
of what i

2382
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:27,440
of what i
 

2383
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,150
of what i
just described but i think there's quite

2384
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:30,160
just described but i think there's quite
 

2385
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,349
just described but i think there's quite
a bit of magic actually and also there's

2386
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
a bit of magic actually and also there's
 

2387
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:36,790
a bit of magic actually and also there's
there's also um stochastic

2388
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:36,800
there's also um stochastic
 

2389
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,990
there's also um stochastic
firing of neurons don't they

2390
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:40,000
firing of neurons don't they
 

2391
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,270
firing of neurons don't they
they're not purely digital in the sense

2392
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:43,280
they're not purely digital in the sense
 

2393
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:43,910
they're not purely digital in the sense
that

2394
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:43,920
that
 

2395
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,150
that
there is there's also analog

2396
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:46,160
there is there's also analog
 

2397
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,910
there is there's also analog
communication between neurons not just

2398
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:47,920
communication between neurons not just
 

2399
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:48,710
communication between neurons not just
digital

2400
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
digital
 

2401
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,390
digital
so it's not just with not just with

2402
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:50,400
so it's not just with not just with
 

2403
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,990
so it's not just with not just with
firing of axons

2404
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:52,000
firing of axons
 

2405
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,550
firing of axons
and some of that there's there are other

2406
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:54,560
and some of that there's there are other
 

2407
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,150
and some of that there's there are other
ways to communicate and

2408
00:44:56,150 --> 00:44:56,160
ways to communicate and
 

2409
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,589
ways to communicate and
also um uh

2410
00:44:59,589 --> 00:44:59,599
also um uh
 

2411
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,829
also um uh
there's noise in the system and the

2412
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
there's noise in the system and the
 

2413
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:02,870
there's noise in the system and the
noise is there

2414
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:02,880
noise is there
 

2415
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,990
noise is there
for a really good reason and that is the

2416
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:06,000
for a really good reason and that is the
 

2417
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:06,550
for a really good reason and that is the
more

2418
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:06,560
more
 

2419
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,670
more
variability there is the more

2420
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:09,680
variability there is the more
 

2421
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,190
variability there is the more
potential there is for your brain to

2422
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:13,200
potential there is for your brain to
 

2423
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:16,390
potential there is for your brain to
be able to be information bearing so

2424
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:16,400
be able to be information bearing so
 

2425
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,829
be able to be information bearing so
um basically you know there are some

2426
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:19,839
um basically you know there are some
 

2427
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:20,550
um basically you know there are some
animals that

2428
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:20,560
animals that
 

2429
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:23,510
animals that
have clusters of cells the only job is

2430
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:23,520
have clusters of cells the only job is
 

2431
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,670
have clusters of cells the only job is
to inject noise

2432
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:25,680
to inject noise
 

2433
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,910
to inject noise
you know into their um neural patterns

2434
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:27,920
you know into their um neural patterns
 

2435
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,589
you know into their um neural patterns
so maybe noise is the source of free

2436
00:45:29,589 --> 00:45:29,599
so maybe noise is the source of free
 

2437
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:30,150
so maybe noise is the source of free
will

2438
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:30,160
will
 

2439
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,990
will
so you can think about you can think

2440
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:32,000
so you can think about you can think
 

2441
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,950
so you can think about you can think
about stochasticity or noise as

2442
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:34,960
about stochasticity or noise as
 

2443
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,349
about stochasticity or noise as
as a source of free will or you can

2444
00:45:37,349 --> 00:45:37,359
as a source of free will or you can
 

2445
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:37,990
as a source of free will or you can
think of

2446
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:38,000
think of
 

2447
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,430
think of
of um conceptual combination as a source

2448
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:41,440
of um conceptual combination as a source
 

2449
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,230
of um conceptual combination as a source
of free will

2450
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:42,240
of free will
 

2451
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,829
of free will
you can certainly think about um

2452
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:44,839
you can certainly think about um
 

2453
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:46,630
you can certainly think about um
cultivating uh

2454
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:46,640
cultivating uh
 

2455
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,630
cultivating uh
you know you can't reach back into your

2456
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:48,640
you know you can't reach back into your
 

2457
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:49,910
you know you can't reach back into your
past and

2458
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:49,920

poetic
 

2483
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,829
poetic
yes you are continually cultivating your

2489
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,030

so you think uh yeah i guess the the

2490
00:46:29,030 --> 00:46:29,040
so you think uh yeah i guess the the
 

2491
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,710
so you think uh yeah i guess the the
construction of the mental model that

2492
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:30,720
construction of the mental model that
 

2493
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,790
construction of the mental model that
you use for prediction

2494
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
you use for prediction
 

2495
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,510
you use for prediction
ultimately contains within it your

2496
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:35,520
ultimately contains within it your
 

2497
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,589
ultimately contains within it your
perception of the past like the way

2498
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:37,599
perception of the past like the way
 

2499
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,349
perception of the past like the way
you interpret the past or even just the

2500
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:39,359
you interpret the past or even just the
 

2501
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:41,030
you interpret the past or even just the
entirety of your narrative about the

2502
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:41,040
entirety of your narrative about the
 

2503
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:41,670

what about the other thing you talk
 

2515
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,270
what about the other thing you talk
about

2516
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:55,280
about
 

2517
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,630
about
you've mentioned about sensory

2518
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:56,640
you've mentioned about sensory
 

2519
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:59,190
you've mentioned about sensory
perception as a thing that like

2520
00:46:59,190 --> 00:46:59,200
perception as a thing that like
 

2521
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,829
perception as a thing that like
is just you have to infer about the

2522
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:01,839
is just you have to infer about the
 

2523
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:02,470
is just you have to infer about the
sources

2524
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:02,480
sources
 

2525
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,750
sources
of the thing that you have perceived

2526
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:05,760
of the thing that you have perceived
 

2527
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:07,589
of the thing that you have perceived
through your senses

2528
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:07,599
through your senses
 

2529
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,790
through your senses
so uh let me ask the

2530
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:10,800
so uh let me ask the
 

2531
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,470
so uh let me ask the
another ridiculous question is is

2532
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:12,480
another ridiculous question is is
 

2533
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:13,990
another ridiculous question is is
anything real at all

2534
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:14,000
anything real at all
 

2535
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,069
anything real at all
like how do we know it's real how do we

2536
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:16,079
like how do we know it's real how do we
 

2537
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,270
like how do we know it's real how do we
make sense

2538
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,280
make sense
 

2539
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,950
make sense
of the fact that just like you said

2540
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:18,960
of the fact that just like you said
 

2541
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,790
of the fact that just like you said
there's this brain sitting alone in the

2542
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:20,800
there's this brain sitting alone in the
 

2543
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,030
there's this brain sitting alone in the
darkness trying to perceive the world

2544
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
darkness trying to perceive the world
 

2545
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,470
darkness trying to perceive the world
how do we know that the world is out

2546
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:24,480
how do we know that the world is out
 

2547
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,150
how do we know that the world is out
there i

2548
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:26,160
there i
 

2549
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,710
there i
will be perceived yeah so i don't think

2550
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:28,720
will be perceived yeah so i don't think
 

2551
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,470
will be perceived yeah so i don't think
that you should be asking questions like

2552
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
that you should be asking questions like
 

2553
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,470
that you should be asking questions like
that without passing a joint

2554
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:32,480
that without passing a joint
 

2555
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,470
that without passing a joint
right no for sure yeah i actually did

2556
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:34,480
right no for sure yeah i actually did
 

2557
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,150
right no for sure yeah i actually did
before this so i apologize

2558
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,160
before this so i apologize
 

2559
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,990
before this so i apologize
okay no well that's okay you apologize

2560
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:38,000
okay no well that's okay you apologize
 

2561
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,349
okay no well that's okay you apologize
for not sharing that's okay

2562
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:39,359
for not sharing that's okay
 

2563
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,190
for not sharing that's okay
so i mean here's what i would say what i

2564
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:41,200
so i mean here's what i would say what i
 

2565
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,270
so i mean here's what i would say what i
would say is that the reason why

2566
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:43,280
would say is that the reason why
 

2567
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,790
would say is that the reason why
we can be pretty sure that there's a

2568
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:44,800
we can be pretty sure that there's a
 

2569
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,109
we can be pretty sure that there's a
there there is that

2570
00:47:47,109 --> 00:47:47,119
there there is that
 

2571
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,069
there there is that
the the structure of the information in

2572
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
the the structure of the information in
 

2573
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,510
the the structure of the information in
the world

2574
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:51,520
the world
 

2575
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,150
the world
what we call statistical regularities in

2576
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:54,160
what we call statistical regularities in
 

2577
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,990
what we call statistical regularities in
sights and sounds and so on

2578
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:56,000
sights and sounds and so on
 

2579
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,750
sights and sounds and so on
and the structure of the information

2580
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:57,760
and the structure of the information
 

2581
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,270
and the structure of the information
that comes from your body it's not

2582
00:47:59,270 --> 00:47:59,280
that comes from your body it's not
 

2583
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,470
that comes from your body it's not
random stuff

2584
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
random stuff
 

2585
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,630
random stuff
there's a structure to it there's a

2586
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:02,640
there's a structure to it there's a
 

2587
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,069
there's a structure to it there's a
spatial structure and a temporal

2588
00:48:04,069 --> 00:48:04,079
spatial structure and a temporal
 

2589
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:04,950
spatial structure and a temporal
structure

2590
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:04,960
structure
 

2591
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,270
structure
and that spatial and temporal structure

2592
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:07,280
and that spatial and temporal structure
 

2593
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:09,510
and that spatial and temporal structure
wires your brain

2594
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:09,520
wires your brain
 

2595
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,150
wires your brain
so an infant brain is not a miniature

2596
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:12,160
so an infant brain is not a miniature
 

2597
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,829
so an infant brain is not a miniature
adult brain

2598
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:13,839
adult brain
 

2599
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,790
adult brain
it's a brain that is waiting for wiring

2600
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:16,800
it's a brain that is waiting for wiring
 

2601
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,030
it's a brain that is waiting for wiring
instructions from the world

2602
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,040
instructions from the world
 

2603
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:21,030
instructions from the world
and it must receive those wiring

2604
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,040
and it must receive those wiring
 

2605
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,150
and it must receive those wiring
instructions

2606
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:22,160
instructions
 

2607
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,950
instructions
to develop in a typical way so for

2608
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
to develop in a typical way so for
 

2609
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:25,510
to develop in a typical way so for
example

2610
00:48:25,510 --> 00:48:25,520
example
 

2611
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,430
example
when a newborn is born when a newborn is

2612
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:29,440
when a newborn is born when a newborn is
 

2613
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:32,950
when a newborn is born when a newborn is
born when a when a baby is born um

2614
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:32,960
born when a when a baby is born um
 

2615
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,390
born when a when a baby is born um
the baby can't see

2616
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:36,400
the baby can't see
 

2617
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,790
the baby can't see
very well because the visual system in

2618
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:38,800
very well because the visual system in
 

2619
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:39,990
very well because the visual system in
that baby's brain

2620
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,000
that baby's brain
 

2621
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,069
that baby's brain
is not complete the

2622
00:48:44,069 --> 00:48:44,079

00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:46,400
the retina of your eye which actually is
 

2625
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,750
the retina of your eye which actually is
part of your brain

2626
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:47,760
part of your brain
 

2627
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,910
part of your brain
has to be stimulated with photons of

00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:49,920
has to be stimulated with photons of
 

2629
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:51,510
has to be stimulated with photons of

the baby won't develop normally to be

2632
00:48:54,309 --> 00:48:54,319
the baby won't develop normally to be
 

2633
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:55,030
the baby won't develop normally to be
able to see

2634
00:48:55,030 --> 00:48:55,040
able to see
 

2635
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,510
able to see
in in a neurotypical way same thing is

2636
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:57,520
in in a neurotypical way same thing is
 

2637
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,390
in in a neurotypical way same thing is
true for hearing

2638
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:58,400
true for hearing
 

2639
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,750
true for hearing
the same thing is true really for all

2640
00:48:59,750 --> 00:48:59,760
the same thing is true really for all
 

2641
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,670
the same thing is true really for all
your senses so the

2642
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
your senses so the
 

2643
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,270
your senses so the
point is that that

2644
00:49:05,270 --> 00:49:05,280
point is that that
 

2645
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,910
point is that that
the physical world the sense data from

2646
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920
the physical world the sense data from
 

2647
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:09,109
the physical world the sense data from
the physical world

2648
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:09,119
the physical world
 

2649
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,829
the physical world
wires your brain so that you have an

2650
00:49:11,829 --> 00:49:11,839
wires your brain so that you have an
 

2651
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:12,710
wires your brain so that you have an
internal model

2652
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:12,720
internal model
 

2653
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,589
internal model
of that world so that your brain can

2654
00:49:15,589 --> 00:49:15,599
of that world so that your brain can
 

2655
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,750
of that world so that your brain can
predict well to keep you alive and well

2656
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:17,760
predict well to keep you alive and well
 

2657
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,990
predict well to keep you alive and well
and allow you to thrive that's

2658
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:20,000
and allow you to thrive that's
 

2659
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,190
and allow you to thrive that's
fascinating that the brain is waiting

2660
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:23,200
fascinating that the brain is waiting
 

2661
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,829
fascinating that the brain is waiting
for a very specific kind of uh set of

2662
00:49:25,829 --> 00:49:25,839
for a very specific kind of uh set of
 

2663
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,910
for a very specific kind of uh set of
instructions from the world like not

2664
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:27,920
instructions from the world like not
 

2665
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,230
instructions from the world like not
not the specific but a very specific

2666
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:30,240
not the specific but a very specific
 

2667
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:31,829
not the specific but a very specific
kind of instruction yes

2668
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:31,839
kind of instruction yes
 

2669
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,390
kind of instruction yes
so you scientists call it expectable

2670
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:34,400
so you scientists call it expectable
 

2671
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:34,950
so you scientists call it expectable
input

2672
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:34,960
input
 

2673
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,230
input
the brain needs some input in order to

2674
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:38,240
the brain needs some input in order to
 

2675
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,190
the brain needs some input in order to
develop normally

2676
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:39,200
develop normally
 

2677
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,950
develop normally
and so we're and we are genetically

2678
00:49:42,950 --> 00:49:42,960
and so we're and we are genetically
 

2679
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,030
and so we're and we are genetically
you know we as i say in the book we we

2680
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:45,040
you know we as i say in the book we we
 

2681
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,790
you know we as i say in the book we we
have the kind of nature that requires

2682
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:46,800
have the kind of nature that requires
 

2683
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:48,230
have the kind of nature that requires
nurture

2684
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:48,240
nurture
 

2685
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:51,030
nurture
we we can't develop normally without

00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
we we can't develop normally without
 

2687
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:51,750
we we can't develop normally without

from the body
 

2693
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,829
from the body
and what's really interesting about

2694
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:56,839
and what's really interesting about
 

2695
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,230
and what's really interesting about
humans and

2696
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:58,240
humans and
 

2697
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,990
humans and
some other animals too but really

2698
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,000
some other animals too but really
 

2699
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,430
some other animals too but really
seriously in humans is the input that we

2700
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:05,440
seriously in humans is the input that we
 

2701
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,309
seriously in humans is the input that we
need

2702
00:50:06,309 --> 00:50:06,319
need
 

2703
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:11,109
need
is not just physical it's also social

2704
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:11,119
is not just physical it's also social
 

2705
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,390
is not just physical it's also social
we in order for an an infant a human

2706
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:14,400
we in order for an an infant a human
 

2707
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,790
we in order for an an infant a human
infant to develop normally

2708
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:16,800
infant to develop normally
 

2709
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,630
infant to develop normally
that infant needs eye contact touch

2710
00:50:20,630 --> 00:50:20,640
that infant needs eye contact touch
 

2711
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,589
that infant needs eye contact touch
it needs certain types of smells it

2712
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:23,599
it needs certain types of smells it
 

2713
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,309
it needs certain types of smells it
needs to be

2714
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:24,319
needs to be
 

2715
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:27,910
needs to be
cuddled it needs right so um

2716
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:27,920
cuddled it needs right so um
 

2717
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:31,990
cuddled it needs right so um
without social input

2718
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:32,000
without social input
 

2719
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,470
without social input
the brain it's that that infant's brain

2720
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:34,480
the brain it's that that infant's brain
 

2721
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,670
the brain it's that that infant's brain
will not wire

2722
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:35,680
will not wire
 

2723
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,870
will not wire
itself in a neurotypical way and again i

2724
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:38,880
itself in a neurotypical way and again i
 

2725
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:40,069
itself in a neurotypical way and again i
would say

2726
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:40,079
would say
 

2727
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,589
would say
there are lots of um

2728
00:50:43,589 --> 00:50:43,599
there are lots of um
 

2729
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,069
there are lots of um
cultural patterns of caring for an

2730
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:46,079
cultural patterns of caring for an
 

2731
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,430
cultural patterns of caring for an
infant it's not like the infant has to

2732
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
infant it's not like the infant has to
 

2733
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,670
infant it's not like the infant has to
be cared for in one way

2734
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:49,680
be cared for in one way
 

2735
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,790
be cared for in one way
um whatever the social environment

2736
00:50:52,790 --> 00:50:52,800
um whatever the social environment
 

2737
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,990
um whatever the social environment
is for an infant that it will will be

2738
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
is for an infant that it will will be
 

2739
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,230
is for an infant that it will will be
reflected in that infant's

2740
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
reflected in that infant's
 

2741
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,750
reflected in that infant's
internal model so we have lots of

2742
00:50:59,750 --> 00:50:59,760
internal model so we have lots of
 

2743
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,030
internal model so we have lots of
different cultures lots of different

2744
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:01,040
different cultures lots of different
 

2745
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,950
different cultures lots of different
ways of rearing children

2746
00:51:02,950 --> 00:51:02,960
ways of rearing children
 

2747
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,510
ways of rearing children
and that's an advantage for our species

2748
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:05,520
and that's an advantage for our species
 

2749
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,710
and that's an advantage for our species
although we don't always experience it

2750
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,720
although we don't always experience it
 

2751
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:07,190
although we don't always experience it
that way

2752
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:07,200
that way
 

2753
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,069
that way
that is an advantage for our species but

2754
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:10,079
that is an advantage for our species but
 

2755
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:11,190
that is an advantage for our species but
if you

2756
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:11,200
if you
 

2757
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,230
if you
if you just you know feed and water a

2758
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:14,240
if you just you know feed and water a
 

2759
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,829
if you just you know feed and water a
baby

2760
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:15,839
baby
 

2761
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:20,230
baby
without all the extra social doodads

2762
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:20,240
without all the extra social doodads
 

2763
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,270
without all the extra social doodads
what you get is a profoundly impaired

2764
00:51:23,270 --> 00:51:23,280
what you get is a profoundly impaired
 

2765
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,390
what you get is a profoundly impaired
uh human yeah but

2766
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:26,400
uh human yeah but
 

2767
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,710
uh human yeah but
nevertheless you're kind of saying that

2768
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:28,720
nevertheless you're kind of saying that
 

2769
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,150
nevertheless you're kind of saying that
the physical reality

2770
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
the physical reality
 

2771
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,910
the physical reality
has uh has a consistent

2772
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:33,920
has uh has a consistent
 

2773
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,549
has uh has a consistent
thing throughout that keeps feeding

2774
00:51:36,549 --> 00:51:36,559
thing throughout that keeps feeding
 

2775
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,750
thing throughout that keeps feeding
these

2776
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:37,760
these
 

2777
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,630
these
set of sensory information that our

2778
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:40,640
set of sensory information that our
 

2779
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,630
set of sensory information that our
brains are constructed

2780
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:42,640
brains are constructed
 

2781
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,950
brains are constructed
for but yeah the cool thing though is

2782
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:44,960
for but yeah the cool thing though is
 

2783
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,030
for but yeah the cool thing though is
that if you change the consistency

2784
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:47,040
that if you change the consistency
 

2785
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,309
that if you change the consistency
if you change the statistical

2786
00:51:48,309 --> 00:51:48,319
if you change the statistical
 

2787
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:50,950
if you change the statistical
regularities so prediction error

2788
00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
regularities so prediction error
 

2789
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,710
regularities so prediction error
your brain can learn it it's expensive

2790
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:52,720
your brain can learn it it's expensive
 

2791
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:54,309
your brain can learn it it's expensive
for your brain to learn it and it takes

2792
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:54,319
for your brain to learn it and it takes
 

2793
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,190
for your brain to learn it and it takes
a while to

2794
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:55,200
a while to
 

2795
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,710
a while to
for the brain to get really automated

2796
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:56,720
for the brain to get really automated
 

2797
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,630
for the brain to get really automated
with it but you know you um

2798
00:51:58,630 --> 00:51:58,640
with it but you know you um
 

2799
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,270
with it but you know you um
had a wonderful conversation with david

2800
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:01,280
had a wonderful conversation with david
 

2801
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,950
had a wonderful conversation with david
eagleman who just published a book

2802
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:02,960
eagleman who just published a book
 

2803
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,270
eagleman who just published a book
about this yeah and gave lots and lots

2804
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:05,280
about this yeah and gave lots and lots
 

2805
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,670
about this yeah and gave lots and lots
of really very very cool examples

2806
00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:07,680
of really very very cool examples
 

2807
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,910
of really very very cool examples
some of which i actually discussed in

2808
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:09,920
some of which i actually discussed in
 

2809
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,750
some of which i actually discussed in
how emotions were made but not obviously

2810
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:11,760
how emotions were made but not obviously
 

2811
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,270
how emotions were made but not obviously
to the extent that he did

2812
00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:13,280
to the extent that he did
 

2813
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,190
to the extent that he did
um in his book which it's a fascinating

2814
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:15,200
um in his book which it's a fascinating
 

2815
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,630
um in his book which it's a fascinating
book and it's

2816
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:16,640
book and it's
 

2817
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,069
book and it's
but it it speaks to the point that

2818
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:20,079
but it it speaks to the point that
 

2819
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,150
but it it speaks to the point that
your internal model is always under

2820
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
your internal model is always under
 

2821
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,230
your internal model is always under
construction

2822
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
construction
 

2823
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,510
construction
and therefore you always

2824
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:27,520
and therefore you always
 

2825
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,790
and therefore you always
can modify your experience i wonder what

2826
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:30,800
can modify your experience i wonder what
 

2827
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:31,670
can modify your experience i wonder what
the limits are

2828
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:31,680
the limits are
 

2829
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,990
the limits are
like uh if we can if we put it on mars

2830
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:34,000
like uh if we can if we put it on mars
 

2831
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,150
like uh if we can if we put it on mars
or if we put in virtual reality

2832
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:36,160
or if we put in virtual reality
 

2833
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,190
or if we put in virtual reality
or if we sit at home during a pandemic

2834
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:39,200
or if we sit at home during a pandemic
 

2835
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,030
or if we sit at home during a pandemic
and we spend most of our day on twitter

2836
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:41,040
and we spend most of our day on twitter
 

2837
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:42,549
and we spend most of our day on twitter
and tick tock

2838
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:42,559
and tick tock
 

2839
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,549
and tick tock
like i wonder what where the breaking

2840
00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:44,559
like i wonder what where the breaking
 

2841
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:46,630
like i wonder what where the breaking
point like the limitations of

2842
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:46,640
point like the limitations of
 

2843
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,790
point like the limitations of
the brain's capacity to uh

2844
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:50,800
the brain's capacity to uh
 

2845
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,990
the brain's capacity to uh
to properly continue wiring itself

2846
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,000
to properly continue wiring itself
 

2847
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,390
to properly continue wiring itself
well i think what i would say is that

2848
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:56,400
well i think what i would say is that
 

2849
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,790
well i think what i would say is that
there are different ways to

2850
00:52:58,790 --> 00:52:58,800
there are different ways to
 

2851
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,870
there are different ways to
specify your question right like one way

2852
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:00,880
specify your question right like one way
 

2853
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,390
specify your question right like one way
to specify it would be the way that

2854
00:53:02,390 --> 00:53:02,400
to specify it would be the way that
 

2855
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,589
to specify it would be the way that
david

2856
00:53:03,589 --> 00:53:03,599
david
 

2857
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,790
david
um phrases it which is

2858
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:06,800
um phrases it which is
 

2859
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,150
um phrases it which is
can we can we create a new sense like

2860
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:10,160
can we can we create a new sense like
 

2861
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:13,990
can we can we create a new sense like
can we create a new sensory modality

2862
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:14,000
can we create a new sensory modality
 

2863
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,750
can we create a new sensory modality
how hard would that be what are the

2864
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:15,760
how hard would that be what are the
 

2865
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,430
how hard would that be what are the
limits in doing that

2866
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:17,440
limits in doing that
 

2867
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,510
limits in doing that
um and um but another way to

2868
00:53:21,510 --> 00:53:21,520
um and um but another way to
 

2869
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,670
um and um but another way to
say it is what what happens to a brain

2870
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:23,680
say it is what what happens to a brain
 

2871
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:24,790
say it is what what happens to a brain
when you

2872
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:24,800
when you
 

2873
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,470
when you
remove some of those statistical

2874
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:26,480
remove some of those statistical
 

2875
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:28,470
remove some of those statistical
regularities right like what happens to

2876
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
regularities right like what happens to
 

2877
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,069
regularities right like what happens to
a brain what happens to an adult brain

2878
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:30,079
a brain what happens to an adult brain
 

2879
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:30,950
a brain what happens to an adult brain
when you

2880
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:30,960
when you
 

2881
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,309
when you
remove some of the

2882
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:34,319
remove some of the
 

2883
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:36,790
remove some of the
statistical patterns that were there and

2884
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:36,800
statistical patterns that were there and
 

2885
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,829
statistical patterns that were there and
they're not there anymore

2886
00:53:37,829 --> 00:53:37,839
they're not there anymore
 

2887
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,589
they're not there anymore
you're talking about in the environment

2888
00:53:39,589 --> 00:53:39,599
you're talking about in the environment
 

2889
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:41,270
you're talking about in the environment
or in the actual like

2890
00:53:41,270 --> 00:53:41,280
or in the actual like
 

2891
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,349
or in the actual like
you remove eyesight for example or did

2892
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:43,359
you remove eyesight for example or did
 

2893
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,710
you remove eyesight for example or did
you well either way

2894
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:44,720
you well either way
 

2895
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,230
you well either way
i mean basically one way to limit

2896
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
i mean basically one way to limit
 

2897
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,470
i mean basically one way to limit
the inputs to your brain are to stay

2898
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:50,480
the inputs to your brain are to stay
 

2899
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:51,589
the inputs to your brain are to stay
home and

2900
00:53:51,589 --> 00:53:51,599
home and
 

2901
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,390
home and
protect yourself another way is to put

2902
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:54,400
protect yourself another way is to put
 

2903
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,030
protect yourself another way is to put
someone

2904
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:55,040
someone
 

2905
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:58,230
someone
in solitary confinement another way

2906
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:58,240
in solitary confinement another way
 

2907
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,150
in solitary confinement another way
is to stick them uh in a nursing home

2908
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:02,160
is to stick them uh in a nursing home
 

2909
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,309
is to stick them uh in a nursing home
another well not all nursing homes but

2910
00:54:04,309 --> 00:54:04,319
another well not all nursing homes but
 

2911
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:05,510
another well not all nursing homes but
you know

2912
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:05,520
you know
 

2913
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:08,829
you know
but there are some right which really

2914
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:08,839
but there are some right which really
 

2915
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:10,069
but there are some right which really
are

2916
00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:10,079
are
 

2917
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:11,670
are
some where peop people are somewhat

2918
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
some where peop people are somewhat
 

2919
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,670
some where peop people are somewhat
impoverished in the interactions the end

2920
00:54:13,670 --> 00:54:13,680
impoverished in the interactions the end
 

2921
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,150
impoverished in the interactions the end
this

2922
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:14,160
this
 

2923
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,069
this
sensory the variety of sensory

2924
00:54:16,069 --> 00:54:16,079
sensory the variety of sensory
 

2925
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,829
sensory the variety of sensory
stimulation that they get

2926
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:17,839
stimulation that they get
 

2927
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:21,030
stimulation that they get
another way is that you lose a sense

2928
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:21,040
another way is that you lose a sense
 

2929
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:23,589
another way is that you lose a sense
right but the point is i think that you

2930
00:54:23,589 --> 00:54:23,599
right but the point is i think that you
 

2931
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:24,470
right but the point is i think that you
know

2932
00:54:24,470 --> 00:54:24,480
know
 

2933
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,829
know
the human brain really

2934
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:27,839
the human brain really
 

2935
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:31,190
the human brain really
likes variety to to say it in a

2936
00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:31,200
likes variety to to say it in a
 

2937
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,230
likes variety to to say it in a
you know like a pro you know sort of

2938
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,240
you know like a pro you know sort of
 

2939
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:35,109
you know like a pro you know sort of
cartesian way

2940
00:54:35,109 --> 00:54:35,119
cartesian way
 

2941
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,549
cartesian way
you know variety is a good thing

2942
00:54:38,549 --> 00:54:38,559
you know variety is a good thing
 

2943
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,829
you know variety is a good thing
um for a brain and um

2944
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:41,839
um for a brain and um
 

2945
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,349
um for a brain and um
uh

2946
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:45,359

 

2947
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:48,630

there are risks that you take uh

2948
00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:48,640
there are risks that you take uh
 

2949
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:51,430
there are risks that you take uh
when you restrict uh what you expose

2950
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:51,440
when you restrict uh what you expose
 

2951
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,990
when you restrict uh what you expose
yourself to

2952
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000

 

2953
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,910

yeah you know there's always talk of

2954
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:55,920
yeah you know there's always talk of
 

2955
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,030
yeah you know there's always talk of
diversity

2956
00:54:57,030 --> 00:54:57,040
diversity
 

2957
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,670
diversity
the brain loves it to the fullest

2958
00:54:59,670 --> 00:54:59,680
the brain loves it to the fullest
 

2959
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,829
the brain loves it to the fullest
definition and degree of diversity

2960
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:01,839
definition and degree of diversity
 

2961
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,069
definition and degree of diversity
yeah i mean i would say the only thing

2962
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:04,079
yeah i mean i would say the only thing
 

2963
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,069
yeah i mean i would say the only thing
basically human brains thrive

2964
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:06,079
basically human brains thrive
 

2965
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:08,470
basically human brains thrive
on diversity the only place where we

2966
00:55:08,470 --> 00:55:08,480
on diversity the only place where we
 

2967
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,430
on diversity the only place where we
seem to have

2968
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:09,440
seem to have
 

2969
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,430
seem to have
difficulty with diversity is with each

2970
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:11,440
difficulty with diversity is with each
 

2971
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:13,030
difficulty with diversity is with each
other

2972
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
other
 

2973
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:15,430
other
right but we who wants to eat the same

2974
00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:15,440
right but we who wants to eat the same
 

2975
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,390
right but we who wants to eat the same
food every day

2976
00:55:16,390 --> 00:55:16,400
food every day
 

2977
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,230
food every day
you never would who wants to wear the

2978
00:55:18,230 --> 00:55:18,240
you never would who wants to wear the
 

2979
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,670
you never would who wants to wear the
same clothes every day i mean

2980
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:19,680
same clothes every day i mean
 

2981
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,510
same clothes every day i mean
my husband if you ask him to close his

2982
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:21,520
my husband if you ask him to close his
 

2983
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,630
my husband if you ask him to close his
eyes he won't be able to tell you what

2984
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:22,640
eyes he won't be able to tell you what
 

2985

he's wearing
 

2987
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:26,230
he's wearing
he's just right he'll buy seven shirts

2988
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,240
he's just right he'll buy seven shirts
 

2989
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,150
he's just right he'll buy seven shirts
of exactly the same style in different

2990
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,160
of exactly the same style in different
 

2991
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:28,789
of exactly the same style in different
colors

2992

colors
 

2993
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,710
colors
but they are in different colors right

2994
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:30,720
but they are in different colors right
 

2995
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,829
but they are in different colors right
it's not like how would you then

2996
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:32,839
it's not like how would you then
 

2997
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:35,750
it's not like how would you then
explain my brain which is

2998
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:35,760
explain my brain which is
 

2999
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:37,510
explain my brain which is
terrified of choice and therefore i wore

3000
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:37,520
terrified of choice and therefore i wore
 

3001
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:39,270
terrified of choice and therefore i wore
the same thing every time

3002
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:39,280
the same thing every time
 

3003
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,190
the same thing every time
well you must be getting your diversity

3004
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:41,200
well you must be getting your diversity
 

3005
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,950
well you must be getting your diversity
well first of all you are a fairly sharp

3006
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:42,960
well first of all you are a fairly sharp
 

3007
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:43,750
well first of all you are a fairly sharp
dresser so

3008
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:43,760
dresser so
 

3009
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,069
dresser so
there is that but um so you're getting

3010
00:55:46,069 --> 00:55:46,079
there is that but um so you're getting
 

3011
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,670
there is that but um so you're getting
some reinforcement progressing the way

3012
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:47,680
some reinforcement progressing the way
 

3013
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,309
some reinforcement progressing the way
that you do

3014
00:55:48,309 --> 00:55:48,319
that you do
 

3015
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,630
that you do
but well your brain must get diversity

3016
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:50,640
but well your brain must get diversity
 

3017
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,670
but well your brain must get diversity
in in other words

3018
00:55:51,670 --> 00:55:51,680
in in other words
 

3019
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,109
in in other words
in other places but i think we you know

3020
00:55:55,109 --> 00:55:55,119
in other places but i think we you know
 

3021
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,390
in other places but i think we you know
the the so there the two most expensive

3022
00:55:58,390 --> 00:55:58,400
the the so there the two most expensive
 

3023
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,750
the the so there the two most expensive
things your brain can do metabolically

3024
00:55:59,750 --> 00:55:59,760
things your brain can do metabolically
 

3025
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:00,789
things your brain can do metabolically
speaking

3026
00:56:00,789 --> 00:56:00,799
speaking
 

3027
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:04,789
speaking
is um is move your body

3028
00:56:04,789 --> 00:56:04,799
is um is move your body
 

3029
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,069
is um is move your body
um and uh learn something new

3030
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:08,079
um and uh learn something new
 

3031
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:11,510
um and uh learn something new
so novelty that is diversity

3032
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
so novelty that is diversity
 

3033
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,150
so novelty that is diversity
right comes at a cost a metabolic cost

3034
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:14,160
right comes at a cost a metabolic cost
 

3035
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:17,270
right comes at a cost a metabolic cost
but it's a cost it's an investment that

3036
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,280
but it's a cost it's an investment that
 

3037
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:21,109
but it's a cost it's an investment that
that gives returns and in general

00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,119
that gives returns and in general
 

3039
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:22,710
that gives returns and in general
people vary in how much they like

people vary in how much they like
 

3041
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:24,390

novelty unexpected things

00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:24,400
novelty unexpected things
 

3043
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,630
novelty unexpected things
some people really like it some people

some people really like it some people
 

3045
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:27,990
some people really like it some people
really don't like it and there's

3046
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:28,000
really don't like it and there's
 

3047
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,190
really don't like it and there's
everybody in between

3048
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:29,200
everybody in between
 

3049
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:31,670
everybody in between
but in general we don't eat the same

3050
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:31,680
but in general we don't eat the same
 

3051
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:32,710
but in general we don't eat the same
thing every day

thing every day
 

3053
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:35,589
thing every day
we don't usually do exactly the same

we don't usually do exactly the same

difficulty
uh with diversity in is

00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:46,720
uh with diversity in is
 

3067
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:49,270
uh with diversity in is
in each other and then we we have

3068
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:49,280
in each other and then we we have
 

3069
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,710
in each other and then we we have
considerable problems there

3070
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:50,720
considerable problems there
 

3071
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:54,069
considerable problems there
i would say as a species let me ask uh

00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,640
about it i think we know for sure it
 

3115
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:43,990
about it i think we know for sure it
doesn't have to be the

3116
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:44,000
doesn't have to be the
 

3117
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,910
doesn't have to be the
you know crappy version of anything but

3118
00:57:47,910 --> 00:57:47,920
you know crappy version of anything but
 

3119
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,990
you know crappy version of anything but
we definitely have a limited

3120
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:50,000
we definitely have a limited
 

3121
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,630
we definitely have a limited
we have we have a set of senses that are

3122
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:52,640
we have we have a set of senses that are
 

3123
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,030
we have we have a set of senses that are
limited in very physical ways

3124
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:55,040
limited in very physical ways
 

3125
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:56,710
limited in very physical ways
and we're clearly not perceiving

3126
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:56,720
and we're clearly not perceiving
 

3127
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,549
and we're clearly not perceiving
everything there is to perceive

3128
00:57:58,549 --> 00:57:58,559
everything there is to perceive
 

3129
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,950
everything there is to perceive
that's clear i mean it's just it's not

3130
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:00,960
that's clear i mean it's just it's not
 

3131
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,150
that's clear i mean it's just it's not
that hard we can't

3132
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:02,160
that hard we can't
 

3133
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,990
that hard we can't
without special why do we invent

3134
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:04,000
without special why do we invent
 

3135
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,750
without special why do we invent
scientific tools it's so that we can

3136
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:05,760
scientific tools it's so that we can
 

3137
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,670
scientific tools it's so that we can
overcome our senses and

3138
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:07,680
overcome our senses and
 

3139
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,349
overcome our senses and
and experience things that we couldn't

3140
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:09,359
and experience things that we couldn't
 

3141
00:58:09,359 --> 00:58:11,109
and experience things that we couldn't
otherwise whether they are

3142
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:11,119
otherwise whether they are
 

3143
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,190
otherwise whether they are
you know different parts of the uh

3144
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:13,200
you know different parts of the uh
 

3145
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,109
you know different parts of the uh
visual spectrum the light spectrum

3146
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
visual spectrum the light spectrum
 

3147
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,190
visual spectrum the light spectrum
or um things that are too

3148
00:58:17,190 --> 00:58:17,200
or um things that are too
 

3149
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,230
or um things that are too
microscopically

3150
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:18,240
microscopically
 

3151
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:21,109
microscopically
small for us to see or too far away for

3152
00:58:21,109 --> 00:58:21,119
small for us to see or too far away for
 

3153
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:22,390

so clearly we're only getting a slice

3156
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,000
so clearly we're only getting a slice
 

3157
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,789
so clearly we're only getting a slice
um and that slice

3158
00:58:30,789 --> 00:58:30,799
um and that slice
 

3159
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:35,190
um and that slice
you know the interesting or

3160
00:58:35,190 --> 00:58:35,200
you know the interesting or
 

3161
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,230
you know the interesting or
potentially sad thing about humans is

3162
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:38,240
potentially sad thing about humans is
 

3163
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,109
potentially sad thing about humans is
that we

3164
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:39,119
that we
 

3165
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,109
that we
whatever we experience we think there's

3166
00:58:41,109 --> 00:58:41,119
whatever we experience we think there's
 

3167
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,470
whatever we experience we think there's
a natural reason for experiencing it

3168
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480
a natural reason for experiencing it
 

3169
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,230
a natural reason for experiencing it
and we think it's obvious and natural

3170
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:46,240
and we think it's obvious and natural
 

3171
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:48,309
and we think it's obvious and natural
and it must be this way

3172
00:58:48,309 --> 00:58:48,319
and it must be this way
 

3173
00:58:48,319 --> 00:58:49,750
and it must be this way
and that all the other stuff isn't

3174
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:49,760
and that all the other stuff isn't
 

3175
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,670
and that all the other stuff isn't
important

3176
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:51,680
important
 

3177
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,630
important
and that's clearly not true many of the

3178
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:54,640
and that's clearly not true many of the
 

3179
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,390
and that's clearly not true many of the
things that we think of as natural

3180
00:58:56,390 --> 00:58:56,400
things that we think of as natural
 

3181
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:58,150
things that we think of as natural
are anything but we've cr they're

3182
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:58,160
are anything but we've cr they're
 

3183
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:01,030
are anything but we've cr they're
certainly real but we've created them

3184
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:01,040
certainly real but we've created them
 

3185
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,870
certainly real but we've created them
they certainly have very real impacts

3186
00:59:02,870 --> 00:59:02,880
they certainly have very real impacts
 

3187
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,190
they certainly have very real impacts
but we've created those impacts

3188
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:05,200
but we've created those impacts
 

3189
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,270
but we've created those impacts
and we also know that there are many

3190
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:07,280
and we also know that there are many
 

3191
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,789
and we also know that there are many
things outside of our awareness that

3192
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:08,799
things outside of our awareness that
 

3193
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,750
things outside of our awareness that
have

3194
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:09,760
have
 

3195
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,309
have
have tremendous influence on what we

3196
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
have tremendous influence on what we
 

3197
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:12,870
have tremendous influence on what we
experience

3198
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:12,880
experience
 

3199
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,750
experience
and what we do so there's no question

3200
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:15,760
and what we do so there's no question
 

3201
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:16,390
and what we do so there's no question
that that's

3202
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:16,400
that that's
 

3203
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,750
that that's
true i mean just it's it's um

3204
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:19,760
true i mean just it's it's um
 

3205
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,990
true i mean just it's it's um
but the extent is how fantastic really

3206
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:22,000
but the extent is how fantastic really
 

3207
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,750
but the extent is how fantastic really
the question is how fantastical is it

3208
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:23,760
the question is how fantastical is it
 

3209
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,430
the question is how fantastical is it
yeah like what you know a lot of people

3210
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:25,440
yeah like what you know a lot of people
 

3211
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:26,230
yeah like what you know a lot of people
ask me i'm

3212
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:26,240
ask me i'm
 

3213
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,910
ask me i'm
i'm not allowed to say this i think i'm

3214
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:27,920
i'm not allowed to say this i think i'm
 

3215
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:29,670
i'm not allowed to say this i think i'm
allowed to say this uh i've

3216
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:29,680
allowed to say this uh i've
 

3217
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,670
allowed to say this uh i've
eaten shrooms a couple times but i

3218
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:31,680
eaten shrooms a couple times but i
 

3219
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:33,109
eaten shrooms a couple times but i
haven't gone the full

3220
00:59:33,109 --> 00:59:33,119
haven't gone the full
 

3221
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:34,630
haven't gone the full
i'm talking to a few researchers and

3222
00:59:34,630 --> 00:59:34,640
i'm talking to a few researchers and
 

3223
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,710
i'm talking to a few researchers and
psychedelics it's an interesting

3224
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:36,720
psychedelics it's an interesting
 

3225
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,789
psychedelics it's an interesting
scientifically place like what is the

3226
00:59:38,789 --> 00:59:38,799
scientifically place like what is the
 

3227
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,950
scientifically place like what is the
portal you're entering when you take

3228
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:40,960
portal you're entering when you take
 

3229
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,030
portal you're entering when you take
psychedelics or another would ask is

3230
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:43,040
psychedelics or another would ask is
 

3231
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:43,670
psychedelics or another would ask is
like

3232
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:43,680
like
 

3233
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,309
like
dreams whatever so let me tell you what

3234
00:59:46,309 --> 00:59:46,319
dreams whatever so let me tell you what
 

3235
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:47,829
dreams whatever so let me tell you what
i think which is based on

3236
00:59:47,829 --> 00:59:47,839
i think which is based on
 

3237
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,150
i think which is based on
nothing like this is based on my life

3238
00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:50,160
nothing like this is based on my life
 

3239
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:51,430
nothing like this is based on my life
right so i don't

3240
00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:51,440
right so i don't
 

3241
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,349
right so i don't
your intuition it's based on my it's

3242
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:53,359
your intuition it's based on my it's
 

3243
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:54,710
your intuition it's based on my it's
based on my

3244
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:54,720
based on my
 

3245
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,670
based on my
i'm guessing now um based on what i do

3246
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:57,680
i'm guessing now um based on what i do
 

3247
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,230
i'm guessing now um based on what i do
know

3248
00:59:58,230 --> 00:59:58,240
know
 

3249
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,950
know
i would say but i think that well think

3250
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:00,960
i would say but i think that well think
 

3251
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:02,390
i would say but i think that well think
about what happens

3252
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:02,400
about what happens
 

3253
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,670
about what happens
so you're running your brain's running

3254
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:03,680
so you're running your brain's running
 

3255
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,270
so you're running your brain's running
this internal model right and it's all

3256
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:05,280
this internal model right and it's all
 

3257
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,630
this internal model right and it's all
outside of your awareness really

3258
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:06,640
outside of your awareness really
 

3259
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,390
outside of your awareness really
you see the you feel the products but

3260
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:08,400
you see the you feel the products but
 

3261
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,230
you see the you feel the products but
you don't you don't sense the

3262
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:10,240
you don't you don't sense the
 

3263
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,549
you don't you don't sense the
you have no awareness of the mechanics

3264
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:12,559
you have no awareness of the mechanics
 

3265
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:13,589
you have no awareness of the mechanics
of it right

3266
01:00:13,589 --> 01:00:13,599
of it right
 

3267
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,950
of it right
it's going on all the time um

3268
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:16,960
it's going on all the time um
 

3269
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:18,390
it's going on all the time um
and so one thing that's going on all the

3270
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:18,400
and so one thing that's going on all the
 

3271
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,710
and so one thing that's going on all the
time that you're completely unaware of

3272
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:20,720
time that you're completely unaware of
 

3273
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,270
time that you're completely unaware of
is that um when your brain your brain is

3274
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:23,280
is that um when your brain your brain is
 

3275
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,710
is that um when your brain your brain is
basically

3276
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:24,720
basically
 

3277
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:26,870
basically
asking itself figuratively speaking not

3278
01:00:26,870 --> 01:00:26,880
asking itself figuratively speaking not
 

3279
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,230
asking itself figuratively speaking not
literally right like

3280
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:28,240
literally right like
 

3281
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,549
literally right like
how is the scent given the last time i

3282
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:30,559
how is the scent given the last time i
 

3283
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,549
how is the scent given the last time i
was in this sensory array with this

3284
01:00:32,549 --> 01:00:32,559
was in this sensory array with this
 

3285
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,390
was in this sensory array with this
stuff going on in my body and i

3286
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:34,400
stuff going on in my body and i
 

3287
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,390
stuff going on in my body and i
and that this chain of events which just

3288
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:36,400
and that this chain of events which just
 

3289
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,670
and that this chain of events which just
occurred

3290
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:37,680
occurred
 

3291
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:40,549
occurred
what did i do next what did i feel next

01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:40,559
what did i do next what did i feel next
 

3293
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:41,990

it doesn't come up with one answer it

3296
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:43,680
it doesn't come up with one answer it
 

3297
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:45,670
it doesn't come up with one answer it
comes up with a distribution of it

3298
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:45,680
comes up with a distribution of it
 

3299
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,270
comes up with a distribution of it
possible answers

3300
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:47,280
possible answers
 

3301
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:49,109
possible answers
and then there has to be some selection

3302
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:49,119
and then there has to be some selection
 

3303
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,950
and then there has to be some selection
process and so you

3304
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:50,960
process and so you
 

3305
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,309
process and so you
have a network in your brain a

3306
01:00:54,309 --> 01:00:54,319
have a network in your brain a
 

3307
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,549
have a network in your brain a
subnetwork in your brain a population of

3308
01:00:56,549 --> 01:00:56,559
subnetwork in your brain a population of
 

3309
01:00:56,559 --> 01:00:57,589
subnetwork in your brain a population of
neurons

3310
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
neurons
 

3311
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,710
neurons
that helps to choose

01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:08,000
silly like that um this is not
 

3319
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,870
silly like that um this is not

3325
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:19,430

a a set of neurons that weighs

01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:22,880
the probabilities uh um um and and helps
 

3329
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:24,309
the probabilities uh um um and and helps
to select

that network is working all the time
 

3335
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:32,069
that network is working all the time
it's actually called the control network

3336
01:01:32,069 --> 01:01:32,079
it's actually called the control network
 

3337
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:34,069
it's actually called the control network
the executive control network or you can

3338
01:01:34,069 --> 01:01:34,079
the executive control network or you can
 

3339
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:35,750
the executive control network or you can
call it a fronto parietal

3340
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
call it a fronto parietal
 

3341
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,589
call it a fronto parietal
because the regions of the brain that

3342
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:37,599
because the regions of the brain that
 

3343
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,270
because the regions of the brain that
make it up or in the frontal lobe and

3344
01:01:39,270 --> 01:01:39,280
make it up or in the frontal lobe and
 

3345
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,030
make it up or in the frontal lobe and
the parietal lobe

the parietal lobe
 

3347
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,270
the parietal lobe
there are also parts that belong to the

there are also parts that belong to the
 

3349
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,789
there are also parts that belong to the
subcortical parts of your brain

subcortical parts of your brain
 

3351
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:46,150
subcortical parts of your brain
it doesn't really matter the point is

3352
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:46,160
it doesn't really matter the point is
 

3353
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:47,829
it doesn't really matter the point is
that that there is this network and it

3354
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:47,839
that that there is this network and it
 

3355
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,109
that that there is this network and it
is working all the time

01:01:49,109 --> 01:01:49,119
is working all the time
 

3357
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,710
is working all the time
whether or not you feel in control

whether or not you feel in control
whether or not you feel like you're

whether or not you feel like you're
 

3361
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:53,430
whether or not you feel like you're
expending effort doesn't really matter

3362
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:53,440
expending effort doesn't really matter

01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,950
expending effort doesn't really matter
it's on all the time

3364
01:01:54,950 --> 01:01:54,960
it's on all the time
 

3365
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,190
it's on all the time
except when you sleep when you sleep

3366
01:01:59,190 --> 01:01:59,200
except when you sleep when you sleep
 

3367
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,950
except when you sleep when you sleep
it's it's a little bit relaxed

3368
01:02:02,950 --> 01:02:02,960
it's it's a little bit relaxed
 

3369
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,549
it's it's a little bit relaxed
and so think about what's happening when

3370
01:02:04,549 --> 01:02:04,559
and so think about what's happening when
 

3371
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,710
and so think about what's happening when
you sleep when you sleep

3372
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:06,720
you sleep when you sleep
 

3373
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,829
you sleep when you sleep

01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,190
that's scary yeah but you fl you're
talking about like yeah

3434
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:15,200
talking about like yeah
 

3435
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:18,390
talking about like yeah
i fly my dreams and i'm way faster right

3436
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
i fly my dreams and i'm way faster right
 

3437
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,630
i fly my dreams and i'm way faster right
and you're better on my back way faster

3438
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:20,640
and you're better on my back way faster
 

3439
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:21,510
and you're better on my back way faster
um

3440
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:21,520
um
 

3441
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,950
um
now you can say well you know you never

3442
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:22,960
now you can say well you know you never
 

3443
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:24,950
now you can say well you know you never
flew in your life right it's conceptual

3444
01:03:24,950 --> 01:03:24,960
flew in your life right it's conceptual
 

3445
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:26,710
flew in your life right it's conceptual
combination i mean i've flown in an

3446
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:26,720
combination i mean i've flown in an
 

3447
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,309
combination i mean i've flown in an
airplane and i've seen birds fly and

3448
01:03:30,309 --> 01:03:30,319
airplane and i've seen birds fly and
 

3449
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,150
airplane and i've seen birds fly and
i've watched movies of people flying and

3450
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:32,160
i've watched movies of people flying and
 

3451
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,390
i've watched movies of people flying and
i know superman probably flies i don't

3452
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:34,400
i know superman probably flies i don't
 

3453
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:36,069
i know superman probably flies i don't
know if he flies faster on his back but

3454
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:36,079
know if he flies faster on his back but
 

3455
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,069
know if he flies faster on his back but
he's voice he's out of never he's lying

3456
01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:38,079
he's voice he's out of never he's lying
 

3457
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:39,589
he's voice he's out of never he's lying
on his front right but

3458
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
on his front right but
 

3459
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:41,430
on his front right but
yeah but anyways my point is that you

3460
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:41,440
yeah but anyways my point is that you
 

3461
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,029
yeah but anyways my point is that you
know all of this stuff

3462
01:03:43,029 --> 01:03:43,039
know all of this stuff
 

3463
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:46,710
know all of this stuff
really um all these experiences really

3464
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
really um all these experiences really
 

3465
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,710
really um all these experiences really
become part of your internal model

3466
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:48,720
become part of your internal model
 

3467
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,069
become part of your internal model
the thing is that when you're asleep

3468
01:03:52,069 --> 01:03:52,079
the thing is that when you're asleep
 

3469
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,510
the thing is that when you're asleep
your internal model is still being

3470
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:53,520
your internal model is still being
 

3471
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,589
your internal model is still being
constrained by your body

3472
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:55,599
constrained by your body
 

3473
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:57,349
constrained by your body
your your brain's always attached to

3474
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:57,359
your your brain's always attached to
 

3475
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:59,349
your your brain's always attached to
your body it's always

3476
01:03:59,349 --> 01:03:59,359
your body it's always
 

3477
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,029
your body it's always
receiving sense data from your body

3478
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:01,039
receiving sense data from your body
 

3479
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:03,589
receiving sense data from your body
you're mostly never aware of it

3480
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:03,599
you're mostly never aware of it
 

3481
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,109
you're mostly never aware of it
uh unless you run up the stairs uh or or

3482
01:04:07,109 --> 01:04:07,119
uh unless you run up the stairs uh or or
 

3483
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:07,670
uh unless you run up the stairs uh or or
you know

3484
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:07,680
you know
 

3485
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,029
you know
uh maybe you um are ill in some way

3486
01:04:11,029 --> 01:04:11,039
uh maybe you um are ill in some way
 

3487
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,789
uh maybe you um are ill in some way
but you're mostly not aware of it which

3488
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:12,799
but you're mostly not aware of it which
 

3489
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,230
but you're mostly not aware of it which
is a really good thing because if you

3490
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:14,240
is a really good thing because if you
 

3491
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,510
is a really good thing because if you
were

3492
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:15,520
were
 

3493
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,029
were
you know you'd never pay attention to

3494
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:17,039
you know you'd never pay attention to
 

3495
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:18,549
you know you'd never pay attention to
anything outside your own skin ever

3496
01:04:18,549 --> 01:04:18,559
anything outside your own skin ever
 

3497
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:18,950
anything outside your own skin ever
again

3498
01:04:18,950 --> 01:04:18,960
again
 

3499
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,789
again
like right now you seem like you're

3500
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:20,799
like right now you seem like you're
 

3501
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,950
like right now you seem like you're
sitting there very calmly but you have a

3502
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:22,960
sitting there very calmly but you have a
 

3503
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,430
sitting there very calmly but you have a
virtual whole thing drama right it's

3504
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:25,440
virtual whole thing drama right it's
 

3505
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,150
virtual whole thing drama right it's
like a

3506
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:26,160
like a
 

3507
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:28,710
like a
like a like an opera going on inside

3508
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
like a like an opera going on inside
 

3509
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,230
like a like an opera going on inside
your body

3510
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:30,240
your body
 

3511
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,430
your body
and so i think that one of the things

3512
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:33,440
and so i think that one of the things
 

3513
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,630
and so i think that one of the things
that happens

3514
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:34,640
that happens
 

3515
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:38,230
that happens
when people take psilocybin or

3516
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:38,240
when people take psilocybin or
 

3517
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,750
when people take psilocybin or
take uh you know ketamine for example

3518
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
take uh you know ketamine for example
 

3519
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,029
take uh you know ketamine for example
is that the tethers

3520
01:04:45,029 --> 01:04:45,039
is that the tethers
 

3521
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,309
is that the tethers
completely are completely removed yeah

3522
01:04:48,309 --> 01:04:48,319
completely are completely removed yeah
 

3523
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,029
completely are completely removed yeah
yeah that's fascinating and then and

3524
01:04:51,029 --> 01:04:51,039
yeah that's fascinating and then and
 

3525
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,190
yeah that's fascinating and then and
that's why it's helpful to have a guide

3526
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:53,200
that's why it's helpful to have a guide
 

3527
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,670
that's why it's helpful to have a guide
right because the guide is giving you

3528
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:55,680
right because the guide is giving you
 

3529
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:56,950
right because the guide is giving you
sense data

3530
01:04:56,950 --> 01:04:56,960
sense data
 

3531
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,990
sense data
to steer that internal model so that it

3532
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:00,000
to steer that internal model so that it
 

3533
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:00,630
to steer that internal model so that it
doesn't go

3534
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
doesn't go
 

3535
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,789
doesn't go
completely off the rails yeah i know

3536
01:05:02,789 --> 01:05:02,799
completely off the rails yeah i know
 

3537
01:05:02,799 --> 01:05:04,710
completely off the rails yeah i know
there's so again that wiring to

3538
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:04,720
there's so again that wiring to
 

3539
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,670
there's so again that wiring to
the other brain that's the guide is at

3540
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:07,680
the other brain that's the guide is at
 

3541
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:08,069
the other brain that's the guide is at
least

3542
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:08,079
least
 

3543
01:05:08,079 --> 01:05:11,190
least
a tiny little tether exactly yeah

3544
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
a tiny little tether exactly yeah
 

3545
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,069
a tiny little tether exactly yeah
let's talk about emotion a little bit if

3546
01:05:14,069 --> 01:05:14,079
let's talk about emotion a little bit if
 

3547
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:14,870
let's talk about emotion a little bit if
we could

3548
01:05:14,870 --> 01:05:14,880
we could
 

3549
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,990
we could
emotion comes up often and i have never

3550
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:18,000
emotion comes up often and i have never
 

3551
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,670
emotion comes up often and i have never
spoken with anybody who um

3552
01:05:21,670 --> 01:05:21,680
spoken with anybody who um
 

3553
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,950
spoken with anybody who um
who has a clarity about emotion from a

3554
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:24,960
who has a clarity about emotion from a
 

3555
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,069
who has a clarity about emotion from a
biological and

3556
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:26,079
biological and
 

3557
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,109
biological and
neuroscience perspective that you do

3558
01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:29,119
neuroscience perspective that you do
 

3559
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,630
neuroscience perspective that you do
and i'm not sure i fully

3560
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:32,640
and i'm not sure i fully
 

3561
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,390
and i'm not sure i fully
know how to as a as a i mentioned this

3562
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:36,400
know how to as a as a i mentioned this
 

3563
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,230
know how to as a as a i mentioned this
way too much but as somebody who was

3564
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:38,240
way too much but as somebody who was
 

3565
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:39,910
way too much but as somebody who was
born in the soviet union

3566
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:39,920
born in the soviet union
 

3567
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:42,390
born in the soviet union
and romanticizes basically everything

3568
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:42,400
and romanticizes basically everything
 

3569
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,029
and romanticizes basically everything
talks about

3570
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:43,039
talks about
 

3571
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,789
talks about
love non-stop you know emotion is a

3572
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:46,799
love non-stop you know emotion is a
 

3573
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:49,190
love non-stop you know emotion is a
i don't know what to make of it i don't

3574
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,200
i don't know what to make of it i don't
 

3575
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,950
i don't know what to make of it i don't
know

3576
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:50,960
know
 

3577
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:53,750
know
so maybe uh let's just try to talk about

3578
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:53,760
so maybe uh let's just try to talk about
 

3579
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,029
so maybe uh let's just try to talk about
it i mean from a neuroscience

3580
01:05:55,029 --> 01:05:55,039
it i mean from a neuroscience
 

3581
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:56,309
it i mean from a neuroscience
perspective

3582
01:05:56,309 --> 01:05:56,319
perspective
 

3583
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,390
perspective
we talked about a little bit last time

3584
01:05:58,390 --> 01:05:58,400
we talked about a little bit last time
 

3585
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,390
we talked about a little bit last time
your book covers it how emotions are

3586
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:00,400
your book covers it how emotions are
 

3587
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,270
your book covers it how emotions are
made but

3588
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:01,280
made but
 

3589
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,390
made but
what are some misconceptions we writers

3590
01:06:04,390 --> 01:06:04,400
what are some misconceptions we writers
 

3591
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,150
what are some misconceptions we writers
of poetry

3592
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:06,160

yeah so there is a common view of

in the west the caricature
of that view is that um

3612
01:06:30,549 --> 01:06:30,559
of that view is that um
 

3613
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,270
of that view is that um
you know we have an inner beast right

3614

you know we have an inner beast right
 

3615
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,270
you know we have an inner beast right
your limbic system

3616
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:35,280
your limbic system
 

3617
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:38,390
your limbic system
your your inner lizard um we have an

3618
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:38,400
your your inner lizard um we have an
 

3619
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,270
your your inner lizard um we have an

inner beast
 

3621
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:41,589
inner beast
and that comes baked in to the brain at

3622
01:06:41,589 --> 01:06:41,599
and that comes baked in to the brain at
 

3623
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,589
and that comes baked in to the brain at
birth so you've got circuits for anger

3624
01:06:43,589 --> 01:06:43,599
birth so you've got circuits for anger
 

3625
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,510
birth so you've got circuits for anger
atmosphere it's interesting that they

3626
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:45,520
atmosphere it's interesting that they
 

3627
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,910
atmosphere it's interesting that they
all have english names these circles

3628
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:47,920
all have english names these circles
 

3629
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,630
all have english names these circles
but um that that and they're there and

3630
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:50,640
but um that that and they're there and
 

3631
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:52,710
but um that that and they're there and
they're triggered by things in the world

3632
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:52,720
they're triggered by things in the world
 

3633
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:55,829
they're triggered by things in the world
and um then they cause you to do and say

3634
01:06:55,829 --> 01:06:55,839
and um then they cause you to do and say
 

3635

and
 

3637
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,710
and
you know so when your fear circuit is

3638
01:06:58,710 --> 01:06:58,720
you know so when your fear circuit is
 

3639
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:01,109
you know so when your fear circuit is
triggered you widen your eyes

3640
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:01,119
triggered you widen your eyes
 

3641
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:05,670
triggered you widen your eyes
you gasp your

3642
01:07:05,670 --> 01:07:05,680

 

3643
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:08,230

heart rate goes up you prepare to flee

3644
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:08,240
heart rate goes up you prepare to flee
 

3645
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:09,990
heart rate goes up you prepare to flee

these are modal responses they're not

these are modal responses they're not
 

3651
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,190
these are modal responses they're not
the only responses that you give but on

01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,200
the only responses that you give but on
 

3653
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,710
the only responses that you give but on
average they're the prototypical

responses
 

3657
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,829
responses
that's the view and um

3658
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839
that's the view and um
 

3659
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,750
that's the view and um
that's the view of emotion in the law

3660
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:25,760
that's the view of emotion in the law
 

3661
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:27,430
that's the view of emotion in the law
that's the view

3662
01:07:27,430 --> 01:07:27,440
that's the view
 

3663
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,549
that's the view
you know that emotions are these

3664
01:07:28,549 --> 01:07:28,559
you know that emotions are these
 

3665
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,950
you know that emotions are these
profoundly unhelpful things

3666
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:30,960
profoundly unhelpful things
 

3667
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,270
profoundly unhelpful things
that are obligatory kind of like

3668
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:33,280
that are obligatory kind of like
 

3669
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:37,670
that are obligatory kind of like
reflexes

3670
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:37,680

 

3671
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:40,870

the problem with that view is that it

3672
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:40,880
the problem with that view is that it
 

3673
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,390
the problem with that view is that it
doesn't comport to the

3674
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
doesn't comport to the
 

3675
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:46,230
doesn't comport to the
evidence um and it doesn't really matter

3676
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:46,240
evidence um and it doesn't really matter
 

3677
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:47,670
evidence um and it doesn't really matter
the evidence actually lines up

3678
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:47,680
the evidence actually lines up
 

3679
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:49,349
the evidence actually lines up
beautifully with each other it just

3680
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:49,359
beautifully with each other it just
 

3681
01:07:49,359 --> 01:07:50,870
beautifully with each other it just
doesn't line up with that view and it

3682
01:07:50,870 --> 01:07:50,880
doesn't line up with that view and it
 

3683
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:51,910
doesn't line up with that view and it
doesn't matter whether you're measuring

3684
01:07:51,910 --> 01:07:51,920
doesn't matter whether you're measuring
 

3685
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:53,109
doesn't matter whether you're measuring
people's faces

people's faces
 

3687
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:54,309

their body movements or measuring their

01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:05,750
output that you want to measure and you
know any system you want to measure and

you don't
 

3703
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,109
you don't
really find strong evidence for this and

3704
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:09,119
really find strong evidence for this and
 

3705

you know remote cultures which are
 

3727
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:37,349
you know remote cultures which are
very different from urban

large-scale cultures like ours and
 

3731
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:43,590
large-scale cultures like ours and
one culture that we visited and i say we

one culture that we visited and i say we
 

3733
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:44,870
one culture that we visited and i say we
euphemistically because

01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:44,880
euphemistically because
 

3735

i i myself didn't go because i only had
 

3737
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:49,829
i i myself didn't go because i only had
two research permits

3738
01:08:49,829 --> 01:08:49,839
two research permits
 

3739
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:52,470
two research permits
and i gave them to my students because i

3740
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:52,480
and i gave them to my students because i
 

3741
01:08:52,480 --> 01:08:54,070
and i gave them to my students because i
felt like it was

3742
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:54,080
felt like it was
 

3743
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,229
felt like it was
better for them to have that experience

3744
01:08:56,229 --> 01:08:56,239
better for them to have that experience
 

3745
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,910
better for them to have that experience
and more formative for them to have that

3746

things
and through a lot of reading and a lot

the hypothesis that the brain

3820
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
the hypothesis that the brain
 

3821
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,870
the hypothesis that the brain
is constructing these instances out of

01:10:26,870 --> 01:10:26,880
is constructing these instances out of
 

3823
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,189
is constructing these instances out of
more basic ingredients

01:10:29,189 --> 01:10:29,199
more basic ingredients
 

3825
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,229
more basic ingredients
so when i tell you that the brain when i

3826
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:32,239
so when i tell you that the brain when i
 

3827
01:10:32,239 --> 01:10:33,590
so when i tell you that the brain when i
suggest you that what your brain is

3828
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:33,600
suggest you that what your brain is
 

3829
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,070
suggest you that what your brain is
doing

3830
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,080
doing
 

3831
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,830
doing
is making a prediction and it's asking

01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:37,840
is making a prediction and it's asking
 

3833
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:40,870
is making a prediction and it's asking

01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:44,070
the last time i was in this situation
and

3838
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
and
 

3839
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,870
and
this you know physical state what did i

3840
01:10:46,870 --> 01:10:46,880
this you know physical state what did i
 

3841
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:48,790
this you know physical state what did i
do next what did i see next what did i

3842
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:48,800
do next what did i see next what did i
 

3843
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,910
do next what did i see next what did i
hear next

3844
01:10:49,910 --> 01:10:49,920
hear next
 

3845
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,750

it's basically asking what in my past is

3846
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:53,760
it's basically asking what in my past is
 

3847
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,030
it's basically asking what in my past is
similar to the present

3848
01:10:59,030 --> 01:10:59,040
similar to the present
 

3849
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,390
similar to the present
things which are similar to one another

3850
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:02,400
things which are similar to one another
 

3851
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,070
things which are similar to one another
are called a category

3852
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:06,080

 

3853
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:07,350

a group of things which are similar to

3854
01:11:07,350 --> 01:11:07,360
a group of things which are similar to
 

3855
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:09,350
a group of things which are similar to
one another as a category

3856
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
one another as a category
 

3857
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,870
one another as a category
and a mental representation of a

3858
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:10,880
and a mental representation of a
 

3859
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:14,470
and a mental representation of a
category is a concept

3860
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:14,480
category is a concept
 

3861
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,630
category is a concept
so your brain is constructing categories

3862
01:11:16,630 --> 01:11:16,640
so your brain is constructing categories
 

3863
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:19,430
so your brain is constructing categories
or concepts on the fly continuously

3864
01:11:19,430 --> 01:11:19,440
or concepts on the fly continuously
 

3865
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,630
or concepts on the fly continuously
so you really want to understand what a

3866
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:20,640
so you really want to understand what a
 

3867
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,630
so you really want to understand what a
brain is doing you don't

3868
01:11:22,630 --> 01:11:22,640
brain is doing you don't
 

3869
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:23,830
brain is doing you don't
using machine learning like

3870
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:23,840
using machine learning like
 

3871
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:25,830
using machine learning like
classification models is not going to

3872
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:25,840
classification models is not going to
 

3873
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:27,270
classification models is not going to
help you because the brain doesn't

3874
01:11:27,270 --> 01:11:27,280
help you because the brain doesn't
 

3875
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:29,030
help you because the brain doesn't
classify it's doing category

3876
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:29,040
classify it's doing category
 

3877
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,110
classify it's doing category
construction

3878
01:11:31,110 --> 01:11:31,120
construction
 

3879
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,149
construction
and the categories change or you could

3880
01:11:34,149 --> 01:11:34,159
and the categories change or you could
 

3881
01:11:34,159 --> 01:11:35,830
and the categories change or you could
say it's doing concept construction it's

3882
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:35,840
say it's doing concept construction it's
 

3883
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,750
say it's doing concept construction it's
using past experience to

3884
01:11:37,750 --> 01:11:37,760
using past experience to
 

3885
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,430
using past experience to
conjure a concept which is a prediction

3886
01:11:43,430 --> 01:11:43,440

 

3887
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,830

and if it's using past experiences of

3888
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
and if it's using past experiences of
 

3889
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,510
and if it's using past experiences of
emotion

3890
01:11:47,510 --> 01:11:47,520
emotion
 

3891
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:49,270
emotion
then it's constructing an emotion

3892
01:11:49,270 --> 01:11:49,280
then it's constructing an emotion
 

3893
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:52,390
then it's constructing an emotion
concept

3894
01:11:52,390 --> 01:11:52,400

 

3895
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:55,669

your concept will

3896
01:11:55,669 --> 01:11:55,679
your concept will
 

3897
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,270
your concept will
be the content of it is

3898
01:11:59,270 --> 01:11:59,280
be the content of it is
 

3899
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:02,310
be the content of it is
ism changes

3900
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:02,320
ism changes
 

3901
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:03,910
ism changes
depending on the situation that you're

3902
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:03,920
depending on the situation that you're
 

3903
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,669
depending on the situation that you're
in so for example if your brain

3904
01:12:05,669 --> 01:12:05,679
in so for example if your brain
 

3905
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:08,870
in so for example if your brain
uses past experiences of anger that you

3906
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:08,880
uses past experiences of anger that you
 

3907
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:13,270
uses past experiences of anger that you
have learned either because somebody

3908
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,280
have learned either because somebody
 

3909
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,430
have learned either because somebody
labeled them for you taught them to you

3910
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:15,440
labeled them for you taught them to you
 

3911
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:17,110
labeled them for you taught them to you
you observed them

3912
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:17,120
you observed them
 

3913
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:20,390
you observed them
in movies and so on in one situation

3914
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:20,400
in movies and so on in one situation
 

3915
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:21,669
in movies and so on in one situation
could be very different from your

3916
01:12:21,669 --> 01:12:21,679
could be very different from your
 

3917
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:22,310
could be very different from your
concept

3918
01:12:22,310 --> 01:12:22,320
concept
 

3919
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,950
concept
of for anger than another situation and

3920
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:24,960
of for anger than another situation and
 

3921
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,709
of for anger than another situation and
this is how

3922
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:26,719
this is how
 

3923
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:29,830
this is how
anger instances of anger are

3924
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:29,840
anger instances of anger are
 

3925
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:31,750
anger instances of anger are
what we call a population of variable

3926
01:12:31,750 --> 01:12:31,760
what we call a population of variable
 

3927
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:33,030
what we call a population of variable

instances
 

3929
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,270
instances
sometimes when you're angry you scowl

3930
01:12:35,270 --> 01:12:35,280
sometimes when you're angry you scowl
 

3931

sometimes when you're angry you scowl
sometimes when you're angry

sometimes when you're angry
 

3933
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:39,990
sometimes when you're angry
you might smile sometimes when you're

3934
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:40,000
you might smile sometimes when you're
 

3935
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,030
you might smile sometimes when you're

angry
 

3937
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,590
angry
you might cry sometimes your heart rate

3938
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:43,600
you might cry sometimes your heart rate
 

3939
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,229
you might cry sometimes your heart rate
will go up

3940
01:12:44,229 --> 01:12:44,239
will go up
 

3941
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,870
will go up
it will go down it will stay the same it

3942
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:46,880
it will go down it will stay the same it
 

3943
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:48,709
it will go down it will stay the same it
depends on what action you're about to

3944
01:12:48,709 --> 01:12:48,719
depends on what action you're about to
 

3945
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:49,430
depends on what action you're about to
take

take
 

3947
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:52,070
take
because the way predict and i should say

because the way predict and i should say

01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:54,470
because the way predict and i should say
the idea that

3950
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:54,480
the idea that
 

3951
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,510
the idea that
physiology is yoked to action is a very

3952

physiology is yoked to action is a very
 

3953
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:58,470
physiology is yoked to action is a very
old idea

3954
01:12:58,470 --> 01:12:58,480
old idea
 

3955
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,110
old idea
in in uh the study of the peripheral

3956
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:01,120
in in uh the study of the peripheral
 

3957
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,870
in in uh the study of the peripheral
nervous system that's been known for

nervous system that's been known for
 

3959
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:06,070
nervous system that's been known for
really decades and so

3960
01:13:06,070 --> 01:13:06,080
really decades and so
 

3961
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:07,669
really decades and so
if you look at what the brain is doing

3962
01:13:07,669 --> 01:13:07,679
if you look at what the brain is doing
 

3963
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:09,270
if you look at what the brain is doing
if you just look at the anatomy

3964
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:09,280
if you just look at the anatomy
 

3965
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,350
if you just look at the anatomy
and you what here's the hypothesis that

3966
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:11,360
and you what here's the hypothesis that
 

3967
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,870
and you what here's the hypothesis that
you would that you would come up with

3968
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:12,880
you would that you would come up with

i've published these details in in
scientific papers and they also appear

01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:05,750
right a flush of of cortisol
which is not a stress hormone it's a

which is not a stress hormone it's a
 

4017
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,430
which is not a stress hormone it's a
hormone that gets glucose into your

bloodstream
 

4021
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:10,709
bloodstream
very fast because your brain is

4022
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
very fast because your brain is
 

4023
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,110
very fast because your brain is
predicting you need to do something

4024
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:13,120
predicting you need to do something
 

4025
01:14:13,120 --> 01:14:16,630

expensive and so so either that means

4028
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
expensive and so so either that means
 

4029
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,990
expensive and so so either that means
either move

4030
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:22,000
either move
 

4031
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,350
either move
or learn okay and

4032
01:14:25,350 --> 01:14:25,360
or learn okay and
 

4033
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:28,550
or learn okay and
so your brain is preparing your body the

4034
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:28,560
so your brain is preparing your body the
 

4035
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:30,390
so your brain is preparing your body the
internal systems of your body

4036
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:30,400
internal systems of your body
 

4037
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:33,669
internal systems of your body
to execute some actions to move in some

01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:39,760
and the and then it infers
 

4043
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,189
and the and then it infers
based on those motor predictions and

4044
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:43,199
based on those motor predictions and
 

4045
01:14:43,199 --> 01:14:45,110
based on those motor predictions and
what we call visceral motor predictions

4046
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:45,120
what we call visceral motor predictions
 

4047
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:46,149
what we call visceral motor predictions
meaning the

4048
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:46,159
meaning the
 

4049
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,110
meaning the
the the changes in the viscera that your

01:14:57,510 --> 01:14:57,520
your brain makes an inference about
 

4057
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:00,550
your brain makes an inference about
what you will sense based on those motor

01:15:05,350 --> 01:15:05,360
so your experience of the world
 

4063
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,350
so your experience of the world
and your experience of your own body

4064
01:15:09,350 --> 01:15:09,360
and your experience of your own body
 

4065
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:11,830
and your experience of your own body
are a consequence of those predictions

those
 

4069
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:15,350
those
concepts when your brain makes a concept

for emotion
 

4073
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:20,070
for emotion
it's constructing an instance of that

01:15:36,390 --> 01:15:36,400
outside the body
 

4089
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:39,350
outside the body
i mean it includes other humans so just

4090
01:15:39,350 --> 01:15:39,360
i mean it includes other humans so just
 

4091
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:42,149
i mean it includes other humans so just
this construction of a concept

4092
01:15:42,149 --> 01:15:42,159
this construction of a concept
 

4093
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:45,750
this construction of a concept
includes the variables that are much

4094
01:15:45,750 --> 01:15:45,760
includes the variables that are much
 

4095
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:46,870
includes the variables that are much
richer than just

4096
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
richer than just
 

4097
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:51,110
richer than just
some sort of um simple notion

4098
01:15:51,110 --> 01:15:51,120
some sort of um simple notion
 

4099
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,709
some sort of um simple notion
yeah so our colloquial notion of a

4100
01:15:52,709 --> 01:15:52,719
yeah so our colloquial notion of a
 

4101
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,390
yeah so our colloquial notion of a
concept where

4102
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:54,400
concept where
 

4103
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:58,229
concept where
um you know um

4104
01:15:58,229 --> 01:15:58,239
um you know um
 

4105
01:15:58,239 --> 01:15:59,910
um you know um
where i say well what's the concept of a

4106
01:15:59,910 --> 01:15:59,920
where i say well what's the concept of a
 

4107
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,990
where i say well what's the concept of a
bird and then you list a set of features

4108
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
bird and then you list a set of features
 

4109
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,709
bird and then you list a set of features
off to me

4110
01:16:02,709 --> 01:16:02,719
off to me
 

4111
01:16:02,719 --> 01:16:04,550
off to me
that's that's people's understanding you

4112
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
that's that's people's understanding you
 

4113
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,990
that's that's people's understanding you
know typically of what a concept is but

4114
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:06,000
know typically of what a concept is but
 

4115
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:09,189
know typically of what a concept is but
if you go uh into the literature

4116
01:16:09,189 --> 01:16:09,199
if you go uh into the literature
 

4117
01:16:09,199 --> 01:16:11,350
if you go uh into the literature
in um cognitive science what you'll see

4118
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,360
in um cognitive science what you'll see
 

4119
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:13,030
in um cognitive science what you'll see
is that the way

4120
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:13,040
is that the way
 

4121
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,870
is that the way
that scientists have understood what a

4122
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:14,880
that scientists have understood what a
 

4123
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,030
that scientists have understood what a
concept is has really changed over the

4124
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:17,040
concept is has really changed over the
 

4125
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:17,990
concept is has really changed over the
years so

4126
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:18,000
years so
 

4127
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,790
years so
people used to think about a concept as

4128
01:16:20,790 --> 01:16:20,800
people used to think about a concept as
 

4129
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,750
people used to think about a concept as
um

4130
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:21,760
um
 

4131
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,270
um
philosophers and scientists used to

4132
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:23,280
philosophers and scientists used to
 

4133
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:25,350
philosophers and scientists used to
think about a concept as a dictionary

4134
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,360
think about a concept as a dictionary
 

4135
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,350
think about a concept as a dictionary
definition for a category

4136
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
definition for a category
 

4137
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:28,790
definition for a category
so there's a set of things which are

4138
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:28,800
so there's a set of things which are
 

4139
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:31,270
so there's a set of things which are
similar out in the world

4140
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:31,280
similar out in the world
 

4141
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:34,790
similar out in the world
and um your concept

4142
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:34,800
and um your concept
 

4143
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,590
and um your concept
for for that category is a dictionary

4144
01:16:37,590 --> 01:16:37,600
for for that category is a dictionary
 

4145
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:39,110
for for that category is a dictionary
definition of the features

4146
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:39,120
definition of the features
 

4147
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,550
definition of the features
right the necessary insufficient

4148
01:16:40,550 --> 01:16:40,560
right the necessary insufficient
 

4149
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:44,390
right the necessary insufficient
features of that of those instances so

4150
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:44,400
features of that of those instances so
 

4151
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,590
features of that of those instances so
for a bird um you know would be

4152
01:16:47,590 --> 01:16:47,600
for a bird um you know would be
 

4153
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,870
for a bird um you know would be
wings feathers right a beak yeah it

4154
01:16:50,870 --> 01:16:50,880
wings feathers right a beak yeah it
 

4155
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:51,990
wings feathers right a beak yeah it
flies whatever

4156
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:52,000
flies whatever
 

4157
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,149
flies whatever
okay um that's called the classical

4158
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:54,159
okay um that's called the classical
 

4159
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:55,590
okay um that's called the classical
category

4160
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:55,600
category
 

4161
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,470
category
and scientists discovered observed that

4162
01:16:58,470 --> 01:16:58,480
and scientists discovered observed that
 

4163
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,310
and scientists discovered observed that
actually

4164
01:17:00,310 --> 01:17:00,320
actually
 

4165
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,709
actually
not all instances of birds have feathers

4166
01:17:02,709 --> 01:17:02,719
not all instances of birds have feathers
 

4167
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,630
not all instances of birds have feathers
and not all instances of birds

4168
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:04,640
and not all instances of birds
 

4169
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:08,229
and not all instances of birds
fly and so the idea was that you don't

4170
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
fly and so the idea was that you don't
 

4171
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:09,110
fly and so the idea was that you don't
have a single

4172
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:09,120
have a single
 

4173
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:11,030
have a single
representation of necessary and

4174
01:17:11,030 --> 01:17:11,040
representation of necessary and
 

4175
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,550
representation of necessary and
sufficient features stored in your brain

4176
01:17:12,550 --> 01:17:12,560
sufficient features stored in your brain
 

4177
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,229
sufficient features stored in your brain
somewhere instead what you have

4178
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:14,239
somewhere instead what you have
 

4179
01:17:14,239 --> 01:17:17,270
somewhere instead what you have
is a prototype a prototype meaning

4180
01:17:17,270 --> 01:17:17,280
is a prototype a prototype meaning
 

4181
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:18,709
is a prototype a prototype meaning
um you still have a single

4182
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
um you still have a single
 

4183
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,310
um you still have a single
representation for the category

4184
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:20,320
representation for the category
 

4185
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:24,149
representation for the category
one um but the features

4186
01:17:24,149 --> 01:17:24,159
one um but the features
 

4187
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:27,189
one um but the features
are like of the most typical instance of

4188
01:17:27,189 --> 01:17:27,199
are like of the most typical instance of
 

4189
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,950
are like of the most typical instance of
the category or maybe the most frequent

4190
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:28,960
the category or maybe the most frequent
 

4191
01:17:28,960 --> 01:17:30,229
the category or maybe the most frequent
instance but not all

4192
01:17:30,229 --> 01:17:30,239
instance but not all
 

4193
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:32,070
instance but not all
instances of the category have all the

4194
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:32,080
instances of the category have all the
 

4195
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,669
instances of the category have all the
features right they they have some

4196
01:17:33,669 --> 01:17:33,679
features right they they have some
 

4197
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:35,110
features right they they have some
graded similarity

4198
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:35,120
graded similarity
 

4199
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:38,550
graded similarity
to the prototype

4200
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:38,560

 

4201
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,870

and then uh you know

4202
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:42,880
and then uh you know
 

4203
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,990
and then uh you know
what um

4204
01:17:45,990 --> 01:17:46,000
what um
 

4205
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,390
what um
i'm gonna like incredibly simplify now a

4206
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:48,400
i'm gonna like incredibly simplify now a
 

4207
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:49,270
i'm gonna like incredibly simplify now a
lot of work

4208
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:49,280
lot of work
 

4209
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:52,229
lot of work
to say that then a series of experiments

4210
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:52,239
to say that then a series of experiments
 

4211
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:52,870
to say that then a series of experiments
were done

4212
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:52,880
were done
 

4213
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:55,910
were done
to show that in fact

4214
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:55,920
to show that in fact
 

4215
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:57,990
to show that in fact
what your brain seems to be doing is

4216
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,000
what your brain seems to be doing is
 

4217
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,110
what your brain seems to be doing is
coming up with a single

4218
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
coming up with a single
 

4219
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,990
coming up with a single
exemplar or instance of the category and

4220
01:18:03,990 --> 01:18:04,000
exemplar or instance of the category and
 

4221
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,070
exemplar or instance of the category and
reading off

4222
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
reading off
 

4223
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,590
reading off
the um features when i ask you for the

4224
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:09,600
the um features when i ask you for the
 

4225
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:10,950
the um features when i ask you for the
concept

4226
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:10,960
concept
 

4227
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,669
concept
so if we were in a pet store

4228
01:18:15,669 --> 01:18:15,679
so if we were in a pet store
 

4229
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:19,350
so if we were in a pet store
and i asked you what are the features of

4230
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:19,360
and i asked you what are the features of
 

4231
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,830
and i asked you what are the features of
a bird tell me the concept of bird

4232
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:21,840
a bird tell me the concept of bird
 

4233
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:24,149
a bird tell me the concept of bird
you would be more likely to give me

4234
01:18:24,149 --> 01:18:24,159
you would be more likely to give me
 

4235
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,270
you would be more likely to give me
features of a good

4236
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:25,280
features of a good
 

4237
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,110
features of a good
pet and if we were in a restaurant

4238
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:29,120
pet and if we were in a restaurant
 

4239
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:31,030
pet and if we were in a restaurant
you would be more likely you know like a

4240
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:31,040
you would be more likely you know like a
 

4241
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,149
you would be more likely you know like a
budgie right or

4242
01:18:32,149 --> 01:18:32,159
budgie right or
 

4243
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,070
budgie right or
a canary if we were in a restaurant you

4244
01:18:34,070 --> 01:18:34,080
a canary if we were in a restaurant you
 

4245
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:35,669
a canary if we were in a restaurant you
would be more likely to give me the

4246
01:18:35,669 --> 01:18:35,679
would be more likely to give me the
 

4247
01:18:35,679 --> 01:18:36,390
would be more likely to give me the
features

4248
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:36,400
features
 

4249
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:38,070
features
of a bird that you would eat like a

4250
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:38,080
of a bird that you would eat like a
 

4251
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:40,310
of a bird that you would eat like a
chicken and if we were in a park you'd

4252
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:40,320
chicken and if we were in a park you'd
 

4253
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:41,990
chicken and if we were in a park you'd
be more likely

4254
01:18:41,990 --> 01:18:42,000
be more likely
 

4255
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,510
be more likely
to give me uh in this country

4256
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:45,520
to give me uh in this country
 

4257
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,070
to give me uh in this country
uh you know the features of a sparrow or

4258
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:48,080
uh you know the features of a sparrow or
 

4259
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,030
uh you know the features of a sparrow or
a robin

4260
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
a robin
 

4261
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:50,870
a robin
whereas if we were in south america you

4262
01:18:50,870 --> 01:18:50,880
whereas if we were in south america you
 

4263
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,950
whereas if we were in south america you
would probably give me the features

4264
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:52,960
would probably give me the features
 

4265
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:57,030
would probably give me the features
of a peacock because that's more common

4266
01:18:57,030 --> 01:18:57,040
of a peacock because that's more common
 

4267
01:18:57,040 --> 01:18:58,870
of a peacock because that's more common
or it's or it is more common there than

4268
01:18:58,870 --> 01:18:58,880
or it's or it is more common there than
 

4269
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:00,550
or it's or it is more common there than
here that you would see a peacock in

4270
01:19:00,550 --> 01:19:00,560
here that you would see a peacock in
 

4271
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,630
here that you would see a peacock in
such circumstances so

4272
01:19:02,630 --> 01:19:02,640
such circumstances so
 

4273
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,110
such circumstances so
the idea was that really what your brain

4274
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
the idea was that really what your brain
 

4275
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,830
the idea was that really what your brain
was doing

4276
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:06,840
was doing
 

4277
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:09,750
was doing
was conjuring

4278
01:19:09,750 --> 01:19:09,760
was conjuring
 

4279
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,189
was conjuring
a concept on the fly that meets the

4280
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:13,199
a concept on the fly that meets the
 

4281
01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:14,630
a concept on the fly that meets the
function

4282
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
function
 

4283
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,310
function
that the category is being put to

4284
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:18,320
that the category is being put to
 

4285
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,350
that the category is being put to
okay yep okay

4286
01:19:21,350 --> 01:19:21,360
okay yep okay
 

4287
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,030
okay yep okay
then people started studying

4288
01:19:25,030 --> 01:19:25,040
then people started studying
 

4289
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:28,390
then people started studying
ad hoc concepts meaning

4290
01:19:28,390 --> 01:19:28,400
ad hoc concepts meaning
 

4291
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,070
ad hoc concepts meaning
um concepts that where the instances

4292
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:32,080
um concepts that where the instances
 

4293
01:19:32,080 --> 01:19:33,510
um concepts that where the instances
don't share

4294
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
don't share
 

4295
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,550
don't share
any feat any physical features

4296
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:36,560
any feat any physical features
 

4297
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:39,270
any feat any physical features
but the function of the instances are

4298
01:19:39,270 --> 01:19:39,280
but the function of the instances are
 

4299
01:19:39,280 --> 01:19:40,149
but the function of the instances are
the same

4300
01:19:40,149 --> 01:19:40,159
the same
 

4301
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:41,990
the same
so for example think about all the

4302
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:42,000
so for example think about all the
 

4303
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,430
so for example think about all the
things that can protect you

4304
01:19:43,430 --> 01:19:43,440
things that can protect you
 

4305
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,709
things that can protect you
from the rain what are all the things

4306
01:19:46,709 --> 01:19:46,719
from the rain what are all the things
 

4307
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:48,630
from the rain what are all the things
that can protect you from the rain

4308
01:19:48,630 --> 01:19:48,640
that can protect you from the rain
 

4309
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:52,310
that can protect you from the rain
uh umbrella uh

4310
01:19:52,310 --> 01:19:52,320
uh umbrella uh
 

4311
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:55,430
uh umbrella uh
like this apartment right

4312
01:19:55,430 --> 01:19:55,440
like this apartment right
 

4313
01:19:55,440 --> 01:20:00,709
like this apartment right
um your car not giving a damn

4314
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719

 

4315
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,070

like like a like a mindset yeah

4316
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:04,080
like like a like a mindset yeah
 

4317
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:07,030
like like a like a mindset yeah
right right so the idea is that the

4318
01:20:07,030 --> 01:20:07,040
right right so the idea is that the
 

4319
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:07,830
right right so the idea is that the
function

4320
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:07,840
function
 

4321
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,229
function
of the instances is the same in a given

4322
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
of the instances is the same in a given
 

4323
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:11,350
of the instances is the same in a given
situation

4324
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:11,360
situation
 

4325
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:13,189

01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:13,199
even if they look different sound
 

4327
01:20:13,199 --> 01:20:14,950
even if they look different sound

there are two really cool things about

there are two really cool things about
 

4355
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,750
there are two really cool things about
this one is

this one is
 

4357
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,590
this one is
that's what darwin said a species was

4358
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:51,600
that's what darwin said a species was
 

4359
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,270
that's what darwin said a species was
so darwin is known

4360
01:20:55,270 --> 01:20:55,280
so darwin is known
 

4361
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,590
so darwin is known
for discovering natural selection

4362

01:22:08,229 --> 01:22:08,239
size of the dog and the uh amount of fur
 

4421
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,470
size of the dog and the uh amount of fur
the dog has and the color and the

4422
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:10,480
the dog has and the color and the
 

4423
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:12,070
the dog has and the color and the
how long is the tail and how long is

4424
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:12,080
how long is the tail and how long is
 

4425
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:14,070
how long is the tail and how long is
this snout

4426
01:22:14,070 --> 01:22:14,080
this snout
 

4427
01:22:14,080 --> 01:22:17,430
this snout
in humans we talk about that variation

4428
01:22:17,430 --> 01:22:17,440
in humans we talk about that variation
 

4429
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:20,870
in humans we talk about that variation
in all kinds of ways right including in

4430
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:20,880
in all kinds of ways right including in
 

4431
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,629
in all kinds of ways right including in
cultural ways

4432
01:22:24,629 --> 01:22:24,639
cultural ways
 

4433
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,390
cultural ways
so that's one thing that's really

4434
01:22:26,390 --> 01:22:26,400
so that's one thing that's really
 

4435
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,470
so that's one thing that's really
interesting about conceptual categories

4436
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:28,480
interesting about conceptual categories
 

4437
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,070
interesting about conceptual categories
is that darwin is basically saying a

4438
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:30,080
is that darwin is basically saying a
 

4439
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:32,550
is that darwin is basically saying a
species is a conceptual category

4440
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:32,560
species is a conceptual category
 

4441
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:35,189
species is a conceptual category
and in fact if you look at modern

4442
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:35,199
and in fact if you look at modern
 

4443
01:22:35,199 --> 01:22:36,149
and in fact if you look at modern
debates about

4444
01:22:36,149 --> 01:22:36,159
debates about
 

4445
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:39,510
debates about
what is a species you can't find anybody

4446
01:22:39,510 --> 01:22:39,520
what is a species you can't find anybody
 

4447
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,669
what is a species you can't find anybody
agreeing on what the criteria are

4448
01:22:41,669 --> 01:22:41,679
agreeing on what the criteria are
 

4449
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:43,830
agreeing on what the criteria are
for a species because they don't all

4450
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:43,840
for a species because they don't all
 

4451
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:46,229
for a species because they don't all
share the same genome

4452
01:22:46,229 --> 01:22:46,239
share the same genome
 

4453
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:47,990
share the same genome
we don't all share we don't there isn't

4454
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
we don't all share we don't there isn't
 

4455
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,669
we don't all share we don't there isn't
a single human genome

4456
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:49,679
a single human genome
 

4457
01:22:49,679 --> 01:22:53,990
a single human genome
there's a population of genomes

4458
01:22:53,990 --> 01:22:54,000
there's a population of genomes
 

4459
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,189
there's a population of genomes
but they're variable it's not unbounded

4460
01:22:57,189 --> 01:22:57,199
but they're variable it's not unbounded
 

4461
01:22:57,199 --> 01:22:58,229
but they're variable it's not unbounded
variation

4462
01:22:58,229 --> 01:22:58,239
variation
 

4463
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:01,270
variation
but they are variable right and

4464
01:23:01,270 --> 01:23:01,280
but they are variable right and
 

4465
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:04,709
but they are variable right and
the other thing that's really cool about

4466
01:23:04,709 --> 01:23:04,719
the other thing that's really cool about
 

4467
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,629
the other thing that's really cool about
conceptual categories is that um

4468
01:23:08,629 --> 01:23:08,639
conceptual categories is that um
 

4469
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,669
conceptual categories is that um
they are the categories that we use

4470
01:23:11,669 --> 01:23:11,679
they are the categories that we use
 

4471
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,030
they are the categories that we use
to make civilization

4472
01:23:15,030 --> 01:23:15,040
to make civilization
 

4473
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:19,110
to make civilization
so think about money for example

4474
01:23:19,110 --> 01:23:19,120
so think about money for example
 

4475
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,030
so think about money for example
what are all the physical things that

4476
01:23:23,030 --> 01:23:23,040
what are all the physical things that
 

4477
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:26,070
what are all the physical things that
make something a currency is there any

4478
01:23:26,070 --> 01:23:26,080
make something a currency is there any
 

4479
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,110

that all the currencies in all the
worlds that's ever been used by humans

4484
01:23:31,830 --> 01:23:31,840
worlds that's ever been used by humans
 

4485
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:33,430

share

4486
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:33,440
share
 

4487
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,590
share
well certainly right but uh but what

4488
01:23:35,590 --> 01:23:35,600
well certainly right but uh but what
 

4489
01:23:35,600 --> 01:23:37,830
well certainly right but uh but what
what is it uh is it definable

4490
01:23:37,830 --> 01:23:37,840
what is it uh is it definable
 

4491
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,550
what is it uh is it definable
you know so it's getting to the point

4492
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:40,560
you know so it's getting to the point
 

4493
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:41,430
you know so it's getting to the point
that you're

4494
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:41,440
that you're
 

4495
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,430
that you're
because you're making it function it's

4496
01:23:43,430 --> 01:23:43,440
because you're making it function it's
 

4497
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:45,110
because you're making it function it's
the function right function it's that we

4498
01:23:45,110 --> 01:23:45,120
the function right function it's that we
 

4499
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,110
the function right function it's that we
trade it for material goods

4500
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:47,120
trade it for material goods
 

4501
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:49,110
trade it for material goods
and that and we have to agree right we

4502
01:23:49,110 --> 01:23:49,120
and that and we have to agree right we
 

4503
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,270
and that and we have to agree right we
all impose on whatever it is

4504
01:23:51,270 --> 01:23:51,280
all impose on whatever it is
 

4505

yeah and uh yes that's bril by the way

4526
01:24:14,229 --> 01:24:14,239
yeah and uh yes that's bril by the way
 

4527
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:15,510
yeah and uh yes that's bril by the way
you're attributing some of that to

4528
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:15,520
you're attributing some of that to
 

4529
01:24:15,520 --> 01:24:15,990
you're attributing some of that to
darwin

4530
01:24:15,990 --> 01:24:16,000
darwin
 

4531
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,669
darwin
that he thought no i'm no i'm saying

4532
01:24:17,669 --> 01:24:17,679
that he thought no i'm no i'm saying
 

4533
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:19,510
that he thought no i'm no i'm saying
that because it's a brilliant view of

4534
01:24:19,510 --> 01:24:19,520
that because it's a brilliant view of
 

4535
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:21,669
that because it's a brilliant view of
what a species is is the function

4536
01:24:21,669 --> 01:24:21,679
what a species is is the function
 

4537
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:24,470
what a species is is the function
yeah what i'm saying is that what darwin

4538
01:24:24,470 --> 01:24:24,480
yeah what i'm saying is that what darwin
 

4539
01:24:24,480 --> 01:24:25,510
yeah what i'm saying is that what darwin
darwin really

4540
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:25,520
darwin really
 

4541
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,550
darwin really
talked about variation in um so if you

4542
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:28,560
talked about variation in um so if you
 

4543
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,310
talked about variation in um so if you
read for example the biologist ernst

4544
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:30,320
read for example the biologist ernst
 

4545
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:31,110
read for example the biologist ernst

who was an evolutionary biologist and

4548
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:33,199
who was an evolutionary biologist and
 

4549
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,390
who was an evolutionary biologist and
then when he retired

4550
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:34,400
then when he retired
 

4551
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:37,030
then when he retired
became a historian and philosopher of

4552
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
became a historian and philosopher of
 

4553
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,310
became a historian and philosopher of
biology

4554
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:38,320
biology
 

4555
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:41,510
biology
and his suggestion is

4556
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:41,520
and his suggestion is
 

4557
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,990
and his suggestion is
that darwin darwin did talk about

4558
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
that darwin darwin did talk about
 

4559
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,590
that darwin darwin did talk about
variation

4560
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:45,600
variation

he vanquished what's called essentialism

4562
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:48,000
he vanquished what's called essentialism
 

4563
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,950
he vanquished what's called essentialism
the idea that there's a single

4564
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:50,960
the idea that there's a single
 

4565
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:55,990
the idea that there's a single
set of features that define any species

4566
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,000
set of features that define any species
 

4567
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,229
set of features that define any species
and um out of that grew

4568
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:00,239
and um out of that grew
 

4569
01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:03,990
and um out of that grew
um really discussions of

4570
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:04,000
um really discussions of
 

4571
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,430
um really discussions of
the function you know like some of the

4572
01:25:05,430 --> 01:25:05,440
the function you know like some of the
 

4573
01:25:05,440 --> 01:25:07,030
the function you know like some of the
functional features that species have

4574
01:25:07,030 --> 01:25:07,040
functional features that species have
 

4575
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,470
functional features that species have
like they can reproduce

4576
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:08,480
like they can reproduce
 

4577
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,709
like they can reproduce
uh off they can have offspring the

4578
01:25:10,709 --> 01:25:10,719
uh off they can have offspring the
 

4579
01:25:10,719 --> 01:25:11,990
uh off they can have offspring the
individuals of a species can have

4580
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:12,000
individuals of a species can have
 

4581
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:12,629
individuals of a species can have

4582
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:12,639
offspring
 

4583
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:15,910
offspring
it turns out that's not a perfect uh

4584
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:15,920
it turns out that's not a perfect uh
 

4585
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:17,830
it turns out that's not a perfect uh
you know that's not a perfect uh

4586
01:25:17,830 --> 01:25:17,840
you know that's not a perfect uh
 

4587
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,669
you know that's not a perfect uh
criterion to use but it's a functional

4588
01:25:19,669 --> 01:25:19,679
criterion to use but it's a functional
 

4589
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:20,950
criterion to use but it's a functional
criterion right so

4590
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:20,960
criterion right so
 

4591
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:22,629
criterion right so
what i'm saying is that in cognitive

4592
01:25:22,629 --> 01:25:22,639
what i'm saying is that in cognitive
 

4593
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,550
what i'm saying is that in cognitive
science people came up with the idea

4594
01:25:24,550 --> 01:25:24,560
science people came up with the idea
 

4595
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:26,229
science people came up with the idea
they discovered the idea of conceptual

4596
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:26,239
they discovered the idea of conceptual
 

4597
01:25:26,239 --> 01:25:27,750
they discovered the idea of conceptual
categories or

4598
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:27,760
categories or
 

4599
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:29,990
categories or
ad hoc concepts these concepts that can

4600
01:25:29,990 --> 01:25:30,000
ad hoc concepts these concepts that can
 

4601
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:30,790
ad hoc concepts these concepts that can
change

4602
01:25:30,790 --> 01:25:30,800
change
 

4603
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:32,550
change
based on the function they're serving

4604
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:32,560
based on the function they're serving
 

4605
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:33,830
based on the function they're serving
right and

4606
01:25:33,830 --> 01:25:33,840
right and
 

4607
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,270
right and
um uh that it's there

4608
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:37,280
um uh that it's there
 

4609
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:40,070
um uh that it's there
darwin it's in darwin and it's also in

4610
01:25:40,070 --> 01:25:40,080
darwin it's in darwin and it's also in
 

4611
01:25:40,080 --> 01:25:42,149
darwin it's in darwin and it's also in
the philosophy of social reality you can

4612
01:25:42,149 --> 01:25:42,159
the philosophy of social reality you can
 

4613
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:43,830
the philosophy of social reality you can
the way that philosophers talk about

4614
01:25:43,830 --> 01:25:43,840
the way that philosophers talk about
 

4615
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,070
the way that philosophers talk about
social reality just look around you

4616
01:25:46,070 --> 01:25:46,080
social reality just look around you
 

4617
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:48,550
social reality just look around you
i mean we impose we're treating a bunch

4618
01:25:48,550 --> 01:25:48,560
i mean we impose we're treating a bunch
 

4619
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,229
i mean we impose we're treating a bunch
of things as similar which are

4620
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:50,239
of things as similar which are
 

4621
01:25:50,239 --> 01:25:51,910
of things as similar which are
physically different

4622
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:51,920
physically different
 

4623
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:54,390
physically different
and sometimes we take things that are

4624
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:54,400
and sometimes we take things that are
 

4625
01:25:54,400 --> 01:25:55,030
and sometimes we take things that are
physically

4626
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:55,040
physically
 

4627
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:57,270
physically
the same and we treat them as separate

4628
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:57,280
the same and we treat them as separate
 

4629
01:25:57,280 --> 01:25:58,310
the same and we treat them as separate
categories

4630
01:25:58,310 --> 01:25:58,320
categories
 

4631
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:01,030
categories
but it feels like the number of

4632
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
but it feels like the number of
 

4633
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,709
but it feels like the number of
variables involved in that kind of

4634
01:26:02,709 --> 01:26:02,719
variables involved in that kind of
 

4635
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,270
variables involved in that kind of
categorization is nearly infinite

4636
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:05,280
categorization is nearly infinite
 

4637
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:07,189
categorization is nearly infinite
no i don't think so because there is a

4638
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
no i don't think so because there is a
 

4639
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,270
no i don't think so because there is a
physical constraint right like you and i

4640
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:09,280
physical constraint right like you and i
 

4641
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,390
physical constraint right like you and i
could agree

4642
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:10,400
could agree
 

4643
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:13,590
could agree
that um we can fly in real life

4644
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:13,600
that um we can fly in real life
 

4645
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,830
that um we can fly in real life
but we can't that's a physical that's a

4646
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:15,840
but we can't that's a physical that's a
 

4647
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:17,669
but we can't that's a physical that's a
physical constraint that we can't

4648
01:26:17,669 --> 01:26:17,679
physical constraint that we can't
 

4649
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:19,590
physical constraint that we can't
break right you and i could agree that

4650
01:26:19,590 --> 01:26:19,600
break right you and i could agree that
 

4651
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,189
break right you and i could agree that
we could walk through the walls

4652
01:26:21,189 --> 01:26:21,199
we could walk through the walls
 

4653
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,030
we could walk through the walls
right but we can't we could agree that

4654
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
right but we can't we could agree that
 

4655
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,790
right but we can't we could agree that
we could eat glass but there's a lot of

4656
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:24,800
we could eat glass but there's a lot of
 

4657
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:25,350
we could eat glass but there's a lot of
constraints

4658
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:25,360
constraints
 

4659
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,830
constraints
but yeah we could agree that the virus

4660
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:27,840
but yeah we could agree that the virus
 

4661
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:29,430
but yeah we could agree that the virus
doesn't exist and we don't have to wear

4662
01:26:29,430 --> 01:26:29,440
doesn't exist and we don't have to wear
 

4663
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:32,229
doesn't exist and we don't have to wear
masks right

4664
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:32,239
masks right
 

4665
01:26:32,239 --> 01:26:35,110
masks right
yeah but you know physical reality still

4666
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:35,120
yeah but you know physical reality still
 

4667
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:37,110
yeah but you know physical reality still
holds the trump card right

4668
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:37,120
holds the trump card right
 

4669
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:41,510
holds the trump card right
but still there's a lot of card well

4670
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:41,520
but still there's a lot of card well
 

4671
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:42,950
but still there's a lot of card well
pun completely unattended but there you

4672
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:42,960
pun completely unattended but there you
 

4673
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:44,790
pun completely unattended but there you
go that's a predicting brain for you

4674
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:44,800
go that's a predicting brain for you
 

4675
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:48,390
go that's a predicting brain for you
um uh but but there's a tremendous

4676
01:26:48,390 --> 01:26:48,400
um uh but but there's a tremendous
 

4677
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:49,590
um uh but but there's a tremendous
amount of leeway

4678
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:49,600
amount of leeway
 

4679
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,229
amount of leeway
yes yeah that's the point so what i'm

4680
01:26:52,229 --> 01:26:52,239
yes yeah that's the point so what i'm
 

4681
01:26:52,239 --> 01:26:55,669
yes yeah that's the point so what i'm
saying is that emotions are like money

4682
01:26:55,669 --> 01:26:55,679
saying is that emotions are like money
 

4683
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:57,350
saying is that emotions are like money
basically they're they're like money

4684
01:26:57,350 --> 01:26:57,360
basically they're they're like money
 

4685
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,910
basically they're they're like money
they're like countries they're like

4686
01:26:59,910 --> 01:26:59,920
they're like countries they're like
 

4687
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,229
they're like countries they're like
um kings and queens and presidents

4688
01:27:02,229 --> 01:27:02,239
um kings and queens and presidents
 

4689
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:02,950
um kings and queens and presidents
they're like

4690
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:02,960
they're like
 

4691
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,590
they're like
everything that we construct that we

4692
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:05,600
everything that we construct that we
 

4693
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:06,629
everything that we construct that we
impose meaning

4694
01:27:06,629 --> 01:27:06,639
impose meaning
 

4695
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,950
impose meaning
on we take these physical signals and we

4696
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
on we take these physical signals and we
 

4697
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,470
on we take these physical signals and we
give them meanings

4698
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:10,480
give them meanings
 

4699
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,310
give them meanings
that um they don't otherwise have by

4700
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:12,320
that um they don't otherwise have by
 

4701
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,750
that um they don't otherwise have by
their physical nature

4702
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:13,760
their physical nature
 

4703
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,149
their physical nature
and because we agree yeah

4704
01:27:18,149 --> 01:27:18,159
and because we agree yeah
 

4705
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:20,310
and because we agree yeah
they have that function but the the

4706
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:20,320
they have that function but the the
 

4707
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,870
they have that function but the the
beautiful thing so maybe unlike money

4708
01:27:22,870 --> 01:27:22,880
beautiful thing so maybe unlike money
 

4709
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,910
beautiful thing so maybe unlike money
i love this similarity is it it's not

4710
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:25,920
i love this similarity is it it's not
 

4711
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,830
i love this similarity is it it's not
obvious to me that this kind of

4712
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
obvious to me that this kind of
 

4713
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,149
obvious to me that this kind of
emergent agreement should happen with

4714
01:27:30,149 --> 01:27:30,159
emergent agreement should happen with
 

4715
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:31,030
emergent agreement should happen with
emotion

4716
01:27:31,030 --> 01:27:31,040
emotion
 

4717
01:27:31,040 --> 01:27:33,189
emotion
because our experiences are so different

4718
01:27:33,189 --> 01:27:33,199
because our experiences are so different
 

4719
01:27:33,199 --> 01:27:34,629
because our experiences are so different
for each of us humans

4720
01:27:34,629 --> 01:27:34,639
for each of us humans
 

4721
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:36,950
for each of us humans
and yet we kind of converge well in a

4722
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:36,960
and yet we kind of converge well in a
 

4723
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,470
and yet we kind of converge well in a
culture we converge

4724
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:38,480
culture we converge
 

4725
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:40,390
culture we converge
but not across cultures there are huge

4726
01:27:40,390 --> 01:27:40,400
but not across cultures there are huge
 

4727
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,590
but not across cultures there are huge
huge differences

4728
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:41,600
huge differences
 

4729
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:43,590
huge differences
there are huge differences in what what

4730
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:43,600
there are huge differences in what what
 

4731
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:44,950
there are huge differences in what what
concepts exist

4732
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:44,960
concepts exist
 

4733
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,470
concepts exist
what their um what they look like um

4734
01:27:48,470 --> 01:27:48,480
what their um what they look like um
 

4735
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:51,350
what their um what they look like um
so what i would say is that they feel

4736
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:51,360
so what i would say is that they feel
 

4737
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,070
so what i would say is that they feel
like

4738
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:52,080
like
 

4739
01:27:52,080 --> 01:27:54,950
like
what what we're doing with our young

4740
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:54,960
what what we're doing with our young
 

4741
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:55,910
what what we're doing with our young
children

4742
01:27:55,910 --> 01:27:55,920
children
 

4743
01:27:55,920 --> 01:28:00,229

01:30:58,149 --> 01:30:58,159
systems
 

4907
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,390
systems
so here's what i would say you know we

4908

4909
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:02,070
so here's what i would say you know we
did a series of studies

4910
01:31:02,070 --> 01:31:02,080
did a series of studies
 

4911
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:05,189
did a series of studies
um uh in the 1990s where

4912
01:31:05,189 --> 01:31:05,199
um uh in the 1990s where
 

4913
01:31:05,199 --> 01:31:08,070
um uh in the 1990s where
we asked men and women to tell us about

4914
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:08,080
we asked men and women to tell us about
 

4915
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,910
we asked men and women to tell us about
their emotional lives

4916
01:31:09,910 --> 01:31:09,920
their emotional lives
 

4917
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:11,590
their emotional lives
and women described themselves as much

4918
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:11,600
and women described themselves as much
 

4919
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:13,510
and women described themselves as much
more emotional than men

4920
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:13,520
more emotional than men
 

4921
01:31:13,520 --> 01:31:14,629
more emotional than men
they believed that they were more

4922
01:31:14,629 --> 01:31:14,639
they believed that they were more
 

4923
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:17,030
they believed that they were more
emotional than men and men agreed

4924
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:17,040
emotional than men and men agreed

okay and then

4928
01:31:21,030 --> 01:31:21,040
okay and then
 

4929
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:24,149
okay and then
we gave them little handheld computers

4930
01:31:24,149 --> 01:31:24,159
we gave them little handheld computers
 

4931
01:31:24,159 --> 01:31:25,750
we gave them little handheld computers
these were little hewlett-packard

4932
01:31:25,750 --> 01:31:25,760
these were little hewlett-packard
 

4933
01:31:25,760 --> 01:31:27,350
these were little hewlett-packard
computers they fit in the palm of your

4934
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:27,360
computers they fit in the palm of your
 

4935
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,070
computers they fit in the palm of your
hand

4936
01:31:28,070 --> 01:31:28,080
hand
 

4937
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:29,350
hand
a couple of pen they weighed a couple of

4938
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:29,360
a couple of pen they weighed a couple of
 

4939
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:31,350
a couple of pen they weighed a couple of
pounds so this was like pre-palm pilot

4940
01:31:31,350 --> 01:31:31,360
pounds so this was like pre-palm pilot
 

4941
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:32,390
pounds so this was like pre-palm pilot
even like this was

4942
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:32,400
even like this was
 

4943
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:36,709
even like this was
you know 1990s and like early

4944
01:31:36,709 --> 01:31:36,719
you know 1990s and like early
 

4945
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,870
you know 1990s and like early
and um we um

4946
01:31:40,870 --> 01:31:40,880
and um we um
 

4947
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:44,550
and um we um
asked them we would you know ping them

4948
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:44,560
asked them we would you know ping them
 

4949
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,270
asked them we would you know ping them
like 10 times a day and just ask them to

4950
01:31:47,270 --> 01:31:47,280
like 10 times a day and just ask them to
 

4951

which is called experience sampling so

4954
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:51,920
which is called experience sampling so
 

4955
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:53,910
which is called experience sampling so
we experience sampled

4956
01:31:53,910 --> 01:31:53,920
we experience sampled
 

4957
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:57,669
we experience sampled
and and then at the end

4958
01:31:57,669 --> 01:31:57,679
and and then at the end
 

4959
01:31:57,679 --> 01:31:59,430
and and then at the end
and then we looked at their reports and

4960
01:31:59,430 --> 01:31:59,440
and then we looked at their reports and
 

4961
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:01,430
and then we looked at their reports and
we found is that men and women basically

4962
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
we found is that men and women basically
 

4963
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,390
we found is that men and women basically
didn't differ

4964
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:02,400
didn't differ
 

4965
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,470
didn't differ
and there were some people who were

and i just that feeling and then i tried
 

5079
01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:12,870
and i just that feeling and then i tried
to reduce that to

5080
01:34:12,870 --> 01:34:12,880
to reduce that to
 

5081
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:15,990
to reduce that to
what what is that because i think the

5082
01:34:15,990 --> 01:34:16,000
what what is that because i think the
 

5083
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:18,070
what what is that because i think the
same attributes that are annoying

5084
01:34:18,070 --> 01:34:18,080
same attributes that are annoying
 

5085
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:20,950

um i think a lot of people experienced

5152
01:35:27,590 --> 01:35:27,600
um i think a lot of people experienced
 

5153
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:29,590
um i think a lot of people experienced
but it's also in line with research

5154
01:35:29,590 --> 01:35:29,600
but it's also in line with research
 

5155
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:30,470
but it's also in line with research
which shows

5156
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:30,480
which shows
 

5157
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,870
which shows
and and particularly research actually

5158
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:32,880
and and particularly research actually
 

5159
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:33,830
and and particularly research actually
on um

5160
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:33,840
on um

in about teaching evaluations is one

5162
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:35,840
in about teaching evaluations is one
 

5163
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:37,590
in about teaching evaluations is one
place that you really see it

5164
01:35:37,590 --> 01:35:37,600
place that you really see it
 

5165
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,790
place that you really see it
where the expectation is that a woman

5166
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:40,800
where the expectation is that a woman
 

5167
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,550
where the expectation is that a woman
will be nurturant and that a man

5168
01:35:44,550 --> 01:35:44,560
will be nurturant and that a man
 

5169
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:46,550
will be nurturant and that a man
there's just no expectation for him to

5170
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:46,560
there's just no expectation for him to
 

5171
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:47,990
there's just no expectation for him to
be nurturing so he's

5172
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:48,000
be nurturing so he's
 

5173
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,910
be nurturing so he's
you know if he is nurturant he gets

5174
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:49,920
you know if he is nurturant he gets
 

5175
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:51,030
you know if he is nurturant he gets
points

5176
01:35:51,030 --> 01:35:51,040
points
 

5177
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:54,149
points
um if he's not he gets points right

5178
01:35:54,149 --> 01:35:54,159
um if he's not he gets points right
 

5179
01:35:54,159 --> 01:35:55,830
um if he's not he gets points right
they're just different points right

5180
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:55,840
they're just different points right
 

5181
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,350
they're just different points right
whereas for a woman

5182
01:35:57,350 --> 01:35:57,360
whereas for a woman
 

5183
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,430
whereas for a woman
especially a woman who's an authority

5184
01:35:59,430 --> 01:35:59,440
especially a woman who's an authority
 

5185
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:01,830
especially a woman who's an authority
figure she's really in a catch-22

5186
01:36:01,830 --> 01:36:01,840
figure she's really in a catch-22
 

5187
01:36:01,840 --> 01:36:04,550
figure she's really in a catch-22
right because if she's serious she's a

5188
01:36:04,550 --> 01:36:05,350
right because if she's serious she's a
 

5189
01:36:05,350 --> 01:36:05,360

 

5190
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:09,350

and if she's empathic uh then she's weak

5191
01:36:09,350 --> 01:36:09,360
and if she's empathic uh then she's weak
 

5192
01:36:09,360 --> 01:36:12,149
and if she's empathic uh then she's weak
right that's brilliant i mean one of the

5193
01:36:12,149 --> 01:36:12,159
right that's brilliant i mean one of the
 

5194
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,430
right that's brilliant i mean one of the
bigger questions to ask

5195
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
bigger questions to ask
 

5196
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:16,310
bigger questions to ask
here so that's one example where our con

5197
01:36:16,310 --> 01:36:16,320
here so that's one example where our con
 

5198
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,830
here so that's one example where our con

i love this research because it so
violates my own

5231
01:36:49,109 --> 01:36:49,119
violates my own
 

5232
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:52,070
violates my own
like deeply deeply held beliefs about

01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:52,080
like deeply deeply held beliefs about
 

5234
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,750
like deeply deeply held beliefs about
myself

5235

that most animals on this planet who

5237
01:36:56,470 --> 01:36:56,480
that most animals on this planet who
 

5238
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:59,830
that most animals on this planet who
have been studied and there are many

5239
01:36:59,830 --> 01:36:59,840
have been studied and there are many

actually eat to regulate their protein

5241
01:37:01,830 --> 01:37:01,840
actually eat to regulate their protein
 

5242

so you will overeat carbohydrates if you

5245
01:37:07,109 --> 01:37:07,119
so you will overeat carbohydrates if you
 

5246
01:37:07,119 --> 01:37:10,550
so you will overeat carbohydrates if you
in order to get enough protein and these

5247
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:10,560
in order to get enough protein and these
 

5248
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:12,390
in order to get enough protein and these
this research has been done with human

5249
01:37:12,390 --> 01:37:12,400
this research has been done with human
 

5250
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:13,669
this research has been done with human
very beautiful research

5251
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
very beautiful research
 

5252
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:16,310
very beautiful research
with humans with crickets with like you

5253
01:37:16,310 --> 01:37:16,320

know bonobo i mean just like all these

5255
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:18,000
know bonobo i mean just like all these
 

5256
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:19,270
know bonobo i mean just like all these
different animals not bonobos but i

5257
01:37:19,270 --> 01:37:19,280
different animals not bonobos but i
 

5258
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:20,950
different animals not bonobos but i
think like baboons

5259
01:37:20,950 --> 01:37:20,960
think like baboons
 

5260
01:37:20,960 --> 01:37:23,750
think like baboons
um now that i have no intuition about

5261
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:23,760
um now that i have no intuition about
 

5262
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:24,470
um now that i have no intuition about
that

5263
01:37:24,470 --> 01:37:24,480
that
 

5264
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:27,669
that
and i even now as i regulate my eating

5265
01:37:27,669 --> 01:37:27,679
and i even now as i regulate my eating
 

5266
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:30,390
and i even now as i regulate my eating
i don't i still i just have no intuition

5267
01:37:30,390 --> 01:37:30,400
i don't i still i just have no intuition
 

5268
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,669
i don't i still i just have no intuition
it just i can't

5269
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
it just i can't
 

5270
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,790
it just i can't
i can't feel it what i feel is only

5271
01:37:34,790 --> 01:37:34,800
i can't feel it what i feel is only
 

5272
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:35,750
i can't feel it what i feel is only
about the carbohydrates

5273
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:35,760
about the carbohydrates
 

5274
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:37,189
about the carbohydrates
it feels like you're regulating around

5275
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:37,199
it feels like you're regulating around
 

5276
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:39,109
it feels like you're regulating around
carbohydrates not the protein yeah

5277
01:37:39,109 --> 01:37:39,119
carbohydrates not the protein yeah
 

5278
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:41,189
carbohydrates not the protein yeah
but in fact actually what i am doing if

5279
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199
but in fact actually what i am doing if
 

5280
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:42,390
but in fact actually what i am doing if
i am like most

5281
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,400
i am like most
 

5282
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:44,629
i am like most
uh animals on the planet i am regulating

5283
01:37:44,629 --> 01:37:44,639
uh animals on the planet i am regulating
 

5284
01:37:44,639 --> 01:37:46,310
uh animals on the planet i am regulating
around proteins so

5285
01:37:46,310 --> 01:37:46,320
around proteins so
 

5286
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:49,109
around proteins so
knowing this what do i do i correct my

5287
01:37:49,109 --> 01:37:49,119
knowing this what do i do i correct my
 

5288
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:49,910
knowing this what do i do i correct my
behavior

5289
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:49,920
behavior
 

5290
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,750

this is the idea behind bias training

5295
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
this is the idea behind bias training
 

5296
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:00,629
this is the idea behind bias training
right like

5297
01:38:00,629 --> 01:38:00,639
right like
 

5298
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:04,149
right like
if you um

5299
01:38:04,149 --> 01:38:04,159
if you um
 

5300
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:07,350
if you um
i also

01:38:26,790 --> 01:38:26,800
that rationality is

that rationality is
the absence of emotion because sometimes

or scent anything feelings in general
 

5324
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,750
or scent anything feelings in general
not the same thing as emotion um that's

5325
01:38:35,750 --> 01:38:35,760
not the same thing as emotion um that's
 

5326
01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:36,870
not the same thing as emotion um that's
another topic

5327
01:38:36,870 --> 01:38:36,880
another topic
 

5328
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,310
another topic
um but you know our our source of

5329
01:38:40,310 --> 01:38:40,320
um but you know our our source of
 

5330
01:38:40,320 --> 01:38:42,310
um but you know our our source of
of information and their wisdom and

5331
01:38:42,310 --> 01:38:42,320
of information and their wisdom and
 

5332
01:38:42,320 --> 01:38:44,229
of information and their wisdom and
helpful so i'm not saying that

5333
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:44,239
helpful so i'm not saying that
 

5334
01:38:44,239 --> 01:38:45,590
helpful so i'm not saying that
but what i am saying is that if you have

5335
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:45,600
but what i am saying is that if you have
 

5336
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:47,430
but what i am saying is that if you have
a deeply held belief and the evidence

5337
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
a deeply held belief and the evidence
 

5338
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,189
a deeply held belief and the evidence
shows that you're wrong

5339
01:38:49,189 --> 01:38:49,199
shows that you're wrong
 

5340
01:38:49,199 --> 01:38:50,790
shows that you're wrong
then you're wrong it doesn't really

5341
01:38:50,790 --> 01:38:50,800
then you're wrong it doesn't really
 

5342
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:52,790
then you're wrong it doesn't really
matter how confident you feel

5343
01:38:52,790 --> 01:38:52,800
matter how confident you feel
 

5344
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,790
matter how confident you feel
you that confidence could be also

5345
01:38:54,790 --> 01:38:54,800
you that confidence could be also
 

5346
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,709
you that confidence could be also
explained by science right so

5347
01:38:56,709 --> 01:38:56,719
explained by science right so
 

5348
01:38:56,719 --> 01:38:59,510
explained by science right so
it would be the same thing as if i

5349
01:38:59,510 --> 01:38:59,520
it would be the same thing as if i
 

5350
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:01,189
it would be the same thing as if i
regardless of whether someone is

5351
01:39:01,189 --> 01:39:01,199
regardless of whether someone is
 

5352
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,790
regardless of whether someone is
like charlie baker right regardless of

5353
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800
like charlie baker right regardless of
 

5354
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,550
like charlie baker right regardless of
whether somebody is a republican or a

5355
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:04,560
whether somebody is a republican or a
 

5356
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,189
whether somebody is a republican or a
democrat

5357
01:39:05,189 --> 01:39:05,199
democrat
 

5358
01:39:05,199 --> 01:39:07,750
democrat
if that person has a record that you can

5359
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:07,760
if that person has a record that you can
 

5360
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:09,189
if that person has a record that you can
see

5361
01:39:09,189 --> 01:39:09,199
see
 

5362
01:39:09,199 --> 01:39:12,310
see
is consistent with what you believe then

5363
01:39:12,310 --> 01:39:12,320
is consistent with what you believe then
 

5364
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:15,590
is consistent with what you believe then
that is information that you can act on

5365
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:15,600
that is information that you can act on
 

5366
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,390
that is information that you can act on
yeah and and then so try to i mean this

5367
01:39:18,390 --> 01:39:18,400
yeah and and then so try to i mean this
 

5368
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:20,149
yeah and and then so try to i mean this
is kind of what empathy is in

5369
01:39:20,149 --> 01:39:20,159
is kind of what empathy is in
 

5370
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,950
is kind of what empathy is in
open-mindedness is try to um

5371
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:22,960
open-mindedness is try to um
 

5372
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:25,270
open-mindedness is try to um

5375
01:39:27,350 --> 01:39:27,360
your your brain has constructed

5379
01:39:30,709 --> 01:39:30,719
world is
 

5380
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:32,390
world is
not painting the full picture i mean

5381
01:39:32,390 --> 01:39:32,400
not painting the full picture i mean
 

5382
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:34,950
not painting the full picture i mean
this is now true for basically ever

5383
01:39:34,950 --> 01:39:34,960
this is now true for basically ever
 

5384
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,470
this is now true for basically ever
it doesn't have to be men and women it

5385
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:36,480
it doesn't have to be men and women it
 

5386
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:38,870
it doesn't have to be men and women it
could be basically the prism through

5387
01:39:38,870 --> 01:39:38,880
could be basically the prism through
 

5388
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,990
could be basically the prism through
which we pursue actually the

5389
01:39:39,990 --> 01:39:40,000
which we pursue actually the
 

5390
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,030
which we pursue actually the
political discourse right absolutely so

5391
01:39:43,030 --> 01:39:43,040
political discourse right absolutely so
 

5392
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,390
political discourse right absolutely so
so here's what i would say um

5393
01:39:46,390 --> 01:39:46,400
so here's what i would say um
 

5394
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:50,310
so here's what i would say um
the you know there are

5395
01:39:50,310 --> 01:39:50,320
the you know there are
 

5396
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:51,990
the you know there are
people who scientists who will talk to

5397
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:52,000
people who scientists who will talk to
 

5398
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,590
people who scientists who will talk to
you about cognitive empathy and

5399
01:39:53,590 --> 01:39:53,600
you about cognitive empathy and
 

5400
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,270
you about cognitive empathy and
emotional empathy and

5401
01:39:55,270 --> 01:39:55,280
emotional empathy and
 

5402
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,510
emotional empathy and
i i prefer to think of it

5403
01:39:59,510 --> 01:39:59,520
i i prefer to think of it
 

5404
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:01,830
i i prefer to think of it
i think the evidence is more consistent

5405
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:01,840
i think the evidence is more consistent
 

5406
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,950
i think the evidence is more consistent
with what i'm about to say which is that

5407
01:40:04,950 --> 01:40:04,960
with what i'm about to say which is that
 

5408
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:08,149
with what i'm about to say which is that
your brain is always making predictions

5409
01:40:08,149 --> 01:40:08,159
your brain is always making predictions
 

5410
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,390
your brain is always making predictions
using your your own past experience and

5411
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:10,400
using your your own past experience and
 

5412
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:11,350
using your your own past experience and
what you've learned

5413
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:11,360
what you've learned
 

5414
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,990
what you've learned
from you know books and movies and other

5415
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:14,000
from you know books and movies and other
 

5416
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,189
from you know books and movies and other
people telling you about their

5417
01:40:15,189 --> 01:40:15,199
people telling you about their
 

5418
01:40:15,199 --> 01:40:17,669
people telling you about their
experiences and so on

5419
01:40:17,669 --> 01:40:17,679
experiences and so on
 

5420
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:22,709
experiences and so on
and if your brain cannot make a concept

5421
01:40:22,709 --> 01:40:22,719
and if your brain cannot make a concept
 

5422
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:24,790
and if your brain cannot make a concept
to make sense of those anticipate what

5423
01:40:24,790 --> 01:40:24,800
to make sense of those anticipate what
 

5424
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:25,910
to make sense of those anticipate what
those sense data are

5425
01:40:25,910 --> 01:40:25,920
those sense data are
 

5426
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,189
those sense data are
and make sense of them you will be

5427
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:28,199
and make sense of them you will be
 

5428
01:40:28,199 --> 01:40:31,189
and make sense of them you will be
experientially blind

5429
01:40:31,189 --> 01:40:31,199
experientially blind
 

5430
01:40:31,199 --> 01:40:33,830
experientially blind
so you know when i'm giving lectures to

5431
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:33,840
so you know when i'm giving lectures to
 

5432
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:35,669
so you know when i'm giving lectures to
people i'll show them like a blobby

5433
01:40:35,669 --> 01:40:35,679
people i'll show them like a blobby
 

5434
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:36,070
people i'll show them like a blobby
black

5435
01:40:36,070 --> 01:40:36,080
black
 

5436
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:39,350
black
and white image and they're

5437
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:39,360
and white image and they're
 

5438
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,189
and white image and they're
experientially blind

5439
01:40:41,189 --> 01:40:41,199
experientially blind
 

5440
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:43,990
experientially blind
to the image they can't see anything in

5441
01:40:43,990 --> 01:40:44,000
to the image they can't see anything in
 

5442
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:44,950
to the image they can't see anything in
it and then i

5443
01:40:44,950 --> 01:40:44,960
it and then i
 

5444
01:40:44,960 --> 01:40:46,310
it and then i
show them a photograph and then i show

5445
01:40:46,310 --> 01:40:46,320
show them a photograph and then i show
 

5446
01:40:46,320 --> 01:40:48,390
show them a photograph and then i show
them the image again the blobby

5447
01:40:48,390 --> 01:40:48,400
them the image again the blobby
 

5448
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:50,390
them the image again the blobby
image and then they see actually an

5449
01:40:50,390 --> 01:40:50,400
image and then they see actually an
 

5450
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:52,550
image and then they see actually an
object in it but the art but the image

5451
01:40:52,550 --> 01:40:52,560
object in it but the art but the image
 

5452
01:40:52,560 --> 01:40:53,430
object in it but the art but the image
is the same

5453
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:53,440
is the same
 

5454
01:40:53,440 --> 01:40:55,590
is the same
yeah it's there they're actually adding

5455
01:40:55,590 --> 01:40:55,600
yeah it's there they're actually adding
 

5456
01:40:55,600 --> 01:40:57,669
yeah it's there they're actually adding
their predictions now are adding right

5457
01:40:57,669 --> 01:40:57,679
their predictions now are adding right
 

5458
01:40:57,679 --> 01:40:58,390
their predictions now are adding right
or

5459
01:40:58,390 --> 01:40:58,400
or
 

5460
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:00,790
or
anything for example anybody who's

5461
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:00,800
anything for example anybody who's
 

5462
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,950
anything for example anybody who's
learned a language

5463
01:41:02,950 --> 01:41:02,960
learned a language
 

5464
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:06,310
learned a language
uh a second language after their

5465
01:41:06,310 --> 01:41:06,320
uh a second language after their
 

5466
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:08,790
uh a second language after their
first language also has this experience

5467
01:41:08,790 --> 01:41:08,800
first language also has this experience
 

5468
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:09,910
first language also has this experience
of

5469
01:41:09,910 --> 01:41:09,920
of
 

5470
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:11,830
of
um things that initially sound like

5471
01:41:11,830 --> 01:41:11,840
um things that initially sound like
 

5472
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:13,830
um things that initially sound like
sounds that they can't quite make sense

5473
01:41:13,830 --> 01:41:13,840
sounds that they can't quite make sense
 

5474
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:15,030
sounds that they can't quite make sense
of eventually come

5475
01:41:15,030 --> 01:41:15,040
of eventually come
 

5476
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:17,109
of eventually come
to make they eventually come to make

5477
01:41:17,109 --> 01:41:17,119
to make they eventually come to make
 

5478
01:41:17,119 --> 01:41:18,790
to make they eventually come to make
sense of them and in fact there are

5479
01:41:18,790 --> 01:41:18,800
sense of them and in fact there are
 

5480
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:20,470
sense of them and in fact there are
really cool examples

5481
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:20,480
really cool examples
 

5482
01:41:20,480 --> 01:41:23,189
really cool examples
of people who are like born blind

5483
01:41:23,189 --> 01:41:23,199
of people who are like born blind
 

5484
01:41:23,199 --> 01:41:24,870
of people who are like born blind
because they have cataracts

5485
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:24,880
because they have cataracts
 

5486
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:29,030
because they have cataracts
or um they have corneal damage so that

5487
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:29,040
or um they have corneal damage so that
 

5488
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:32,390
or um they have corneal damage so that
no light is reaching

5489
01:41:32,390 --> 01:41:32,400
no light is reaching
 

5490
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:35,189
no light is reaching
the brain and then they have an

5491
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:35,199
the brain and then they have an
 

5492
01:41:35,199 --> 01:41:35,910
the brain and then they have an
operation

5493
01:41:35,910 --> 01:41:35,920
operation
 

5494
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,470
operation
and then light reaches the brain and

5495
01:41:38,470 --> 01:41:38,480
and then light reaches the brain and
 

5496
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:41,430
and then light reaches the brain and
they can't see

5497
01:41:41,430 --> 01:41:41,440

 

5498
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:44,550

for days and weeks and sometimes

5499
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:44,560
for days and weeks and sometimes
 

5500
01:41:44,560 --> 01:41:46,310
for days and weeks and sometimes
years they have they are experientially

5501
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:46,320
years they have they are experientially
 

5502
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,390
years they have they are experientially
blind to certain things

5503
01:41:48,390 --> 01:41:48,400
blind to certain things
 

5504
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:51,109
blind to certain things
so what happens with empathy right is

5505
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:51,119
so what happens with empathy right is
 

5506
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:52,629
so what happens with empathy right is
that your brain

5507
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
that your brain
 

5508
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,149
that your brain
is making a prediction and if it doesn't

5509
01:41:56,149 --> 01:41:56,159
is making a prediction and if it doesn't
 

5510
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:59,990
is making a prediction and if it doesn't
if it doesn't have the capacity

5511
01:41:59,990 --> 01:42:00,000
if it doesn't have the capacity
 

5512
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:03,109
if it doesn't have the capacity
to um

5513
01:42:03,109 --> 01:42:03,119
to um
 

5514
01:42:03,119 --> 01:42:05,510
to um
make it doesn't if you don't share if

5515
01:42:05,510 --> 01:42:05,520
make it doesn't if you don't share if
 

5516
01:42:05,520 --> 01:42:06,470
make it doesn't if you don't share if
you're not similar

5517
01:42:06,470 --> 01:42:06,480
you're not similar
 

5518
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,629
you're not similar
remember you mean you know categories

5519
01:42:08,629 --> 01:42:08,639
remember you mean you know categories
 

5520
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:09,910
remember you mean you know categories
are

5521
01:42:09,910 --> 01:42:09,920
are
 

5522
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,990
are
instances which are similar in some way

5523
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:12,000
instances which are similar in some way
 

5524
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,189
instances which are similar in some way
if you are

5525
01:42:13,189 --> 01:42:13,199
if you are
 

5526
01:42:13,199 --> 01:42:16,070
if you are
not similar enough to that person you

5527
01:42:16,070 --> 01:42:16,080
not similar enough to that person you
 

5528
01:42:16,080 --> 01:42:17,270
not similar enough to that person you
will have a hard time making a

5529
01:42:17,270 --> 01:42:17,280
will have a hard time making a
 

5530
01:42:17,280 --> 01:42:19,270
will have a hard time making a
prediction about what they feel

5531
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:19,280
prediction about what they feel
 

5532
01:42:19,280 --> 01:42:21,750
prediction about what they feel
you will be experientially blind to what

5533
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:21,760
you will be experientially blind to what
 

5534
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,790
you will be experientially blind to what
they feel

5535
01:42:24,790 --> 01:42:24,800

 

5536
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:28,229

in the united states children

5537
01:42:28,229 --> 01:42:28,239
in the united states children
 

5538
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:32,149
in the united states children
of color are under prescribed medicine

5539
01:42:32,149 --> 01:42:32,159
of color are under prescribed medicine
 

5540
01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:35,270
of color are under prescribed medicine
by their physicians this

5541
01:42:35,270 --> 01:42:35,280
by their physicians this
 

5542
01:42:35,280 --> 01:42:38,709
by their physicians this
is been documented

5543
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
is been documented
 

5544
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:42,229
is been documented
it's not that the physicians

5545
01:42:42,229 --> 01:42:42,239
it's not that the physicians
 

5546
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,270
it's not that the physicians
are racist necessarily

5547
01:42:45,270 --> 01:42:45,280
are racist necessarily
 

5548
01:42:45,280 --> 01:42:52,070
are racist necessarily
but they might be experientially blind

5549
01:42:52,070 --> 01:42:52,080

 

5550
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,910

the same thing is true of male

5551
01:42:53,910 --> 01:42:53,920
the same thing is true of male
 

5552
01:42:53,920 --> 01:42:56,709
the same thing is true of male
physicians with female patients

5553
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:56,719
physicians with female patients
 

5554
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:58,310
physicians with female patients
i could tell you some hair-raising

5555
01:42:58,310 --> 01:42:58,320
i could tell you some hair-raising
 

5556
01:42:58,320 --> 01:42:59,750
i could tell you some hair-raising
stories

5557
01:42:59,750 --> 01:42:59,760
stories
 

5558
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:02,229
stories
really that where people die as a

5559
01:43:02,229 --> 01:43:02,239
really that where people die as a
 

5560
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:03,030
really that where people die as a
consequence

5561
01:43:03,030 --> 01:43:03,040
consequence
 

5562
01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:06,550
consequence
of a physician making the wrong

5563
01:43:06,550 --> 01:43:06,560
of a physician making the wrong
 

5564
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:09,109
of a physician making the wrong
inference the wrong prediction because

5565
01:43:09,109 --> 01:43:09,119
inference the wrong prediction because
 

5566
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:12,229
inference the wrong prediction because
of being experientially blind

5567
01:43:12,229 --> 01:43:12,239
of being experientially blind
 

5568
01:43:12,239 --> 01:43:15,669
of being experientially blind
so we are

5569
01:43:15,669 --> 01:43:15,679

 

5570
01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:18,149

you know empathy is not um it's not

5571
01:43:18,149 --> 01:43:18,159
you know empathy is not um it's not
 

5572
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,629
you know empathy is not um it's not
magic

5573
01:43:20,629 --> 01:43:20,639
magic
 

5574
01:43:20,639 --> 01:43:23,510
magic
it's we make inferences about each other

5575
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,520
it's we make inferences about each other
 

5576
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,350
it's we make inferences about each other
about what each other's feeling and

5577
01:43:25,350 --> 01:43:25,360
about what each other's feeling and
 

5578
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:26,149
about what each other's feeling and
thinking

5579
01:43:26,149 --> 01:43:26,159
thinking
 

5580
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:28,550
thinking
in this culture more than there are some

5581
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:28,560
in this culture more than there are some
 

5582
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,669
in this culture more than there are some
cultures where

5583
01:43:29,669 --> 01:43:29,679
cultures where
 

5584
01:43:29,679 --> 01:43:32,390
cultures where
you know people have what's called

5585
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:32,400
you know people have what's called
 

5586
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:33,910
you know people have what's called
opacity of mind where they

5587
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:33,920
opacity of mind where they
 

5588
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,109
opacity of mind where they
will make a prediction about someone

5589
01:43:35,109 --> 01:43:35,119
will make a prediction about someone
 

5590
01:43:35,119 --> 01:43:36,709
will make a prediction about someone
else's actions but they're not inferring

5591
01:43:36,709 --> 01:43:36,719
else's actions but they're not inferring
 

5592
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:38,229
else's actions but they're not inferring
anything about the internal state of

5593
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:38,239
anything about the internal state of
 

5594
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,830
anything about the internal state of
that person

5595
01:43:39,830 --> 01:43:39,840
that person
 

5596
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,229
that person
but in our culture we're constantly

5597
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,239
but in our culture we're constantly
 

5598
01:43:42,239 --> 01:43:44,070
but in our culture we're constantly
making inferences what is this person

5599
01:43:44,070 --> 01:43:44,080
making inferences what is this person
 

5600
01:43:44,080 --> 01:43:45,750
making inferences what is this person
thinking what is and we're not doing it

5601
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:45,760
thinking what is and we're not doing it
 

5602
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,910
thinking what is and we're not doing it
necessarily consciously but it's doing

5603
01:43:47,910 --> 01:43:47,920
necessarily consciously but it's doing
 

5604
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:49,750
necessarily consciously but it's doing
it really automatically using our

5605
01:43:49,750 --> 01:43:49,760
it really automatically using our
 

5606
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,950
it really automatically using our
predictions what we know and

5607
01:43:52,950 --> 01:43:52,960
predictions what we know and
 

5608
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:56,870
predictions what we know and
if you expose yourself to

5609
01:43:56,870 --> 01:43:56,880
if you expose yourself to
 

5610
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:58,470
if you expose yourself to
information which is very different from

5611
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:58,480
information which is very different from
 

5612
01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:00,229
information which is very different from
somebody else i mean

5613
01:44:00,229 --> 01:44:00,239
somebody else i mean
 

5614
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:03,109
somebody else i mean
really what we have is we have different

5615
01:44:03,109 --> 01:44:03,119
really what we have is we have different
 

5616
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,550
really what we have is we have different
cultures in this

5617
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:04,560
cultures in this
 

5618
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:07,109
cultures in this
in this country right now that are there

5619
01:44:07,109 --> 01:44:07,119
in this country right now that are there
 

5620
01:44:07,119 --> 01:44:08,310
in this country right now that are there
are a number of reasons

5621
01:44:08,310 --> 01:44:08,320
are a number of reasons
 

5622
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,910
are a number of reasons
for this i mean part of it is i don't

5623
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:09,920
for this i mean part of it is i don't
 

5624
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:12,470
for this i mean part of it is i don't
know if you saw the social dilemma the

5625
01:44:12,470 --> 01:44:12,480
know if you saw the social dilemma the
 

5626
01:44:12,480 --> 01:44:15,669
know if you saw the social dilemma the
the netflix um uh part about it yeah

5627
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:15,679
the netflix um uh part about it yeah
 

5628
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:17,030
the netflix um uh part about it yeah
it's a great

5629
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:17,040
it's a great
 

5630
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:20,790
it's a great
it's really great um documentary and uh

5631
01:44:20,790 --> 01:44:20,800
it's really great um documentary and uh
 

5632
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:22,390
it's really great um documentary and uh
about what social networks are doing to

5633
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:22,400
about what social networks are doing to
 

5634
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:24,629
about what social networks are doing to
our society yeah yeah

5635
01:44:24,629 --> 01:44:24,639
our society yeah yeah
 

5636
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:29,350
our society yeah yeah
but you know nothing no phenomenon has a

5637
01:44:29,350 --> 01:44:29,360
but you know nothing no phenomenon has a
 

5638
01:44:29,360 --> 01:44:33,590
but you know nothing no phenomenon has a
a simple single cause there are multiple

5639
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
a simple single cause there are multiple
 

5640
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,070
a simple single cause there are multiple
small causes which all add up to a

5641
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:36,080
small causes which all add up to a
 

5642
01:44:36,080 --> 01:44:37,430
small causes which all add up to a
perfect storm that's

5643
01:44:37,430 --> 01:44:37,440
perfect storm that's
 

5644
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:40,470
perfect storm that's
that's just you know how most things

5645
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:40,480
that's just you know how most things
 

5646
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,750
that's just you know how most things
work

5647
01:44:41,750 --> 01:44:41,760
work
 

5648
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:44,470
work
and so the fact that machine learning

5649
01:44:44,470 --> 01:44:44,480
and so the fact that machine learning
 

5650
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,310
and so the fact that machine learning
algorithms are serving people

5651
01:44:46,310 --> 01:44:46,320
algorithms are serving people
 

5652
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,109
algorithms are serving people
up information on social media that is

5653
01:44:49,109 --> 01:44:49,119
up information on social media that is
 

5654
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:50,310
up information on social media that is
consistent with what they've already

5655
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:50,320
consistent with what they've already
 

5656
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,189
consistent with what they've already
viewed

5657
01:44:51,189 --> 01:44:51,199
viewed
 

5658
01:44:51,199 --> 01:44:54,229
viewed
and making you know um

5659
01:44:54,229 --> 01:44:54,239
and making you know um
 

5660
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,310
and making you know um
is part of the reason that you have

5661
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:56,320
is part of the reason that you have
 

5662
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:59,189
is part of the reason that you have
these silos but it's not the only reason

5663
01:44:59,189 --> 01:44:59,199
these silos but it's not the only reason
 

5664
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,350
these silos but it's not the only reason
why you have these silos i think there

5665
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:01,360
why you have these silos i think there
 

5666
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:02,709
why you have these silos i think there
are other

5667
01:45:02,709 --> 01:45:02,719
are other
 

5668
01:45:02,719 --> 01:45:06,070
are other
there are other things afoot that uh

5669
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:06,080
there are other things afoot that uh
 

5670
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:11,510
there are other things afoot that uh
enhance um people's inability to

5671
01:45:11,510 --> 01:45:11,520
enhance um people's inability to
 

5672
01:45:11,520 --> 01:45:13,590
enhance um people's inability to
even have a decent conversation yeah i

5673
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:13,600
even have a decent conversation yeah i
 

5674
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:14,629
even have a decent conversation yeah i
mean okay so

5675
01:45:14,629 --> 01:45:14,639
mean okay so
 

5676
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:16,070
mean okay so
so many things you said are just

5677
01:45:16,070 --> 01:45:16,080
so many things you said are just
 

5678
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:17,830
so many things you said are just
brilliant so the experiment

5679
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:17,840
brilliant so the experiment
 

5680
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,870
brilliant so the experiment
experiential blindness but also from my

5681
01:45:20,870 --> 01:45:20,880
experiential blindness but also from my
 

5682
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:21,669
experiential blindness but also from my
perspective

5683
01:45:21,669 --> 01:45:21,679
perspective
 

5684
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:25,590
perspective
like i i preach and i try to practice

5685
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:25,600
like i i preach and i try to practice
 

5686
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:28,629
like i i preach and i try to practice
empathy a lot and something about the

5687
01:45:28,629 --> 01:45:28,639
empathy a lot and something about the
 

5688
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,709
empathy a lot and something about the
way you've explained it

5689
01:45:30,709 --> 01:45:30,719
way you've explained it
 

5690
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:32,950
way you've explained it
makes me almost see it as a kind of

5691
01:45:32,950 --> 01:45:32,960
makes me almost see it as a kind of
 

5692
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:34,470
makes me almost see it as a kind of
exercise that we should all do

5693
01:45:34,470 --> 01:45:34,480
exercise that we should all do
 

5694
01:45:34,480 --> 01:45:37,669
exercise that we should all do
like to train like to add experiences

5695
01:45:37,669 --> 01:45:37,679
like to train like to add experiences
 

5696
01:45:37,679 --> 01:45:41,109
like to train like to add experiences
to the brain to expand this capacity to

5697
01:45:41,109 --> 01:45:41,119
to the brain to expand this capacity to
 

5698
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,669
to the brain to expand this capacity to
predict more effectively absolutely so

5699
01:45:43,669 --> 01:45:43,679
predict more effectively absolutely so
 

5700
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:44,550
predict more effectively absolutely so
like what

5701
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:44,560
like what
 

5702
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,550
like what
like what i do is kind of like a method

5703
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:46,560
like what i do is kind of like a method
 

5704
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,550
like what i do is kind of like a method
acting thing which is

5705
01:45:48,550 --> 01:45:48,560
acting thing which is
 

5706
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,629
acting thing which is
i imagine what the life of a person is

5707
01:45:50,629 --> 01:45:50,639
i imagine what the life of a person is
 

5708
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:51,750
i imagine what the life of a person is
like

5709
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:51,760
like
 

5710
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:54,149
like
you know just think i mean this is

5711
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:54,159
you know just think i mean this is
 

5712
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,510
you know just think i mean this is
something you see with black lives

5713
01:45:55,510 --> 01:45:55,520
something you see with black lives
 

5714
01:45:55,520 --> 01:45:55,990
something you see with black lives
matter

5715
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,000
matter
 

5716
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,790
matter
and uh police officers it feels like

5717
01:45:58,790 --> 01:45:58,800
and uh police officers it feels like
 

5718
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,229
and uh police officers it feels like
they're both

5719
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:00,239
they're both
 

5720
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,270

01:48:56,709 --> 01:48:56,719
realize like they just the the way that
 

5888
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:58,470
realize like they just the the way that
these situations are constructed i think

5889
01:48:58,470 --> 01:48:58,480
these situations are constructed i think
 

5890
01:48:58,480 --> 01:48:59,590
these situations are constructed i think
it's just

5891
01:48:59,590 --> 01:48:59,600
it's just
 

5892
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,270
it's just
there's a lot to be said there i guess

5893
01:49:01,270 --> 01:49:01,280
there's a lot to be said there i guess
 

5894
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:03,430
there's a lot to be said there i guess
is what i wanted is there something we

5895
01:49:03,430 --> 01:49:03,440
is what i wanted is there something we
 

5896
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,950
is what i wanted is there something we
can try to say

5897
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:04,960
can try to say
 

5898
01:49:04,960 --> 01:49:07,910
can try to say
in a sense like what i'm from the

5899
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:07,920
in a sense like what i'm from the
 

5900
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,510
in a sense like what i'm from the
perspective of the predictive brain

5901
01:49:09,510 --> 01:49:09,520
perspective of the predictive brain
 

5902
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:10,550
perspective of the predictive brain
which is a

5903
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:10,560
which is a
 

5904
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:13,750
which is a
fascinating perspective uh to take on

5905
01:49:13,750 --> 01:49:13,760
fascinating perspective uh to take on
 

5906
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:14,950
fascinating perspective uh to take on
this

5907
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:14,960
this
 

5908
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:17,109
this
you know the all the protests are going

5909
01:49:17,109 --> 01:49:17,119
you know the all the protests are going
 

5910
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,070
you know the all the protests are going
on

5911
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:18,080
on
 

5912
01:49:18,080 --> 01:49:20,550
on
there seems to be a concept of a police

5913
01:49:20,550 --> 01:49:20,560
there seems to be a concept of a police
 

5914
01:49:20,560 --> 01:49:22,390
there seems to be a concept of a police
officer being built

5915
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:22,400
officer being built
 

5916
01:49:22,400 --> 01:49:23,830
officer being built
no i think that police i think that

5917
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:23,840
no i think that police i think that
 

5918
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,510
no i think that police i think that
concept is there

5919
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:25,520
concept is there
 

5920
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,310
concept is there
but it's is gaining strength so it's

5921
01:49:28,310 --> 01:49:28,320
but it's is gaining strength so it's
 

5922
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,390
but it's is gaining strength so it's
being re-um

5923
01:49:30,390 --> 01:49:30,400
being re-um
 

5924
01:49:30,400 --> 01:49:33,189
being re-um
i mean yeah it is sure it is there but i

5925
01:49:33,189 --> 01:49:33,199
i mean yeah it is sure it is there but i
 

5926
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:33,669
i mean yeah it is sure it is there but i
think

5927
01:49:33,669 --> 01:49:33,679
think
 

5928
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:35,350
think
yeah for sure i think that that's right

5929
01:49:35,350 --> 01:49:35,360
yeah for sure i think that that's right
 

5930
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:38,629
yeah for sure i think that that's right
i think that there's um

5931
01:49:38,629 --> 01:49:38,639
i think that there's um
 

5932
01:49:38,639 --> 01:49:41,669
i think that there's um
there's a shift in the

5933
01:49:41,669 --> 01:49:41,679
there's a shift in the
 

5934
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:43,589
there's a shift in the
stereotype of what i would say is a

5935
01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
stereotype of what i would say is a
 

5936
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,830
stereotype of what i would say is a
stereotype there's a stereotype of

5937
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:45,840
stereotype there's a stereotype of
 

5938
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:48,790
stereotype there's a stereotype of
of uh black man in this country that's

5939
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:48,800
of uh black man in this country that's
 

5940
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:49,350
of uh black man in this country that's
always

5941
01:49:49,350 --> 01:49:49,360
always
 

5942
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:51,270

in movies and television not always but
 

5944
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,629
in movies and television not always but
like largely

5945
01:49:52,629 --> 01:49:52,639
like largely
 

5946
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,550
like largely
um that many people watch

5947
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:56,560
um that many people watch
 

5948
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:58,629
um that many people watch

watching a 10 o'clock drama
 

5952
01:50:00,159 --> 01:50:01,669
watching a 10 o'clock drama
and all you're doing is like kicking

5953
01:50:01,669 --> 01:50:01,679
and all you're doing is like kicking
 

5954
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,830
and all you're doing is like kicking
back and relaxing but actually

5955
01:50:03,830 --> 01:50:03,840
back and relaxing but actually
 

5956
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:06,070
back and relaxing but actually
you're having certain predictions

01:50:06,070 --> 01:50:06,080
you're having certain predictions
 

5958
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,950
you're having certain predictions

and others not and what's happening
 

5962
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:11,510

01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:11,520
what's happening now with police
 

5964
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:14,149
what's happening now with police
is the same thing um that there are

5965
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:14,159
is the same thing um that there are
 

5966
01:50:14,159 --> 01:50:16,790
is the same thing um that there are
certain stereotypes of a police officer

5967

certain stereotypes of a police officer
 

5968

stereotypes that are being reinforced
 

5972
01:50:21,119 --> 01:50:24,470
stereotypes that are being reinforced
by by what you see happening all i'll

5973
01:50:24,470 --> 01:50:24,480
by by what you see happening all i'll
 

5974
01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:25,430
by by what you see happening all i'll
say is that

5975
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,440
say is that
 

5976
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,189
say is that
if you remember i mean there's a lot to

5977
01:50:27,189 --> 01:50:27,199
if you remember i mean there's a lot to
 

5978
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:28,470
if you remember i mean there's a lot to
say about this really

5979
01:50:28,470 --> 01:50:28,480
say about this really
 

5980
01:50:28,480 --> 01:50:32,310
say about this really
that you know regardless of whether it

5981
01:50:32,310 --> 01:50:32,320
that you know regardless of whether it
 

5982
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,830
that you know regardless of whether it
makes people mad or not i mean i just

5983
01:50:33,830 --> 01:50:33,840
makes people mad or not i mean i just
 

5984
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,589
makes people mad or not i mean i just
i the science is what it is um

5985
01:50:37,589 --> 01:50:37,599
i the science is what it is um
 

5986
01:50:37,599 --> 01:50:40,629
i the science is what it is um
just remember what i said the brain

5987
01:50:40,629 --> 01:50:40,639
just remember what i said the brain
 

5988
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:45,030
just remember what i said the brain
is makes predictions about internal

5989
01:50:45,030 --> 01:50:45,040
is makes predictions about internal
 

5990
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:47,030
is makes predictions about internal
changes in the body first and then motor

5991
01:50:47,030 --> 01:50:47,040
changes in the body first and then motor
 

5992
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:49,109
changes in the body first and then motor
it starts to prepare motor action

5993
01:50:49,109 --> 01:50:49,119
it starts to prepare motor action
 

5994
01:50:49,119 --> 01:50:52,149
it starts to prepare motor action
and then it makes a prediction about

5995
01:50:52,149 --> 01:50:52,159
and then it makes a prediction about
 

5996
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:54,070
and then it makes a prediction about
what you will see and hear and feel

5997
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:54,080
what you will see and hear and feel
 

5998
01:50:54,080 --> 01:50:57,270
what you will see and hear and feel
based on those actions okay

5999
01:50:57,270 --> 01:50:57,280
based on those actions okay
 

6000
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,870
based on those actions okay
so it's also the case that

6001
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:00,880
so it's also the case that
 

6002
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:03,510
so it's also the case that
we didn't talk about is that sensory

6003
01:51:03,510 --> 01:51:03,520
we didn't talk about is that sensory
 

6004
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:04,229
we didn't talk about is that sensory
sampling

6005
01:51:04,229 --> 01:51:04,239
sampling
 

6006
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:06,149
sampling
like your brain's ability to sample

6007
01:51:06,149 --> 01:51:06,159
like your brain's ability to sample
 

6008
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:08,149
like your brain's ability to sample
what's out there

6009
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
what's out there
 

6010
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:11,510
what's out there
is yoked to your heart rate it's yoke to

6011
01:51:11,510 --> 01:51:11,520
is yoked to your heart rate it's yoke to
 

6012
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:12,790
is yoked to your heart rate it's yoke to
your heartbeats

6013
01:51:12,790 --> 01:51:12,800
your heartbeats
 

6014
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:14,229
your heartbeats
there are certain phases of the

6015
01:51:14,229 --> 01:51:14,239
there are certain phases of the
 

6016
01:51:14,239 --> 01:51:16,390
there are certain phases of the
heartbeat where it's easier for you to

6017
01:51:16,390 --> 01:51:16,400
heartbeat where it's easier for you to
 

6018
01:51:16,400 --> 01:51:16,950
heartbeat where it's easier for you to
see

6019
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:16,960
see
 

6020
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:18,830
see
what's happening in the world than in

6021
01:51:18,830 --> 01:51:18,840
what's happening in the world than in
 

6022
01:51:18,840 --> 01:51:20,070
what's happening in the world than in
others

6023
01:51:20,070 --> 01:51:20,080
others
 

6024
01:51:20,080 --> 01:51:22,390
others
and so if your heart rate goes through

6025
01:51:22,390 --> 01:51:22,400
and so if your heart rate goes through
 

6026
01:51:22,400 --> 01:51:26,229
and so if your heart rate goes through
the roof

6027
01:51:26,229 --> 01:51:26,239

 

6028
01:51:26,239 --> 01:51:28,070

you will be less like you will be more

6029
01:51:28,070 --> 01:51:28,080
you will be less like you will be more
 

6030
01:51:28,080 --> 01:51:29,990
you will be less like you will be more
likely to just go with your prediction

6031
01:51:29,990 --> 01:51:30,000
likely to just go with your prediction
 

6032
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,589
likely to just go with your prediction
and not correct based on what you

6033
01:51:33,589 --> 01:51:33,599
and not correct based on what you
 

6034
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:36,070
and not correct based on what you
what's out there because you're actually

6035
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:36,080
what's out there because you're actually
 

6036
01:51:36,080 --> 01:51:39,030
what's out there because you're actually
literally not seeing as well

6037
01:51:39,030 --> 01:51:39,040
literally not seeing as well
 

6038
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:41,109
literally not seeing as well
or you will see things that aren't there

6039
01:51:41,109 --> 01:51:41,119
or you will see things that aren't there
 

6040
01:51:41,119 --> 01:51:43,589
or you will see things that aren't there
basically

6041
01:51:43,589 --> 01:51:43,599
basically
 

6042
01:51:43,599 --> 01:51:45,910
basically
is there something that we could say in

6043
01:51:45,910 --> 01:51:45,920
is there something that we could say in
 

6044
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:48,390
is there something that we could say in

is expensive and if it goes on for long
enough

6211
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:48,960
enough
 

6212
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:51,430
enough
what happens is first of all you will

6213
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:51,440
what happens is first of all you will
 

6214
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,589
what happens is first of all you will
feel really jittery and antsy

6215
01:54:53,589 --> 01:54:53,599
feel really jittery and antsy
 

6216
01:54:53,599 --> 01:54:56,790
feel really jittery and antsy
which we describe as anxiety

6217
01:54:56,790 --> 01:54:56,800
which we describe as anxiety
 

6218
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,669
which we describe as anxiety
it isn't necessarily anxiety it could be

6219
01:54:59,669 --> 01:54:59,679
it isn't necessarily anxiety it could be
 

6220
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:02,629
it isn't necessarily anxiety it could be
just

6221
01:55:02,629 --> 01:55:02,639

 

6222
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,189

something is not predictable and you are

6223
01:55:05,189 --> 01:55:05,199
something is not predictable and you are
 

6224
01:55:05,199 --> 01:55:07,350
something is not predictable and you are
experiencing arousal because

6225
01:55:07,350 --> 01:55:07,360
experiencing arousal because
 

6226
01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:09,910
experiencing arousal because
the chemicals that help you learn

6227
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:09,920
the chemicals that help you learn
 

6228
01:55:09,920 --> 01:55:10,629
the chemicals that help you learn
increase

6229
01:55:10,629 --> 01:55:10,639
increase
 

6230
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:13,430
increase
your feeling of arousal basically but if

6231
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:13,440
your feeling of arousal basically but if
 

6232
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,030
your feeling of arousal basically but if
it goes on for long enough

6233
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:15,040
it goes on for long enough
 

6234
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,550
it goes on for long enough
you will become depleted you will start

6235
01:55:18,550 --> 01:55:18,560
you will become depleted you will start
 

6236
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:19,109
you will become depleted you will start
to feel

6237
01:55:19,109 --> 01:55:19,119
to feel
 

6238
01:55:19,119 --> 01:55:22,310
to feel
really really really distressed so what

6239
01:55:22,310 --> 01:55:22,320
really really really distressed so what
 

6240
01:55:22,320 --> 01:55:23,589
really really really distressed so what
we have

6241
01:55:23,589 --> 01:55:23,599
we have
 

6242
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:26,870
we have
is a culture full of people right now

6243
01:55:26,870 --> 01:55:26,880
is a culture full of people right now
 

6244
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,750
is a culture full of people right now
who are their body budgets are just

6245
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:29,760
who are their body budgets are just
 

6246
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:31,270
who are their body budgets are just
decimated

6247
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:31,280
decimated
 

6248
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,589
decimated
yeah and there's a tremendous amount of

6249
01:55:33,589 --> 01:55:33,599
yeah and there's a tremendous amount of
 

6250
01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:36,550
yeah and there's a tremendous amount of
uncertainty

6251
01:55:36,550 --> 01:55:36,560

 

6252
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:39,030

when you talk about it as depression

6253
01:55:39,030 --> 01:55:39,040
when you talk about it as depression
 

6254
01:55:39,040 --> 01:55:39,669

anxiety
 

6256
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:42,709
anxiety
it makes you think that it's not about

6257
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:42,719
it makes you think that it's not about
 

6258
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:44,709
it makes you think that it's not about
your metabolism that it's not about your

6259
01:55:44,709 --> 01:55:44,719
your metabolism that it's not about your
 

6260
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:46,470
your metabolism that it's not about your
body budgeting that

6261
01:55:46,470 --> 01:55:46,480
body budgeting that
 

6262
01:55:46,480 --> 01:55:48,470
body budgeting that
it's not about getting enough sleep or

6263
01:55:48,470 --> 01:55:48,480
it's not about getting enough sleep or
 

6264
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:49,510
it's not about getting enough sleep or
about eating

6265
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:49,520
about eating
 

6266
01:55:49,520 --> 01:55:51,669
about eating
well or about making sure that you have

6267
01:55:51,669 --> 01:55:51,679
well or about making sure that you have
 

6268
01:55:51,679 --> 01:55:53,030
well or about making sure that you have
social connections

6269
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:53,040
social connections
 

6270
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:55,669
social connections
um it's you know it's you think that

6271
01:55:55,669 --> 01:55:55,679
um it's you know it's you think that
 

6272
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:57,030
um it's you know it's you think that
it's something separate from that but

6273
01:55:57,030 --> 01:55:57,040
it's something separate from that but
 

6274
01:55:57,040 --> 01:55:58,950
it's something separate from that but
depression anxiety are just a way of

6275
01:55:58,950 --> 01:55:58,960
depression anxiety are just a way of
 

6276
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:01,510
depression anxiety are just a way of
being in the world

6277
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:01,520
being in the world
 

6278
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:04,229
being in the world
they're a way of being in the world when

6279
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:04,239
they're a way of being in the world when
 

6280
01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:05,830
they're a way of being in the world when
things aren't quite right with your

6281
01:56:05,830 --> 01:56:05,840
things aren't quite right with your
 

6282
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,550
things aren't quite right with your
predictions

6283
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:08,560

 

6284
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:10,709

that's such a deep way of thinking like

6285
01:56:10,709 --> 01:56:10,719
that's such a deep way of thinking like
 

6286
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:13,589
that's such a deep way of thinking like
the the brain is

6287
01:56:13,589 --> 01:56:13,599
the the brain is
 

6288
01:56:13,599 --> 01:56:16,870
the the brain is
maintaining homeostasis it's actually

6289
01:56:16,870 --> 01:56:16,880
maintaining homeostasis it's actually
 

6290
01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:17,750
maintaining homeostasis it's actually
allostational

6291
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:17,760
allostational
 

6292
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,950
allostational
stasis i'm sorry uh and it's it's

6293
01:56:20,950 --> 01:56:20,960
stasis i'm sorry uh and it's it's
 

6294
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:22,790
stasis i'm sorry uh and it's it's
constantly making predictions

6295
01:56:22,790 --> 01:56:22,800
constantly making predictions
 

6296
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:24,709
constantly making predictions
and metabolically speaking it's very

6297
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:24,719
and metabolically speaking it's very
 

6298
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,550
and metabolically speaking it's very
costly to make novel

6299
01:56:26,550 --> 01:56:26,560
costly to make novel
 

6300
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:28,790
costly to make novel
like constantly be learning to making

6301
01:56:28,790 --> 01:56:28,800
like constantly be learning to making
 

6302
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,750
like constantly be learning to making
adjustments

6303
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:29,760
adjustments
 

6304
01:56:29,760 --> 01:56:31,830
adjustments
and then over time there's you know

6305
01:56:31,830 --> 01:56:31,840
and then over time there's you know
 

6306
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:33,350
and then over time there's you know
there's a

6307
01:56:33,350 --> 01:56:33,360
there's a
 

6308
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:37,430
there's a
cost to be paid if you're just yeah in

6309
01:56:37,430 --> 01:56:37,440
cost to be paid if you're just yeah in
 

6310
01:56:37,440 --> 01:56:40,790
cost to be paid if you're just yeah in
in in a place of chaos where there's

6311
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:40,800
in in a place of chaos where there's
 

6312
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,830
in in a place of chaos where there's
constant need for adjusting and learning

6313
01:56:43,830 --> 01:56:43,840
constant need for adjusting and learning
 

6314
01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,430
constant need for adjusting and learning
and experience novel things and so part

6315
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:47,440
and experience novel things and so part
 

6316
01:56:47,440 --> 01:56:49,350
and experience novel things and so part
of the problem here

6317
01:56:49,350 --> 01:56:49,360
of the problem here
 

6318
01:56:49,360 --> 01:56:50,870
of the problem here
there are a couple of things like i said

6319
01:56:50,870 --> 01:56:50,880
there are a couple of things like i said
 

6320
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:52,550
there are a couple of things like i said
you know it's a perfect storm there

6321
01:56:52,550 --> 01:56:52,560
you know it's a perfect storm there
 

6322
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:54,070
you know it's a perfect storm there
isn't a single cause

6323
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:54,080
isn't a single cause
 

6324
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:56,149
isn't a single cause
right there are multiple cause multiple

6325
01:56:56,149 --> 01:56:56,159
right there are multiple cause multiple
 

6326
01:56:56,159 --> 01:56:57,589
right there are multiple cause multiple
things that combine together it's a

6327
01:56:57,589 --> 01:56:57,599
things that combine together it's a
 

6328
01:56:57,599 --> 01:56:58,390
things that combine together it's a
complex

6329
01:56:58,390 --> 01:56:58,400
complex
 

6330
01:56:58,400 --> 01:57:01,430
complex
it's a complex system multiple things

6331
01:57:01,430 --> 01:57:01,440
it's a complex system multiple things
 

6332
01:57:01,440 --> 01:57:04,709
it's a complex system multiple things
part of it is that um people are

6333
01:57:04,709 --> 01:57:04,719
part of it is that um people are
 

6334
01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:07,910
part of it is that um people are
they're they're metabolically encumbered

what does it mean for a brain to stop

6361
01:57:38,870 --> 01:57:38,880
what does it mean for a brain to stop

a brain stops moving very much stops
 

6366
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:44,870
a brain stops moving very much stops
moving the body

6367
01:57:44,870 --> 01:57:44,880
moving the body
 

6368
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:47,510
moving the body
and it stops learning it just goes with

the book and when i realized the
 

6620
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,350
the book and when i realized the
insights that i was sort of like playing

6621
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
insights that i was sort of like playing
 

6622
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:31,990
insights that i was sort of like playing
around with

this make sense i didn't
immediately plunge into it i basically

6629
02:02:38,070 --> 02:02:38,080
immediately plunge into it i basically
 

6630
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:39,430
immediately plunge into it i basically
wrote some stuff down

6631
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:39,440
wrote some stuff down
 

6632
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:42,550
wrote some stuff down
i set it aside and then i did what i i

6633
02:02:42,550 --> 02:02:42,560
i set it aside and then i did what i i
 

6634
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,950
i set it aside and then i did what i i
prepared myself to make an expenditure i

shake

6641
02:02:49,189 --> 02:02:49,199
shake
 

6642
02:02:49,199 --> 02:02:51,350
shake
always have a protein shake because i

6643
02:02:51,350 --> 02:02:51,360
always have a protein shake because i
 

6644
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:53,510
always have a protein shake because i
need to fuel up before i make this

6645
02:02:53,510 --> 02:02:53,520
need to fuel up before i make this

6650
02:02:58,239 --> 02:03:00,149
and so i did the same thing
i didn't have a protein drink but i um

6651
02:03:00,149 --> 02:03:00,159
i didn't have a protein drink but i um
 

6652

that would screw up a human body budget
 

6742
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,229
that would screw up a human body budget
it would be the one that we live in

6752
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:54,229
full of ambiguity which is really hard
for

6753

for
 

6754
02:04:54,239 --> 02:04:56,229
for
a human nervous system right really

6755
02:04:56,229 --> 02:04:56,239
a human nervous system right really
 

6756
02:04:56,239 --> 02:04:57,430
a human nervous system right really
really hard like

really hard like
 

6758
02:04:57,440 --> 02:04:59,589
really hard like
ambiguity with no context to predict it

6759
02:04:59,589 --> 02:04:59,599
ambiguity with no context to predict it
 

6760
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:00,629
ambiguity with no context to predict it
i mean it's like

02:05:00,629 --> 02:05:00,639
i mean it's like
 

6762

really and then you know there are the
 

6764
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:03,990
really and then you know there are the
economic concerns that

6765
02:05:03,990 --> 02:05:04,000
economic concerns that
 

6766
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,830

you i'm not saying everything is

6771
02:05:09,350 --> 02:05:09,360
you i'm not saying everything is
 

6772
02:05:09,360 --> 02:05:10,950
you i'm not saying everything is
reducible to

6773
02:05:10,950 --> 02:05:10,960
reducible to
 

6774
02:05:10,960 --> 02:05:12,870
reducible to
metabolism not everything is reducible

6775
02:05:12,870 --> 02:05:12,880
metabolism not everything is reducible
 

6776
02:05:12,880 --> 02:05:14,790
metabolism not everything is reducible
to metabolism but

6777
02:05:14,790 --> 02:05:14,800
to metabolism but
 

6778
02:05:14,800 --> 02:05:17,510
to metabolism but
there if you combine all these things

6779
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:17,520
there if you combine all these things
 

6780
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:18,390
there if you combine all these things
together

6781
02:05:18,390 --> 02:05:18,400
together
 

6782
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:19,990
together
it's helpful to think of it that way

6783
02:05:19,990 --> 02:05:20,000
it's helpful to think of it that way
 

6784
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,910
it's helpful to think of it that way
then somehow it's also

6785
02:05:21,910 --> 02:05:21,920
then somehow it's also
 

6786
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:25,990
then somehow it's also
uh somehow reduces the entirety of the

6787
02:05:25,990 --> 02:05:26,000
uh somehow reduces the entirety of the
 

6788
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,669
uh somehow reduces the entirety of the
human experience the same kind of

6789

human experience the same kind of
 

6790
02:05:27,679 --> 02:05:29,510
human experience the same kind of
obvious logic like we should exercise

6791
02:05:29,510 --> 02:05:29,520
obvious logic like we should exercise
 

6792
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:31,589
obvious logic like we should exercise
every day in the same kind of way

6793
02:05:31,589 --> 02:05:31,599
every day in the same kind of way
 

6794

every day in the same kind of way
we should uh we should empathize every
