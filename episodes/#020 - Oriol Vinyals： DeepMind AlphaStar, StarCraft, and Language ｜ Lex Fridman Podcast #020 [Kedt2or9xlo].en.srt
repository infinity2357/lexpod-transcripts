course in the 90s so how did you get
 

101
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,840
course in the 90s so how did you get
into StarCraft what was your favorite

102
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:10,850
into StarCraft what was your favorite
 

103
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:13,360
into StarCraft what was your favorite
race how do you develop how did you

develop your skill what was your

106
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:15,739
develop your skill what was your
 

107
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:18,520
develop your skill what was your
strategy all that kind of thing so as a

108
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,530
strategy all that kind of thing so as a
 

109
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,920
strategy all that kind of thing so as a
player I tended to try to play not many

110
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:20,930
player I tended to try to play not many
 

111
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,110
player I tended to try to play not many
games not to kind of disclose the

112
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:23,120
games not to kind of disclose the
 

113
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,090
games not to kind of disclose the
strategies that I kind of developed and

114
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:25,100
strategies that I kind of developed and
 

115
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:27,970
strategies that I kind of developed and
I like to play random actually not in

116
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:27,980
I like to play random actually not in
 

117
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,610
I like to play random actually not in
competitions but just to I think in

118
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:30,620
competitions but just to I think in
 

119
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,199
competitions but just to I think in
StarCraft there's well there's three

120
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:32,209
StarCraft there's well there's three
 

121
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:34,720
StarCraft there's well there's three
main races and I found it very useful to

122
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:34,730
main races and I found it very useful to
 

123
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:37,120
main races and I found it very useful to
play with all of them and so I would

124
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,130
play with all of them and so I would
 

125
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,099
play with all of them and so I would
choose random many times even sometimes

126
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:39,109
choose random many times even sometimes
 

127
00:02:39,109 --> 00:02:41,530
choose random many times even sometimes
in tournaments to gain skill on the

128
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:41,540
in tournaments to gain skill on the
 

129
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,660
in tournaments to gain skill on the
three races because it's not how you

130
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:43,670
three races because it's not how you
 

131
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,240
three races because it's not how you
play against someone but also if you

132
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:46,250
play against someone but also if you
 

133
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,400
play against someone but also if you
understand the race because you play it

134
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,410
understand the race because you play it
 

135
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,470
understand the race because you play it
you also understand what's annoying what

136
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
you also understand what's annoying what
 

137
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,690
you also understand what's annoying what
then when you're on the other side what

138
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:52,700
then when you're on the other side what
 

139
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,970
then when you're on the other side what
to do to annoy that person to try to

140
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:54,980
to do to annoy that person to try to
 

141
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,280
to do to annoy that person to try to
gain advantages here and there and so on

142
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,290
gain advantages here and there and so on
 

143
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:59,560
gain advantages here and there and so on
so I actually played random although I

144
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,570
so I actually played random although I
 

145
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,780
so I actually played random although I
must say in terms of favorite race I

146
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:01,790
must say in terms of favorite race I
 

147
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,750
must say in terms of favorite race I
really liked zerk I was probably best at

00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:04,760
really liked zerk I was probably best at
 

149
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,960
really liked zerk I was probably best at
Zerg and that's probably what I tend to

150
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:07,970
Zerg and that's probably what I tend to
 

151
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,670
Zerg and that's probably what I tend to
use towards the end of my career

152
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
use towards the end of my career
 

153
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,709
use towards the end of my career
year before starting University so let's

154
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:11,719
year before starting University so let's
 

155
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:13,990
year before starting University so let's
step back a little bit could you try to

156
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,000
step back a little bit could you try to
 

157
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,330
step back a little bit could you try to
describe Starcraft to people that may

the massively online variety right so

162
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:21,709
the massively online variety right so
 

163
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,220
the massively online variety right so
craft so Starcraft is a real-time

164
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,230
craft so Starcraft is a real-time
 

165
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,160
craft so Starcraft is a real-time
strategy game and the way to think about

166
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,170
strategy game and the way to think about
 

167
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,289
strategy game and the way to think about
Starcraft perhaps if you understand a

168
00:03:29,289 --> 00:03:29,299
Starcraft perhaps if you understand a
 

169
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:32,379
Starcraft perhaps if you understand a
bit chess is that there are there's a

170
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:32,389
bit chess is that there are there's a
 

171
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:35,559
bit chess is that there are there's a
board which is called map or or or the

172
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:35,569
board which is called map or or or the
 

173
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:38,289
board which is called map or or or the
gallic the map where people play against

174
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:38,299
gallic the map where people play against
 

175
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,330
gallic the map where people play against
each other there's obviously many ways

176
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:40,340
each other there's obviously many ways
 

177
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,520
each other there's obviously many ways
you can play but the most interesting

178
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,530
you can play but the most interesting
 

179
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,830
you can play but the most interesting
one is the one versus one setup where

180
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:44,840
one is the one versus one setup where
 

181
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,500
one is the one versus one setup where
you just play against someone else or

182
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:47,510
you just play against someone else or
 

183
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,599
you just play against someone else or
even the built in AI right the wizard

184
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:49,609
even the built in AI right the wizard
 

185
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,490
even the built in AI right the wizard
put a system that can play the game

186
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:51,500
put a system that can play the game
 

187
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,349
put a system that can play the game
reasonably well if you don't know how to

188
00:03:53,349 --> 00:03:53,359
reasonably well if you don't know how to
 

189
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:56,199
reasonably well if you don't know how to
play and then in this board you have

190
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:56,209
play and then in this board you have
 

191
00:03:56,209 --> 00:03:59,020
play and then in this board you have
again pieces like in chess but these

192
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,030
again pieces like in chess but these
 

193
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,720
again pieces like in chess but these
pieces are not there initially like they

194
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:01,730
pieces are not there initially like they
 

195
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,580
pieces are not there initially like they
are in chess you actually need to decide

196
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:03,590
are in chess you actually need to decide
 

197
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,640
are in chess you actually need to decide
to gather resources to decide which

198
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:06,650
to gather resources to decide which
 

199
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,619
to gather resources to decide which
pieces to build so in a way you're

200
00:04:08,619 --> 00:04:08,629
pieces to build so in a way you're
 

201
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:11,199
pieces to build so in a way you're
starting almost with no pieces you start

202
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:11,209
starting almost with no pieces you start
 

203
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,539
starting almost with no pieces you start
gathering resources in StarCraft there's

204
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:13,549
gathering resources in StarCraft there's
 

205
00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:15,490
gathering resources in StarCraft there's
minerals and gas that you you can gather

206
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:15,500
minerals and gas that you you can gather
 

207
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,909
minerals and gas that you you can gather
and then you must decide how much do you

208
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:18,919
and then you must decide how much do you
 

209
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:20,529
and then you must decide how much do you
want to focus for instance on gathering

210
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:20,539
want to focus for instance on gathering
 

211
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:22,300
want to focus for instance on gathering
more resources or starting to build

212
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:22,310
more resources or starting to build
 

213
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,110
more resources or starting to build
units or pieces and then once you have

214
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,120
units or pieces and then once you have
 

215
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,219
units or pieces and then once you have
enough pieces or maybe like attack you

216
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:30,229
enough pieces or maybe like attack you
 

217
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,439
enough pieces or maybe like attack you
know a good attack composition then you

218
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:32,449
know a good attack composition then you
 

219
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,899
know a good attack composition then you
go and attack the other side of the map

220
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:34,909
go and attack the other side of the map
 

221
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:37,390
go and attack the other side of the map
and now the other main difference with

222
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,400
and now the other main difference with
 

223
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,980
and now the other main difference with
chess is that you don't see the other

224
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:38,990
chess is that you don't see the other
 

225
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,770
chess is that you don't see the other
side of the map so you're not seeing the

226
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:41,780
side of the map so you're not seeing the
 

227
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,990
side of the map so you're not seeing the
moves of the enemy it's what we call

228
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,000
moves of the enemy it's what we call
 

229
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,070
moves of the enemy it's what we call
partially observable

230
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:45,080
partially observable
 

231
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,430
partially observable
so as a result you must not only decide

232
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:48,440
so as a result you must not only decide
 

233
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,249
so as a result you must not only decide
Trading of economy versus building your

234
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:51,259
Trading of economy versus building your
 

235
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,439
Trading of economy versus building your
own units but you also must decide

236
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:53,449
own units but you also must decide
 

237
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:54,999
own units but you also must decide
whether you want to scout

238
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:55,009
whether you want to scout
 

239
00:04:55,009 --> 00:04:57,399
whether you want to scout
to gather information but also by

240
00:04:57,399 --> 00:04:57,409
to gather information but also by
 

241
00:04:57,409 --> 00:04:58,870
to gather information but also by
scouting you might be giving away some

242
00:04:58,870 --> 00:04:58,880
scouting you might be giving away some
 

243
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,850
scouting you might be giving away some
information that you might be hiding

244
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:00,860
information that you might be hiding
 

245
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,710
information that you might be hiding
from the enemy so there's a lot of

246
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:02,720
from the enemy so there's a lot of
 

247
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,680
from the enemy so there's a lot of
complex decision-making all in real-time

248
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:05,690
complex decision-making all in real-time
 

249
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,080
complex decision-making all in real-time
there's also unlike chess this is not a

250
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,090
there's also unlike chess this is not a
 

251
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:11,710
there's also unlike chess this is not a
turn-based game you play basically all

252
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:11,720
turn-based game you play basically all
 

253
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:15,070
turn-based game you play basically all
the time continuously and thus some

254
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,080
the time continuously and thus some
 

255
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,020
the time continuously and thus some
skill in terms of speed and accuracy of

256
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:17,030
skill in terms of speed and accuracy of
 

257
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,640
skill in terms of speed and accuracy of
clicking is also very important and

258
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:18,650
clicking is also very important and
 

259
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,040
clicking is also very important and
people that train for these really play

260
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,050
people that train for these really play
 

261
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,510
people that train for these really play
this game at an amazing skill

262
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
this game at an amazing skill
 

263
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,270
this game at an amazing skill
I've seen many times these and if you

264
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:26,280
I've seen many times these and if you
 

265
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,040
I've seen many times these and if you
can witness this life is really really

266
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,050
can witness this life is really really
 

267
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:30,740
can witness this life is really really
impressive so in a way it's kind of a

268
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:30,750
impressive so in a way it's kind of a
 

269
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,360
impressive so in a way it's kind of a
chess where you don't see the other side

270
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:32,370
chess where you don't see the other side
 

271
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,129
chess where you don't see the other side
of the board you're building your own

272
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:34,139
of the board you're building your own
 

273
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,409
of the board you're building your own
pieces and you also need to gather

274
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:36,419
pieces and you also need to gather
 

275
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,409
pieces and you also need to gather
resources to basically get some money to

276
00:05:39,409 --> 00:05:39,419
resources to basically get some money to
 

277
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,719
resources to basically get some money to
build other buildings pieces technology

278
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:41,729
build other buildings pieces technology
 

279
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:42,409
build other buildings pieces technology
and so on

280
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:42,419
and so on
 

281
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:44,659
and so on
from the perspective of the human player

282
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:44,669
from the perspective of the human player
 

283
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,300
from the perspective of the human player
the difference between that and chess or

284
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:47,310
the difference between that and chess or
 

285
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,119
the difference between that and chess or
maybe that and a game like turn-based

286
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:50,129
maybe that and a game like turn-based
 

287
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:52,249
maybe that and a game like turn-based
strategy like heroes a might of magic is

288
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:52,259
strategy like heroes a might of magic is
 

289
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:56,330
strategy like heroes a might of magic is
that there's an anxiety because you have

290
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,340
that there's an anxiety because you have
 

291
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,279
that there's an anxiety because you have
to make these decisions really quickly

292
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:58,289
to make these decisions really quickly
 

293
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:03,260
to make these decisions really quickly
and if you are not actually aware or

294
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,270
and if you are not actually aware or
 

295
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,029
and if you are not actually aware or
what decisions work it's a very

296
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:05,039
what decisions work it's a very
 

297
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,529
what decisions work it's a very
stressful balance the if there's

298
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:06,539
stressful balance the if there's
 

299
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,240
stressful balance the if there's
everything you describe is actually

300
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:08,250
everything you describe is actually
 

301
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,920
everything you describe is actually
quite stressful difficult to balance for

302
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:09,930
quite stressful difficult to balance for
 

303
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,170
quite stressful difficult to balance for
a mature human player I don't know if it

304
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:12,180
a mature human player I don't know if it
 

305
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,460
a mature human player I don't know if it
gets easier at the professional level

306
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:13,470
gets easier at the professional level
 

307
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,860
gets easier at the professional level
like if they're fully aware what they

308
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:15,870
like if they're fully aware what they
 

309
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,629
like if they're fully aware what they
have to do but at the amateur level

310
00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:17,639
have to do but at the amateur level
 

311
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,029
have to do but at the amateur level
there's this anxiety oh crap I'm being

312
00:06:20,029 --> 00:06:20,039
there's this anxiety oh crap I'm being
 

313
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:22,339
there's this anxiety oh crap I'm being
attacked oh crap I have to build up

314
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:22,349
attacked oh crap I have to build up
 

315
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:24,260
attacked oh crap I have to build up
resource oh I have to probably expand

316
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:24,270
resource oh I have to probably expand
 

317
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:27,170
resource oh I have to probably expand
and all these the time the real-time

318
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:27,180
and all these the time the real-time
 

319
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,629
and all these the time the real-time

computation I'm sure difficult we'll get
 

323
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,309
computation I'm sure difficult we'll get
into it but for me battlenet so

00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:03,540
Spain so we didn't have internet like
 

393
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,150
Spain so we didn't have internet like
very good internet right so there was

394
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:05,160
very good internet right so there was
 

395
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,820
very good internet right so there was
for us a Starcraft became first kind of

396
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:07,830
for us a Starcraft became first kind of
 

397
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,970
for us a Starcraft became first kind of
an offline experience where you kind of

398
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:10,980
an offline experience where you kind of
 

399
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,010
an offline experience where you kind of
start to play these missions right you

400
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,020
start to play these missions right you
 

401
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,990
start to play these missions right you
play against some sort of scripted

402
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,000
play against some sort of scripted
 

403
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
play against some sort of scripted
things to develop the story of the

404
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:17,400
things to develop the story of the
 

405
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,910
things to develop the story of the
characters in the game and then later on

406
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:19,920
characters in the game and then later on
 

407
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,540
characters in the game and then later on
I start playing against the butene AI

408
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:22,550
I start playing against the butene AI
 

409
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,890
I start playing against the butene AI
and I thought it was impossible to

410
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:24,900
and I thought it was impossible to
 

411
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,320
and I thought it was impossible to
defeat it then eventually you defeat one

412
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,330
defeat it then eventually you defeat one
 

413
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:29,330
defeat it then eventually you defeat one
and you can actually break n7 built in

414
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:29,340
and you can actually break n7 built in
 

415
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,430
and you can actually break n7 built in
the eyes at the same time which also

416
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:31,440
the eyes at the same time which also
 

417
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,010
the eyes at the same time which also
felt impossible but actually it's not

418
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:34,020
felt impossible but actually it's not
 

419
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,409
felt impossible but actually it's not
that hard to beat seven built-in eyes at

420
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:36,419
that hard to beat seven built-in eyes at
 

421
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:39,530
that hard to beat seven built-in eyes at
once so once we achieve that also we

422
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:39,540
once so once we achieve that also we
 

423
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,530
once so once we achieve that also we
discovered that we could play as I said

424
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:42,540
discovered that we could play as I said
 

425
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,240
discovered that we could play as I said
internet wasn't that great but we could

426
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,250
internet wasn't that great but we could
 

427
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,130
internet wasn't that great but we could
play with the land right on like

428
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:46,140
play with the land right on like
 

429
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,440
play with the land right on like
basically against each other if we were

430
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:48,450
basically against each other if we were
 

431
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,480
basically against each other if we were
in the same place because you could just

432
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:50,490
in the same place because you could just
 

433
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:52,810
in the same place because you could just
connect machines with like cables right

434
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:52,820
connect machines with like cables right
 

435
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,720
connect machines with like cables right
so we started playing in LAN mode and

436
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:55,730
so we started playing in LAN mode and
 

437
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,190
so we started playing in LAN mode and
again you know as a group of friends and

438
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:58,200
again you know as a group of friends and
 

439
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,930
again you know as a group of friends and
it was really really like much more

440
00:08:59,930 --> 00:08:59,940
it was really really like much more
 

441
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,370
it was really really like much more
entertaining than playing against the

442
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:01,380
entertaining than playing against the
 

443
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,100
entertaining than playing against the
eyes and later on as internet was

444
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:04,110
eyes and later on as internet was
 

445
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,810
eyes and later on as internet was
starting to develop and being a bit

446
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:05,820
starting to develop and being a bit
 

447
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,880
starting to develop and being a bit
faster and more reliable then it's when

448
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:07,890
faster and more reliable then it's when
 

449
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,860
faster and more reliable then it's when
I started experiencing battlenet which

450
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:09,870
I started experiencing battlenet which
 

451
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:11,750
I started experiencing battlenet which
is these amazing universe not only

452
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:11,760
is these amazing universe not only
 

453
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,330

you just get exposed to now like this
 

463
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,230
you just get exposed to now like this
vast variety of it's kind of a bit when

464
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:24,240
vast variety of it's kind of a bit when
 

465
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,150
vast variety of it's kind of a bit when
the chats came about right there was a

466
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,160
the chats came about right there was a
 

467
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,760
the chats came about right there was a
chat system you could play against

468
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:28,770
chat system you could play against
 

469
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,200
chat system you could play against
people where you could also chat with

470
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,210
people where you could also chat with
 

471
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,000
people where you could also chat with
people not only about soccer but about

472
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,010
people not only about soccer but about
 

473
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,800
people not only about soccer but about
anything and that became a way of life

474
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:33,810
anything and that became a way of life
 

475
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:38,030
anything and that became a way of life
for kind of two years and obviously then

476
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,040

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:47,880
studying and I think for the most part
 

635
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,290
studying and I think for the most part
it was relatively true these things do

636
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:51,300
it was relatively true these things do
 

637
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,720
it was relatively true these things do
take time games like stark if you take

638
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:53,730
take time games like stark if you take
 

639
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,820
take time games like stark if you take
the game pretty seriously and you wanna

640
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:55,830
the game pretty seriously and you wanna
 

641
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,500
the game pretty seriously and you wanna
study it then you obviously will

642
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:57,510
study it then you obviously will
 

643
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,600
study it then you obviously will
dedicate more time to it and I

644
00:12:59,600 --> 00:12:59,610
dedicate more time to it and I
 

645
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,790
dedicate more time to it and I
definitely took gaming and obviously

646
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:01,800
definitely took gaming and obviously
 

647
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:05,800
definitely took gaming and obviously
studying very seriously I loved learning

648
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:05,810
studying very seriously I loved learning
 

649
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,790
studying very seriously I loved learning
science and etc so to me especially when

650
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:10,800
science and etc so to me especially when
 

651
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,580
science and etc so to me especially when
I started University undergrad I kind of

652
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:13,590
I started University undergrad I kind of
 

653
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:15,560
I started University undergrad I kind of
step off Starcraft I actually fully

654
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:15,570
step off Starcraft I actually fully
 

655
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,840
step off Starcraft I actually fully
stopped playing and then wall of war

656
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:17,850
stopped playing and then wall of war
 

657
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,310
stopped playing and then wall of war
curve was a bit more casual you could

658
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:19,320
curve was a bit more casual you could
 

659
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,440
curve was a bit more casual you could
just connect online and I mean it was it

660
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:21,450
just connect online and I mean it was it
 

661
00:13:21,450 --> 00:13:25,220
just connect online and I mean it was it
was fun but I as I said that was not as

662
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,230
was fun but I as I said that was not as
 

663
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,950
was fun but I as I said that was not as
much time investment as it was for me in

664
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:27,960
much time investment as it was for me in
 

665
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,100
much time investment as it was for me in
StarCraft ok so let's get into alpha

666
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:31,110
StarCraft ok so let's get into alpha
 

667
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,430
StarCraft ok so let's get into alpha
star what are the your behind the team

668
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:34,440
star what are the your behind the team
 

669
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,380
star what are the your behind the team
so deep mine has been working on

670
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:36,390
so deep mine has been working on
 

671
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,420
so deep mine has been working on
Starcraft and released a bunch of cool

672
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:38,430
Starcraft and released a bunch of cool
 

673
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,280
Starcraft and released a bunch of cool
open-source agents and so on the past

674
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:40,290
open-source agents and so on the past
 

675
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,800
open-source agents and so on the past
few years but alpha star really is the

676
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:42,810
few years but alpha star really is the
 

677
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,590
few years but alpha star really is the
moment where the first time you beat a

678
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:45,600
moment where the first time you beat a
 

679
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,910
moment where the first time you beat a
world-class player so what are the

680
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:49,920
world-class player so what are the
 

681
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,980
world-class player so what are the
parameters of the challenge in the way

682
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:51,990
parameters of the challenge in the way
 

683
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,350
parameters of the challenge in the way
that alpha star took it on and how did

684
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:54,360
that alpha star took it on and how did
 

685
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,850
that alpha star took it on and how did
you and David and the rest of deepmind

686
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:55,860
you and David and the rest of deepmind
 

687
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,250
you and David and the rest of deepmind
team get into it

688
00:13:58,250 --> 00:13:58,260
team get into it
 

689
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,110
team get into it
consider that you can even beat the best

690
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:00,120
consider that you can even beat the best
 

691
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,780
consider that you can even beat the best
in the world or top players I think it

692
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:02,790
in the world or top players I think it
 

693
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,420
in the world or top players I think it
all started in back in 2015

694
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:07,430
all started in back in 2015
 

695
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:10,670
all started in back in 2015
actually I'm lying I think it was 2014

696
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:10,680
actually I'm lying I think it was 2014
 

697
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,030
actually I'm lying I think it was 2014
when the mine was acquired by Google and

698
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,040
when the mine was acquired by Google and
 

699
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,800
when the mine was acquired by Google and
I at the time was at Google brain which

700
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:15,810
I at the time was at Google brain which
 

701
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,400
I at the time was at Google brain which
is it it was in California

702
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:17,410
is it it was in California
 

703
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,920
is it it was in California
in California we had this summit where

704
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:19,930
in California we had this summit where
 

705
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:22,290
in California we had this summit where
we got together the two groups so Google

706
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:22,300
we got together the two groups so Google
 

707
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,699
we got together the two groups so Google
brain and google deepmind got together

708
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:23,709
brain and google deepmind got together
 

709
00:14:23,709 --> 00:14:27,449
brain and google deepmind got together
and we gave a series of talks and given

710
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:27,459
and we gave a series of talks and given
 

711
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,309
and we gave a series of talks and given
that they were doing deep reinforcement

712
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:29,319
that they were doing deep reinforcement
 

713
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:31,590
that they were doing deep reinforcement
learning for games I decided to bring up

714
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:31,600
learning for games I decided to bring up
 

715
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,650
learning for games I decided to bring up
part of my past which I had developed at

716
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:34,660
part of my past which I had developed at
 

717
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,569
part of my past which I had developed at
Berkeley like this thing which we called

718
00:14:36,569 --> 00:14:36,579
Berkeley like this thing which we called
 

719
00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:37,949
Berkeley like this thing which we called
Berkeley over mine which is really just

720
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:37,959
Berkeley over mine which is really just
 

721
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:41,129
Berkeley over mine which is really just
a Starcraft one but right so I about

722
00:14:41,129 --> 00:14:41,139
a Starcraft one but right so I about
 

723
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:43,829
a Starcraft one but right so I about
that and I remember them is just came to

724
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:43,839
that and I remember them is just came to
 

725
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,230
that and I remember them is just came to
me and said well maybe not now it's it's

726
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:46,240
me and said well maybe not now it's it's
 

727
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,939
me and said well maybe not now it's it's
perhaps a bit too early but you should

728
00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:47,949
perhaps a bit too early but you should
 

729
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:50,850
perhaps a bit too early but you should
just come to the mine and do this again

730
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:50,860
just come to the mine and do this again
 

731
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,040
just come to the mine and do this again
with deep reinforcement learning right

732
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:53,050
with deep reinforcement learning right
 

733
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,550
with deep reinforcement learning right
and at the time it sounded very

734
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:55,560
and at the time it sounded very
 

735
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,889
and at the time it sounded very
science-fiction for for several reasons

736
00:14:57,889 --> 00:14:57,899
science-fiction for for several reasons
 

737
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,929
science-fiction for for several reasons
but then in 2016 when I actually moved

738
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:00,939
but then in 2016 when I actually moved
 

739
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:02,340
but then in 2016 when I actually moved
to London and joined in mind

740
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:02,350
to London and joined in mind
 

741
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,189
to London and joined in mind
transferring from brain it became

742
00:15:05,189 --> 00:15:05,199
transferring from brain it became
 

743
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,019
transferring from brain it became
apparent that because of the alphago

744
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:07,029
apparent that because of the alphago
 

745
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:10,470
apparent that because of the alphago
moment and kind of Blizzard reaching out

746
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:10,480
moment and kind of Blizzard reaching out
 

747
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,329
moment and kind of Blizzard reaching out
to us to say wait like do you want the

748
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:12,339
to us to say wait like do you want the
 

749
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:13,530
to us to say wait like do you want the
next challenge and also me being

750
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:13,540
next challenge and also me being
 

751
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:15,540
next challenge and also me being
full-time at deep mine it's a sort of

752
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:15,550
full-time at deep mine it's a sort of
 

753
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:18,210
full-time at deep mine it's a sort of
kind of all these came together and then

754
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,220
kind of all these came together and then
 

755
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,309
kind of all these came together and then
I was I went to to air vine in

756
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:20,319
I was I went to to air vine in
 

757
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,110
I was I went to to air vine in
California to the Blizzard headquarters

758
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:22,120
California to the Blizzard headquarters
 

759
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,120
California to the Blizzard headquarters
to just chat with them and try to

760
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,130
to just chat with them and try to
 

761
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:26,670
to just chat with them and try to
explain how would it all work before you

762
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:26,680
explain how would it all work before you
 

763
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,210
explain how would it all work before you
do anything and the approach has always

764
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:30,220
do anything and the approach has always
 

765
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,120
do anything and the approach has always
been about the learning perspective

766
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:33,130
been about the learning perspective
 

767
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:36,629
been about the learning perspective
right so in in Berkeley we did a lot of

768
00:15:36,629 --> 00:15:36,639
right so in in Berkeley we did a lot of
 

769
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,480
right so in in Berkeley we did a lot of
rule-based you know conditioning and or

770
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:39,490
rule-based you know conditioning and or
 

771
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:41,819
rule-based you know conditioning and or
if you have more than three units then

772
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:41,829
if you have more than three units then
 

773
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,499
if you have more than three units then
go attack and if the other has more

774
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:43,509
go attack and if the other has more
 

775
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,689
go attack and if the other has more
units than me I retreat and so on and so

776
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:45,699
units than me I retreat and so on and so
 

777
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,730
units than me I retreat and so on and so
forth and of course the point of deep

778
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:47,740
forth and of course the point of deep
 

779
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,990
forth and of course the point of deep

machine learning in general is that all

782
00:15:51,269 --> 00:15:51,279
machine learning in general is that all
 

783
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,939
machine learning in general is that all
these should be learned behavior so that

784
00:15:53,939 --> 00:15:53,949
these should be learned behavior so that
 

785
00:15:53,949 --> 00:15:57,179
these should be learned behavior so that
kind of was the DNA of the project since

786
00:15:57,179 --> 00:15:57,189
kind of was the DNA of the project since
 

787
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:00,179
kind of was the DNA of the project since
its inception in 2016 where we just

788
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:00,189
its inception in 2016 where we just
 

789
00:16:00,189 --> 00:16:02,009
its inception in 2016 where we just
didn't even have an environment to work

790
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:02,019
didn't even have an environment to work
 

791
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:04,290
didn't even have an environment to work
with and so these that's how it all

792
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:04,300
with and so these that's how it all
 

793
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,470
with and so these that's how it all
started really so if you go back to a

794
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:07,480
started really so if you go back to a
 

795
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,269
started really so if you go back to a
conversation with damage or even in your

796
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:09,279
conversation with damage or even in your
 

797
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,329
conversation with damage or even in your
own head how far away did you because

798
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:12,339
own head how far away did you because
 

799
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:13,829
own head how far away did you because
that's we're talking about Atari games

800
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:13,839
that's we're talking about Atari games
 

801
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,619
that's we're talking about Atari games
we're talking about go which is kind of

802
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:16,629
we're talking about go which is kind of
 

803
00:16:16,629 --> 00:16:18,360
we're talking about go which is kind of
if you're honest about it really far

804
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,370
if you're honest about it really far
 

805
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:21,569
if you're honest about it really far
away from Starcraft in a well now that

806
00:16:21,569 --> 00:16:21,579
away from Starcraft in a well now that
 

807
00:16:21,579 --> 00:16:22,769
away from Starcraft in a well now that
you've beaten it maybe you could say

808
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:22,779
you've beaten it maybe you could say
 

809
00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:25,199
you've beaten it maybe you could say
it's close but is it's much it seems

810
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:25,209
it's close but is it's much it seems
 

811
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:27,970
it's close but is it's much it seems
like Starcraft is way harder than go

812
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:27,980
like Starcraft is way harder than go
 

813
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,259
like Starcraft is way harder than go
philosophically in mathematically

814
00:16:30,259 --> 00:16:30,269
philosophically in mathematically
 

815
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,889
philosophically in mathematically
speaking so how far away did you did you

816
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:33,899
speaking so how far away did you did you
 

817
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:36,800
speaking so how far away did you did you
think you were do you think it's 2019 in

818
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:36,810
think you were do you think it's 2019 in
 

819
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,480
think you were do you think it's 2019 in
18 you could be doing as well as you

820
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:38,490
18 you could be doing as well as you
 

821
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,460
18 you could be doing as well as you
have yeah when I when I kind of thought

822
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:40,470
have yeah when I when I kind of thought
 

823
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:43,009
have yeah when I when I kind of thought
about okay I'm gonna dedicate know a lot

824
00:16:43,009 --> 00:16:43,019
about okay I'm gonna dedicate know a lot
 

825
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:44,900
about okay I'm gonna dedicate know a lot
of my time and focus on this and

826
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:44,910
of my time and focus on this and
 

827
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,150
of my time and focus on this and
obviously I do a lot of different

828
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,160
obviously I do a lot of different
 

829
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,790
obviously I do a lot of different
research in deep learning so spending

830
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:49,800
research in deep learning so spending
 

831
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,710
research in deep learning so spending
time on it I mean I really had to kind

832
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:51,720
time on it I mean I really had to kind
 

833
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,660
time on it I mean I really had to kind
of think there's gonna be something good

834
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:53,670
of think there's gonna be something good
 

835
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,600
of think there's gonna be something good
happening out of this so really I

836
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:56,610
happening out of this so really I
 

837
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:58,670
happening out of this so really I
thought well this sounds impossible and

838
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:58,680
thought well this sounds impossible and
 

839
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,980
thought well this sounds impossible and
it probably is impossible to do the full

840
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:00,990
it probably is impossible to do the full
 

841
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:03,400
it probably is impossible to do the full
thing like the all like the full game

842
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:03,410
thing like the all like the full game
 

843
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:07,189
thing like the all like the full game
where you play one versus one and it's

844
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:07,199
where you play one versus one and it's
 

845
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,049
where you play one versus one and it's
only a neural network playing and so on

846
00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:09,059
only a neural network playing and so on
 

847
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,020
only a neural network playing and so on
so it really felt like I just didn't

848
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,030
so it really felt like I just didn't
 

849
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:14,299
so it really felt like I just didn't
even think it was possible but on the

850
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:14,309
even think it was possible but on the
 

851
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:15,980
even think it was possible but on the
other hand I could see some stepping

852
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:15,990
other hand I could see some stepping
 

853
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,400
other hand I could see some stepping
stones like towards that goal clearly

854
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,410
stones like towards that goal clearly
 

855
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,960
stones like towards that goal clearly
you could define subproblems in

856
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:20,970
you could define subproblems in
 

857
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:23,000
you could define subproblems in
StarCraft and sort of dissect it a bit

858
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,010
StarCraft and sort of dissect it a bit
 

859
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,650
StarCraft and sort of dissect it a bit
and say okay here is a part of the game

860
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:24,660
and say okay here is a part of the game
 

861
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,980
and say okay here is a part of the game
here's another part and also obviously

862
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:27,990
here's another part and also obviously
 

863
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,410
here's another part and also obviously
the fact so this was really also

864
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:30,420
the fact so this was really also
 

865
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,060
the fact so this was really also
critical to me the fact that we could

866
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,070
critical to me the fact that we could
 

867
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,880
critical to me the fact that we could
access human replays right so Blizzard

868
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:34,890
access human replays right so Blizzard
 

869
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,290
access human replays right so Blizzard
was very kind and in fact they

870
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:36,300
was very kind and in fact they
 

871
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,490
was very kind and in fact they
open-source these for the whole

872
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:37,500
open-source these for the whole
 

873
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,580
open-source these for the whole
community where you can just go and it's

874
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:40,590
community where you can just go and it's
 

875
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,470
community where you can just go and it's
not every single Starcraft game ever

876
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:42,480
not every single Starcraft game ever
 

877
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
not every single Starcraft game ever
played but it's a lot of them you can

878
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,490
played but it's a lot of them you can
 

879
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,610
played but it's a lot of them you can
just go and download and every day they

880
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:46,620
just go and download and every day they
 

881
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,740
just go and download and every day they
will you can just query a dataset and

882
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:48,750
will you can just query a dataset and
 

883
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,270
will you can just query a dataset and
say well give me all the games that were

884
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:50,280
say well give me all the games that were
 

885
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,620
say well give me all the games that were
played today and given my kind of

886
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:53,630
played today and given my kind of
 

887
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,570
played today and given my kind of
experience with language and sequences

888
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:56,580
experience with language and sequences
 

889
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,340
experience with language and sequences
and supervised learning I thought well

890
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:58,350
and supervised learning I thought well
 

891
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,710
and supervised learning I thought well
that's definitely gonna be very helpful

892
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:00,720
that's definitely gonna be very helpful
 

893
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,340
that's definitely gonna be very helpful
and something quite unique now because

894
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:03,350
and something quite unique now because
 

895
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,470
and something quite unique now because
ever before we had such a large dataset

896
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:06,480
ever before we had such a large dataset
 

897
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,010
ever before we had such a large dataset
of replays of people playing the game at

898
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:10,020
of replays of people playing the game at
 

899
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,290
of replays of people playing the game at
this scale of such a complex video game

900
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:12,300
this scale of such a complex video game
 

901
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,600
this scale of such a complex video game
right so that to me was a precious

902
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:14,610
right so that to me was a precious
 

903
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,850
right so that to me was a precious
resource and as soon as I knew that

904
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:16,860
resource and as soon as I knew that
 

905
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,159
resource and as soon as I knew that
Blizzard was able to kind of give these

906
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:19,169
Blizzard was able to kind of give these
 

907
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:21,650
Blizzard was able to kind of give these
to the community I started to feel

908
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:21,660
to the community I started to feel
 

909
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,540
to the community I started to feel
positive about something non-trivial

910
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:23,550
positive about something non-trivial
 

911
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:26,299
positive about something non-trivial
happening but but I also thought the

912
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:26,309
happening but but I also thought the
 

913
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:29,030
happening but but I also thought the
full thing like really no rules no no

914
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:29,040
full thing like really no rules no no
 

915
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,220
full thing like really no rules no no
single line of code that tries to say

916
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:31,230
single line of code that tries to say
 

917
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:32,600
single line of code that tries to say
well I mean if you see this unit will

918
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:32,610
well I mean if you see this unit will
 

919
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,419
well I mean if you see this unit will
the detector all these not having any of

920
00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:35,429
the detector all these not having any of
 

921
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:37,430
the detector all these not having any of
these specializations seemed really

922
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
these specializations seemed really
 

923
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,300
these specializations seemed really
really really difficult to me

924
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:39,310
really really difficult to me
 

925
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:42,390
really really difficult to me
I do also like that Blizzard was teasing

926
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:42,400
I do also like that Blizzard was teasing
 

927
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,610
I do also like that Blizzard was teasing
or even trolling you sort of almost yeah

928
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:47,620
or even trolling you sort of almost yeah
 

929
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,260
or even trolling you sort of almost yeah
pulling you in into this really

930
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:49,270
pulling you in into this really
 

931
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,330
pulling you in into this really
difficult challenge they have any aware

932
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:51,340
difficult challenge they have any aware
 

933
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,910
difficult challenge they have any aware
and that what's what's the interest from

934
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:53,920
and that what's what's the interest from
 

935
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,190
and that what's what's the interest from
the perspective of Blizzard except just

936
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:56,200
the perspective of Blizzard except just
 

937
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,500
the perspective of Blizzard except just
curiosity yeah I think Blizzard has

938
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:58,510
curiosity yeah I think Blizzard has
 

939
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:00,660
curiosity yeah I think Blizzard has
really understood and and really bring

940
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:00,670
really understood and and really bring
 

941
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,240
really understood and and really bring
bring forward these competitiveness of

942
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:03,250
bring forward these competitiveness of
 

943
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,640
bring forward these competitiveness of
eSports in games the Starcraft really

944
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:05,650
eSports in games the Starcraft really
 

945
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,550
eSports in games the Starcraft really
kind of sparked a lot of like something

946
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:08,560
kind of sparked a lot of like something
 

947
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,280
kind of sparked a lot of like something

I was saying he back in Korea so they

950
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,100
I was saying he back in Korea so they
 

951
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,920
I was saying he back in Korea so they
just probably thought well this is such

952
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:16,930
just probably thought well this is such
 

953
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,620
just probably thought well this is such
a pure 1vs1 setup that it would be great

954
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:19,630
a pure 1vs1 setup that it would be great
 

955
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,430
a pure 1vs1 setup that it would be great
to see if something that can play Atari

956
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,440
to see if something that can play Atari
 

957
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,850
to see if something that can play Atari
or go and then later on chess could

958
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:26,860
or go and then later on chess could
 

959
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,130
or go and then later on chess could
could even tackle these kind of complex

960
00:19:29,130 --> 00:19:29,140
could even tackle these kind of complex
 

961
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,620
could even tackle these kind of complex
realtime strategy game right so for them

962
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:31,630
realtime strategy game right so for them
 

963
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,720
realtime strategy game right so for them
they wanted to see first obviously

964
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:33,730
they wanted to see first obviously
 

965
00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:37,620
they wanted to see first obviously
whether it was possible if the game they

966
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:37,630
whether it was possible if the game they
 

967
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,990
whether it was possible if the game they
created was in a way solvable to some

968
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,000
created was in a way solvable to some
 

969
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,120
created was in a way solvable to some
extent and I think on the other hand

970
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,130
extent and I think on the other hand
 

971
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,670
extent and I think on the other hand
they also are a pretty modern company

972
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:44,680
they also are a pretty modern company
 

973
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,250
they also are a pretty modern company
that innovates a lot so just starting to

974
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:47,260
that innovates a lot so just starting to
 

975
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,230
that innovates a lot so just starting to
understand AI for them to how to bring

976
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:49,240
understand AI for them to how to bring
 

977
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,230
understand AI for them to how to bring
AI into games is not is not AI for games

978
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:52,240
AI into games is not is not AI for games
 

979
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,540
AI into games is not is not AI for games
but get a games for AI oh right I mean

980
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:54,550
but get a games for AI oh right I mean
 

981
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,300
but get a games for AI oh right I mean
both ways I think can work and you up we

982
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:57,310
both ways I think can work and you up we
 

983
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,520
both ways I think can work and you up we
obviously did mine use games for AI

984
00:19:59,520 --> 00:19:59,530
obviously did mine use games for AI
 

985
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,370
obviously did mine use games for AI
right to drive AI progress but Blizzard

986
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:02,380
right to drive AI progress but Blizzard
 

987
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,960
right to drive AI progress but Blizzard
might actually be able to do and many

988
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:03,970
might actually be able to do and many
 

989
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,000
might actually be able to do and many
other companies to start to understand

990
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,010
other companies to start to understand
 

991
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,890
other companies to start to understand
done to the opposite so I think that is

992
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:07,900
done to the opposite so I think that is
 

993
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,690
done to the opposite so I think that is
also something they can get out of these

994
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:09,700
also something they can get out of these
 

995
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:12,240
also something they can get out of these
and they definitely we have brainstorm a

996
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,250
and they definitely we have brainstorm a
 

997
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:13,980
and they definitely we have brainstorm a
lot about about these right but one of

998
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:13,990
lot about about these right but one of
 

999
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,120
lot about about these right but one of
the interesting things to me about

1000
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:15,130
the interesting things to me about
 

1001
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,270
the interesting things to me about
Starcraft and Diablo and these games

1002
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,280
Starcraft and Diablo and these games
 

1003
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,640
Starcraft and Diablo and these games
that blizzards created is the task of

1004
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:20,650
that blizzards created is the task of
 

1005
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,790
that blizzards created is the task of
balancing classes for example sort of

1006
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:23,800
balancing classes for example sort of
 

1007
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,060
balancing classes for example sort of
making the game fair from the starting

1008
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,070
making the game fair from the starting
 

1009
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,250
making the game fair from the starting
point and then let's skill the term and

1010
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,260
point and then let's skill the term and
 

1011
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,850
point and then let's skill the term and
the outcome is there uh I mean can you

1012
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:32,860
the outcome is there uh I mean can you
 

1013
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,650
the outcome is there uh I mean can you
first comment there's three races Zerg

1014
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:34,660
first comment there's three races Zerg
 

1015
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,260
first comment there's three races Zerg
Protoss and Terran I don't know if I've

1016
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:37,270
Protoss and Terran I don't know if I've
 

1017
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,360
Protoss and Terran I don't know if I've
ever said that out loud is that how you

1018
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:39,370
ever said that out loud is that how you
 

1019
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,460
ever said that out loud is that how you
pronounce it Terran yeah yeah I don't

1020
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:44,470
pronounce it Terran yeah yeah I don't
 

1021
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,320
pronounce it Terran yeah yeah I don't
think I've ever seen personally interact

1022
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,330
think I've ever seen personally interact
 

1023
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,769
think I've ever seen personally interact
with anybody about Starcraft it's funny

1024
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:48,779
with anybody about Starcraft it's funny
 

1025
00:20:48,779 --> 00:20:51,810
with anybody about Starcraft it's funny
so they seem to be pretty balanced

1026
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:51,820
so they seem to be pretty balanced
 

1027
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,349
so they seem to be pretty balanced
I wonder if the AI the work that you're

1028
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:55,359
I wonder if the AI the work that you're
 

1029
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,299
I wonder if the AI the work that you're
doing with the Alpha star would help

1030
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:57,309
doing with the Alpha star would help
 

1031
00:20:57,309 --> 00:20:59,399
doing with the Alpha star would help
balance them even further is that

1032
00:20:59,399 --> 00:20:59,409
balance them even further is that
 

1033
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:00,720
balance them even further is that
something you think about is that

1034
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:00,730
something you think about is that
 

1035
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:02,549
something you think about is that
something that Blizzard is thinking

1036
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:02,559
something that Blizzard is thinking
 

1037
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,700
something that Blizzard is thinking
about right so so balancing when you add

1038
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:05,710
about right so so balancing when you add
 

1039
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,499
about right so so balancing when you add
a new unit or a new spell type is

1040
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:07,509
a new unit or a new spell type is
 

1041
00:21:07,509 --> 00:21:09,779
a new unit or a new spell type is
obviously possible given that you can

1042
00:21:09,779 --> 00:21:09,789
obviously possible given that you can
 

1043
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:13,379
obviously possible given that you can
always train or retrain at scale some

1044
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:13,389
always train or retrain at scale some
 

1045
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,149
always train or retrain at scale some
agent that might start using that in

1046
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:15,159
agent that might start using that in
 

1047
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:17,700
agent that might start using that in
unintended ways but I think actually if

1048
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:17,710
unintended ways but I think actually if
 

1049
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,369
unintended ways but I think actually if
you understand how StarCraft has kind of

1050
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:20,379
you understand how StarCraft has kind of
 

1051
00:21:20,379 --> 00:21:22,889
you understand how StarCraft has kind of
co-evolved with players in a way I think

1052
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:22,899
co-evolved with players in a way I think
 

1053
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:25,169
co-evolved with players in a way I think
it's actually very cool the ways that

1054
00:21:25,169 --> 00:21:25,179
it's actually very cool the ways that
 

1055
00:21:25,179 --> 00:21:27,359
it's actually very cool the ways that
many of the things and strategies that

1056
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:27,369
many of the things and strategies that
 

1057
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,430
many of the things and strategies that
people came up with right so I think

1058
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:29,440
people came up with right so I think
 

1059
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,499
people came up with right so I think
it's we've seen it over and over in

1060
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:31,509
it's we've seen it over and over in
 

1061
00:21:31,509 --> 00:21:33,720
it's we've seen it over and over in
StarCraft that Blizzard comes up with

1062
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:33,730
StarCraft that Blizzard comes up with
 

1063
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,180
StarCraft that Blizzard comes up with
maybe a new unit and then some players

1064
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:36,190
maybe a new unit and then some players
 

1065
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,099
maybe a new unit and then some players
get creative and do something kind of

1066
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:38,109
get creative and do something kind of
 

1067
00:21:38,109 --> 00:21:40,320
get creative and do something kind of
unintentional or something that Blizzard

1068
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:40,330
unintentional or something that Blizzard
 

1069
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,210
unintentional or something that Blizzard
designers that just simply didn't test

1070
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:42,220
designers that just simply didn't test
 

1071
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,580
designers that just simply didn't test
or think about and then after that

1072
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:44,590
or think about and then after that
 

1073
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,470
or think about and then after that
becomes kind of mainstream in the

1074
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
becomes kind of mainstream in the
 

1075
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,210
becomes kind of mainstream in the
community Blizzard patches the game and

1076
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,220
community Blizzard patches the game and
 

1077
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,119
community Blizzard patches the game and
and then they kind of maybe weaken that

1078
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:51,129
and then they kind of maybe weaken that
 

1079
00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:53,310
and then they kind of maybe weaken that
strategy or or make it actually more

1080
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:53,320
strategy or or make it actually more
 

1081
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,560
strategy or or make it actually more
interesting but a bit more balanced so

1082
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:55,570
interesting but a bit more balanced so
 

1083
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,330
interesting but a bit more balanced so
these kind of continual talk between

1084
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:57,340
these kind of continual talk between
 

1085
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,279
these kind of continual talk between
players and Blizzard is is kind of what

1086
00:21:59,279 --> 00:21:59,289
players and Blizzard is is kind of what
 

1087
00:21:59,289 --> 00:22:02,190
players and Blizzard is is kind of what
has defined them actually in actually

1088
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,200
has defined them actually in actually
 

1089
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,139
has defined them actually in actually
most games that the in in stykera but

1090
00:22:04,139 --> 00:22:04,149
most games that the in in stykera but
 

1091
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:06,119
most games that the in in stykera but
also in World of Warcraft they would do

1092
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:06,129
also in World of Warcraft they would do
 

1093
00:22:06,129 --> 00:22:07,680
also in World of Warcraft they would do
that there are several classes and it

1094
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:07,690
that there are several classes and it
 

1095
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:10,460
that there are several classes and it
would be not good that everyone plays

1096
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:10,470
would be not good that everyone plays
 

1097
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,930
would be not good that everyone plays
absolutely the same race or and so on

1098
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:12,940
absolutely the same race or and so on
 

1099
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,200
absolutely the same race or and so on
right so I think they they do care about

1100
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,210
right so I think they they do care about
 

1101
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,479
right so I think they they do care about
balancing of course and they do a fair

1102
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:18,489
balancing of course and they do a fair
 

1103
00:22:18,489 --> 00:22:20,099
balancing of course and they do a fair
amount of testing but it's also

1104
00:22:20,099 --> 00:22:20,109
amount of testing but it's also
 

1105
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:23,220
amount of testing but it's also
beautiful to to also see how players get

1106
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:23,230
beautiful to to also see how players get
 

1107
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,379
beautiful to to also see how players get
creative anyways and I mean whether I

1108
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:25,389
creative anyways and I mean whether I
 

1109
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:27,479
creative anyways and I mean whether I
can be more creative at this point I

1110
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:27,489
can be more creative at this point I
 

1111
00:22:27,489 --> 00:22:29,190
can be more creative at this point I
don't think so right I mean it's just

1112
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:29,200
don't think so right I mean it's just
 

1113
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,529
don't think so right I mean it's just
sometimes something so amazing happens

1114
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:31,539
sometimes something so amazing happens
 

1115
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:33,779
sometimes something so amazing happens
like I remember back in in the days like

1116
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:33,789
like I remember back in in the days like
 

1117
00:22:33,789 --> 00:22:36,029
like I remember back in in the days like
you have these drop ships that could

1118
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:36,039
you have these drop ships that could
 

1119
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:38,099
you have these drop ships that could
drop rivers and that was actually not

1120
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:38,109
drop rivers and that was actually not
 

1121
00:22:38,109 --> 00:22:40,529
drop rivers and that was actually not
thought about that you could drop this

1122
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:40,539
thought about that you could drop this
 

1123
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:42,720
thought about that you could drop this
unit that has this what's called Splash

1124
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:42,730
unit that has this what's called Splash
 

1125
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,539
unit that has this what's called Splash
Damage that would basically eliminate

1126
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:45,549
Damage that would basically eliminate
 

1127
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:48,330
Damage that would basically eliminate
all the enemies workers at once no one

1128
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:48,340
all the enemies workers at once no one
 

1129
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,009
all the enemies workers at once no one
thought that you could actually put them

1130
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:50,019
thought that you could actually put them
 

1131
00:22:50,019 --> 00:22:52,259
thought that you could actually put them
and really early game do that kind of

1132
00:22:52,259 --> 00:22:52,269
and really early game do that kind of
 

1133
00:22:52,269 --> 00:22:55,109
and really early game do that kind of
damage and then we know things change in

1134
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:55,119
damage and then we know things change in
 

1135
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:56,159
damage and then we know things change in
the game but I don't know I think

1136
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:56,169
the game but I don't know I think
 

1137
00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:57,680
the game but I don't know I think
there's it's quite an amazing

1138
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:57,690
there's it's quite an amazing
 

1139
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:00,180
there's it's quite an amazing
exploration process from both sides

1140
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:00,190
exploration process from both sides
 

1141
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:02,070
exploration process from both sides
players and Blizzard alike well

1142
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:02,080
players and Blizzard alike well
 

1143
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,049
players and Blizzard alike well
it's it's almost like a reinforcement

1144
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,059
it's it's almost like a reinforcement
 

1145
00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:06,570
it's it's almost like a reinforcement
learning exploration but a the scale of

1146
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:06,580
learning exploration but a the scale of
 

1147
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,500
learning exploration but a the scale of
humans that play that play Blizzard

1148
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,510
humans that play that play Blizzard
 

1149
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,500
humans that play that play Blizzard
games is almost on the scale of a

1150
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:12,510
games is almost on the scale of a
 

1151
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:15,389
games is almost on the scale of a
large-scale deepmind RL experiment I

1152
00:23:15,389 --> 00:23:15,399
large-scale deepmind RL experiment I
 

1153
00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:17,669
large-scale deepmind RL experiment I
mean if you look at the numbers that's I

1154
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:17,679
mean if you look at the numbers that's I
 

1155
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,899
mean if you look at the numbers that's I
mean you're talking about I don't know

1156
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:18,909
mean you're talking about I don't know
 

1157
00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:20,430
mean you're talking about I don't know
how many games but hundreds of thousands

1158
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:20,440
how many games but hundreds of thousands
 

1159
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,009
how many games but hundreds of thousands
of games probably a month yeah I mean so

1160
00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:23,019
of games probably a month yeah I mean so
 

1161
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:24,840
of games probably a month yeah I mean so
that you could it's almost the same as

1162
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:24,850
that you could it's almost the same as
 

1163
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:29,580
that you could it's almost the same as
running RL agents what an aspect of the

1164
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:29,590
running RL agents what an aspect of the
 

1165
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,620
running RL agents what an aspect of the
problem of StarCraft II things the

1166
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:31,630
problem of StarCraft II things the
 

1167
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:33,779
problem of StarCraft II things the
hardest is it the like you said the

1168
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:33,789
hardest is it the like you said the
 

1169
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:35,970
hardest is it the like you said the
imperfect information is it the fact

1170
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:35,980
imperfect information is it the fact
 

1171
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,549
imperfect information is it the fact
they have to do long term planning is it

1172
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:38,559
they have to do long term planning is it
 

1173
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,860
they have to do long term planning is it
the real time aspects we have to do

1174
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:40,870
the real time aspects we have to do
 

1175
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:43,049
the real time aspects we have to do
stuff really quickly is it the fact that

1176
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:43,059
stuff really quickly is it the fact that
 

1177
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:46,049
stuff really quickly is it the fact that
a large action space that you can do so

1178
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:46,059
a large action space that you can do so
 

1179
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,500
a large action space that you can do so
many possible things or is it you know

1180
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:49,510
many possible things or is it you know
 

1181
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,509
many possible things or is it you know
in the game theoretic sense there is no

1182
00:23:51,509 --> 00:23:51,519
in the game theoretic sense there is no
 

1183
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:53,009
in the game theoretic sense there is no
Nash equilibria at least you don't know

1184
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:53,019
Nash equilibria at least you don't know
 

1185
00:23:53,019 --> 00:23:54,269
Nash equilibria at least you don't know
what the optimal strategy is because

1186
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:54,279
what the optimal strategy is because
 

1187
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,190
what the optimal strategy is because
there's way too many options right

1188
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,200
there's way too many options right
 

1189
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,110
there's way too many options right
what's is there something that stands

1190
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,120
what's is there something that stands
 

1191
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,549
what's is there something that stands
out is just like the hardest the most

1192
00:23:59,549 --> 00:23:59,559
out is just like the hardest the most
 

1193
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,419
out is just like the hardest the most
annoying thing so when we sort of looked

1194
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:03,429
annoying thing so when we sort of looked
 

1195
00:24:03,429 --> 00:24:05,220
annoying thing so when we sort of looked
at the problem and start to define

1196
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,230
at the problem and start to define
 

1197
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,560
at the problem and start to define
permit like the parameters of it right

1198
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:07,570
permit like the parameters of it right
 

1199
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,210
permit like the parameters of it right
what are the observations what are the

1200
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:09,220
what are the observations what are the
 

1201
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:13,680
what are the observations what are the
actions it became very apparent that you

1202
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:13,690
actions it became very apparent that you
 

1203
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,330
actions it became very apparent that you
know that the very first barrier that

1204
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:15,340
know that the very first barrier that
 

1205
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,509
know that the very first barrier that
one would hit in StarCraft would be

1206
00:24:17,509 --> 00:24:17,519
one would hit in StarCraft would be
 

1207
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:19,830
one would hit in StarCraft would be
because of the action space being so

1208
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:19,840
because of the action space being so
 

1209
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,379
because of the action space being so
large and as not being able to search

1210
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:22,389
large and as not being able to search
 

1211
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:25,740
large and as not being able to search
like you could in in chess or or go even

1212
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:25,750
like you could in in chess or or go even
 

1213
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,009
like you could in in chess or or go even
though the search space is vast the main

1214
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:29,019
though the search space is vast the main
 

1215
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,169
though the search space is vast the main
problem that we identified was that of

1216
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:31,179
problem that we identified was that of
 

1217
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,230
problem that we identified was that of
exploration right so without any sort of

1218
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:34,240
exploration right so without any sort of
 

1219
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,960
exploration right so without any sort of
human knowledge or human prior if you

1220
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:36,970
human knowledge or human prior if you
 

1221
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,970
human knowledge or human prior if you
think about StarCraft and you know how

1222
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:38,980
think about StarCraft and you know how
 

1223
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,799
think about StarCraft and you know how
deep reinforcement learning is algorithm

1224
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:40,809
deep reinforcement learning is algorithm
 

1225
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:43,980
deep reinforcement learning is algorithm
works work which is essentially by

1226
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:43,990
works work which is essentially by
 

1227
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:46,049
works work which is essentially by
issuing random actions and hoping that

1228
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:46,059
issuing random actions and hoping that
 

1229
00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:47,970
issuing random actions and hoping that
they will get some wins sometimes so

1230
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:47,980
they will get some wins sometimes so
 

1231
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,149
they will get some wins sometimes so
they could learn so if you think of the

1232
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:51,159
they could learn so if you think of the
 

1233
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,190
they could learn so if you think of the
of the action space in StarCraft almost

1234
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:53,200
of the action space in StarCraft almost
 

1235
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,960
of the action space in StarCraft almost
anything you can do in the early game is

1236
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:54,970
anything you can do in the early game is
 

1237
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,750
anything you can do in the early game is
bad because any action involves taking

1238
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:57,760
bad because any action involves taking
 

1239
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,049
bad because any action involves taking

1242
00:25:02,789 --> 00:25:02,799

automatically sends them to mine and you

1244
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:05,169
automatically sends them to mine and you
 

1245
00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:07,169
automatically sends them to mine and you
would immediately just take them out of

1246
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:07,179
would immediately just take them out of
 

1247
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:10,649
would immediately just take them out of
mining and send them around so just

1248
00:25:10,649 --> 00:25:10,659
mining and send them around so just
 

1249
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,590
mining and send them around so just
thinking how how is it gonna be possible

1250
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:13,600
thinking how how is it gonna be possible
 

1251
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,990
thinking how how is it gonna be possible
to to get to understand the

to to get to understand the
 

1253
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,030
to to get to understand the
these concepts but but even more like

1254
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:18,040
these concepts but but even more like
 

1255
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,980
these concepts but but even more like
expanding right there's there's these

1256
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:19,990
expanding right there's there's these
 

1257
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,420
expanding right there's there's these
buildings you can place in other

1258
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:21,430
buildings you can place in other
 

1259
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:23,550
buildings you can place in other
locations in the map to gather more

1260
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:23,560
locations in the map to gather more
 

1261
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,230
locations in the map to gather more
resources but the location of the

1262
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:25,240
resources but the location of the
 

1263
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,390
resources but the location of the
building is important and you have to

1264
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,400
building is important and you have to
 

1265
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,720
building is important and you have to
select a worker send it walking to that

1266
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:30,730
select a worker send it walking to that
 

1267
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:33,330
select a worker send it walking to that
location build the building wait for the

1268
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:33,340
location build the building wait for the
 

1269
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,970
location build the building wait for the
building to be built and then put extra

1270
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:35,980
building to be built and then put extra
 

1271
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,950
building to be built and then put extra
workers there so they start mining that

1272
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:37,960
workers there so they start mining that
 

1273
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,350
workers there so they start mining that
just that feels like impossible if you

1274
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:40,360
just that feels like impossible if you
 

1275
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,630
just that feels like impossible if you
just randomly click to produce that

1276
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:42,640
just randomly click to produce that
 

1277
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,910
just randomly click to produce that
state desirable state that then you

1278
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:44,920
state desirable state that then you
 

1279
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,190
state desirable state that then you
could hope to learn from because

1280
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:47,200
could hope to learn from because
 

1281
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,960
could hope to learn from because
eventually that may yield to an extra

1282
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:48,970
eventually that may yield to an extra
 

1283
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:51,000
eventually that may yield to an extra
win right so for me the exploration

1284
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,010
win right so for me the exploration
 

1285
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,000
win right so for me the exploration
problem and due to the actions pace and

1286
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,010
problem and due to the actions pace and
 

1287
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,980
problem and due to the actions pace and
the fact that there's not really turns

1288
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:55,990
the fact that there's not really turns
 

1289
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,870
the fact that there's not really turns
there's so many turns because the game

1290
00:25:57,870 --> 00:25:57,880
there's so many turns because the game
 

1291
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:01,380
there's so many turns because the game
essentially peaks at 22 times per second

1292
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:01,390
essentially peaks at 22 times per second
 

1293
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,940
essentially peaks at 22 times per second
if you mean that's how they keep

1294
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:02,950
if you mean that's how they keep
 

1295
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:06,030
if you mean that's how they keep
discretize sort of time obviously you

1296
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:06,040
discretize sort of time obviously you
 

1297
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,620
discretize sort of time obviously you
always have to discretize time there's

1298
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:07,630
always have to discretize time there's
 

1299
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:09,900
always have to discretize time there's
not no such thing as real time but it's

1300
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:09,910
not no such thing as real time but it's
 

1301
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,930
not no such thing as real time but it's
really a lot of time steps of things

1302
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:12,940
really a lot of time steps of things
 

1303
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,970
really a lot of time steps of things
that could go wrong and that definitely

1304
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:14,980
that could go wrong and that definitely
 

1305
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,090
that could go wrong and that definitely
felt a priori like the hardest you

1306
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:18,100
felt a priori like the hardest you
 

1307
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,980
felt a priori like the hardest you
mentioned many good ones I think partial

1308
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:19,990
mentioned many good ones I think partial
 

1309
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,080
mentioned many good ones I think partial
observability and the fact that there is

1310
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,090
observability and the fact that there is
 

1311
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,090
observability and the fact that there is
no perfect strategy because of the

1312
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:24,100
no perfect strategy because of the
 

1313
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,070
no perfect strategy because of the
partial observability those are very

1314
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
partial observability those are very
 

1315
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,420
partial observability those are very
interesting problems we start seeing

1316
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:27,430
interesting problems we start seeing
 

1317
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:30,060
interesting problems we start seeing
more and more now in terms of us we

1318
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:30,070
more and more now in terms of us we
 

1319
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,500
more and more now in terms of us we
solve the previous ones but the core

1320
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:31,510
solve the previous ones but the core
 

1321
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,380
solve the previous ones but the core
problem to me was exploration and

1322
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,390
problem to me was exploration and
 

1323
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:37,200
problem to me was exploration and
solving it has been basically kind of

1324
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:37,210
solving it has been basically kind of
 

1325
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,730
solving it has been basically kind of
the focus and how we saw the first

1326
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:38,740
the focus and how we saw the first
 

1327
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,940
the focus and how we saw the first
breakthroughs so exploration you know in

1328
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:41,950
breakthroughs so exploration you know in
 

1329
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,730
breakthroughs so exploration you know in
a multi hierarchical way so like 22

1330
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:44,740
a multi hierarchical way so like 22
 

1331
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,920
a multi hierarchical way so like 22
times the second exploration is a very

1332
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:46,930
times the second exploration is a very
 

1333
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,930
times the second exploration is a very
different meaning than it does in terms

1334
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:48,940
different meaning than it does in terms
 

1335
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,540
different meaning than it does in terms
of should I gather resources early or

1336
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,550
of should I gather resources early or
 

1337
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,580
of should I gather resources early or
should I wait or so on so how do you

1338
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:53,590
should I wait or so on so how do you
 

1339
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:56,730
should I wait or so on so how do you
solve the long-term let's talk about the

1340
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:56,740
solve the long-term let's talk about the
 

1341
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,050
solve the long-term let's talk about the
internals of alpha stuff so first of all

1342
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:01,060
internals of alpha stuff so first of all
 

1343
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,700
internals of alpha stuff so first of all
how do you represent the state of the

1344
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:02,710
how do you represent the state of the
 

1345
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,970
how do you represent the state of the
game as an input right how do you then

1346
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:05,980
game as an input right how do you then
 

1347
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,910
game as an input right how do you then
do the long term sequence modeling how

1348
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:08,920
do the long term sequence modeling how
 

1349
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,370
do the long term sequence modeling how
do you build a policy right also what's

1350
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:11,380
do you build a policy right also what's
 

1351
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,480
do you build a policy right also what's
the architecture like so alpha star has

1352
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:14,490
the architecture like so alpha star has
 

1353
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:17,450
the architecture like so alpha star has
obviously several components but

1354
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:17,460
obviously several components but
 

1355
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,920
obviously several components but
everything passes through what we call

1356
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:19,930
everything passes through what we call
 

1357
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,140
everything passes through what we call
the policy which is a neural network and

1358
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,150
the policy which is a neural network and
 

1359
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,600
the policy which is a neural network and
that's kind of the beauty of it there is

1360
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:24,610
that's kind of the beauty of it there is
 

1361
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:26,460
that's kind of the beauty of it there is
I could just now give you a neural

1362
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:26,470
I could just now give you a neural
 

1363
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:28,690
I could just now give you a neural
network and some weights

1364
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:28,700
network and some weights
 

1365
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,340
network and some weights
and if you fed the right observations

1366
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,350
and if you fed the right observations
 

1367
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,990
and if you fed the right observations
and you understood the actions the same

1368
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
and you understood the actions the same
 

1369
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,180
and you understood the actions the same
way we do you would have basically the

1370
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:34,190
way we do you would have basically the
 

1371
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:35,290
way we do you would have basically the
agent playing the game there's

1372
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:35,300
agent playing the game there's
 

1373
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,390
agent playing the game there's
absolutely nothing else needed other

1374
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:37,400
absolutely nothing else needed other
 

1375
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,510
absolutely nothing else needed other
than those weights that were trained now

1376
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:40,520
than those weights that were trained now
 

1377
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,910
than those weights that were trained now
the first step is observing the game and

1378
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:42,920
the first step is observing the game and
 

1379
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,190
the first step is observing the game and
we've experimented with a few

1380
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
we've experimented with a few
 

1381
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,040
we've experimented with a few
alternatives the one that we currently

1382
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,050
alternatives the one that we currently
 

1383
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,280
alternatives the one that we currently
use mixes both spatial sort of images

1384
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:51,290
use mixes both spatial sort of images
 

1385
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:53,200
use mixes both spatial sort of images
that you would process from the game

1386
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,210
that you would process from the game
 

1387
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,630
that you would process from the game
that is the zoomed out version of the of

1388
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:55,640
that is the zoomed out version of the of
 

1389
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,090
that is the zoomed out version of the of
the map and also assume the inversion of

1390
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:58,100
the map and also assume the inversion of
 

1391
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,070
the map and also assume the inversion of
the camera or the screen as we call it

1392
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,080
the camera or the screen as we call it
 

1393
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,910
the camera or the screen as we call it
but also we give to the agent the list

1394
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:03,920
but also we give to the agent the list
 

1395
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,630
but also we give to the agent the list
of units that it sees more of as a set

1396
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:07,640
of units that it sees more of as a set
 

1397
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,290
of units that it sees more of as a set
of objects that it can operate on that

1398
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:11,300
of objects that it can operate on that
 

1399
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,080
of objects that it can operate on that
is not necessarily required to use it

1400
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,090
is not necessarily required to use it
 

1401
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,270
is not necessarily required to use it
and we have versions of the game that

1402
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:16,280
and we have versions of the game that
 

1403
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,520
and we have versions of the game that
play well without this set vision that

1404
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:18,530
play well without this set vision that
 

1405
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:20,440
play well without this set vision that
is a bit not like how humans perceive

1406
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:20,450
is a bit not like how humans perceive
 

1407
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:22,900
is a bit not like how humans perceive
the game but it certainly helps a lot

1408
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:22,910
the game but it certainly helps a lot
 

1409
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,030
the game but it certainly helps a lot
because it's a very natural way to

1410
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,040
because it's a very natural way to
 

1411
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,490
because it's a very natural way to
encode the game is by just looking at

1412
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:27,500
encode the game is by just looking at
 

1413
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
encode the game is by just looking at
all the units that there are there they

1414
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:29,510
all the units that there are there they
 

1415
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,350
all the units that there are there they
have properties like health position

1416
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:32,360
have properties like health position
 

1417
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,230
have properties like health position
type of unit whether it's my unit or the

1418
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:35,240
type of unit whether it's my unit or the
 

1419
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,650
type of unit whether it's my unit or the
enemies and that's sort of is kind of

1420
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:38,660
enemies and that's sort of is kind of
 

1421
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:42,520
enemies and that's sort of is kind of
the the summary of the state of the of

1422
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:42,530
the the summary of the state of the of
 

1423
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:44,650
the the summary of the state of the of
the game note that list of units or set

1424
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:44,660
the game note that list of units or set
 

1425
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:47,470
the game note that list of units or set
of units that you see all the time well

1426
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:47,480
of units that you see all the time well
 

1427
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,880
of units that you see all the time well
that's pretty close to the way humans

1428
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:48,890
that's pretty close to the way humans
 

1429
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:50,320
that's pretty close to the way humans
see it again why do you say it's not

1430
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:50,330
see it again why do you say it's not
 

1431
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,050
see it again why do you say it's not
isn't it you're saying the exactness of

1432
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:53,060
isn't it you're saying the exactness of
 

1433
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,180
isn't it you're saying the exactness of
it is not yeah other humans the

1434
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:55,190
it is not yeah other humans the
 

1435
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,800
it is not yeah other humans the
exactness of it is perhaps not the

1436
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:56,810
exactness of it is perhaps not the
 

1437
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,720
exactness of it is perhaps not the
problem I guess maybe the problem if you

1438
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:58,730
problem I guess maybe the problem if you
 

1439
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,930
problem I guess maybe the problem if you
look at it from how actually humans play

1440
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:01,940
look at it from how actually humans play
 

1441
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,790
look at it from how actually humans play
the game is that they play with a mouse

1442
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:03,800
the game is that they play with a mouse
 

1443
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,310
the game is that they play with a mouse
on a keyboard and a screen and they

1444
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:06,320
on a keyboard and a screen and they
 

1445
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,620
on a keyboard and a screen and they
don't see sort of a structured object

1446
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:08,630
don't see sort of a structured object
 

1447
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:10,210
don't see sort of a structured object
with all the units what they see is what

1448
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:10,220
with all the units what they see is what
 

1449
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,340
with all the units what they see is what
they see on the screen right yes so

1450
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,350
they see on the screen right yes so
 

1451
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,840
they see on the screen right yes so
remember that there's a certain

1452
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:13,850
remember that there's a certain
 

1453
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:15,460
remember that there's a certain
interrupt there's a plot that you showed

1454
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:15,470
interrupt there's a plot that you showed
 

1455
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:18,100
interrupt there's a plot that you showed
with camera base where you do exactly

1456
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,110
with camera base where you do exactly
 

1457
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,260
with camera base where you do exactly
that right move around and that seems to

1458
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:20,270
that right move around and that seems to
 

1459
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,390
that right move around and that seems to
converge it to similar performance yeah

1460
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:22,400
converge it to similar performance yeah
 

1461
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,980
converge it to similar performance yeah
I think that's what I we're kind of

1462
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:23,990
I think that's what I we're kind of
 

1463
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,990
I think that's what I we're kind of
experimenting with what's necessary or

1464
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:26,000
experimenting with what's necessary or
 

1465
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,220
experimenting with what's necessary or
not but using the set so actually if you

1466
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:30,230
not but using the set so actually if you
 

1467
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,570
not but using the set so actually if you
look at research in computer vision

1468
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:31,580
look at research in computer vision
 

1469
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:34,920
look at research in computer vision
where it makes a lot of sense to treat

1470
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:34,930
where it makes a lot of sense to treat
 

1471
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,290
where it makes a lot of sense to treat
images as two-dimensional arrays there

1472
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:38,300
images as two-dimensional arrays there
 

1473
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,790
images as two-dimensional arrays there
is actually a very nice paper from

1474
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:39,800
is actually a very nice paper from
 

1475
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,190
is actually a very nice paper from
Facebook I think I forgot who the

1476
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:42,200
Facebook I think I forgot who the
 

1477
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,670
Facebook I think I forgot who the
authors

1478
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:42,680
authors
 

1479
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,250
authors
but I think it's part of gaming's has

1480
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:45,260
but I think it's part of gaming's has
 

1481
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,220
but I think it's part of gaming's has
group and what they do is they take an

1482
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:48,230
group and what they do is they take an
 

1483
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,010
group and what they do is they take an
image which is this two-dimensional

1484
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,020
image which is this two-dimensional
 

1485
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,230
image which is this two-dimensional
signal and they actually take pixel by

1486
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:53,240
signal and they actually take pixel by
 

1487
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,930
signal and they actually take pixel by
pixel and scramble the image as if it

1488
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:55,940
pixel and scramble the image as if it
 

1489
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,560
pixel and scramble the image as if it
was just a list of pixels and crucially

1490
00:29:59,560 --> 00:29:59,570
was just a list of pixels and crucially
 

1491
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,720
was just a list of pixels and crucially
they encode the position of the pixels

1492
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:01,730
they encode the position of the pixels
 

1493
00:30:01,730 --> 00:30:04,150
they encode the position of the pixels
with at the XY coordinates and this is

1494
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:04,160
with at the XY coordinates and this is
 

1495
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,790
with at the XY coordinates and this is
just kind of a new architecture which we

1496
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:06,800
just kind of a new architecture which we
 

1497
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,470
just kind of a new architecture which we
incidentally also use in StarCraft

1498
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
incidentally also use in StarCraft
 

1499
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,510
incidentally also use in StarCraft
called the transformer which is a very

1500
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:10,520
called the transformer which is a very
 

1501
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,100
called the transformer which is a very
popular paper from last year which

1502
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,110
popular paper from last year which
 

1503
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,140
popular paper from last year which
yielded very nice result in machine

1504
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,150
yielded very nice result in machine
 

1505
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:17,230
yielded very nice result in machine
translation and if you actually believe

1506
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:17,240
translation and if you actually believe
 

1507
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,450
translation and if you actually believe
in this kind of or it's actually a set

1508
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:19,460
in this kind of or it's actually a set
 

1509
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,670
in this kind of or it's actually a set
of pixels as long as you encode X Y it's

1510
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:21,680
of pixels as long as you encode X Y it's
 

1511
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,180
of pixels as long as you encode X Y it's
okay

1512
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,190
okay
 

1513
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,910
okay
then you you could argue that the list

1514
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:24,920
then you you could argue that the list
 

1515
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,860
then you you could argue that the list
of units that we see is precisely that

1516
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:26,870
of units that we see is precisely that
 

1517
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:29,890
of units that we see is precisely that
because we have each unit as a kind of

1518
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:29,900
because we have each unit as a kind of
 

1519
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,290
because we have each unit as a kind of
pixel if you will and then there XY

1520
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:32,300
pixel if you will and then there XY
 

1521
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,750
pixel if you will and then there XY
coordinates so in that perspective we

1522
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:34,760
coordinates so in that perspective we
 

1523
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,030
coordinates so in that perspective we
without knowing it we use the same

1524
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,040
without knowing it we use the same
 

1525
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,400
without knowing it we use the same
architecture that was shown to work very

1526
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:39,410
architecture that was shown to work very
 

1527
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,500
architecture that was shown to work very
well on Pascal on image net and so on so

1528
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:41,510
well on Pascal on image net and so on so
 

1529
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,630
well on Pascal on image net and so on so
the interesting thing here is putting it

1530
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:43,640
the interesting thing here is putting it
 

1531
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,510
the interesting thing here is putting it
in that way it starts to move it towards

1532
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:46,520
in that way it starts to move it towards
 

1533
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,550
in that way it starts to move it towards
the way you usually work with language

1534
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:48,560
the way you usually work with language
 

1535
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,790
the way you usually work with language
so what and especially with your

1536
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:51,800
so what and especially with your
 

1537
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,750
so what and especially with your
expertise and work in language it seems

1538
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:55,760
expertise and work in language it seems
 

1539
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,200
expertise and work in language it seems
like there's echoes of a lot of the way

1540
00:30:59,200 --> 00:30:59,210
like there's echoes of a lot of the way
 

1541
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,820
like there's echoes of a lot of the way
you would work with natural language in

1542
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:00,830
you would work with natural language in
 

1543
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,170
you would work with natural language in
the way you've approached alpha star

1544
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:02,180
the way you've approached alpha star
 

1545
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:05,230
the way you've approached alpha star
right what's does that help with the

1546
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:05,240
right what's does that help with the
 

1547
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,180
right what's does that help with the
long term sequence modeling there

1548
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,190
long term sequence modeling there
 

1549
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:09,670
long term sequence modeling there
somehow exactly so so now that we

1550
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:09,680
somehow exactly so so now that we
 

1551
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:11,350
somehow exactly so so now that we
understand what an observation for a

1552
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:11,360
understand what an observation for a
 

1553
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,470
understand what an observation for a
given time step is we need to move on to

1554
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:14,480
given time step is we need to move on to
 

1555
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,850
given time step is we need to move on to
say well there's going to be a sequence

1556
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:15,860
say well there's going to be a sequence
 

1557
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,700
say well there's going to be a sequence
of such observations and an agent will

1558
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:18,710
of such observations and an agent will
 

1559
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,280
of such observations and an agent will
need to given all that it's seen not

1560
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,290
need to given all that it's seen not
 

1561
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:23,170
need to given all that it's seen not
only the current time step but all that

1562
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:23,180
only the current time step but all that
 

1563
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,240
only the current time step but all that
it's seen why because there is partial

1564
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,250
it's seen why because there is partial
 

1565
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,490
it's seen why because there is partial
observability we must remember whether

1566
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:27,500
observability we must remember whether
 

1567
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,200
observability we must remember whether
we saw a worker going somewhere for

1568

we saw a worker going somewhere for
instance right because then there might

1570
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:30,860
instance right because then there might
 

1571
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,770
instance right because then there might
be an expansion and the top right of the

map so given that what you must then
 

1575
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,800
map so given that what you must then
think about is there is the problem of

1576
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:38,810
think about is there is the problem of
 

1577
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,810
think about is there is the problem of
given all the observations you have to

1578
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:40,820
given all the observations you have to
 

1579
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,390
given all the observations you have to
predict the next action and not only

1580
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:43,400
predict the next action and not only
 

1581
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,070
predict the next action and not only
given all the observations but given all

given all the observations but given all
 

1583
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,540
given all the observations but given all
the observations and given all the

the observations and given all the
 

1585
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,490
the observations and given all the
actions you've taken predict the next

1586
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:48,500
actions you've taken predict the next
 

1587
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,800
actions you've taken predict the next
action and that sounds exactly like

1588
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:50,810
action and that sounds exactly like
 

1589
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,950
action and that sounds exactly like
machine translation where and that's

machine translation where and that's
 

1591
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,729

into so once you run out of imitation

1662
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:15,979
into so once you run out of imitation
 

1663
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:19,810
into so once you run out of imitation
right so so indeed you can bootstrap

1664
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:19,820
right so so indeed you can bootstrap
 

1665
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,560
right so so indeed you can bootstrap
from human replays but then the agents

1666
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:23,570
from human replays but then the agents
 

1667
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,710
from human replays but then the agents
you get are actually not as good as the

1668
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:26,720
you get are actually not as good as the
 

1669
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,349
you get are actually not as good as the
humans you imitated right so how do you

1670
00:33:29,349 --> 00:33:29,359
humans you imitated right so how do you
 

1671
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:32,799
humans you imitated right so how do you
imitate well we take humans from 3,000

1672
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:32,809
imitate well we take humans from 3,000
 

1673
00:33:32,809 --> 00:33:35,950
imitate well we take humans from 3,000
MMR and hire 3,000 MMR is just a metric

1674
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:35,960
MMR and hire 3,000 MMR is just a metric
 

1675
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:39,700
MMR and hire 3,000 MMR is just a metric
of human skill and 3,000 MMR might be

1676
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:39,710
of human skill and 3,000 MMR might be
 

1677
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:42,339
of human skill and 3,000 MMR might be
like 50% percentile right so it's just

1678
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:42,349
like 50% percentile right so it's just
 

1679
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:44,499
like 50% percentile right so it's just
Kevin average human what's that so maybe

1680
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:44,509
Kevin average human what's that so maybe
 

1681
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:47,859
Kevin average human what's that so maybe
quick pause MMR's ranking scale the

1682
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:47,869
quick pause MMR's ranking scale the
 

1683
00:33:47,869 --> 00:33:50,469
quick pause MMR's ranking scale the
matchmaking rating yeah for players so

1684
00:33:50,469 --> 00:33:50,479
matchmaking rating yeah for players so
 

1685
00:33:50,479 --> 00:33:52,299
matchmaking rating yeah for players so
street uh remember there's like a master

1686
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:52,309
street uh remember there's like a master
 

1687
00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:55,210
street uh remember there's like a master
and a grandmaster with 3000 so 3,000 is

1688
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:55,220
and a grandmaster with 3000 so 3,000 is
 

1689
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:57,700
and a grandmaster with 3000 so 3,000 is
is pretty bad I think it's kind of gold

1690
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:57,710
is pretty bad I think it's kind of gold
 

1691
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:59,320
is pretty bad I think it's kind of gold
level it just sounds really good

1692
00:33:59,320 --> 00:33:59,330
level it just sounds really good
 

1693
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,239
level it just sounds really good
relative to chess I think oh yeah I know

1694
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:01,249
relative to chess I think oh yeah I know
 

1695
00:34:01,249 --> 00:34:03,129
relative to chess I think oh yeah I know
the the rating is the best in the world

1696
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:03,139
the the rating is the best in the world
 

1697
00:34:03,139 --> 00:34:04,790
the the rating is the best in the world
are at 7,000 mm

1698
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:04,800
are at 7,000 mm
 

1699
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,490
are at 7,000 mm
so 3,000 it's a bit like Eloy indeed

1700
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:07,500
so 3,000 it's a bit like Eloy indeed
 

1701
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,540
so 3,000 it's a bit like Eloy indeed
right so 3,300 just allows us to not

1702
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:11,550
right so 3,300 just allows us to not
 

1703
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,270
right so 3,300 just allows us to not
filter a lot of the data so we like to

1704
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:14,280
filter a lot of the data so we like to
 

1705
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,740
filter a lot of the data so we like to
have a lot of data in deep learning as

1706
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:15,750
have a lot of data in deep learning as
 

1707
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:18,290
have a lot of data in deep learning as
you probably know so we take these kind

1708
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,300
you probably know so we take these kind
 

1709
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:21,320
you probably know so we take these kind
of 3,500 and above but then we do a very

1710
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,330
of 3,500 and above but then we do a very
 

1711
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,660
of 3,500 and above but then we do a very
interesting trick which is we tell the

1712
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:23,670
interesting trick which is we tell the
 

1713
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,970
interesting trick which is we tell the
neural network what level they are

1714
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:25,980
neural network what level they are
 

1715
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,120
neural network what level they are
imitating so we say these replay you're

1716
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:29,130
imitating so we say these replay you're
 

1717
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,669
imitating so we say these replay you're
gonna try to imitate to predict the next

1718
00:34:31,669 --> 00:34:31,679
gonna try to imitate to predict the next
 

1719
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,230
gonna try to imitate to predict the next
action for all the actions that you're

1720
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:33,240
action for all the actions that you're
 

1721
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:36,230
action for all the actions that you're
gonna see is a 4,000 mm our replay this

1722
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:36,240
gonna see is a 4,000 mm our replay this
 

1723
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,350
gonna see is a 4,000 mm our replay this
one is a 6,000 mm our replay and what

1724
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:39,360
one is a 6,000 mm our replay and what
 

1725
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,330
one is a 6,000 mm our replay and what
what's cool about this is then we take

1726
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:41,340
what's cool about this is then we take
 

1727
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,580
what's cool about this is then we take
this policy that is being trained from

1728
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:43,590
this policy that is being trained from
 

1729
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:45,710
this policy that is being trained from
human and then we can ask it to play

1730
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:45,720
human and then we can ask it to play
 

1731
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,080
human and then we can ask it to play
like a 3,000 mm our player by setting a

1732
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,090
like a 3,000 mm our player by setting a
 

1733
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,480
like a 3,000 mm our player by setting a
bit saying well okay play like a 3,000

1734
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:50,490
bit saying well okay play like a 3,000
 

1735
00:34:50,490 --> 00:34:52,640
bit saying well okay play like a 3,000
mm our player or play like a 6,000 mm

1736
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:52,650
mm our player or play like a 6,000 mm
 

1737
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,800
mm our player or play like a 6,000 mm
our player and you actually see how the

1738
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:54,810
our player and you actually see how the
 

1739
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:56,960
our player and you actually see how the
policy behaves differently

1740
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:56,970
policy behaves differently
 

1741
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:59,750
policy behaves differently
it gets worse economy if you play like a

1742
00:34:59,750 --> 00:34:59,760
it gets worse economy if you play like a
 

1743
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,390
it gets worse economy if you play like a
gold level player it does less actions

1744
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:02,400
gold level player it does less actions
 

1745
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,190
gold level player it does less actions
per minute which is the number of clicks

1746
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:04,200
per minute which is the number of clicks
 

1747
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,840
per minute which is the number of clicks
or number of actions that you will issue

1748
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:05,850
or number of actions that you will issue
 

1749
00:35:05,850 --> 00:35:08,510
or number of actions that you will issue
in a whole minute and it's very

1750
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:08,520
in a whole minute and it's very
 

1751
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,860
in a whole minute and it's very
interesting to see that it kind of

1752
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:09,870
interesting to see that it kind of
 

1753
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:12,440
interesting to see that it kind of
imitates the skill level quite well but

1754
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:12,450
imitates the skill level quite well but
 

1755
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,510
imitates the skill level quite well but
if we ask you to play like a 6000 mm our

1756
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:14,520
if we ask you to play like a 6000 mm our
 

1757
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,080
if we ask you to play like a 6000 mm our
player

1758
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:15,090
player
 

1759
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,120
player
we tested of course these policies to

1760
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,130
we tested of course these policies to
 

1761
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,310
we tested of course these policies to
see how well they do they actually beat

1762
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:19,320
see how well they do they actually beat
 

1763
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,410
see how well they do they actually beat
all the built-in ai's that these are put

1764
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:21,420
all the built-in ai's that these are put
 

1765
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:23,180
all the built-in ai's that these are put
in the game but they're nowhere near

1766
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:23,190
in the game but they're nowhere near
 

1767
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,370
in the game but they're nowhere near
6000 mm our players right they might be

1768
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:25,380
6000 mm our players right they might be
 

1769
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,260
6000 mm our players right they might be
maybe around gold level

1770
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,270
maybe around gold level
 

1771
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,260
maybe around gold level
platinum perhaps so there's still a lot

1772
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,270
platinum perhaps so there's still a lot
 

1773
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,300
platinum perhaps so there's still a lot
of work to be done for the policy to

1774
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,310
of work to be done for the policy to
 

1775
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,150
of work to be done for the policy to
truly understand what it means to win so

1776
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:35,160
truly understand what it means to win so
 

1777
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,730
truly understand what it means to win so
far we only asked them ok here is the

1778
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:37,740
far we only asked them ok here is the
 

1779
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,770
far we only asked them ok here is the
screen and that's what happened on the

1780
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:39,780
screen and that's what happened on the
 

1781
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,260
screen and that's what happened on the
game until this point what would the

1782
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:42,270
game until this point what would the
 

1783
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:44,240
game until this point what would the
next action be that we asked you know we

1784
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:44,250
next action be that we asked you know we
 

1785
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,820
next action be that we asked you know we
asked a pro - now say all this you're

1786
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:46,830
asked a pro - now say all this you're
 

1787
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,510
asked a pro - now say all this you're
gonna click here or here or there and

1788
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:49,520
gonna click here or here or there and
 

1789
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,820
gonna click here or here or there and

wins and losses is very important to

1792
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:54,600
wins and losses is very important to
 

1793
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,200

then start to refine otherwise the

1794
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:57,210
then start to refine otherwise the
 

1795
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,360
then start to refine otherwise the
policy can get loose can can just go off

1796
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,370
policy can get loose can can just go off
 

1797
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:00,890
policy can get loose can can just go off
policy as we call it that's so

1798
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:00,900
policy as we call it that's so
 

1799
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,810
policy as we call it that's so
interesting you can at least hope

1800
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:02,820
interesting you can at least hope
 

1801
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,810
interesting you can at least hope
eventually to be able to control a

1802
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:04,820
eventually to be able to control a

eventually to be able to control a

1805
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,000
policy approximately to be a some MMR
level that's that's so interesting

1806
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,010
level that's that's so interesting
 

1807
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:12,860
level that's that's so interesting
especially given that you have ground

1808
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:12,870
especially given that you have ground
 

1809
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,230
especially given that you have ground
truth for a lot of these cases right can

1810
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:15,240
truth for a lot of these cases right can
 

1811
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,780
truth for a lot of these cases right can
ask your personal questions or what's

1812
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:17,790
ask your personal questions or what's
 

1813
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,819
ask your personal questions or what's
your mmm

your mmm
 

1815
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:21,609
your mmm
well I haven't played Starcraft 2 so I

1816
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:21,619
well I haven't played Starcraft 2 so I
 

1817
00:36:21,619 --> 00:36:24,729
well I haven't played Starcraft 2 so I
am unranked oh is the kind of Lois

1818
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:24,739
am unranked oh is the kind of Lois
 

1819
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:27,599
am unranked oh is the kind of Lois
League okay so I used to play Starcraft

1820
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:27,609
League okay so I used to play Starcraft
 

1821
00:36:27,609 --> 00:36:30,190
League okay so I used to play Starcraft
the first one and but you haven't

1822
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:30,200
the first one and but you haven't
 

1823
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,609
the first one and but you haven't
seriously played so the best player we

1824
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:33,619
seriously played so the best player we
 

1825
00:36:33,619 --> 00:36:36,339
seriously played so the best player we
have a deep mind is about five thousand

1826
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:36,349
have a deep mind is about five thousand
 

1827
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:40,209
have a deep mind is about five thousand
MMR which is high masters is not at

1828
00:36:40,209 --> 00:36:40,219
MMR which is high masters is not at
 

1829
00:36:40,219 --> 00:36:41,680
MMR which is high masters is not at
Grandmaster level

1830
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:41,690
Grandmaster level
 

1831
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,079
Grandmaster level
Grandmaster level would be the top 200

1832
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,089
Grandmaster level would be the top 200
 

1833
00:36:44,089 --> 00:36:46,180
Grandmaster level would be the top 200
players in a certain region like Europe

1834
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,190
players in a certain region like Europe
 

1835
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,890
players in a certain region like Europe
or America or Asia but for me it would

1836
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:50,900
or America or Asia but for me it would
 

1837
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:52,660
or America or Asia but for me it would
be hard to say I am very bad at the game

1838
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:52,670
be hard to say I am very bad at the game
 

1839
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,420
be hard to say I am very bad at the game
I actually played alpha star a bit too

1840
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:55,430
I actually played alpha star a bit too
 

1841
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,489
I actually played alpha star a bit too
late and it bit me I remember the whole

1842
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:57,499
late and it bit me I remember the whole
 

1843
00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:00,009
late and it bit me I remember the whole
team was Oreo you should play yeah and I

1844

team was Oreo you should play yeah and I
 

1845
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:02,079
team was Oreo you should play yeah and I
was it looks like it's not so good yet

1846
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:02,089
was it looks like it's not so good yet
 

1847
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:04,839
was it looks like it's not so good yet
and then I remember I kind of got busy

1848
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:04,849
and then I remember I kind of got busy
 

1849
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:07,150
and then I remember I kind of got busy
and waited an extra week and I played

1850
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:07,160
and waited an extra week and I played
 

1851
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,099
and waited an extra week and I played
and it really beat me

1852
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:09,109
and it really beat me
 

1853
00:37:09,109 --> 00:37:11,049
and it really beat me
very badly was it I've heard that feel

1854
00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:11,059
very badly was it I've heard that feel
 

1855
00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:13,209
very badly was it I've heard that feel
it's not an amazing feelings amazing

1856
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:13,219
it's not an amazing feelings amazing
 

1857
00:37:13,219 --> 00:37:16,150
it's not an amazing feelings amazing
yeah I mean obviously I tried my best

1858
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:16,160
yeah I mean obviously I tried my best
 

1859
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,489

and I try to also impress my because I

1860
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:18,499
and I try to also impress my because I
 

1861
00:37:18,499 --> 00:37:20,109
and I try to also impress my because I
actually played the first game so I'm

1862
00:37:20,109 --> 00:37:20,119
actually played the first game so I'm
 

1863
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,390
actually played the first game so I'm
still pretty good at micromanagement

1864
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
still pretty good at micromanagement
 

1865
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,430
still pretty good at micromanagement
um the promise I just don't understand

1866
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:24,440
um the promise I just don't understand
 

1867
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,339
um the promise I just don't understand
Starcraft 2 I understand Starcraft and

1868
00:37:27,339 --> 00:37:27,349
Starcraft 2 I understand Starcraft and
 

1869
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,789
Starcraft 2 I understand Starcraft and
when I played Starcraft I probably was

1870
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:29,799
when I played Starcraft I probably was
 

1871
00:37:29,799 --> 00:37:32,349
when I played Starcraft I probably was
consistently like for for a couple years

1872
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:32,359
consistently like for for a couple years
 

1873
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,069
consistently like for for a couple years
top 32 in Europe so I was decent but at

1874
00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:36,079
top 32 in Europe so I was decent but at
 

1875
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,589
top 32 in Europe so I was decent but at
the time we didn't have this kind of MMR

1876
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:38,599
the time we didn't have this kind of MMR
 

1877
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,569
the time we didn't have this kind of MMR
system as as well established so it

1878
00:37:40,569 --> 00:37:40,579
system as as well established so it
 

1879
00:37:40,579 --> 00:37:42,370
system as as well established so it
would be hard to know what what it was

1880
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:42,380
would be hard to know what what it was
 

1881
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:44,049
would be hard to know what what it was
back then so what's the difference in

1882
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:44,059
back then so what's the difference in
 

1883
00:37:44,059 --> 00:37:46,109
back then so what's the difference in
interface between alpha star and

1884
00:37:46,109 --> 00:37:46,119
interface between alpha star and
 

1885
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:48,849
interface between alpha star and
Starcraft and a human player and

1886
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:48,859
Starcraft and a human player and
 

1887
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:51,549
Starcraft and a human player and
Starcraft is there any significant

1888
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:51,559
Starcraft is there any significant
 

1889
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:52,989
Starcraft is there any significant
differences between the way they both

1890
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:52,999
differences between the way they both
 

1891
00:37:52,999 --> 00:37:55,299
differences between the way they both
see the game I would say the way they

1892
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:55,309
see the game I would say the way they
 

1893
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,609
see the game I would say the way they
see the game there's a few things that

1894
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:57,619
see the game there's a few things that
 

1895
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:01,630
see the game there's a few things that
are just very hard to simulate the main

1896
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:01,640
are just very hard to simulate the main
 

1897
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,450
are just very hard to simulate the main
one perhaps which is obvious in

1898
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:04,460
one perhaps which is obvious in
 

1899
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,349
one perhaps which is obvious in
hindsight is what's called cloaked units

1900
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:08,359
hindsight is what's called cloaked units
 

1901
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:11,200
hindsight is what's called cloaked units
which are invisible units so in

1902
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,210
which are invisible units so in
 

1903
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:13,359
which are invisible units so in
StarCraft you can make some units that

1904
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:13,369
StarCraft you can make some units that
 

1905
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:16,420
StarCraft you can make some units that
you need to have a particular kind of

1906
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:16,430
you need to have a particular kind of
 

1907
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,239
you need to have a particular kind of
unit to detect it so these units are

1908
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:19,249
unit to detect it so these units are
 

1909
00:38:19,249 --> 00:38:19,959
unit to detect it so these units are
invisible

1910
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:19,969
invisible
 

1911
00:38:19,969 --> 00:38:21,999
invisible
if you cannot detect them you cannot

1912
00:38:21,999 --> 00:38:22,009
if you cannot detect them you cannot
 

1913
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,309
if you cannot detect them you cannot
target them so they would just you know

1914
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:24,319
target them so they would just you know
 

1915
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:26,289
target them so they would just you know
destroy your buildings or kill your

1916
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:26,299
destroy your buildings or kill your
 

1917
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,979
destroy your buildings or kill your
workers but

1918
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:28,989
workers but
 

1919
00:38:28,989 --> 00:38:31,120
workers but
despite the fact you cannot target the

1920
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,130
despite the fact you cannot target the
 

1921
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,400
despite the fact you cannot target the
unit there's a shimmer that as a human

1922
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:33,410
unit there's a shimmer that as a human
 

1923
00:38:33,410 --> 00:38:35,440
unit there's a shimmer that as a human
you observe I mean you need to train a

1924
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:35,450
you observe I mean you need to train a
 

1925
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:37,599
you observe I mean you need to train a
little bit you need to pay attention but

1926
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:37,609
little bit you need to pay attention but
 

1927
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,239
little bit you need to pay attention but
you would see this kind of space-time as

1928
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:40,249
you would see this kind of space-time as
 

1929
00:38:40,249 --> 00:38:42,009
you would see this kind of space-time as
space-time like distortion and you

1930
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:42,019
space-time like distortion and you
 

1931
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:44,920
space-time like distortion and you
wouldn't know okay there art yeah yeah

1932
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:44,930
wouldn't know okay there art yeah yeah
 

1933
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:47,979
wouldn't know okay there art yeah yeah
it's like a wave thing yeah she's kinda

1934
00:38:47,979 --> 00:38:47,989
it's like a wave thing yeah she's kinda
 

1935
00:38:47,989 --> 00:38:49,630
it's like a wave thing yeah she's kinda
storsch I don't like it that's really

1936
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:49,640
storsch I don't like it that's really
 

1937
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,789
storsch I don't like it that's really
like the Blizzard term is shimmer

1938
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:51,799
like the Blizzard term is shimmer
 

1939
00:38:51,799 --> 00:38:54,819
like the Blizzard term is shimmer
shimmer and so this shimmer professional

1940
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:54,829
shimmer and so this shimmer professional
 

1941
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:57,039
shimmer and so this shimmer professional
players actually can see it immediately

1942
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:57,049
players actually can see it immediately
 

1943
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:59,769
players actually can see it immediately
they understand it very well but it's

1944
00:38:59,769 --> 00:38:59,779
they understand it very well but it's
 

1945
00:38:59,779 --> 00:39:01,749
they understand it very well but it's
still something that requires certain

1946
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:01,759
still something that requires certain
 

1947
00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:03,579
still something that requires certain
amount of attention and and and it's

1948
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:03,589
amount of attention and and and it's
 

1949
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:04,960
amount of attention and and and it's
kind of a bit annoying to deal with

1950
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:04,970
kind of a bit annoying to deal with
 

1951
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:07,509
kind of a bit annoying to deal with
whereas four alpha star in terms of

1952
00:39:07,509 --> 00:39:07,519
whereas four alpha star in terms of
 

1953
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:09,969
whereas four alpha star in terms of
vision it's very hard for us to simulate

1954
00:39:09,969 --> 00:39:09,979
vision it's very hard for us to simulate
 

1955
00:39:09,979 --> 00:39:11,259
vision it's very hard for us to simulate
sort of

1956
00:39:11,259 --> 00:39:11,269
sort of
 

1957
00:39:11,269 --> 00:39:13,269
sort of
you know are you looking at these pixel

1958
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:13,279
you know are you looking at these pixel
 

1959
00:39:13,279 --> 00:39:15,789
you know are you looking at these pixel
in the screen and so on so um the only

1960
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:15,799
in the screen and so on so um the only
 

1961
00:39:15,799 --> 00:39:18,219
in the screen and so on so um the only
thing we can do is we there is a unit

1962
00:39:18,219 --> 00:39:18,229
thing we can do is we there is a unit
 

1963
00:39:18,229 --> 00:39:20,289
thing we can do is we there is a unit
that's invisible over there so alpha

1964
00:39:20,289 --> 00:39:20,299
that's invisible over there so alpha
 

1965
00:39:20,299 --> 00:39:21,989
that's invisible over there so alpha
star would know that immediately

1966
00:39:21,989 --> 00:39:21,999
star would know that immediately
 

1967
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:24,099
star would know that immediately
obviously still obeys the rules you

1968
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:24,109
obviously still obeys the rules you
 

1969
00:39:24,109 --> 00:39:26,259
obviously still obeys the rules you
cannot attack the unit you must have a

1970
00:39:26,259 --> 00:39:26,269
cannot attack the unit you must have a
 

1971
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:28,239
cannot attack the unit you must have a
detector and so on but it's it's kind of

1972
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:28,249
detector and so on but it's it's kind of
 

1973
00:39:28,249 --> 00:39:30,489
detector and so on but it's it's kind of
one of the main things that it just

1974
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:30,499
one of the main things that it just
 

1975
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,049
one of the main things that it just
doesn't feel there's there's a very

1976
00:39:32,049 --> 00:39:32,059
doesn't feel there's there's a very
 

1977
00:39:32,059 --> 00:39:33,789
doesn't feel there's there's a very
proper way I mean you could imagine are

1978
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:33,799
proper way I mean you could imagine are
 

1979
00:39:33,799 --> 00:39:36,009
proper way I mean you could imagine are
you you don't have high present know

1980
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:36,019
you you don't have high present know
 

1981
00:39:36,019 --> 00:39:37,749
you you don't have high present know
exactly where it is or sometimes you see

1982
00:39:37,749 --> 00:39:37,759
exactly where it is or sometimes you see
 

1983
00:39:37,759 --> 00:39:39,880
exactly where it is or sometimes you see
it sometimes you don't but it's it's

1984
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:39,890
it sometimes you don't but it's it's
 

1985
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:42,969
it sometimes you don't but it's it's
just really really complicated to get it

1986
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:42,979
just really really complicated to get it
 

1987
00:39:42,979 --> 00:39:44,620
just really really complicated to get it
so that everyone would agree oh that's

1988
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:44,630
so that everyone would agree oh that's
 

1989
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:46,359
so that everyone would agree oh that's
that's the best way to simulate this

1990
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:46,369
that's the best way to simulate this
 

1991
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:48,130
that's the best way to simulate this
right you know it seems like a

1992
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:48,140
right you know it seems like a
 

1993
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,229
right you know it seems like a
perception problem it is a perception

1994
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:50,239
perception problem it is a perception
 

1995
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:53,229
perception problem it is a perception
problem so so the only problem is people

1996
00:39:53,229 --> 00:39:53,239
problem so so the only problem is people
 

1997
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:54,700
problem so so the only problem is people
are you ask what's the difference

1998
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:54,710
are you ask what's the difference
 

1999
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:56,709
are you ask what's the difference
between how humans perceive the game I

2000
00:39:56,709 --> 00:39:56,719
between how humans perceive the game I
 

2001
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,900
between how humans perceive the game I
would say they wouldn't be able to tell

2002
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:58,910
would say they wouldn't be able to tell
 

2003
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:01,239
would say they wouldn't be able to tell
a shimmer immediately as it appears on

2004
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:01,249
a shimmer immediately as it appears on
 

2005
00:40:01,249 --> 00:40:01,690
a shimmer immediately as it appears on
the screen

2006
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:01,700
the screen
 

2007
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:04,690
the screen
whereas alpha star in principal sees it

2008
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:04,700
whereas alpha star in principal sees it
 

2009
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,729
whereas alpha star in principal sees it
very sharply right it seems okay it sees

2010
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:06,739
very sharply right it seems okay it sees
 

2011
00:40:06,739 --> 00:40:08,529
very sharply right it seems okay it sees
that the beat turned from zero to one

2012
00:40:08,529 --> 00:40:08,539
that the beat turned from zero to one
 

2013
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,150
that the beat turned from zero to one
meaning there's now a unit there

2014
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,160
meaning there's now a unit there
 

2015
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,219
meaning there's now a unit there
although you don't know the unit or you

2016
00:40:12,219 --> 00:40:12,229
although you don't know the unit or you
 

2017
00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:13,779
although you don't know the unit or you
don't know it you know you know that you

2018
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:13,789
don't know it you know you know that you
 

2019
00:40:13,789 --> 00:40:16,180
don't know it you know you know that you
cannot attack it and so on God so that

2020
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:16,190
cannot attack it and so on God so that
 

2021
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:18,099
cannot attack it and so on God so that
from from a vision standpoint that

2022
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:18,109
from from a vision standpoint that
 

2023
00:40:18,109 --> 00:40:21,519
from from a vision standpoint that
probably is the one that is kind of the

2024
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:21,529
probably is the one that is kind of the
 

2025
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:23,739
probably is the one that is kind of the
most obvious one then there are things

2026
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:23,749
most obvious one then there are things
 

2027
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:25,450
most obvious one then there are things
humans cannot do perfectly even

2028
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:25,460
humans cannot do perfectly even
 

2029
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,609
humans cannot do perfectly even
professionals which is they might miss a

2030
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:27,619
professionals which is they might miss a
 

2031
00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:29,769
professionals which is they might miss a
detail or they might have not seen a

2032
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:29,779
detail or they might have not seen a
 

2033
00:40:29,779 --> 00:40:32,349
detail or they might have not seen a
unit and obviously as a computer if

2034
00:40:32,349 --> 00:40:32,359
unit and obviously as a computer if
 

2035
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:34,329
unit and obviously as a computer if
there's a corner of the screen that

2036
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:34,339
there's a corner of the screen that
 

2037
00:40:34,339 --> 00:40:36,459
there's a corner of the screen that
turns green because a unit enters the

2038
00:40:36,459 --> 00:40:36,469
turns green because a unit enters the
 

2039
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:38,920
turns green because a unit enters the
field of view that can go into the

2040
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:38,930
field of view that can go into the
 

2041
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,650
field of view that can go into the
memory of the agent the lsdm and Percy's

2042
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:41,660
memory of the agent the lsdm and Percy's
 

2043
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,609
memory of the agent the lsdm and Percy's
there for a while

2044
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:42,619
there for a while
 

2045
00:40:42,619 --> 00:40:44,650
there for a while
for whatever for however long is

2046
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:44,660
for whatever for however long is
 

2047
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,769
for whatever for however long is
relevant right and in terms of action it

2048
00:40:47,769 --> 00:40:47,779
relevant right and in terms of action it
 

2049
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,140
relevant right and in terms of action it
seems like the rate of action from an

2050
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,150
seems like the rate of action from an
 

2051
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:52,359
seems like the rate of action from an
alpha star is comparative if not slower

2052
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:52,369
alpha star is comparative if not slower
 

2053
00:40:52,369 --> 00:40:54,730
alpha star is comparative if not slower
than professional players but is there

2054
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:54,740
than professional players but is there
 

2055
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,650
than professional players but is there
but it's more precise as well right so

2056
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:56,660
but it's more precise as well right so
 

2057
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,539
but it's more precise as well right so
so that's that's a very like that's

2058
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:58,549
so that's that's a very like that's
 

2059
00:40:58,549 --> 00:41:01,599
so that's that's a very like that's
really probably the one that is causing

2060
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:01,609
really probably the one that is causing
 

2061
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:04,420
really probably the one that is causing
us more issues for a couple of reasons

2062
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:04,430
us more issues for a couple of reasons
 

2063
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:04,930
us more issues for a couple of reasons
right

2064
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:04,940
right
 

2065
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,720
right
the first one is Starcraft has been an

there's really not been a kind of a very
 

2075

there's really not been a kind of a very

2101
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,529
realistic 800 is probably not but you
see humans doing a lot of actions

see humans doing a lot of actions
 

2103
00:41:56,539 --> 00:41:58,660
see humans doing a lot of actions

because they warm up and they kind of

select things and spam and so on just so
 

2107
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,190
select things and spam and so on just so
that when they need they have the

that when they need they have the

accuracy so we came into this by not
 

2111
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:09,999

having kind of a standard way to say

00:42:10,009 --> 00:42:12,819
having kind of a standard way to say
well how do we measure whether an agent

well how do we measure whether an agent
 

2115
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:16,269
well how do we measure whether an agent

is at human level or not on the other

because we do imitation learning agents

because we do imitation learning agents
 

2121
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,579
because we do imitation learning agents
turned out to act like humans in terms

00:42:24,579 --> 00:42:24,589
turned out to act like humans in terms
 

2123
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,920
turned out to act like humans in terms
of rate of actions even Precision's and

00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:31,309
policy you could see all this you could
 

2129
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:34,150
policy you could see all this you could
see how agents like to spam click to

2130
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:34,160
see how agents like to spam click to
 

2131
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,069
see how agents like to spam click to
move here if you played specially Diablo

2132
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:36,079
move here if you played specially Diablo
 

2133
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,089
move here if you played specially Diablo
you would know what I mean I mean you

2134
00:42:37,089 --> 00:42:37,099
you would know what I mean I mean you
 

2135
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:39,249
you would know what I mean I mean you
just duck like spam or a move here

2136
00:42:39,249 --> 00:42:39,259
just duck like spam or a move here
 

2137
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:40,749
just duck like spam or a move here
Murphy a move here you're doing

2138
00:42:40,749 --> 00:42:40,759
Murphy a move here you're doing
 

2139
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,630
Murphy a move here you're doing
literally like maybe five actions in two

2140
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:43,640
literally like maybe five actions in two
 

2141
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,789
literally like maybe five actions in two
seconds but these actions are not very

2142
00:42:45,789 --> 00:42:45,799
seconds but these actions are not very
 

2143
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:47,529
seconds but these actions are not very
meaning meaningful one would have

2144
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:47,539
meaning meaningful one would have
 

2145
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:50,109
meaning meaningful one would have
sufficed so on the one hand we start

2146
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:50,119
sufficed so on the one hand we start
 

2147
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:53,289
sufficed so on the one hand we start
from this imitation policy that is at

2148
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:53,299
from this imitation policy that is at
 

2149
00:42:53,299 --> 00:42:55,059
from this imitation policy that is at
the ballpark of the actions per millions

2150
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:55,069
the ballpark of the actions per millions
 

2151
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:56,380
the ballpark of the actions per millions
of humans because it acts

2152
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:56,390
of humans because it acts
 

2153
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,509
of humans because it acts
statistically trying to imitate humans

2154
00:42:58,509 --> 00:42:58,519
statistically trying to imitate humans
 

2155
00:42:58,519 --> 00:43:00,700
statistically trying to imitate humans
so we see these very nicely in the

2156
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:00,710
so we see these very nicely in the
 

2157
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,049
so we see these very nicely in the
curves that we showed in the blog post

2158
00:43:02,049 --> 00:43:02,059
curves that we showed in the blog post
 

2159
00:43:02,059 --> 00:43:04,299
curves that we showed in the blog post
like this these actions per minute and

2160
00:43:04,299 --> 00:43:04,309
like this these actions per minute and
 

2161
00:43:04,309 --> 00:43:06,809
like this these actions per minute and
the distribution looks very human-like

2162
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:06,819
the distribution looks very human-like
 

2163
00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:10,870
the distribution looks very human-like
but then of course as self play kicks in

2164
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880
but then of course as self play kicks in
 

2165
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,370
but then of course as self play kicks in
and and that's the part we haven't

2166
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:12,380
and and that's the part we haven't
 

2167
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,019
and and that's the part we haven't
talked too much yet but of course the

2168
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:14,029
talked too much yet but of course the
 

2169
00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:16,000
talked too much yet but of course the
agent must played getting itself to

2170
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:16,010
agent must played getting itself to
 

2171
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,460
agent must played getting itself to
improve then there's almost no

2172
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:18,470
improve then there's almost no
 

2173
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:20,799
improve then there's almost no
guarantees that these actions will not

2174
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:20,809
guarantees that these actions will not
 

2175
00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:23,410
guarantees that these actions will not
become more precise or even the rate of

2176
00:43:23,410 --> 00:43:23,420
become more precise or even the rate of
 

2177
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,200
become more precise or even the rate of
actions is going to increase over them

2178
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:25,210
actions is going to increase over them
 

2179
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:28,930
actions is going to increase over them
so what we did and this is probably kind

2180
00:43:28,930 --> 00:43:28,940
so what we did and this is probably kind
 

2181
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,579
so what we did and this is probably kind
of the first attempt that we thought was

2182
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:30,589
of the first attempt that we thought was
 

2183
00:43:30,589 --> 00:43:31,990
of the first attempt that we thought was
reasonable is we looked at the

2184
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:32,000
reasonable is we looked at the
 

2185
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,450
reasonable is we looked at the
distribution of actions for humans for

2186
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:34,460
distribution of actions for humans for
 

2187
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,029
distribution of actions for humans for
certain windows of time and just to give

2188
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:37,039
certain windows of time and just to give
 

2189
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:38,559
certain windows of time and just to give
a perspective because I guess I

2190
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:38,569
a perspective because I guess I
 

2191
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:40,809
a perspective because I guess I
mentioned that some of these agents that

2192
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:40,819
mentioned that some of these agents that
 

2193
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:42,490
mentioned that some of these agents that
are programmatic let's call them they do

2194
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:42,500
are programmatic let's call them they do
 

2195
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,220
are programmatic let's call them they do
40,000 actions per minute professionals

2196
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:45,230
40,000 actions per minute professionals
 

2197
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:47,829
40,000 actions per minute professionals
as I said to 300 to 800 so what we

2198
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:47,839
as I said to 300 to 800 so what we
 

2199
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,480
as I said to 300 to 800 so what we
looked is we look at a distribution over

2200
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:49,490
looked is we look at a distribution over
 

2201
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,400
looked is we look at a distribution over
professional gamers and we took

2202
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:51,410
professional gamers and we took
 

2203
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:54,220
professional gamers and we took
reasonably high actions per minute but

2204
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:54,230
reasonably high actions per minute but
 

2205
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:56,799
reasonably high actions per minute but
we kind of identify certain cat offs

2206
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:56,809
we kind of identify certain cat offs
 

2207
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:59,710
we kind of identify certain cat offs
after which if even if the agent wanted

2208
00:43:59,710 --> 00:43:59,720
after which if even if the agent wanted
 

2209
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,130
after which if even if the agent wanted
to act these actions would be dropped

2210
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:02,140
to act these actions would be dropped
 

2211
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,480
to act these actions would be dropped
but the problem is this cutoff is

2212
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:04,490
but the problem is this cutoff is
 

2213
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:07,690
but the problem is this cutoff is
probably set a bit too high and what

2214
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:07,700
probably set a bit too high and what
 

2215
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:09,519
probably set a bit too high and what
ends up happening even though the games

2216
00:44:09,519 --> 00:44:09,529
ends up happening even though the games
 

2217
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:11,589
ends up happening even though the games
and when we ask the professionals and

2218
00:44:11,589 --> 00:44:11,599
and when we ask the professionals and
 

2219
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:13,420
and when we ask the professionals and
the gamers by by and large they feel

2220
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:13,430
the gamers by by and large they feel
 

2221
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:16,240
the gamers by by and large they feel
like it's playing human-like there are

2222
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:16,250
like it's playing human-like there are
 

2223
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:19,509
like it's playing human-like there are
some Asians that developed maybe

2224
00:44:19,509 --> 00:44:19,519
some Asians that developed maybe
 

2225
00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:23,559
some Asians that developed maybe
slightly too high a PMS which is actions

2226
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:23,569
slightly too high a PMS which is actions
 

2227
00:44:23,569 --> 00:44:25,829
slightly too high a PMS which is actions
per minute combined with the precision

2228
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:25,839
per minute combined with the precision
 

2229
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:28,329
per minute combined with the precision
which made people sort of start

2230
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:28,339
which made people sort of start
 

2231
00:44:28,339 --> 00:44:30,190
which made people sort of start
discussing a very interesting issue

2232
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:30,200
discussing a very interesting issue
 

2233
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:32,170
discussing a very interesting issue
which is should we have limited these

2234
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:32,180
which is should we have limited these
 

2235
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,140
which is should we have limited these
should we just let it loose and see what

2236
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:35,150
should we just let it loose and see what
 

2237
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:38,349
should we just let it loose and see what
cool things it can come up with right so

2238
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:38,359
cool things it can come up with right so
 

2239
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:40,299
cool things it can come up with right so
this is in itself an extremely

2240
00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:40,309
this is in itself an extremely
 

2241
00:44:40,309 --> 00:44:42,880
this is in itself an extremely
interesting question but the same way

2242
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:42,890
interesting question but the same way
 

2243
00:44:42,890 --> 00:44:44,349
interesting question but the same way
that modeling the shimmer would be so

2244
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:44,359
that modeling the shimmer would be so
 

2245
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:44,999
that modeling the shimmer would be so
difficult

2246
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:45,009
difficult
 

2247
00:44:45,009 --> 00:44:47,680
difficult
modeling absolutely all the details

2248
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:47,690
modeling absolutely all the details
 

2249
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:49,900
modeling absolutely all the details
about muscles and precision and an

2250
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:49,910
about muscles and precision and an
 

2251
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:52,269
about muscles and precision and an
tiredness of humans would be quite

2252
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:52,279
tiredness of humans would be quite
 

2253
00:44:52,279 --> 00:44:55,230
tiredness of humans would be quite
difficult right so we're here in kind of

2254
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:55,240
difficult right so we're here in kind of
 

2255
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,460
difficult right so we're here in kind of
innovating in this sense of okay what

2256
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:57,470
innovating in this sense of okay what
 

2257
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:00,160
innovating in this sense of okay what
could be maybe the next iteration of

2258
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,170
could be maybe the next iteration of
 

2259
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:03,210
could be maybe the next iteration of
putting more rules that makes the agents

2260
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:03,220
putting more rules that makes the agents
 

2261
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:06,099
putting more rules that makes the agents
more human-like in terms of restrictions

2262
00:45:06,099 --> 00:45:06,109
more human-like in terms of restrictions
 

2263
00:45:06,109 --> 00:45:08,289
more human-like in terms of restrictions
yeah putting constraints that more

2264
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:08,299
yeah putting constraints that more
 

2265
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:09,819
yeah putting constraints that more
constraints yeah that's really

2266
00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:09,829
constraints yeah that's really
 

2267
00:45:09,829 --> 00:45:11,200
constraints yeah that's really
interesting that's really innovative so

2268
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,210
interesting that's really innovative so
 

2269
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,900
interesting that's really innovative so
one of the constraints you put on your

2270
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:13,910
one of the constraints you put on your
 

2271
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:17,049
one of the constraints you put on your
on yourself or at least focused in is on

2272
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:17,059
on yourself or at least focused in is on
 

2273
00:45:17,059 --> 00:45:19,109
on yourself or at least focused in is on
the protoss race as far as I understand

2274
00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:19,119
the protoss race as far as I understand
 

2275
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,220
the protoss race as far as I understand
can you tell me about the different

2276
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:21,230
can you tell me about the different
 

2277
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:25,180
can you tell me about the different
races and how they so protoss terran and

2278
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:25,190
races and how they so protoss terran and
 

2279
00:45:25,190 --> 00:45:27,430
races and how they so protoss terran and
the Zerg how do they compare how do they

2280
00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:27,440
the Zerg how do they compare how do they
 

2281
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,069
the Zerg how do they compare how do they
interact why did you choose Protoss in

2282
00:45:30,069 --> 00:45:30,079
interact why did you choose Protoss in
 

2283
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,039
interact why did you choose Protoss in
right there is in the dynamics of the

2284
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:33,049
right there is in the dynamics of the
 

2285
00:45:33,049 --> 00:45:34,779
right there is in the dynamics of the
game you seen from a strategic

2286
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:34,789
game you seen from a strategic
 

2287
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:38,079
game you seen from a strategic
perspective so Protoss so in stacked of

2288
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:38,089
perspective so Protoss so in stacked of
 

2289
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:40,450
perspective so Protoss so in stacked of
there are three races indeed in the

2290
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:40,460
there are three races indeed in the
 

2291
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,150
there are three races indeed in the
demonstration we saw only the Protoss

2292
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:43,160
demonstration we saw only the Protoss
 

2293
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:45,249
demonstration we saw only the Protoss
race so maybe let's start with that one

2294
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:45,259
race so maybe let's start with that one
 

2295
00:45:45,259 --> 00:45:46,900
race so maybe let's start with that one
Protoss is kind of the most

2296
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:46,910
Protoss is kind of the most
 

2297
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,809
Protoss is kind of the most
technologically advanced race it has

2298
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:49,819
technologically advanced race it has
 

2299
00:45:49,819 --> 00:45:53,440
technologically advanced race it has
units that are expensive but powerful

2300
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:53,450
units that are expensive but powerful
 

2301
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,960
units that are expensive but powerful
right so in general you want to kind of

2302
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:55,970
right so in general you want to kind of
 

2303
00:45:55,970 --> 00:45:58,809
right so in general you want to kind of
conserve your units as you go attack so

2304
00:45:58,809 --> 00:45:58,819
conserve your units as you go attack so
 

2305
00:45:58,819 --> 00:46:00,490
conserve your units as you go attack so
you wanna and and then you want to

2306
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:00,500
you wanna and and then you want to
 

2307
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,249
you wanna and and then you want to
utilize these tactical advantages of

2308
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:03,259
utilize these tactical advantages of
 

2309
00:46:03,259 --> 00:46:07,299
utilize these tactical advantages of
very fancy spells and so on so forth and

2310
00:46:07,299 --> 00:46:07,309
very fancy spells and so on so forth and
 

2311
00:46:07,309 --> 00:46:11,799
very fancy spells and so on so forth and
at the same time they're kind of people

2312
00:46:11,799 --> 00:46:11,809
at the same time they're kind of people
 

2313
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:13,569
at the same time they're kind of people
say like they're they're a bit easier to

2314
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:13,579
say like they're they're a bit easier to
 

2315
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:16,299
say like they're they're a bit easier to
play perhaps right but that I actually

2316
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:16,309
play perhaps right but that I actually
 

2317
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:18,789
play perhaps right but that I actually
didn't know I mean I just talked to now

2318
00:46:18,789 --> 00:46:18,799
didn't know I mean I just talked to now
 

2319
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:20,980
didn't know I mean I just talked to now
a lot to the players that we we work

2320
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:20,990
a lot to the players that we we work
 

2321
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:23,230
a lot to the players that we we work
with TLO and mana and they said oh yeah

2322
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:23,240
with TLO and mana and they said oh yeah
 

2323
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,759
with TLO and mana and they said oh yeah
Protoss is actually people think is

2324
00:46:24,759 --> 00:46:24,769
Protoss is actually people think is
 

2325
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:26,499
Protoss is actually people think is
actually one of the easiest races so

2326
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:26,509
actually one of the easiest races so
 

2327
00:46:26,509 --> 00:46:28,960
actually one of the easiest races so
perhaps the easier that doesn't mean

2328
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:28,970
perhaps the easier that doesn't mean
 

2329
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:30,849
perhaps the easier that doesn't mean
that it's you know obviously

2330
00:46:30,849 --> 00:46:30,859
that it's you know obviously
 

2331
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:33,549
that it's you know obviously
professional players excel at the three

2332
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:33,559
professional players excel at the three
 

2333
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:36,249
professional players excel at the three
races and there's never like a race that

2334
00:46:36,249 --> 00:46:36,259
races and there's never like a race that
 

2335
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:38,769
races and there's never like a race that
dominates for a very long time anyway so

2336
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:38,779
dominates for a very long time anyway so
 

2337
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:40,779
dominates for a very long time anyway so
if you look at the top and 100 in the

2338
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:40,789
if you look at the top and 100 in the
 

2339
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:43,420
if you look at the top and 100 in the
world is there one race that dominates

2340
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:43,430
world is there one race that dominates
 

2341
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,249
world is there one race that dominates
that list it would be hard to know

2342
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:45,259
that list it would be hard to know
 

2343
00:46:45,259 --> 00:46:46,870
that list it would be hard to know
because it depends on the regions I

2344
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:46,880
because it depends on the regions I
 

2345
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,960
because it depends on the regions I
think it's pretty equal in terms of

2346
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:49,970
think it's pretty equal in terms of
 

2347
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,210
think it's pretty equal in terms of
distribution and Blizzard wants it to be

2348
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:52,220
distribution and Blizzard wants it to be
 

2349
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,529
distribution and Blizzard wants it to be
equal right they don't want they

2350
00:46:53,529 --> 00:46:53,539
equal right they don't want they
 

2351
00:46:53,539 --> 00:46:56,380
equal right they don't want they
wouldn't want one race like Protoss to

2352
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:56,390
wouldn't want one race like Protoss to
 

2353
00:46:56,390 --> 00:46:59,039
wouldn't want one race like Protoss to
not be representative in the top place

2354
00:46:59,039 --> 00:46:59,049
not be representative in the top place
 

2355
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:01,930
not be representative in the top place
so definitely like they tried it to be

2356
00:47:01,930 --> 00:47:01,940
so definitely like they tried it to be
 

2357
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:04,930
so definitely like they tried it to be
like the balance right so then maybe the

2358
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:04,940
like the balance right so then maybe the
 

2359
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,779
like the balance right so then maybe the
opposite race of Protoss is zerk dirt is

2360
00:47:07,779 --> 00:47:07,789
opposite race of Protoss is zerk dirt is
 

2361
00:47:07,789 --> 00:47:10,660
opposite race of Protoss is zerk dirt is
a race where you just kind of expand and

2362
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:10,670
a race where you just kind of expand and
 

2363
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:13,089
a race where you just kind of expand and
take over as many resources as you can

2364
00:47:13,089 --> 00:47:13,099
take over as many resources as you can
 

2365
00:47:13,099 --> 00:47:15,789
take over as many resources as you can
and they have a very high capacity to

2366
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:15,799
and they have a very high capacity to
 

2367
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:18,670
and they have a very high capacity to
regenerate their units so if you have an

2368
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:18,680
regenerate their units so if you have an
 

2369
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,980
regenerate their units so if you have an
army it's not that valuable in terms of

2370
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:20,990
army it's not that valuable in terms of
 

2371
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:23,200
army it's not that valuable in terms of
losing the whole army is not a big deal

2372
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:23,210
losing the whole army is not a big deal
 

2373
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:25,450
losing the whole army is not a big deal
azarkh because you can then rebuild it

2374
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:25,460
azarkh because you can then rebuild it
 

2375
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:28,210
azarkh because you can then rebuild it
and given that you generally accumulate

2376
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:28,220
and given that you generally accumulate
 

2377
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,630
and given that you generally accumulate
a huge Bank of resources zurk steep it

2378
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:31,640
a huge Bank of resources zurk steep it
 

2379
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,130
a huge Bank of resources zurk steep it
will play by a prayer applying a lot of

2380
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:33,140
will play by a prayer applying a lot of
 

2381
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,980
will play by a prayer applying a lot of
pressure may be losing their whole army

2382
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:35,990
pressure may be losing their whole army
 

2383
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:37,960
pressure may be losing their whole army
but then rebuilding it quickly so

2384
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:37,970
but then rebuilding it quickly so
 

2385
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:40,660
but then rebuilding it quickly so
although of course every race I mean

2386
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:40,670
although of course every race I mean
 

2387
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:43,480
although of course every race I mean
there is never I mean they're pretty

2388
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:43,490
there is never I mean they're pretty
 

2389
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:45,040
there is never I mean they're pretty
diverse I mean there's some unity insert

2390
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:45,050
diverse I mean there's some unity insert
 

2391
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,630
diverse I mean there's some unity insert
that are technologically advanced and

2392
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:46,640
that are technologically advanced and
 

2393
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,490
that are technologically advanced and
they do some very interesting spells and

2394
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:48,500
they do some very interesting spells and
 

2395
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:50,589
they do some very interesting spells and
there's some units in proto's that are

2396
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:50,599
there's some units in proto's that are
 

2397
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:52,210
there's some units in proto's that are
less valuable and you could lose a lot

2398
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:52,220
less valuable and you could lose a lot
 

2399
00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:54,040
less valuable and you could lose a lot
of them and rebuild them and it wouldn't

2400
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:54,050
of them and rebuild them and it wouldn't
 

2401
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,309
of them and rebuild them and it wouldn't
be a big deal all right so maybe I'm

2402
00:47:57,309 --> 00:47:57,319
be a big deal all right so maybe I'm
 

2403
00:47:57,319 --> 00:47:58,660
be a big deal all right so maybe I'm
missing out maybe I'm gonna say some

2404
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:58,670
missing out maybe I'm gonna say some
 

2405
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,260
missing out maybe I'm gonna say some
dumb stuff but just summary of strategy

2406
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:02,270
dumb stuff but just summary of strategy
 

2407
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:04,780
dumb stuff but just summary of strategy
so first there's collection of a lot of

2408
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:04,790
so first there's collection of a lot of
 

2409
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:06,579
so first there's collection of a lot of
resources right so that's one option the

2410
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:06,589
resources right so that's one option the
 

2411
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:10,599
resources right so that's one option the
other one is expanding so building other

2412
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:10,609
other one is expanding so building other
 

2413
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:13,480
other one is expanding so building other
basins then the other is obviously

2414
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:13,490
basins then the other is obviously
 

2415
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,700
basins then the other is obviously
attack ability building units and

2416
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:15,710
attack ability building units and
 

2417
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:17,920
attack ability building units and
attacking with those units and then I

2418
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:17,930
attacking with those units and then I
 

2419
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:20,829
attacking with those units and then I
don't know what else there is maybe

2420
00:48:20,829 --> 00:48:20,839
don't know what else there is maybe
 

2421
00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:23,250
don't know what else there is maybe
there is the different timing of attacks

2422
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:23,260
there is the different timing of attacks
 

2423
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:26,109
there is the different timing of attacks
like to attack early attack ready what

2424
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:26,119
like to attack early attack ready what
 

2425
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,430
like to attack early attack ready what
are the different strategies that

2426
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
are the different strategies that
 

2427
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,990
are the different strategies that
emerged that you've learned about I've

2428
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:29,000
emerged that you've learned about I've
 

2429
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,940
emerged that you've learned about I've
read the a bunch of people are super

2430
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:30,950
read the a bunch of people are super
 

2431
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:33,010
read the a bunch of people are super
happy that you guys have apparently that

2432
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:33,020
happy that you guys have apparently that
 

2433
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,960
happy that you guys have apparently that
alpha star apparently is discovered

2434
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:34,970
alpha star apparently is discovered
 

2435
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:36,700
alpha star apparently is discovered
that's really good too what is it

2436
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:36,710
that's really good too what is it
 

2437
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,950
that's really good too what is it
saturate oh yeah they're mind-numbing

2438
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:38,960
saturate oh yeah they're mind-numbing
 

2439
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,859
saturate oh yeah they're mind-numbing
online yeah the mineralogist yeah yeah

2440
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:41,869
online yeah the mineralogist yeah yeah
 

2441
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:44,200
online yeah the mineralogist yeah yeah
the in it for greedy amateur players

2442
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:44,210
the in it for greedy amateur players
 

2443
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:46,420
the in it for greedy amateur players
like myself that's always been a good

2444
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:46,430
like myself that's always been a good
 

2445
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:48,520
like myself that's always been a good
strategy you just build up a lot of

2446
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:48,530
strategy you just build up a lot of
 

2447
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,160
strategy you just build up a lot of
money and it just feels good it's just

2448
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:51,170
money and it just feels good it's just
 

2449
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:53,740
money and it just feels good it's just
accumulate and accumulate so thank you

2450
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:53,750
accumulate and accumulate so thank you
 

2451
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,410
accumulate and accumulate so thank you
for discovering that yeah validating all

2452
00:48:56,410 --> 00:48:56,420
for discovering that yeah validating all
 

2453
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:57,819
for discovering that yeah validating all
of us but is there other strategies that

2454
00:48:57,819 --> 00:48:57,829
of us but is there other strategies that
 

2455
00:48:57,829 --> 00:49:00,490
of us but is there other strategies that
you discovered interesting yeah unique

2456
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:00,500
you discovered interesting yeah unique
 

2457
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,520
you discovered interesting yeah unique
to to this game yeah so if you look at

2458
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:03,530
to to this game yeah so if you look at
 

2459
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,130
to to this game yeah so if you look at
the kind of not being a stack of two

2460
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:06,140
the kind of not being a stack of two
 

2461
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:07,420
the kind of not being a stack of two
player but of course Starcraft and

2462
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:07,430
player but of course Starcraft and
 

2463
00:49:07,430 --> 00:49:09,309
player but of course Starcraft and
Starcraft 2 and realtime strategy games

2464
00:49:09,309 --> 00:49:09,319
Starcraft 2 and realtime strategy games
 

2465
00:49:09,319 --> 00:49:12,430
Starcraft 2 and realtime strategy games
in general are very similar I would

2466
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:12,440
in general are very similar I would
 

2467
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:17,079
in general are very similar I would
classify perhaps the openings of the

2468
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:17,089
classify perhaps the openings of the
 

2469
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:18,750
classify perhaps the openings of the
game they're very important and

2470
00:49:18,750 --> 00:49:18,760
game they're very important and
 

2471
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,859
game they're very important and
generally I would say there's two kinds

2472
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:20,869
generally I would say there's two kinds
 

2473
00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:22,809
generally I would say there's two kinds
of openings one that's a standard

2474
00:49:22,809 --> 00:49:22,819
of openings one that's a standard
 

2475
00:49:22,819 --> 00:49:25,750
of openings one that's a standard
opening that's generally how players

2476
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:25,760
opening that's generally how players
 

2477
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,290
opening that's generally how players
find

2478
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:27,300
find
 

2479
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:30,370
find
sort of a balance between risk and

2480
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:30,380
sort of a balance between risk and
 

2481
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:32,750
sort of a balance between risk and
economy and building some you needs

2482
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:32,760
economy and building some you needs
 

2483
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:34,730
economy and building some you needs
early on so that they could defend but

2484
00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:34,740
early on so that they could defend but
 

2485
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:37,280
early on so that they could defend but
they're not to expose basically but also

2486
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:37,290
they're not to expose basically but also
 

2487
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:40,490
they're not to expose basically but also
expanding quite quickly so this is would

2488
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:40,500
expanding quite quickly so this is would
 

2489
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:42,740
expanding quite quickly so this is would
be kind of a standard opening and within

2490
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:42,750
be kind of a standard opening and within
 

2491
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,599
be kind of a standard opening and within
a standard opening then you what you do

2492
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:44,609
a standard opening then you what you do
 

2493
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:46,910
a standard opening then you what you do
choose general is what technology are

2494
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:46,920
choose general is what technology are
 

2495
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,980
choose general is what technology are
you aiming towards so there's a bit of

2496
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:48,990
you aiming towards so there's a bit of
 

2497
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:51,650
you aiming towards so there's a bit of
rock-paper-scissors of you could go for

2498
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:51,660
rock-paper-scissors of you could go for
 

2499
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:54,470
rock-paper-scissors of you could go for
spaceships or you could go for invisible

2500
00:49:54,470 --> 00:49:54,480
spaceships or you could go for invisible
 

2501
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,359
spaceships or you could go for invisible
units or you could go for I don't know

2502
00:49:56,359 --> 00:49:56,369
units or you could go for I don't know
 

2503
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,670
units or you could go for I don't know
like massive units that attack against

2504
00:49:58,670 --> 00:49:58,680
like massive units that attack against
 

2505
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,560
like massive units that attack against
certain kinds of units but they're weak

2506
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:00,570
certain kinds of units but they're weak
 

2507
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:02,920
certain kinds of units but they're weak
against others so standard openings

2508
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:02,930
against others so standard openings
 

2509
00:50:02,930 --> 00:50:05,839
against others so standard openings
themselves have some choices like

2510
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:05,849
themselves have some choices like
 

2511
00:50:05,849 --> 00:50:07,970
themselves have some choices like
rock-paper-scissors style of course if

2512
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:07,980
rock-paper-scissors style of course if
 

2513
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,440
rock-paper-scissors style of course if
you Scout and you're good at guessing

2514
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,450
you Scout and you're good at guessing
 

2515
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,599
you Scout and you're good at guessing
what the opponent is doing then you can

2516
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:11,609
what the opponent is doing then you can
 

2517
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:13,339
what the opponent is doing then you can
plane as an advantage because if you

2518
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:13,349
plane as an advantage because if you
 

2519
00:50:13,349 --> 00:50:14,750
plane as an advantage because if you
know you're gonna play rock I mean I'm

2520
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:14,760
know you're gonna play rock I mean I'm
 

2521
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,910
know you're gonna play rock I mean I'm
gonna play paper obviously so you can

2522
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:16,920
gonna play paper obviously so you can
 

2523
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:19,190
gonna play paper obviously so you can
imagine that normal standard games in

2524
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
imagine that normal standard games in
 

2525
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,520
imagine that normal standard games in
StarCraft looks like a continuous rock

2526
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:22,530
StarCraft looks like a continuous rock
 

2527
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:25,609
StarCraft looks like a continuous rock
paper scissor game where you guess what

2528
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:25,619
paper scissor game where you guess what
 

2529
00:50:25,619 --> 00:50:27,530
paper scissor game where you guess what
the distribution of rock paper and

2530
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:27,540
the distribution of rock paper and
 

2531
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,770
the distribution of rock paper and
scissor is from the enemy and reacting

2532
00:50:30,770 --> 00:50:30,780
scissor is from the enemy and reacting
 

2533
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,070
scissor is from the enemy and reacting
accordingly to try to beat it or you

2534
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:34,080
accordingly to try to beat it or you
 

2535
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,620
accordingly to try to beat it or you
know put the paper out before he kind of

2536
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:36,630
know put the paper out before he kind of
 

2537
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,750
know put the paper out before he kind of
changes his mind from rock to scissors

2538
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:38,760
changes his mind from rock to scissors
 

2539
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,859
changes his mind from rock to scissors
and then you would be in a weak position

2540
00:50:39,859 --> 00:50:39,869
and then you would be in a weak position
 

2541
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,410
and then you would be in a weak position
so sorry to pause on that I didn't

2542
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:42,420
so sorry to pause on that I didn't
 

2543
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:43,790
so sorry to pause on that I didn't
realize this element cuz I know it's

2544
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:43,800
realize this element cuz I know it's
 

2545
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,589

00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:45,599
true but poker I know I looked at

Lambrakis

2548
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:47,180
Lambrakis
 

2549
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:50,599
Lambrakis
you're this is so you're also estimating

2550
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:50,609
you're this is so you're also estimating
 

2551
00:50:50,609 --> 00:50:52,460
you're this is so you're also estimating
trying to guess the distribution to

2552
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:52,470
trying to guess the distribution to
 

2553
00:50:52,470 --> 00:50:53,540
trying to guess the distribution to
better and better estimate the

2554
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:53,550
better and better estimate the
 

2555
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,130
better and better estimate the
distribution what the Epona's likely to

2556
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:55,140
distribution what the Epona's likely to
 

2557
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,560
distribution what the Epona's likely to
be doing yeah I mean as a player you

2558
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:57,570
be doing yeah I mean as a player you
 

2559
00:50:57,570 --> 00:50:59,690
be doing yeah I mean as a player you
definitely want to have a belief state

2560
00:50:59,690 --> 00:50:59,700
definitely want to have a belief state
 

2561
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,270
definitely want to have a belief state
over what's up on the other side of the

2562
00:51:02,270 --> 00:51:02,280
over what's up on the other side of the
 

2563
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,849
over what's up on the other side of the
map and when your belief state becomes

2564
00:51:04,849 --> 00:51:04,859
map and when your belief state becomes
 

2565
00:51:04,859 --> 00:51:06,620
map and when your belief state becomes
inaccurate when you start having that

2566
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:06,630
inaccurate when you start having that
 

2567
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,349
inaccurate when you start having that
serious doubts whether he's gonna play

2568
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
serious doubts whether he's gonna play
 

2569
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,750
serious doubts whether he's gonna play
something that you must know that's when

2570
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
something that you must know that's when
 

2571
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,400
something that you must know that's when
you scout you wanna then gather

2572
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:13,410
you scout you wanna then gather
 

2573
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,290
you scout you wanna then gather
information right it's improving the

2574
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:15,300
information right it's improving the
 

2575
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,150
information right it's improving the
accuracy of the belief or improving the

2576
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:17,160
accuracy of the belief or improving the
 

2577
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,030
accuracy of the belief or improving the
belief state part of the loss that you

2578
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:20,040
belief state part of the loss that you
 

2579
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:22,400
belief state part of the loss that you
try to optimize or is it just in a side

2580
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:22,410
try to optimize or is it just in a side
 

2581
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:24,349
try to optimize or is it just in a side
effect it's implicit but you could

2582
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:24,359
effect it's implicit but you could
 

2583
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:26,359
effect it's implicit but you could
explicitly model it and it would be

2584
00:51:26,359 --> 00:51:26,369
explicitly model it and it would be
 

2585
00:51:26,369 --> 00:51:28,130
explicitly model it and it would be
quite good that's probably predicting

2586
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:28,140
quite good that's probably predicting
 

2587
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,530
quite good that's probably predicting
what's on the other side of the map but

2588
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:30,540
what's on the other side of the map but
 

2589
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:33,050
what's on the other side of the map but
so far it's all implicit the lot there's

2590
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:33,060
so far it's all implicit the lot there's
 

2591
00:51:33,060 --> 00:51:35,690
so far it's all implicit the lot there's
no no additional reward for predicting

2592
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:35,700
no no additional reward for predicting
 

2593
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,790
no no additional reward for predicting
the enemy so there's these standard

2594
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:37,800
the enemy so there's these standard
 

2595
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,400
the enemy so there's these standard
opening x' and then there's what people

2596
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,410
opening x' and then there's what people
 

2597
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:41,300
opening x' and then there's what people
call

2598
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:41,310
call
 

2599
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,400
call
which is very interesting and alpha star

2600
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:43,410
which is very interesting and alpha star
 

2601
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:45,410
which is very interesting and alpha star
sometimes really likes this kind of

2602
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:45,420
sometimes really likes this kind of
 

2603
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,230
sometimes really likes this kind of
cheese these cheese's what they are is

2604
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:48,240
cheese these cheese's what they are is
 

2605
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:52,040
cheese these cheese's what they are is
kind of an all-in strategy you're gonna

2606
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:52,050
kind of an all-in strategy you're gonna
 

2607
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:54,170
kind of an all-in strategy you're gonna
do something sneaky you're gonna hide

2608
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:54,180
do something sneaky you're gonna hide
 

2609
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,870
do something sneaky you're gonna hide
enemies as hide your own buildings close

2610
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:56,880
enemies as hide your own buildings close
 

2611
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,210
enemies as hide your own buildings close
to the enemy base or you're gonna go for

2612
00:51:59,210 --> 00:51:59,220
to the enemy base or you're gonna go for
 

2613
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:01,730
to the enemy base or you're gonna go for
hiding your technological buildings so

2614
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:01,740
hiding your technological buildings so
 

2615
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:03,380
hiding your technological buildings so
that you do invisible units and the

2616
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:03,390
that you do invisible units and the
 

2617
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,170
that you do invisible units and the
enemy just cannot react to detect it and

2618
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:06,180
enemy just cannot react to detect it and
 

2619
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,660
enemy just cannot react to detect it and
does lose the game and there's quite a

2620
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:08,670
does lose the game and there's quite a
 

2621
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,730
does lose the game and there's quite a
few of these cheeses and variants of

2622
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:10,740
few of these cheeses and variants of
 

2623
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,820
few of these cheeses and variants of
them and there is where actually the

2624
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:13,830
them and there is where actually the
 

2625
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,890
them and there is where actually the
belief state becomes even more important

2626
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:15,900
belief state becomes even more important
 

2627
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:18,890
belief state becomes even more important
because if I spelled your base and I see

2628
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:18,900
because if I spelled your base and I see
 

2629
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,930
because if I spelled your base and I see
no buildings at all any human prayer

2630
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:20,940
no buildings at all any human prayer
 

2631
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:22,940
no buildings at all any human prayer
knows something's up they might know

2632
00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:22,950
knows something's up they might know
 

2633
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,950
knows something's up they might know
well you're hiding something close to my

2634
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:24,960
well you're hiding something close to my
 

2635
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,080
well you're hiding something close to my
base should I build suddenly a lot of

2636
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:27,090
base should I build suddenly a lot of
 

2637
00:52:27,090 --> 00:52:29,270
base should I build suddenly a lot of
units to defend should I actually block

2638
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280
units to defend should I actually block
 

2639
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,640
units to defend should I actually block
my ramp with workers so that you cannot

2640
00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:31,650
my ramp with workers so that you cannot
 

2641
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:34,130
my ramp with workers so that you cannot
come and destroy my base so there's all

2642
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:34,140
come and destroy my base so there's all
 

2643
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:37,430
come and destroy my base so there's all
these is happening and defending against

2644
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:37,440
these is happening and defending against
 

2645
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,950
these is happening and defending against
Jesus is extremely important and in the

2646
00:52:39,950 --> 00:52:39,960
Jesus is extremely important and in the
 

2647
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,710
Jesus is extremely important and in the
alpha star League many agents actually

2648
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:42,720
alpha star League many agents actually
 

2649
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:45,440
alpha star League many agents actually
develop some cheesy strategies and in

2650
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:45,450
develop some cheesy strategies and in
 

2651
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:47,420
develop some cheesy strategies and in
the games we saw against elo and mana

2652
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:47,430
the games we saw against elo and mana
 

2653
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,790
the games we saw against elo and mana
two out of the ten agents were actually

2654
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:49,800
two out of the ten agents were actually
 

2655
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,100
two out of the ten agents were actually
doing these kind of strategies which are

2656
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:52,110
doing these kind of strategies which are
 

2657
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,260
doing these kind of strategies which are
cheesy strategies and then there's a

2658
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:54,270
cheesy strategies and then there's a
 

2659
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,090
cheesy strategies and then there's a
baron of cheesy strategy which is called

2660
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:56,100
baron of cheesy strategy which is called
 

2661
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,150
baron of cheesy strategy which is called
all-in so an all-in strategy is not

2662
00:52:59,150 --> 00:52:59,160
all-in so an all-in strategy is not
 

2663
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:01,370
all-in so an all-in strategy is not
perhaps as drastic as oh I'm gonna build

2664
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:01,380
perhaps as drastic as oh I'm gonna build
 

2665
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,200
perhaps as drastic as oh I'm gonna build
cannons on your base and then bring all

2666
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:03,210
cannons on your base and then bring all
 

2667
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:05,090
cannons on your base and then bring all
my workers and try to just disrupt your

2668
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:05,100
my workers and try to just disrupt your
 

2669
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,000
my workers and try to just disrupt your
base and game over or GG as we say in

2670
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:08,010
base and game over or GG as we say in
 

2671
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:11,000
base and game over or GG as we say in
StarCraft umm there's these kind of very

2672
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:11,010
StarCraft umm there's these kind of very
 

2673
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:13,070
StarCraft umm there's these kind of very
cool things that you can align precisely

2674
00:53:13,070 --> 00:53:13,080
cool things that you can align precisely
 

2675
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,650
cool things that you can align precisely
at a certain time mark so for instance

2676
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:15,660
at a certain time mark so for instance
 

2677
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,860
at a certain time mark so for instance
you can generate exactly ten unit

2678
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:18,870
you can generate exactly ten unit
 

2679
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:20,900
you can generate exactly ten unit
composition that is perfectly five of

2680
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:20,910
composition that is perfectly five of
 

2681
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:22,640
composition that is perfectly five of
these type five of disorder type and

2682
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:22,650
these type five of disorder type and
 

2683
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:25,070
these type five of disorder type and
align the upgrade so that at four

2684
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:25,080
align the upgrade so that at four
 

2685
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,560
align the upgrade so that at four
minutes and a half let's say you have

2686
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:27,570
minutes and a half let's say you have
 

2687
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,570
minutes and a half let's say you have
these ten units and the upgrade just

2688
00:53:29,570 --> 00:53:29,580
these ten units and the upgrade just
 

2689
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:32,240
these ten units and the upgrade just
finished and at that point that army is

2690
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:32,250
finished and at that point that army is
 

2691
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,150
finished and at that point that army is
really scary and unless the enemy really

2692
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:35,160
really scary and unless the enemy really
 

2693
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:36,200
really scary and unless the enemy really
knows what's going on

2694
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:36,210
knows what's going on
 

2695
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:39,560
knows what's going on
if you push you might then have an

2696
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:39,570
if you push you might then have an
 

2697
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:41,210
if you push you might then have an
advantage because maybe the enemy is

2698
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:41,220
advantage because maybe the enemy is
 

2699
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,530
advantage because maybe the enemy is
doing something more standard it

2700
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:42,540
doing something more standard it
 

2701
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:44,900
doing something more standard it
expanded too much it developed too much

2702
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:44,910
expanded too much it developed too much
 

2703
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:47,990
expanded too much it developed too much
economy and any trade-off badly against

2704
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:48,000
economy and any trade-off badly against
 

2705
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,390
economy and any trade-off badly against
having defenses and the enemy will lose

2706
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:50,400
having defenses and the enemy will lose
 

2707
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,550
having defenses and the enemy will lose
but it's called all-in because if you

2708
00:53:52,550 --> 00:53:52,560
but it's called all-in because if you
 

2709
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,799
but it's called all-in because if you
don't win then you're gonna lose

2710
00:53:54,799 --> 00:53:54,809
don't win then you're gonna lose
 

2711
00:53:54,809 --> 00:53:57,380
don't win then you're gonna lose
so you see players that do these kind of

2712
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:57,390
so you see players that do these kind of
 

2713
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,509
so you see players that do these kind of
strategies if they don't succeed game is

2714
00:53:59,509 --> 00:53:59,519
strategies if they don't succeed game is
 

2715
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:00,979
strategies if they don't succeed game is
not over I mean they still have a place

2716
00:54:00,979 --> 00:54:00,989
not over I mean they still have a place
 

2717
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:02,989
not over I mean they still have a place
and they still gathering minerals but

2718
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:02,999
and they still gathering minerals but
 

2719
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:04,699
and they still gathering minerals but
they will just gg out of the game

2720
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:04,709
they will just gg out of the game
 

2721
00:54:04,709 --> 00:54:06,769
they will just gg out of the game
because they know well game is over I

2722
00:54:06,769 --> 00:54:06,779
because they know well game is over I
 

2723
00:54:06,779 --> 00:54:08,599
because they know well game is over I
gambled and I failed

2724
00:54:08,599 --> 00:54:08,609
gambled and I failed
 

2725
00:54:08,609 --> 00:54:11,449
gambled and I failed
so if we start entering the game

2726
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:11,459
so if we start entering the game
 

2727
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:13,429
so if we start entering the game
theoretic aspects of the game it's

2728
00:54:13,429 --> 00:54:13,439
theoretic aspects of the game it's
 

2729
00:54:13,439 --> 00:54:15,529
theoretic aspects of the game it's
really rich and it's really that's why

2730
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:15,539
really rich and it's really that's why
 

2731
00:54:15,539 --> 00:54:17,539
really rich and it's really that's why
it also makes it quite entertaining to

2732
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:17,549
it also makes it quite entertaining to
 

2733
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:19,640
it also makes it quite entertaining to
watch even if I don't play I still enjoy

2734
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:19,650
watch even if I don't play I still enjoy
 

2735
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:22,999
watch even if I don't play I still enjoy
watching the game but the agents are

2736
00:54:22,999 --> 00:54:23,009
watching the game but the agents are
 

2737
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:27,049
watching the game but the agents are
trying to do this mostly implicitly but

2738
00:54:27,049 --> 00:54:27,059
trying to do this mostly implicitly but
 

2739
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,819
trying to do this mostly implicitly but
one element that we improved in self

2740
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:28,829
one element that we improved in self
 

2741
00:54:28,829 --> 00:54:30,919
one element that we improved in self
plays creating the alpha star League and

2742
00:54:30,919 --> 00:54:30,929
plays creating the alpha star League and
 

2743
00:54:30,929 --> 00:54:34,069
plays creating the alpha star League and
the alpha star League is not pure self

2744
00:54:34,069 --> 00:54:34,079
the alpha star League is not pure self
 

2745
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,809
the alpha star League is not pure self
play it's trying to create different

2746
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:35,819
play it's trying to create different
 

2747
00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:38,779
play it's trying to create different
personalities of agents so that some of

2748
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:38,789
personalities of agents so that some of
 

2749
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:41,359
personalities of agents so that some of
them will become cheese cheese agents

2750
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:41,369
them will become cheese cheese agents
 

2751
00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:42,859
them will become cheese cheese agents
some of them might become very

2752
00:54:42,859 --> 00:54:42,869
some of them might become very
 

2753
00:54:42,869 --> 00:54:45,079
some of them might become very
economical very greedy like getting all

2754
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:45,089
economical very greedy like getting all
 

2755
00:54:45,089 --> 00:54:47,689
economical very greedy like getting all
the resources but then being maybe early

2756
00:54:47,689 --> 00:54:47,699
the resources but then being maybe early
 

2757
00:54:47,699 --> 00:54:49,370
the resources but then being maybe early
on they're gonna be weak but later on

2758
00:54:49,370 --> 00:54:49,380
on they're gonna be weak but later on
 

2759
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,499
on they're gonna be weak but later on
they're gonna be very strong and by

2760
00:54:51,499 --> 00:54:51,509
they're gonna be very strong and by
 

2761
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:53,419
they're gonna be very strong and by
creating this personality of agents

2762
00:54:53,419 --> 00:54:53,429
creating this personality of agents
 

2763
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:54,949
creating this personality of agents
which sometimes it just happens

2764
00:54:54,949 --> 00:54:54,959
which sometimes it just happens
 

2765
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,620
which sometimes it just happens
naturally that you can see kind of an

2766
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:56,630
naturally that you can see kind of an
 

2767
00:54:56,630 --> 00:54:59,870
naturally that you can see kind of an
evolution of agents that given the

2768
00:54:59,870 --> 00:54:59,880
evolution of agents that given the
 

2769
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,399
evolution of agents that given the
previous generation they trained against

2770
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:01,409
previous generation they trained against
 

2771
00:55:01,409 --> 00:55:03,049
previous generation they trained against
all of them and then they generate kind

2772
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:03,059
all of them and then they generate kind
 

2773
00:55:03,059 --> 00:55:04,609
all of them and then they generate kind
of the count the perfect counter to that

2774
00:55:04,609 --> 00:55:04,619
of the count the perfect counter to that
 

2775
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:07,609
of the count the perfect counter to that
distribution but these these agents you

2776
00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:07,619
distribution but these these agents you
 

2777
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,140
distribution but these these agents you
must have them in the populations

2778
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:09,150
must have them in the populations
 

2779
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:11,419
must have them in the populations
because if you don't have them you're

2780
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:11,429
because if you don't have them you're
 

2781
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:13,039
because if you don't have them you're
not covered against these things right

2782
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:13,049
not covered against these things right

00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:38,029
finding some subset of these but not all
of these so the alpha star League is a

2802
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:38,039
of these so the alpha star League is a
 

2803
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:41,239
of these so the alpha star League is a
way to kind of do an example of agents

2804
00:55:41,239 --> 00:55:41,249
way to kind of do an example of agents
 

2805
00:55:41,249 --> 00:55:43,339
way to kind of do an example of agents
that they're all playing and in a league

2806
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:43,349
that they're all playing and in a league
 

2807
00:55:43,349 --> 00:55:45,469
that they're all playing and in a league
much like people play on battlenet right

2808
00:55:45,469 --> 00:55:45,479
much like people play on battlenet right
 

2809
00:55:45,479 --> 00:55:47,569
much like people play on battlenet right
they play you play against someone who

2810
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:47,579
they play you play against someone who
 

2811
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:49,159
they play you play against someone who
does a new cool strategy and you

2812
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:49,169
does a new cool strategy and you
 

2813
00:55:49,169 --> 00:55:51,739
does a new cool strategy and you
immediately oh my god I want to try it I

2814
00:55:51,739 --> 00:55:51,749
immediately oh my god I want to try it I
 

2815
00:55:51,749 --> 00:55:54,439
immediately oh my god I want to try it I
want to play again and these to me was

2816
00:55:54,439 --> 00:55:54,449
want to play again and these to me was
 

2817
00:55:54,449 --> 00:55:56,809
want to play again and these to me was
another critical part of the of the of

2818
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:56,819
another critical part of the of the of
 

2819
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:59,239
another critical part of the of the of
the problem which was can we create a

2820
00:55:59,239 --> 00:55:59,249
the problem which was can we create a
 

2821
00:55:59,249 --> 00:56:02,269
the problem which was can we create a
battlenet for agents yeah that's kind of

2822
00:56:02,269 --> 00:56:02,279
battlenet for agents yeah that's kind of
 

2823
00:56:02,279 --> 00:56:03,559
battlenet for agents yeah that's kind of
what the Alpha star league is really

2824
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:03,569
what the Alpha star league is really
 

2825
00:56:03,569 --> 00:56:05,089
what the Alpha star league is really
fascinating and where they stick to

2826
00:56:05,089 --> 00:56:05,099
fascinating and where they stick to
 

2827
00:56:05,099 --> 00:56:07,789
fascinating and where they stick to
their different strategies yeah wow

2828
00:56:07,789 --> 00:56:07,799
their different strategies yeah wow
 

2829
00:56:07,799 --> 00:56:08,600
their different strategies yeah wow
that's

2830
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:08,610
that's
 

2831
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:10,070
that's
it's really really interesting so but

2832
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:10,080
it's really really interesting so but
 

2833
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,400
it's really really interesting so but
that said you were fortunate enough or

2834
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:13,410
that said you were fortunate enough or
 

2835
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:17,840
that said you were fortunate enough or
just skilled enough to win 5-0 and so

2836
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:17,850
just skilled enough to win 5-0 and so
 

2837
00:56:17,850 --> 00:56:19,760
just skilled enough to win 5-0 and so
how hard is it to win I mean that's not

2838
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:19,770
how hard is it to win I mean that's not
 

2839
00:56:19,770 --> 00:56:21,200
how hard is it to win I mean that's not
the goal I guess I don't know what the

2840
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:21,210
the goal I guess I don't know what the
 

2841
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:23,800
the goal I guess I don't know what the
goal is the goal should be to a majority

2842
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:23,810
goal is the goal should be to a majority
 

2843
00:56:23,810 --> 00:56:26,330
goal is the goal should be to a majority
not five zero but how hard is it in

2844
00:56:26,330 --> 00:56:26,340
not five zero but how hard is it in
 

2845
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:29,390
not five zero but how hard is it in
general to win all matchups

2846
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:29,400
general to win all matchups
 

2847
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,780
general to win all matchups
I don't want 1v1 so that's a very

2848
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:32,790
I don't want 1v1 so that's a very
 

2849
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:35,900
I don't want 1v1 so that's a very
interesting question because once you

2850
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:35,910
interesting question because once you
 

2851
00:56:35,910 --> 00:56:38,810
interesting question because once you
see alpha star and superficially you

2852
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:38,820
see alpha star and superficially you
 

2853
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:40,100
see alpha star and superficially you
think well locate one

2854
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:40,110
think well locate one
 

2855
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,200
think well locate one
let's if you some of the games like ten

2856
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:42,210
let's if you some of the games like ten
 

2857
00:56:42,210 --> 00:56:44,150
let's if you some of the games like ten
to one right it lost the game that it

2858
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
to one right it lost the game that it
 

2859
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,430
to one right it lost the game that it
played with the camera interface you

2860
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:46,440
played with the camera interface you
 

2861
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,230
played with the camera interface you
might think well that's that's done

2862
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:48,240
might think well that's that's done
 

2863
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,120
might think well that's that's done
right there's it's it's super human at

2864
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:50,130
right there's it's it's super human at
 

2865
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,010
right there's it's it's super human at
the game and that's not really the claim

2866
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:52,020
the game and that's not really the claim
 

2867
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:56,600
the game and that's not really the claim
we really can make actually the claim is

2868
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:56,610
we really can make actually the claim is
 

2869
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:59,120
we really can make actually the claim is
we beat a professional gamer for the

2870
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,130
we beat a professional gamer for the
 

2871
00:56:59,130 --> 00:57:01,640
we beat a professional gamer for the
first time Starcraft has really been a

2872
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:01,650
first time Starcraft has really been a
 

2873
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:03,800
first time Starcraft has really been a
thing that it's been going on for a few

2874
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:03,810
thing that it's been going on for a few
 

2875
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:06,320
thing that it's been going on for a few
years but moment a moment like this

2876
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:06,330
years but moment a moment like this
 

2877
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:08,750
years but moment a moment like this
hasn't not had not occurred before yet

2878
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:08,760
hasn't not had not occurred before yet
 

2879
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:12,170
hasn't not had not occurred before yet
but our decisions impossible to beat

2880
00:57:12,170 --> 00:57:12,180
but our decisions impossible to beat
 

2881
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:14,540
but our decisions impossible to beat
absolutely not right so that's a bit

2882
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:14,550
absolutely not right so that's a bit
 

2883
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:16,400
absolutely not right so that's a bit
what's you know kind of that the

2884
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:16,410
what's you know kind of that the
 

2885
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:18,590
what's you know kind of that the
difference is the agents play at

2886
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:18,600
difference is the agents play at
 

2887
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:19,940
difference is the agents play at
Grandmaster level there definitely

2888
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:19,950
Grandmaster level there definitely
 

2889
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,920
Grandmaster level there definitely
understand the game enough to play

2890
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:21,930
understand the game enough to play
 

2891
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:24,830
understand the game enough to play
extremely well but are they am beatable

2892
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:24,840
extremely well but are they am beatable
 

2893
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:29,210
extremely well but are they am beatable
do they play perfect no and actually in

2894
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:29,220
do they play perfect no and actually in
 

2895
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,850
do they play perfect no and actually in
StarCraft because of these sneaky

2896
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:31,860
StarCraft because of these sneaky
 

2897
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,700
StarCraft because of these sneaky
strategies it's always possible that you

2898
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:34,710
strategies it's always possible that you
 

2899
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:36,920
strategies it's always possible that you
might take a huge risk sometimes but you

2900
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:36,930
might take a huge risk sometimes but you
 

2901
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:38,840
might take a huge risk sometimes but you
might get wins right out of out of this

2902
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:38,850
might get wins right out of out of this
 

2903
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:43,370
might get wins right out of out of this
so I think that as a domain it still has

2904
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:43,380
so I think that as a domain it still has
 

2905
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,830
so I think that as a domain it still has
a lot of opportunities not only because

2906
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:45,840
a lot of opportunities not only because
 

2907
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:47,330
a lot of opportunities not only because
of course we want to learn with less

2908
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:47,340
of course we want to learn with less
 

2909
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,160
of course we want to learn with less
experience we would like to I mean if I

2910
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:49,170
experience we would like to I mean if I
 

2911
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:51,230
experience we would like to I mean if I
if I learn to play Protoss I can play

2912
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:51,240
if I learn to play Protoss I can play
 

2913
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,570
if I learn to play Protoss I can play
turn and learn it much quicker than

2914
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:53,580
turn and learn it much quicker than
 

2915
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,580
turn and learn it much quicker than
alpha star can right so there are

2916
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:55,590
alpha star can right so there are
 

2917
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:57,680
alpha star can right so there are
obvious interesting research challenges

2918
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:57,690
obvious interesting research challenges
 

2919
00:57:57,690 --> 00:58:01,040
obvious interesting research challenges
as well but even as as the raw like as

2920
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:01,050
as well but even as as the raw like as
 

2921
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:03,740
as well but even as as the raw like as
the raw performance goes really the

2922
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:03,750
the raw performance goes really the
 

2923
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:06,290
the raw performance goes really the
claim here can be we are at pro level or

2924
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:06,300
claim here can be we are at pro level or
 

2925
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:10,420
claim here can be we are at pro level or
at high Grandmaster level but obviously

2926
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:10,430
at high Grandmaster level but obviously
 

2927
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,880
at high Grandmaster level but obviously
the players also did not know what to

2928
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:13,890
the players also did not know what to
 

2929
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:15,470
the players also did not know what to
expect right this kind of their prior

2930
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:15,480
expect right this kind of their prior
 

2931
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,720
expect right this kind of their prior
distribution was a bit off because they

2932
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:17,730
distribution was a bit off because they
 

2933
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:20,270
distribution was a bit off because they
played this kind of new like alien brain

2934
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:20,280
played this kind of new like alien brain
 

2935
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:22,370
played this kind of new like alien brain
as they like to say drive and

2936
00:58:22,370 --> 00:58:22,380
as they like to say drive and
 

2937
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:24,590
as they like to say drive and
that's what makes it exciting for them

2938
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:24,600
that's what makes it exciting for them
 

2939
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,170
that's what makes it exciting for them
but also I think if you look at the

2940
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:27,180
but also I think if you look at the
 

2941
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,330
but also I think if you look at the
games closely you see there were

2942
00:58:29,330 --> 00:58:29,340
games closely you see there were
 

2943
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:32,120
games closely you see there were
weaknesses in some points maybe alpha

2944
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:32,130
weaknesses in some points maybe alpha
 

2945
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:34,340
weaknesses in some points maybe alpha
star did not scout or if it had got

2946
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:34,350
star did not scout or if it had got
 

2947
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:36,470
star did not scout or if it had got
invisible units going against at certain

2948
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
invisible units going against at certain
 

2949
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,420
invisible units going against at certain
points it wouldn't have known and it

2950
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:38,430
points it wouldn't have known and it
 

2951
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:40,490
points it wouldn't have known and it
would have been bad so there's still

2952
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:40,500
would have been bad so there's still
 

2953
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,070
would have been bad so there's still
quite a lot of work to do but it's

2954
00:58:43,070 --> 00:58:43,080
quite a lot of work to do but it's
 

2955
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:45,530
quite a lot of work to do but it's
really a very exciting moment for us to

2956
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:45,540
really a very exciting moment for us to
 

2957
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:48,620
really a very exciting moment for us to
be seeing Wow a single neural net on a

2958
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:48,630
be seeing Wow a single neural net on a
 

2959
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,690
be seeing Wow a single neural net on a
GPU is actually playing against these

2960
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:50,700
GPU is actually playing against these
 

2961
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:52,700
GPU is actually playing against these
guys who are amazing I mean you have to

2962
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:52,710
guys who are amazing I mean you have to
 

2963
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:54,260
guys who are amazing I mean you have to
see them play in life if they're really

2964
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:54,270
see them play in life if they're really
 

2965
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:56,240
see them play in life if they're really
really amazing players yeah I'm sure

2966
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:56,250
really amazing players yeah I'm sure
 

2967
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,300
really amazing players yeah I'm sure
there's there's the most there must be a

2968
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:58,310
there's there's the most there must be a
 

2969
00:58:58,310 --> 00:59:00,620
there's there's the most there must be a
guy in Poland somewhere right now

2970
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:00,630
guy in Poland somewhere right now
 

2971
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,500
guy in Poland somewhere right now
training his butt off to make sure that

2972
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:03,510
training his butt off to make sure that
 

2973
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:05,740
training his butt off to make sure that
this never happens again with alpha star

2974
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:05,750
this never happens again with alpha star
 

2975
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:09,230
this never happens again with alpha star
so that's really exciting in terms of

2976
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:09,240
so that's really exciting in terms of
 

2977
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:11,060
so that's really exciting in terms of
alpha star having some holes to exploit

2978
00:59:11,060 --> 00:59:11,070
alpha star having some holes to exploit
 

2979
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:13,250
alpha star having some holes to exploit
yeah it's just great and then you build

2980
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,260
yeah it's just great and then you build
 

2981
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:15,230
yeah it's just great and then you build
on top of each other and it feels like

2982
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:15,240
on top of each other and it feels like
 

2983
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,100
on top of each other and it feels like
Starcraft I'll like go even if you win

2984
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:18,110
Starcraft I'll like go even if you win
 

2985
00:59:18,110 --> 00:59:21,560
Starcraft I'll like go even if you win
it's still not there it's still not

2986
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:21,570
it's still not there it's still not
 

2987
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,180
it's still not there it's still not
there's so many different dimensions in

2988
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:23,190
there's so many different dimensions in
 

2989
00:59:23,190 --> 00:59:24,770
there's so many different dimensions in
which you can explore so that's really

2990
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:24,780
which you can explore so that's really
 

2991
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:26,060
which you can explore so that's really
really interesting do you think there's

2992
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,070
really interesting do you think there's
 

2993
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,540
really interesting do you think there's
a ceiling to alpha star you've said that

2994
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:29,550
a ceiling to alpha star you've said that
 

2995
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:32,090
a ceiling to alpha star you've said that
it hasn't reached you know it's this is

2996
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:32,100
it hasn't reached you know it's this is
 

2997
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,460
it hasn't reached you know it's this is
a big wait what you know let me actually

2998
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,470
a big wait what you know let me actually
 

2999
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,730
a big wait what you know let me actually
just pause for a second how did it feel

3000
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:36,740
just pause for a second how did it feel
 

3001
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:41,210
just pause for a second how did it feel
to come here to this point to beat a top

3002
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,220
to come here to this point to beat a top
 

3003
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,610
to come here to this point to beat a top
professional player like that night I

3004
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:43,620
professional player like that night I
 

3005
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:45,680
professional player like that night I
mean you know Olympic athletes have

3006
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:45,690
mean you know Olympic athletes have
 

3007
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:47,900
mean you know Olympic athletes have
their gold medal right this is your gold

3008
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:47,910
their gold medal right this is your gold
 

3009
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:50,060
their gold medal right this is your gold
medal and sense sure you're cited a lot

3010
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:50,070
medal and sense sure you're cited a lot
 

3011
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,070
medal and sense sure you're cited a lot
you published a lot of prestige papers

3012
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:52,080
you published a lot of prestige papers
 

3013
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,920
you published a lot of prestige papers
whatever but this is like a win

3014
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:54,930
whatever but this is like a win
 

3015
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:57,770
whatever but this is like a win
how did it feel I mean it was for me was

3016
00:59:57,770 --> 00:59:57,780
how did it feel I mean it was for me was
 

3017
00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:02,240
how did it feel I mean it was for me was
unbelievable because first the win

3018
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,250
unbelievable because first the win
 

3019
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:06,010
unbelievable because first the win
itself me was so exciting I mean d so

3020
01:00:06,010 --> 01:00:06,020
itself me was so exciting I mean d so
 

3021
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:10,430
itself me was so exciting I mean d so
looking back to those last days of 2018

3022
01:00:10,430 --> 01:00:10,440
looking back to those last days of 2018
 

3023
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,930
looking back to those last days of 2018
really well that's when the games were

3024
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:11,940
really well that's when the games were
 

3025
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,630
really well that's when the games were
played I'm sure I look back at that

3026
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:14,640
played I'm sure I look back at that
 

3027
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:16,610
played I'm sure I look back at that
moment I say oh my god I want to be it

3028
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:16,620
moment I say oh my god I want to be it
 

3029
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,410
moment I say oh my god I want to be it
like in a project like that it's like I

3030
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:18,420
like in a project like that it's like I
 

3031
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:21,260
like in a project like that it's like I
already feel the nostalgia of like yeah

3032
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:21,270
already feel the nostalgia of like yeah
 

3033
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:24,320
already feel the nostalgia of like yeah
that was huge in terms of the energy and

3034
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:24,330
that was huge in terms of the energy and
 

3035
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,690
that was huge in terms of the energy and
the team effort that went into it and so

3036
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:26,700
the team effort that went into it and so
 

3037
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:29,420
the team effort that went into it and so
in that sense as soon as it happened I

3038
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:29,430
in that sense as soon as it happened I
 

3039
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:32,090
in that sense as soon as it happened I
already knew it was kind of I was losing

3040
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:32,100
already knew it was kind of I was losing
 

3041
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,460
already knew it was kind of I was losing
it a little bit so it is almost like sad

3042
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:34,470
it a little bit so it is almost like sad
 

3043
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:35,660
it a little bit so it is almost like sad
that it happened and all

3044
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:35,670
that it happened and all
 

3045
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:38,599
that it happened and all
like but on the other hand it also

3046
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:38,609
like but on the other hand it also
 

3047
01:00:38,609 --> 01:00:42,319
like but on the other hand it also
verifies the approach but to me also

3048
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:42,329
verifies the approach but to me also
 

3049
01:00:42,329 --> 01:00:43,880
verifies the approach but to me also
there's so many challenges and

3050
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:43,890
there's so many challenges and
 

3051
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,190
there's so many challenges and
interesting aspects of intelligence that

3052
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:46,200
interesting aspects of intelligence that
 

3053
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:48,890
interesting aspects of intelligence that
even though we can train a neural

3054
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:48,900
even though we can train a neural
 

3055
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,470
even though we can train a neural
network to play at the level of the best

3056
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:51,480
network to play at the level of the best
 

3057
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,170
network to play at the level of the best
humans there's still so many challenges

3058
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:54,180
humans there's still so many challenges
 

3059
01:00:54,180 --> 01:00:55,940
humans there's still so many challenges
so for me it's also like well this is

3060
01:00:55,940 --> 01:00:55,950
so for me it's also like well this is
 

3061
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,589
so for me it's also like well this is
really an amazing achievement but I

3062
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:57,599
really an amazing achievement but I
 

3063
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,569
really an amazing achievement but I
already was also thinking about next

3064
01:00:59,569 --> 01:00:59,579
already was also thinking about next
 

3065
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,849
already was also thinking about next
steps I mean as I said these agents play

3066
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:01,859
steps I mean as I said these agents play
 

3067
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:05,599
steps I mean as I said these agents play
Protoss vs. Protoss but they should be

3068
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:05,609
Protoss vs. Protoss but they should be
 

3069
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:07,400
Protoss vs. Protoss but they should be
able to play a different race much

3070
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:07,410
able to play a different race much
 

3071
01:01:07,410 --> 01:01:09,380
able to play a different race much
quicker right so that would be an

3072
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:09,390
quicker right so that would be an
 

3073
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:11,780
quicker right so that would be an
amazing achievement some people call

3074
01:01:11,780 --> 01:01:11,790
amazing achievement some people call
 

3075
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:13,490
amazing achievement some people call
this matter reinforcement learning meta

3076
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:13,500
this matter reinforcement learning meta
 

3077
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:17,240
this matter reinforcement learning meta
learning and so on right so there's so

3078
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:17,250
learning and so on right so there's so
 

3079
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:19,039
learning and so on right so there's so
many possibilities after that moment but

3080
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:19,049
many possibilities after that moment but
 

3081
01:01:19,049 --> 01:01:22,010
many possibilities after that moment but
the moment itself it really felt great

3082
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:22,020
the moment itself it really felt great
 

3083
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:26,569
the moment itself it really felt great
it's I we had this bet so I I'm kind of

3084
01:01:26,569 --> 01:01:26,579
it's I we had this bet so I I'm kind of
 

3085
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:29,059
it's I we had this bet so I I'm kind of
a pessimist in general so I kind of send

3086
01:01:29,059 --> 01:01:29,069
a pessimist in general so I kind of send
 

3087
01:01:29,069 --> 01:01:31,660
a pessimist in general so I kind of send
an email to the team and said okay let's

3088
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:31,670
an email to the team and said okay let's
 

3089
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:34,190
an email to the team and said okay let's
again steal offers right like what's

3090
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:34,200
again steal offers right like what's
 

3091
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,660
again steal offers right like what's
gonna be the result and I really thought

3092
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:35,670
gonna be the result and I really thought
 

3093
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:39,039
gonna be the result and I really thought
we would lose like five zero right III

3094
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:39,049
we would lose like five zero right III
 

3095
01:01:39,049 --> 01:01:41,870
we would lose like five zero right III
we had some calibration made against the

3096
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:41,880
we had some calibration made against the
 

3097
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:46,280
we had some calibration made against the
5000 MMR player TLO was much stronger

3098
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:46,290
5000 MMR player TLO was much stronger
 

3099
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:48,260
5000 MMR player TLO was much stronger
than that player even if he played

3100
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:48,270
than that player even if he played
 

3101
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:51,650
than that player even if he played
Protoss which is his off race but yeah I

3102
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:51,660
Protoss which is his off race but yeah I
 

3103
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,510
Protoss which is his off race but yeah I
was not imagining we would win so for me

3104
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:53,520
was not imagining we would win so for me
 

3105
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,130
was not imagining we would win so for me
that was just kind of a test run or

3106
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:55,140
that was just kind of a test run or
 

3107
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,500
that was just kind of a test run or
something and then it really kind of he

3108
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:57,510
something and then it really kind of he
 

3109
01:01:57,510 --> 01:02:00,950
something and then it really kind of he
was really surprised and unbelievably we

3110
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:00,960
was really surprised and unbelievably we
 

3111
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,680
was really surprised and unbelievably we
went to this to this bar to celebrate

3112
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:03,690
went to this to this bar to celebrate
 

3113
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:07,099
went to this to this bar to celebrate
and and dave tells me well why don't we

3114
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:07,109
and and dave tells me well why don't we
 

3115
01:02:07,109 --> 01:02:09,470
and and dave tells me well why don't we
invite someone who is a thousand mm are

3116
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:09,480
invite someone who is a thousand mm are
 

3117
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:11,660
invite someone who is a thousand mm are
stronger in proto's like an actual

3118
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:11,670
stronger in proto's like an actual
 

3119
01:02:11,670 --> 01:02:14,059
stronger in proto's like an actual
Protoss player like like that it turned

3120
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:14,069
Protoss player like like that it turned
 

3121
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:17,210
Protoss player like like that it turned
up being man all right and you know we

3122
01:02:17,210 --> 01:02:17,220
up being man all right and you know we
 

3123
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,130
up being man all right and you know we
had some drinks and I said sure why not

3124
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:19,140
had some drinks and I said sure why not
 

3125
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,690
had some drinks and I said sure why not
but then I thought well that's really

3126
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:20,700
but then I thought well that's really
 

3127
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,460
but then I thought well that's really
gonna be impossible to beat I mean even

3128
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:22,470
gonna be impossible to beat I mean even
 

3129
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:24,980
gonna be impossible to beat I mean even
because it's so much I had a thousand

3130
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:24,990
because it's so much I had a thousand
 

3131
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:28,490
because it's so much I had a thousand
MMR is really like 99% probability that

3132
01:02:28,490 --> 01:02:28,500
MMR is really like 99% probability that
 

3133
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,880
MMR is really like 99% probability that
mana would beat TLO as Protoss vs.

3134
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:31,890
mana would beat TLO as Protoss vs.
 

3135
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:34,640
mana would beat TLO as Protoss vs.
Protoss right so we did that and to me

3136
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:34,650
Protoss right so we did that and to me
 

3137
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:38,299
Protoss right so we did that and to me
the second the second game was much more

3138
01:02:38,299 --> 01:02:38,309
the second the second game was much more
 

3139
01:02:38,309 --> 01:02:39,770
the second the second game was much more
important even though a lot of

3140
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:39,780
important even though a lot of
 

3141
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:42,500
important even though a lot of
uncertainty kind of disappeared after we

3142
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:42,510
uncertainty kind of disappeared after we
 

3143
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,210
uncertainty kind of disappeared after we
we cannot beat the yellow I mean it he

3144
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:44,220
we cannot beat the yellow I mean it he
 

3145
01:02:44,220 --> 01:02:46,220
we cannot beat the yellow I mean it he
is a professional player so that was

3146
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:46,230
is a professional player so that was
 

3147
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,500
is a professional player so that was
kind of over that's really a very nice

3148
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:48,510
kind of over that's really a very nice
 

3149
01:02:48,510 --> 01:02:49,520
kind of over that's really a very nice
achievement

3150
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:49,530
achievement
 

3151
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:52,040
achievement
but mana really was at the top and you

3152
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:52,050
but mana really was at the top and you
 

3153
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,960
but mana really was at the top and you
could see he played much better but our

3154
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:53,970
could see he played much better but our
 

3155
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:57,050
could see he played much better but our
agents got much better too so it's a and

3156
01:02:57,050 --> 01:02:57,060
agents got much better too so it's a and
 

3157
01:02:57,060 --> 01:03:00,050
agents got much better too so it's a and
then after the first game I said if we

3158
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:00,060
then after the first game I said if we
 

3159
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,610
then after the first game I said if we
take a single game at least we can say

3160
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:01,620
take a single game at least we can say
 

3161
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:03,650
take a single game at least we can say
we beat a game I mean even if we don't

3162
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:03,660
we beat a game I mean even if we don't
 

3163
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,870
we beat a game I mean even if we don't
beat the series for me that was a huge

3164
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:05,880
beat the series for me that was a huge
 

3165
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,450
beat the series for me that was a huge
relief and I mean I remember hugging

3166
01:03:08,450 --> 01:03:08,460
relief and I mean I remember hugging
 

3167
01:03:08,460 --> 01:03:10,340
relief and I mean I remember hugging
them is and I mean it was it was really

3168
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:10,350
them is and I mean it was it was really
 

3169
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,350
them is and I mean it was it was really
like this moment for me will resonate

3170
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:12,360
like this moment for me will resonate
 

3171
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,870
like this moment for me will resonate
forever as a researcher and I mean as a

3172
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:14,880
forever as a researcher and I mean as a
 

3173
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,970
forever as a researcher and I mean as a
person and is a really like great

3174
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:16,980
person and is a really like great
 

3175
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:19,490
person and is a really like great
accomplishment and it was great also to

3176
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:19,500
accomplishment and it was great also to
 

3177
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,410
accomplishment and it was great also to
be there with the team in the room I

3178
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:21,420
be there with the team in the room I
 

3179
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,480
be there with the team in the room I
don't know if you saw like so it was

3180
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:23,490
don't know if you saw like so it was
 

3181
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,220
don't know if you saw like so it was
really like I mean from my perspective

3182
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:25,230
really like I mean from my perspective
 

3183
01:03:25,230 --> 01:03:27,470
really like I mean from my perspective
the other interesting thing is just like

3184
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:27,480
the other interesting thing is just like
 

3185
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,720
the other interesting thing is just like
watching Kasparov watching mana was also

3186
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:32,730
watching Kasparov watching mana was also
 

3187
01:03:32,730 --> 01:03:34,850
watching Kasparov watching mana was also
interesting because he didn't he is kind

3188
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:34,860
interesting because he didn't he is kind
 

3189
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:37,040
interesting because he didn't he is kind
of a loss of words I mean whenever you

3190
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:37,050
of a loss of words I mean whenever you
 

3191
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:38,780
of a loss of words I mean whenever you
lose I've done a lot of sports you

3192
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:38,790
lose I've done a lot of sports you
 

3193
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,960
lose I've done a lot of sports you
sometimes say excuses you look for

3194
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:41,970
sometimes say excuses you look for
 

3195
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:44,420
sometimes say excuses you look for
reasons right and he couldn't really

3196
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:44,430
reasons right and he couldn't really
 

3197
01:03:44,430 --> 01:03:47,230
reasons right and he couldn't really
come up with a reason yeah yeah I mean

3198
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:47,240
come up with a reason yeah yeah I mean
 

3199
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:50,060
come up with a reason yeah yeah I mean
so with the off race for Protoss you

3200
01:03:50,060 --> 01:03:50,070
so with the off race for Protoss you
 

3201
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:51,980
so with the off race for Protoss you
could say it was it felt awkward it

3202
01:03:51,980 --> 01:03:51,990
could say it was it felt awkward it
 

3203
01:03:51,990 --> 01:03:54,470
could say it was it felt awkward it
wasn't but here it was yeah it was it

3204
01:03:54,470 --> 01:03:54,480
wasn't but here it was yeah it was it
 

3205
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,330
wasn't but here it was yeah it was it
was just beaten and it was beautiful to

3206
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:56,340
was just beaten and it was beautiful to
 

3207
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,670
was just beaten and it was beautiful to
look at a human being being superseded

3208
01:03:58,670 --> 01:03:58,680
look at a human being being superseded
 

3209
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,880
look at a human being being superseded
by an AI system I mean it's a it's a

3210
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:01,890
by an AI system I mean it's a it's a
 

3211
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:04,550
by an AI system I mean it's a it's a
beautiful moment for researchers so yeah

3212
01:04:04,550 --> 01:04:04,560
beautiful moment for researchers so yeah
 

3213
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:06,710
beautiful moment for researchers so yeah
for sure it was it was I mean probably

3214
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:06,720
for sure it was it was I mean probably
 

3215
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,070
for sure it was it was I mean probably
the highlight of my career so far

3216
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:09,080
the highlight of my career so far
 

3217
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,480
the highlight of my career so far
because of its uniqueness and coolness

3218
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:11,490
because of its uniqueness and coolness
 

3219
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,550
because of its uniqueness and coolness
and I don't know I mean it's obviously

3220
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:13,560
and I don't know I mean it's obviously
 

3221
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:14,990
and I don't know I mean it's obviously
as you said you can look at paper

3222
01:04:14,990 --> 01:04:15,000
as you said you can look at paper
 

3223
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,720
as you said you can look at paper
citations and so on but these these

3224
01:04:17,720 --> 01:04:17,730
citations and so on but these these
 

3225
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:19,880
citations and so on but these these
really is like a testament of the whole

3226
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:19,890
really is like a testament of the whole
 

3227
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:22,940
really is like a testament of the whole
machine learning approach and using

3228
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:22,950
machine learning approach and using
 

3229
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,190
machine learning approach and using
games to advance technology I mean it's

3230
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,200
games to advance technology I mean it's
 

3231
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,410
games to advance technology I mean it's
really it really was everything came

3232
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:27,420
really it really was everything came
 

3233
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:29,000
really it really was everything came
together at that moment that that's

3234
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:29,010
together at that moment that that's
 

3235
01:04:29,010 --> 01:04:30,590
together at that moment that that's
really the summary also on the other

3236
01:04:30,590 --> 01:04:30,600
really the summary also on the other
 

3237
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:33,620
really the summary also on the other
side it's a popularization of AI too

3238
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:33,630
side it's a popularization of AI too
 

3239
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,800
side it's a popularization of AI too
because just like traveling to to the

3240
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:36,810
because just like traveling to to the
 

3241
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,410
because just like traveling to to the
moon and so on I mean this is where a

3242
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:39,420
moon and so on I mean this is where a
 

3243
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,120
moon and so on I mean this is where a
very large community of people that

3244
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:41,130
very large community of people that
 

3245
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:43,700
very large community of people that
don't really and no way I get to really

3246
01:04:43,700 --> 01:04:43,710
don't really and no way I get to really
 

3247
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:45,980
don't really and no way I get to really
interact with it which is very important

3248
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:45,990
interact with it which is very important
 

3249
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:48,410
interact with it which is very important
I mean it's really we must you know

3250
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:48,420
I mean it's really we must you know
 

3251
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,600
I mean it's really we must you know
writing papers helps our peers

3252
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:50,610
writing papers helps our peers
 

3253
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:52,190
writing papers helps our peers
researchers to understand what we're

3254
01:04:52,190 --> 01:04:52,200
researchers to understand what we're
 

3255
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,310
researchers to understand what we're
doing but I think AI is becoming mature

3256
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:55,320
doing but I think AI is becoming mature
 

3257
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,860
doing but I think AI is becoming mature
enough that we must sort of try to

3258
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:57,870
enough that we must sort of try to
 

3259
01:04:57,870 --> 01:04:59,930
enough that we must sort of try to
explain what it is and perhaps through

3260
01:04:59,930 --> 01:04:59,940
explain what it is and perhaps through
 

3261
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:02,150
explain what it is and perhaps through
games is an obvious way because these

3262
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,160
games is an obvious way because these
 

3263
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,330
games is an obvious way because these
games always had built

3264
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:03,340
games always had built
 

3265
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:06,690
games always had built
so it may be everyone experience an AI

3266
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:06,700
so it may be everyone experience an AI
 

3267
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:08,340
so it may be everyone experience an AI
playing a video game even if they don't

3268
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:08,350
playing a video game even if they don't
 

3269
01:05:08,350 --> 01:05:09,390
playing a video game even if they don't
know because there's always some

3270
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:09,400
know because there's always some
 

3271
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,190
know because there's always some
scripted element and some people might

3272
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:11,200
scripted element and some people might
 

3273
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:14,970
scripted element and some people might
even call that AI already right so what

3274
01:05:14,970 --> 01:05:14,980
even call that AI already right so what
 

3275
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:17,580
even call that AI already right so what
are other applications of the approaches

3276
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:17,590
are other applications of the approaches
 

3277
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:19,740
are other applications of the approaches
underlying alpha star that you see

said transformer of language modeling so

3282
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:24,730
said transformer of language modeling so
 

3283
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,970
said transformer of language modeling so
on have you already started thinking

3284
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:26,980
on have you already started thinking
 

3285
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:30,210
on have you already started thinking
where the breakthroughs in alpha star

3286
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:30,220
where the breakthroughs in alpha star
 

3287
01:05:30,220 --> 01:05:32,490
where the breakthroughs in alpha star
get expanded to other applications right

3288
01:05:32,490 --> 01:05:32,500
get expanded to other applications right
 

3289
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,070
get expanded to other applications right
so I thought about a few things for like

3290
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:35,080
so I thought about a few things for like
 

3291
01:05:35,080 --> 01:05:38,790
so I thought about a few things for like
kind of next months next year's the main

3292
01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:38,800
kind of next months next year's the main
 

3293
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,140
kind of next months next year's the main
thing I'm thinking about actually is

3294
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:40,150
thing I'm thinking about actually is
 

3295
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:42,660
thing I'm thinking about actually is
what's next as a kind of a grand

3296
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:42,670
what's next as a kind of a grand
 

3297
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:45,840
what's next as a kind of a grand
challenge because for me like we've seen

3298
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:45,850
challenge because for me like we've seen
 

3299
01:05:45,850 --> 01:05:48,990
challenge because for me like we've seen
Atari and then there's like the sort of

3300
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:49,000
Atari and then there's like the sort of
 

3301
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Atari and then there's like the sort of
three-dimensional worlds that we've seen

3302
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:51,010
three-dimensional worlds that we've seen
 

3303
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:52,620
three-dimensional worlds that we've seen
also like pretty good performance from

3304
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:52,630
also like pretty good performance from
 

3305
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:53,580
also like pretty good performance from
these capture-the-flag

3306
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:53,590
these capture-the-flag
 

3307
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,650
these capture-the-flag
agents that also some people at deep

3308
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:55,660
agents that also some people at deep
 

3309
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,750

mine and elsewhere are working on we've

3310
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
mine and elsewhere are working on we've
 

3311
01:05:57,760 --> 01:05:59,550
mine and elsewhere are working on we've
also seen some amazing results on like

3312
01:05:59,550 --> 01:05:59,560
also seen some amazing results on like
 

3313
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:01,740
also seen some amazing results on like
for instance dota 2 which is also a very

3314
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:01,750
for instance dota 2 which is also a very
 

3315
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:05,190
for instance dota 2 which is also a very
complicated game so for me like the main

3316
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:05,200
complicated game so for me like the main
 

3317
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:06,570
complicated game so for me like the main
thing I'm thinking about is what's next

3318
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:06,580
thing I'm thinking about is what's next
 

3319
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,000
thing I'm thinking about is what's next
in terms of challenge so as a researcher

3320
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,010
in terms of challenge so as a researcher
 

3321
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:13,430
in terms of challenge so as a researcher
I see sort of two tensions between

3322
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:13,440
I see sort of two tensions between
 

3323
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:16,680
I see sort of two tensions between
research and then applications or areas

3324
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:16,690
research and then applications or areas
 

3325
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:18,960
research and then applications or areas
or domains where you apply them so on

3326
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:18,970
or domains where you apply them so on
 

3327
01:06:18,970 --> 01:06:21,090
or domains where you apply them so on
the one hand we've done thanks to the

3328
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:21,100
the one hand we've done thanks to the
 

3329
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:23,430
the one hand we've done thanks to the
application of StarCraft is very hard we

3330
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
application of StarCraft is very hard we
 

3331
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,750
application of StarCraft is very hard we
develop some techniques some new

3332
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:24,760
develop some techniques some new
 

3333
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,580
develop some techniques some new
research that now we could look at

01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:26,590
research that now we could look at
 

3335
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,260
research that now we could look at
elsewhere like are there other

3336
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:28,270
elsewhere like are there other
 

3337
01:06:28,270 --> 01:06:30,090
elsewhere like are there other
applications where we can apply this and

3338
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:30,100
applications where we can apply this and
 

3339
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:33,210
applications where we can apply this and
the obvious ones absolutely you can

3340
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:33,220
the obvious ones absolutely you can
 

3341
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:37,020
the obvious ones absolutely you can

sequence modeling or natural language
 

3347
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:43,380

processing so we've developed an

3348
01:06:43,380 --> 01:06:43,390
processing so we've developed an
 

3349
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,960
processing so we've developed an
extended things from the transformer and

3350
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:45,970
extended things from the transformer and
 

3351
01:06:45,970 --> 01:06:48,600
extended things from the transformer and
and we use pointer networks we combine

3352
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:48,610
and we use pointer networks we combine
 

3353
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:50,420
and we use pointer networks we combine

01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:03,250
old-school and jump to the
 

3365
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:06,300
old-school and jump to the
to mr. Alan Turing yeah so the Turing

3366
01:07:06,300 --> 01:07:06,310
to mr. Alan Turing yeah so the Turing
 

3367
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:09,450
to mr. Alan Turing yeah so the Turing
test you know there's a natural language

3368
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:09,460
test you know there's a natural language
 

3369
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,180
test you know there's a natural language
test the conversational test what's your

3370
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:12,190
test the conversational test what's your
 

3371
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,839
test the conversational test what's your
thought of it as a test for intelligence

3372
01:07:14,839 --> 01:07:14,849
thought of it as a test for intelligence
 

3373
01:07:14,849 --> 01:07:16,980
thought of it as a test for intelligence
do you think it is a grand challenge

3374
01:07:16,980 --> 01:07:16,990
do you think it is a grand challenge
 

3375
01:07:16,990 --> 01:07:19,800
do you think it is a grand challenge
that's worthy of undertaking maybe if it

3376
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:19,810
that's worthy of undertaking maybe if it
 

3377
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,410
that's worthy of undertaking maybe if it
is would you reformulate it or phrase it

3378
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:22,420
is would you reformulate it or phrase it
 

3379
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,690
is would you reformulate it or phrase it
somehow differently right so I really

3380
01:07:24,690 --> 01:07:24,700
somehow differently right so I really
 

3381
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,599
somehow differently right so I really
love the Turing test because I also like

3382
01:07:26,599 --> 01:07:26,609
love the Turing test because I also like
 

3383
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,240
love the Turing test because I also like
sequences and language understanding and

01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:29,250
sequences and language understanding and
 

3385
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,430
sequences and language understanding and
in fact some of the early work we did in

3386
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:32,440
in fact some of the early work we did in
 

3387
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,290
in fact some of the early work we did in
machine translation we tried to apply to

01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,470
machine translation we tried to apply to
apply to kind of a neural chat bot which

obviously would never pass the Turing

3392
01:07:39,810 --> 01:07:39,820
obviously would never pass the Turing
 

3393
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:42,930
obviously would never pass the Turing
test because it was very limited but it

3394
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:42,940
test because it was very limited but it
 

3395
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:45,089
test because it was very limited but it
is a very fascinating fascinating idea

3396
01:07:45,089 --> 01:07:45,099
is a very fascinating fascinating idea
 

3397
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:49,560
is a very fascinating fascinating idea
that you could really have an AI that

3398
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:49,570
that you could really have an AI that
 

3399
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,630
that you could really have an AI that
would be indistinguishable from humans

3400
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:51,640
would be indistinguishable from humans
 

3401
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:55,170
would be indistinguishable from humans
in terms of asking or conversing with

in terms of asking or conversing with
 

3403
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:58,460
in terms of asking or conversing with
with it right so I think the test itself

3404
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:58,470
with it right so I think the test itself
 

3405
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:01,680
with it right so I think the test itself
seems very nice and it's kind of well

3406
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:01,690
seems very nice and it's kind of well
 

3407
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:04,200
seems very nice and it's kind of well
defined actually like the passing it or

3408
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:04,210
defined actually like the passing it or
 

3409
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:06,390
defined actually like the passing it or
not I think there's quite a few rules

3410
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:06,400
not I think there's quite a few rules
 

3411
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:09,839
not I think there's quite a few rules
that feel like pretty simple and and and

3412
01:08:09,839 --> 01:08:09,849
that feel like pretty simple and and and
 

3413
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:11,609
that feel like pretty simple and and and
you know you could you could really like

01:08:11,609 --> 01:08:11,619
you know you could you could really like
 

3415
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:13,500
you know you could you could really like
have I mean I think they have these

3416
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:13,510
have I mean I think they have these
 

3417
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:15,210
have I mean I think they have these
competitions every year yes of the

3418
01:08:15,210 --> 01:08:15,220
competitions every year yes of the
 

3419
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,440
competitions every year yes of the
laudner prize but I don't know if you've

3420
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:16,450
laudner prize but I don't know if you've
 

3421
01:08:16,450 --> 01:08:20,280
laudner prize but I don't know if you've
seen a I don't know if you've seen the

3422
01:08:20,280 --> 01:08:20,290
seen a I don't know if you've seen the
 

3423
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:23,039
seen a I don't know if you've seen the
kind of bots that emerge from that

3424
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:23,049
kind of bots that emerge from that
 

3425
01:08:23,049 --> 01:08:27,180
kind of bots that emerge from that
competition they're not quite as what

3426
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:27,190
competition they're not quite as what
 

3427
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:29,160
competition they're not quite as what
you would so it feels like that there's

3428
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:29,170
you would so it feels like that there's
 

3429
01:08:29,170 --> 01:08:30,570
you would so it feels like that there's
weaknesses with the way tauren

3430
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:30,580
weaknesses with the way tauren
 

3431
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:34,229
weaknesses with the way tauren
formulated it it needs to be that the

3432
01:08:34,229 --> 01:08:34,239
formulated it it needs to be that the
 

3433
01:08:34,239 --> 01:08:37,650
formulated it it needs to be that the
definition of a genuine rich fulfilling

01:08:37,650 --> 01:08:37,660
definition of a genuine rich fulfilling
 

3435
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:40,740
definition of a genuine rich fulfilling
human conversation it needs to be

3436
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:40,750
human conversation it needs to be
 

3437
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,809
human conversation it needs to be
something else like the Alexa prize

3438
01:08:42,809 --> 01:08:42,819
something else like the Alexa prize
 

3439
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:44,940
something else like the Alexa prize
which I'm not as well familiar with has

3440
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:44,950
which I'm not as well familiar with has
 

3441
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:46,530
which I'm not as well familiar with has
tried to define that more I think by

3442
01:08:46,530 --> 01:08:46,540
tried to define that more I think by
 

3443
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,570
tried to define that more I think by
saying you have to continue keeping a

3444
01:08:48,570 --> 01:08:48,580
saying you have to continue keeping a
 

3445
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,880
saying you have to continue keeping a
conversation for 30 minutes something

3446
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:50,890
conversation for 30 minutes something
 

3447
01:08:50,890 --> 01:08:51,990
conversation for 30 minutes something
like that

3448
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:52,000
like that
 

3449
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,420
like that
so basically forcing the agent not to

3450
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:54,430
so basically forcing the agent not to
 

3451
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:56,430
so basically forcing the agent not to
just fool but to have an engaging

3452
01:08:56,430 --> 01:08:56,440
just fool but to have an engaging
 

3453
01:08:56,440 --> 01:08:59,269
just fool but to have an engaging
conversation kind of thing is that I

3454
01:08:59,269 --> 01:08:59,279
conversation kind of thing is that I
 

3455
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,720
conversation kind of thing is that I
mean is is this have you thought about

3456
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:03,730
mean is is this have you thought about
 

3457
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:07,440
mean is is this have you thought about
this problem richly like as and if if

3458
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:07,450
this problem richly like as and if if
 

3459
01:09:07,450 --> 01:09:09,420
this problem richly like as and if if
you have in general how how far away are

3460
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:09,430
you have in general how how far away are
 

3461
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:13,080
you have in general how how far away are
we from you worked a lot on language

3462
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:13,090
we from you worked a lot on language
 

3463
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:15,550
we from you worked a lot on language
understanding language generation but

3464
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:15,560
understanding language generation but
 

3465
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:18,700
understanding language generation but
the full dialogue the conversation you

3466
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:18,710
the full dialogue the conversation you
 

3467
01:09:18,710 --> 01:09:20,170
the full dialogue the conversation you
know just sitting at the bar having a

3468
01:09:20,170 --> 01:09:20,180
know just sitting at the bar having a
 

3469
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,880
know just sitting at the bar having a
couple of beers for an hour and that

3470
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:21,890
couple of beers for an hour and that
 

3471
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,290
couple of beers for an hour and that
kind of conversation have you thought

3472
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:23,300
kind of conversation have you thought
 

3473
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,120
kind of conversation have you thought
about yeah so I think you touched here

3474
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:25,130
about yeah so I think you touched here
 

3475
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:27,270
about yeah so I think you touched here
on the critical point which is

3476
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:27,280
on the critical point which is
 

3477
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:29,770
on the critical point which is
feasibility right so so there's there's

3478
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:29,780
feasibility right so so there's there's
 

3479
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:33,150
feasibility right so so there's there's
a great sort of essay by Hamming which

3480
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:33,160
a great sort of essay by Hamming which
 

3481
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,190
a great sort of essay by Hamming which
describes sort of grand challenges of

3482
01:09:36,190 --> 01:09:36,200
describes sort of grand challenges of
 

3483
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,180
describes sort of grand challenges of
physics and he argues that well okay for

3484
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:40,190
physics and he argues that well okay for
 

3485
01:09:40,190 --> 01:09:42,400
physics and he argues that well okay for
instance teleportation or time travel

3486
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:42,410
instance teleportation or time travel
 

3487
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:45,160
instance teleportation or time travel
our great grand challenges of physics

3488
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:45,170
our great grand challenges of physics
 

3489
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:47,230
our great grand challenges of physics
but there's no attacks we really don't

3490
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:47,240
but there's no attacks we really don't
 

3491
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:49,750
but there's no attacks we really don't
know or cannot kind of make any progress

3492
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:49,760
know or cannot kind of make any progress
 

3493
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:53,260
know or cannot kind of make any progress
so that's why most physicists and so on

3494
01:09:53,260 --> 01:09:53,270
so that's why most physicists and so on
 

3495
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:55,180
so that's why most physicists and so on
they don't work on these in their PhDs

3496
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:55,190
they don't work on these in their PhDs
 

3497
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:58,030
they don't work on these in their PhDs
and and as part of their careers so I

3498
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:58,040
and and as part of their careers so I
 

3499
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,010
and and as part of their careers so I
see the Turing test as I in the full

3500
01:10:00,010 --> 01:10:00,020
see the Turing test as I in the full
 

3501
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,380
see the Turing test as I in the full
Turing test as a bit still too early

3502
01:10:02,380 --> 01:10:02,390
Turing test as a bit still too early
 

3503
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:05,950
Turing test as a bit still too early
like I am I think we're especially with

3504
01:10:05,950 --> 01:10:05,960
like I am I think we're especially with
 

3505
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,980
like I am I think we're especially with
the current trend of deep learning

3506
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:07,990
the current trend of deep learning
 

3507
01:10:07,990 --> 01:10:10,750
the current trend of deep learning
language models we've seen some amazing

3508
01:10:10,750 --> 01:10:10,760
language models we've seen some amazing
 

3509
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:13,090
language models we've seen some amazing
examples I think GPD to being the most

3510
01:10:13,090 --> 01:10:13,100
examples I think GPD to being the most
 

3511
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,570
examples I think GPD to being the most
recent one which is very impressive but

3512
01:10:15,570 --> 01:10:15,580
recent one which is very impressive but
 

3513
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:19,630
recent one which is very impressive but
to understand to fully solve passing or

3514
01:10:19,630 --> 01:10:19,640
to understand to fully solve passing or
 

3515
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,910
to understand to fully solve passing or
fooling a human to think that you're

3516
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:21,920
fooling a human to think that you're
 

3517
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,380
fooling a human to think that you're
that there's a human on the other side I

3518
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:23,390
that there's a human on the other side I
 

3519
01:10:23,390 --> 01:10:25,720
that there's a human on the other side I
think we're quite far so as a result I

3520
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:25,730
think we're quite far so as a result I
 

3521
01:10:25,730 --> 01:10:28,060
think we're quite far so as a result I
don't see myself and I probably would

3522
01:10:28,060 --> 01:10:28,070
don't see myself and I probably would
 

3523
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:30,550
don't see myself and I probably would
not recommend people doing a PhD on

3524
01:10:30,550 --> 01:10:30,560
not recommend people doing a PhD on
 

3525
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,260
not recommend people doing a PhD on
solving the Turing test because it just

3526
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:32,270
solving the Turing test because it just
 

3527
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:34,660
solving the Turing test because it just
feels it's kind of too early or too hard

3528
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:34,670
feels it's kind of too early or too hard
 

3529
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,880
feels it's kind of too early or too hard
of a problem yeah but that said you said

3530
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:36,890
of a problem yeah but that said you said
 

3531
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:38,590
of a problem yeah but that said you said
the exact same thing about Starcraft

3532
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:38,600
the exact same thing about Starcraft
 

3533
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:41,740
the exact same thing about Starcraft
about a few years ago so into damage so

3534
01:10:41,740 --> 01:10:41,750
about a few years ago so into damage so
 

3535
01:10:41,750 --> 01:10:44,980
about a few years ago so into damage so
I prefer yeah you'll probably also be

3536
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:44,990
I prefer yeah you'll probably also be
 

3537
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,140
I prefer yeah you'll probably also be
the person who passes the Turing test in

3538
01:10:47,140 --> 01:10:47,150
the person who passes the Turing test in
 

3539
01:10:47,150 --> 01:10:49,870
the person who passes the Turing test in
three years I mean I think I think that

3540
01:10:49,870 --> 01:10:49,880
three years I mean I think I think that
 

3541
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:52,150
three years I mean I think I think that
yeah so so we have the Sun record this

3542
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:52,160
yeah so so we have the Sun record this
 

3543
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:55,240
yeah so so we have the Sun record this
is nice it's really I mean that the it's

3544
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:55,250
is nice it's really I mean that the it's
 

3545
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,100
is nice it's really I mean that the it's
true that progress sometimes is a bit

3546
01:10:57,100 --> 01:10:57,110
true that progress sometimes is a bit
 

3547
01:10:57,110 --> 01:10:58,780
true that progress sometimes is a bit
unpredictable I really wouldn't have not

3548
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:58,790
unpredictable I really wouldn't have not
 

3549
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:01,360
unpredictable I really wouldn't have not
even six months ago I would not have

3550
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:01,370
even six months ago I would not have
 

3551
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:03,370
even six months ago I would not have
predicted the level that we see that

3552
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:03,380
predicted the level that we see that
 

3553
01:11:03,380 --> 01:11:06,130
predicted the level that we see that
these agents can deliver at Grandmaster

3554
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:06,140
these agents can deliver at Grandmaster
 

3555
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:09,580
these agents can deliver at Grandmaster
level but I I have worked on language

3556
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:09,590
level but I I have worked on language
 

3557
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:12,160
level but I I have worked on language
enough and basically my concern is not

3558
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:12,170
enough and basically my concern is not
 

3559
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:13,630
enough and basically my concern is not
that something could happen a

3560
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:13,640
that something could happen a
 

3561
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:15,100
that something could happen a
breakthrough could happen that would

3562
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:15,110
breakthrough could happen that would
 

3563
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:17,350
breakthrough could happen that would
bring us to solving or passing the

3564
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:17,360
bring us to solving or passing the
 

3565
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,830
bring us to solving or passing the
Turing test is that I just think the

3566
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
Turing test is that I just think the
 

3567
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,660
Turing test is that I just think the
statistical approach to it like this it

is great for the community but given

3574
01:11:28,689 --> 01:11:28,699
is great for the community but given
 

3575
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:31,090
is great for the community but given
that I think there's quite a more

3576
01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:31,100
that I think there's quite a more
 

3577
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,600
that I think there's quite a more
uncertainty whereas for StarCraft I knew

3578
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:34,610
uncertainty whereas for StarCraft I knew
 

3579
01:11:34,610 --> 01:11:37,660
uncertainty whereas for StarCraft I knew
what the steps would be to kind of get

3580
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:37,670
what the steps would be to kind of get
 

3581
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,090
what the steps would be to kind of get
us there I think it was clear that using

3582
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:40,100
us there I think it was clear that using
 

3583
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,919
us there I think it was clear that using
the imitation learning part and then

3584
01:11:41,919 --> 01:11:41,929
the imitation learning part and then
 

3585
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:44,560
the imitation learning part and then
using these battlenet for agents were

3586
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:44,570
using these battlenet for agents were
 

3587
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,350
using these battlenet for agents were
gonna be key and and it turned out that

3588
01:11:47,350 --> 01:11:47,360
gonna be key and and it turned out that
 

3589
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:49,540
gonna be key and and it turned out that
this was the case and a little more was

3590
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:49,550
this was the case and a little more was
 

3591
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:52,330
this was the case and a little more was
needed but not much more for Turing test

3592
01:11:52,330 --> 01:11:52,340
needed but not much more for Turing test
 

3593
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:54,399
needed but not much more for Turing test
I just don't know what the plan or

3594
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:54,409
I just don't know what the plan or
 

3595
01:11:54,409 --> 01:11:56,290
I just don't know what the plan or
execution plan would look like so that's

3596
01:11:56,290 --> 01:11:56,300
execution plan would look like so that's
 

3597
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:59,620
execution plan would look like so that's
why I'm I myself working on it as a

01:12:01,899 --> 01:12:01,909
grand challenge is hard but there are
 

3601
01:12:01,909 --> 01:12:04,209
grand challenge is hard but there are
quite a few sub challenges that are

01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:04,219
quite a few sub challenges that are
 

3603
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:05,860
quite a few sub challenges that are
related that you could say well I mean

what if you create a great assistant

3606
01:12:08,250 --> 01:12:08,260
what if you create a great assistant
 

3607
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:10,959
what if you create a great assistant
like Google already has like the Google

3608
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:10,969
like Google already has like the Google
 

3609
01:12:10,969 --> 01:12:13,209
like Google already has like the Google
assistant so can we make it better and

3610
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:13,219
assistant so can we make it better and
 

3611
01:12:13,219 --> 01:12:15,070
assistant so can we make it better and
can we make it fully new role and so on

3612
01:12:15,070 --> 01:12:15,080
can we make it fully new role and so on
 

3613
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,380
can we make it fully new role and so on
that I start to believe maybe we're

3614
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:17,390
that I start to believe maybe we're
 

3615
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:19,209
that I start to believe maybe we're
reaching a point where we should attempt

3616
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:19,219
reaching a point where we should attempt
 

3617
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:21,760

these challenges like this conversation

3618
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:21,770
these challenges like this conversation
 

3619
01:12:21,770 --> 01:12:23,560
these challenges like this conversation
so much because the echo is very much to

3620
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:23,570
so much because the echo is very much to
 

3621
01:12:23,570 --> 01:12:25,600
so much because the echo is very much to
start a conversation it's exactly how

3622
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:25,610
start a conversation it's exactly how
 

3623
01:12:25,610 --> 01:12:27,430
start a conversation it's exactly how
you approach StarCraft let's break it

3624
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:27,440
you approach StarCraft let's break it
 

3625
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:29,560
you approach StarCraft let's break it
down into small pieces solve those and

3626
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:29,570
down into small pieces solve those and
 

3627
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,540
down into small pieces solve those and
you end up solving the whole game great

3628
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:31,550
you end up solving the whole game great
 

3629
01:12:31,550 --> 01:12:34,180
you end up solving the whole game great
but that said you you're behind some of

3630
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:34,190
but that said you you're behind some of
 

3631
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:36,970
but that said you you're behind some of
the sort of biggest pieces of work and

3632
01:12:36,970 --> 01:12:36,980
the sort of biggest pieces of work and
 

3633
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:39,390
the sort of biggest pieces of work and
deep learning in the last several years

3634
01:12:39,390 --> 01:12:39,400
deep learning in the last several years
 

3635
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:42,580
deep learning in the last several years
so you mentioned some limits what do you

3636
01:12:42,580 --> 01:12:42,590
so you mentioned some limits what do you
 

3637
01:12:42,590 --> 01:12:43,990
so you mentioned some limits what do you
think of the current limits of deep

3638
01:12:43,990 --> 01:12:44,000
think of the current limits of deep
 

3639
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:46,180
think of the current limits of deep
learning and how do we overcome those

3640
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:46,190
learning and how do we overcome those
 

3641
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,180
learning and how do we overcome those
limits so if I had to actually use a

3642
01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:49,190
limits so if I had to actually use a
 

3643
01:12:49,190 --> 01:12:52,360
limits so if I had to actually use a
single word to define the main challenge

3644
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:52,370
single word to define the main challenge
 

3645
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:53,979
single word to define the main challenge
in deep learning is a challenge that

3646
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:53,989
in deep learning is a challenge that
 

3647
01:12:53,989 --> 01:12:56,169
in deep learning is a challenge that
probably has been the challenge for many

3648
01:12:56,169 --> 01:12:56,179
probably has been the challenge for many
 

3649
01:12:56,179 --> 01:12:59,939
probably has been the challenge for many
years and is that of generalization so

3650
01:12:59,939 --> 01:12:59,949
years and is that of generalization so
 

3651
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:04,180
years and is that of generalization so
what that means is that all that we're

3652
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:04,190
what that means is that all that we're
 

3653
01:13:04,190 --> 01:13:06,959
what that means is that all that we're
doing is fitting functions to data and

3654
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:06,969
doing is fitting functions to data and
 

3655
01:13:06,969 --> 01:13:11,200
doing is fitting functions to data and
when the data we see is not from the

3656
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:11,210
when the data we see is not from the
 

3657
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:13,689
when the data we see is not from the
same distribution or even if there some

3658
01:13:13,689 --> 01:13:13,699
same distribution or even if there some
 

3659
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:15,100
same distribution or even if there some
times that it is very close to

3660
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:15,110
times that it is very close to
 

3661
01:13:15,110 --> 01:13:17,800
times that it is very close to
distribution but because of the way we

3662
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:17,810
distribution but because of the way we
 

3663
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,979
distribution but because of the way we
train it with limited samples we then

3664
01:13:20,979 --> 01:13:20,989
train it with limited samples we then
 

3665
01:13:20,989 --> 01:13:23,680
train it with limited samples we then
get to this stage where we just don't

3666
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:23,690
get to this stage where we just don't
 

3667
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:27,070
get to this stage where we just don't
see generalization as much as we can

3668
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:27,080
see generalization as much as we can
 

3669
01:13:27,080 --> 01:13:29,200
see generalization as much as we can
generalize and I think adversarial

3670
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:29,210
generalize and I think adversarial
 

3671
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:31,120
generalize and I think adversarial
examples are a clear example of these

3672
01:13:31,120 --> 01:13:31,130
examples are a clear example of these
 

3673
01:13:31,130 --> 01:13:33,820
examples are a clear example of these
but if you study machine learning and

3674
01:13:33,820 --> 01:13:33,830
but if you study machine learning and
 

3675
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:36,129
but if you study machine learning and

3677
01:13:36,139 --> 01:13:38,919
literature and you know the reason why
as VMs came very popular where because

3678
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:38,929
as VMs came very popular where because
 

3679
01:13:38,929 --> 01:13:40,030
as VMs came very popular where because
they were dealing and they

3680
01:13:40,030 --> 01:13:40,040
they were dealing and they
 

3681
01:13:40,040 --> 01:13:42,340
they were dealing and they
had some guarantees about generalization

3682
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:42,350
had some guarantees about generalization
 

3683
01:13:42,350 --> 01:13:44,800
had some guarantees about generalization

that you can just find corner cases so I
think that's really the underlying topic

think that's really the underlying topic
 

3723
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,140
think that's really the underlying topic
many times we see when even even at the

01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:38,150
many times we see when even even at the
 

3725
01:14:38,150 --> 01:14:39,780
many times we see when even even at the
grand stage of like doing test

3726
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:39,790
grand stage of like doing test
 

3727
01:14:39,790 --> 01:14:41,650
grand stage of like doing test
generalization I mean if used if you

3728
01:14:41,650 --> 01:14:41,660
generalization I mean if used if you
 

3729
01:14:41,660 --> 01:14:42,130
generalization I mean if used if you
start

3730
01:14:42,130 --> 01:14:42,140
start
 

3731
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:44,620

I mean passing the Turing test should

3732
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:44,630
I mean passing the Turing test should
 

3733
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:46,900
I mean passing the Turing test should
you should it be in English or should it

3734
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:46,910
you should it be in English or should it
 

3735
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,940
you should it be in English or should it
be in any language right I mean as a

3736
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:48,950
be in any language right I mean as a
 

3737
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:51,460
be in any language right I mean as a
human if you could you could if you ask

3738
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:51,470
human if you could you could if you ask
 

3739
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:53,140
human if you could you could if you ask
something in a different language you

3740
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:53,150
something in a different language you
 

3741
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,670
something in a different language you
actually will go and do some research

3742
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:54,680
actually will go and do some research
 

3743
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,910
actually will go and do some research
and try to translate it and so on

3744
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:56,920
and try to translate it and so on
 

3745
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,800
and try to translate it and so on
shoot the Turing test in clementa

3746
01:14:59,800 --> 01:14:59,810
shoot the Turing test in clementa
 

3747
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:02,050
shoot the Turing test in clementa
include that right and it's really a

3748
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:02,060
include that right and it's really a
 

3749
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,880
include that right and it's really a
difficult problem and very fascinating

3750
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:03,890
difficult problem and very fascinating
 

3751
01:15:03,890 --> 01:15:05,650
difficult problem and very fascinating
and very mysterious actually yeah

3752
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:05,660
and very mysterious actually yeah
 

3753
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,660
and very mysterious actually yeah
absolutely but do you think it's if you

3754
01:15:07,660 --> 01:15:07,670
absolutely but do you think it's if you
 

3755
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:12,100
absolutely but do you think it's if you
were to try to solve it can you not grow

3756
01:15:12,100 --> 01:15:12,110
were to try to solve it can you not grow
 

3757
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:14,530
were to try to solve it can you not grow
the size of data intelligently in such a

3758
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:14,540
the size of data intelligently in such a
 

3759
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,660
the size of data intelligently in such a
way that the distribution of your

3760
01:15:16,660 --> 01:15:16,670
way that the distribution of your
 

3761
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:18,760
way that the distribution of your
training set does include the entirety

3762
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:18,770
training set does include the entirety
 

3763
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:21,400
training set does include the entirety
of the testing set I think is that one

3764
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:21,410
of the testing set I think is that one
 

3765
01:15:21,410 --> 01:15:23,080
of the testing set I think is that one
path the other path is totally new

3766
01:15:23,080 --> 01:15:23,090
path the other path is totally new
 

3767
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:24,820
path the other path is totally new
methodology right it's not statistical

3768
01:15:24,820 --> 01:15:24,830
methodology right it's not statistical
 

3769
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:27,310
methodology right it's not statistical
so a path that has worked well and it

3770
01:15:27,310 --> 01:15:27,320
so a path that has worked well and it
 

3771
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,260
so a path that has worked well and it
worked well in in stark Ravin in machine

3772
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:29,270
worked well in in stark Ravin in machine

the data and the model and that's kind

3776
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:33,470
the data and the model and that's kind
 

3777
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:37,330
the data and the model and that's kind
of been maybe the only single formula

3778
01:15:37,330 --> 01:15:37,340
of been maybe the only single formula
 

3779
01:15:37,340 --> 01:15:39,610
of been maybe the only single formula
that the leap still delivers today in

3780
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:39,620
that the leap still delivers today in
 

3781
01:15:39,620 --> 01:15:41,860
that the leap still delivers today in
deep learning right it's it's that scale

3782
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:41,870
deep learning right it's it's that scale
 

3783
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:45,100
deep learning right it's it's that scale
data scale and model scale really do

3784
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:45,110
data scale and model scale really do
 

3785
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,570
data scale and model scale really do
more and more of the things that we

3786
01:15:46,570 --> 01:15:46,580
more and more of the things that we
 

3787
01:15:46,580 --> 01:15:48,220
more and more of the things that we
thought oh there's no way it can

3788
01:15:48,220 --> 01:15:48,230
thought oh there's no way it can
 

3789
01:15:48,230 --> 01:15:49,810
thought oh there's no way it can
generalize to these Ori there's no way

3790
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:49,820
generalize to these Ori there's no way
 

3791
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:51,820
generalize to these Ori there's no way
it can generalize to that but I don't

3792
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:51,830
it can generalize to that but I don't
 

3793
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,510
it can generalize to that but I don't
think fundamentally it

3794
01:15:53,510 --> 01:15:53,520
think fundamentally it
 

3795
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,030
think fundamentally it
resolve with these and for instance I'm

3796
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:56,040
resolve with these and for instance I'm
 

3797
01:15:56,040 --> 01:15:59,240
resolve with these and for instance I'm
really liking some style or approach

really liking some style or approach
that would not only have neural networks

3800
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:02,010
that would not only have neural networks
 

3801
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,040
that would not only have neural networks
but it would have programs or some

3802
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:04,050
but it would have programs or some
 

3803
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:07,040
but it would have programs or some
discrete decision-making because there

3804
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:07,050
discrete decision-making because there
 

3805
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:09,860
discrete decision-making because there
is what I feel there's a bit more like

3806
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:09,870
is what I feel there's a bit more like
 

3807
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:11,660
is what I feel there's a bit more like
like I mean the example of the best

01:16:11,660 --> 01:16:11,670
like I mean the example of the best

we can learn an algorithm with a neural
 

3815
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,460
we can learn an algorithm with a neural
network right so you give it many

3816
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:19,470
network right so you give it many
 

3817
01:16:19,470 --> 01:16:21,200
network right so you give it many
examples and it's going to sort your

3818
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:21,210
examples and it's going to sort your
 

3819
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:23,450
examples and it's going to sort your
sort the input numbers or something like

01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:23,460
sort the input numbers or something like
 

3821
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:27,350
sort the input numbers or something like
that but really strong generalization is

3822
01:16:27,350 --> 01:16:27,360
that but really strong generalization is

01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:30,050
that but really strong generalization is
you give me some numbers or you ask me

3824
01:16:30,050 --> 01:16:30,060
you give me some numbers or you ask me
 

3825
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:31,760
you give me some numbers or you ask me
to create an algorithm that sorts

to create an algorithm that sorts
 

3827
01:16:31,770 --> 01:16:33,500
to create an algorithm that sorts
numbers and instead of creating a neural

gonna go out of range at some point
 

3833
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:39,740
gonna go out of range at some point
you're gonna give you numbers that are

01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:39,750
you're gonna give you numbers that are
 

3835
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:41,540
you're gonna give you numbers that are

you just if you just create a piece of
 

3839
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:46,790
you just if you just create a piece of
code that sorts the numbers then you can

3840
01:16:46,790 --> 01:16:46,800
code that sorts the numbers then you can
 

3841
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:48,650

prove that that will generalize to
 

3843

absolutely all the possible inputs you
 

3845
01:16:50,970 --> 01:16:53,510
absolutely all the possible inputs you
could give so I think that's the problem

3846
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:53,520
could give so I think that's the problem
 

3847

mean scale is a bit more boring but it

3850
01:16:58,460 --> 01:16:58,470
mean scale is a bit more boring but it
 

3851
01:16:58,470 --> 01:17:00,950
mean scale is a bit more boring but it
really works and then maybe programs and

01:17:17,030 --> 01:17:17,040
symbolic systems about computing do you
 

3865
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:19,730
symbolic systems about computing do you
ever go back to those reasoning that

01:17:19,730 --> 01:17:19,740
ever go back to those reasoning that

01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:31,430
those books yeah I actually love
actually adding more inductive biases to

actually adding more inductive biases to

01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:33,230
actually adding more inductive biases to
me the problem really is what are you

me the problem really is what are you
 

3877
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:35,210
me the problem really is what are you
trying to solve if what you're trying to

trying to solve if what you're trying to
 

3879
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,730
trying to solve if what you're trying to

it no matter what then absolutely use

3882
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:40,950
it no matter what then absolutely use
 

3883
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:45,080
it no matter what then absolutely use
rules use domain knowledge and then use

3884
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:45,090
rules use domain knowledge and then use
 

3885
01:17:45,090 --> 01:17:46,670
rules use domain knowledge and then use
a bit of the magic of machine learning

3886
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:46,680
a bit of the magic of machine learning
 

3887
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,100
a bit of the magic of machine learning
to empower to make the system as the

3888
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:49,110
to empower to make the system as the
 

3889
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:52,310
to empower to make the system as the
best system that will detect cancer or

3890
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
best system that will detect cancer or
 

3891
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:55,160
best system that will detect cancer or
you know or detect weather patterns

3892
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:55,170
you know or detect weather patterns
 

3893
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:57,950
you know or detect weather patterns
right or in terms of start of it also

3894
01:17:57,950 --> 01:17:57,960
right or in terms of start of it also
 

3895
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:00,080
right or in terms of start of it also
was a very big challenge so I was

3896
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:00,090
was a very big challenge so I was
 

3897
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:02,900
was a very big challenge so I was
definitely happy that if we had to get

3898
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:02,910
definitely happy that if we had to get
 

3899
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,610
definitely happy that if we had to get
take cut a corner here and there it

3900
01:18:04,610 --> 01:18:04,620
take cut a corner here and there it
 

3901
01:18:04,620 --> 01:18:05,410
take cut a corner here and there it
could have been

3902
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:05,420
could have been
 

3903
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:07,750
could have been
interesting to do and in fact in

3904
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:07,760
interesting to do and in fact in
 

3905
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,610
interesting to do and in fact in
StarCraft we we start thinking about

3906
01:18:09,610 --> 01:18:09,620
StarCraft we we start thinking about
 

3907
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:11,740
StarCraft we we start thinking about
expert systems because it's very you

3908
01:18:11,740 --> 01:18:11,750
expert systems because it's very you
 

3909
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:13,330
expert systems because it's very you
know you can define I mean people

3910
01:18:13,330 --> 01:18:13,340
know you can define I mean people
 

3911
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,550
know you can define I mean people
actually build stack reports by thinking

3912
01:18:15,550 --> 01:18:15,560
actually build stack reports by thinking
 

3913
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,530
actually build stack reports by thinking
about those principal I guess you know

3914
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:17,540
about those principal I guess you know
 

3915
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:20,530
about those principal I guess you know
state machines and rule-based and then

3916
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:20,540
state machines and rule-based and then
 

3917
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,270
state machines and rule-based and then
you could you could think of combining a

3918
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:22,280
you could you could think of combining a
 

3919
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,000
you could you could think of combining a
bit of a rule-based system but that has

3920
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:25,010
bit of a rule-based system but that has
 

3921
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:27,580
bit of a rule-based system but that has
also neural networks incorporated to

3922
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:27,590
also neural networks incorporated to
 

3923
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:29,169
also neural networks incorporated to
make it generalize a bit better so

3924
01:18:29,169 --> 01:18:29,179
make it generalize a bit better so
 

3925
01:18:29,179 --> 01:18:30,910
make it generalize a bit better so
absolutely I mean we should we should

3926
01:18:30,910 --> 01:18:30,920
absolutely I mean we should we should
 

3927
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:32,680
absolutely I mean we should we should
definitely go back to those ideas and

3928
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:32,690
definitely go back to those ideas and
 

3929
01:18:32,690 --> 01:18:35,350
definitely go back to those ideas and
anything that makes the problem simpler

3930
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:35,360
anything that makes the problem simpler
 

3931
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:37,060
anything that makes the problem simpler
as long as your problem is important

3932
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:37,070
as long as your problem is important
 

3933
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:39,520
as long as your problem is important
that's okay and that's research driving

3934
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:39,530
that's okay and that's research driving
 

3935
01:18:39,530 --> 01:18:41,650
that's okay and that's research driving
a very important problem and on the

3936
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:41,660
a very important problem and on the
 

3937
01:18:41,660 --> 01:18:44,620
a very important problem and on the
other hand if you wanna really focus on

3938
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:44,630
other hand if you wanna really focus on
 

3939
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:46,060
other hand if you wanna really focus on
the limits of reinforcement learning

3940
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:46,070
the limits of reinforcement learning
 

3941
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:49,030
the limits of reinforcement learning
then of course you must try not to look

3942
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:49,040
then of course you must try not to look
 

3943
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:52,660
then of course you must try not to look
at imitation data or to look some like

3944
01:18:52,660 --> 01:18:52,670
at imitation data or to look some like
 

3945
01:18:52,670 --> 01:18:54,430
at imitation data or to look some like
for some rules of the domain that would

3946
01:18:54,430 --> 01:18:54,440
for some rules of the domain that would
 

3947
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,740
for some rules of the domain that would
help a lot or even feature engineering

3948
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:56,750
help a lot or even feature engineering
 

3949
01:18:56,750 --> 01:18:59,100
help a lot or even feature engineering
right so these these attention that

3950
01:18:59,100 --> 01:18:59,110
right so these these attention that
 

3951
01:18:59,110 --> 01:19:01,270
right so these these attention that
depending on what you do I think both

3952
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
depending on what you do I think both
 

3953
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,640
depending on what you do I think both
both ways are definitely fine and I

3954
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:03,650
both ways are definitely fine and I
 

3955
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:06,130
both ways are definitely fine and I
would never not do one or the other if

3956
01:19:06,130 --> 01:19:06,140
would never not do one or the other if
 

3957
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:07,750
would never not do one or the other if
you're as long as you what you're doing

3958
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:07,760
you're as long as you what you're doing
 

3959
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,910
you're as long as you what you're doing
is important and needs to be soft right

3960
01:19:09,910 --> 01:19:09,920
is important and needs to be soft right
 

3961
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,880
is important and needs to be soft right
right so there's a bunch of different

3962
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:12,890
right so there's a bunch of different
 

3963
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:16,150
right so there's a bunch of different
ideas that that that you develop that I

3964
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:16,160
ideas that that that you develop that I
 

3965
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:19,229
ideas that that that you develop that I
really enjoy so but one one is

3966
01:19:19,229 --> 01:19:19,239
really enjoy so but one one is
 

3967
01:19:19,239 --> 01:19:22,180
really enjoy so but one one is
translating from the image captioning

3968
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:22,190
translating from the image captioning
 

3969
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,640
translating from the image captioning
translated finish the text just just

3970
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:24,650
translated finish the text just just
 

3971
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,860
translated finish the text just just
another just beautiful yeah beautiful

3972
01:19:26,860 --> 01:19:26,870
another just beautiful yeah beautiful
 

3973
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:31,720
another just beautiful yeah beautiful
idea I think that resonates throughout

3974
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:31,730
idea I think that resonates throughout
 

3975
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:33,850
idea I think that resonates throughout
your work actually so the underlying

3976
01:19:33,850 --> 01:19:33,860
your work actually so the underlying
 

3977
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:36,280
your work actually so the underlying
nature of reality being language always

3978
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:36,290
nature of reality being language always
 

3979
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:40,120
nature of reality being language always
yes somehow so what's the connection

3980
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:40,130
yes somehow so what's the connection
 

3981
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:43,120
yes somehow so what's the connection
between images and text rather the

3982
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:43,130
between images and text rather the
 

3983
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:45,130
between images and text rather the
visual world and the world of language

3984
01:19:45,130 --> 01:19:45,140
visual world and the world of language
 

3985
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:50,110
visual world and the world of language
in your view right so I think a piece of

3986
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:50,120
in your view right so I think a piece of
 

3987
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,209
in your view right so I think a piece of
research that's been central to I would

3988
01:19:52,209 --> 01:19:52,219
research that's been central to I would
 

3989
01:19:52,219 --> 01:19:54,400
research that's been central to I would
say even extending into Starcraft is is

3990
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:54,410
say even extending into Starcraft is is
 

3991
01:19:54,410 --> 01:19:56,740
say even extending into Starcraft is is
this idea of sequence to sequence

3992
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:56,750
this idea of sequence to sequence
 

3993
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,500
this idea of sequence to sequence
learning which what we really meant by

01:19:59,500 --> 01:19:59,510
learning which what we really meant by
 

3995
01:19:59,510 --> 01:20:02,080
learning which what we really meant by
that is that you can you can now really

01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:02,090
that is that you can you can now really
 

3997
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,570
that is that you can you can now really
input anything to a neural network as

3998
01:20:04,570 --> 01:20:04,580
input anything to a neural network as
 

3999
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:08,020
input anything to a neural network as
the input X and then the neural network

4000
01:20:08,020 --> 01:20:08,030
the input X and then the neural network
 

4001
01:20:08,030 --> 01:20:10,360
the input X and then the neural network
will learn a function f that will take X

4002
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:10,370
will learn a function f that will take X
 

4003
01:20:10,370 --> 01:20:12,640
will learn a function f that will take X
as an input and produce any output Y and

4004
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:12,650
as an input and produce any output Y and
 

4005
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:15,370
as an input and produce any output Y and
these x and y's don't need to be like

4006
01:20:15,370 --> 01:20:15,380
these x and y's don't need to be like
 

4007
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:19,090
these x and y's don't need to be like
static or like a features like as

4008
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:19,100
static or like a features like as
 

4009
01:20:19,100 --> 01:20:22,000

01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:22,010
like a fixed vectors or anything like
 

4011
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:23,890
like a fixed vectors or anything like
that it could be it really sequences and

4012
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:23,900
that it could be it really sequences and
 

4013
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:26,680
that it could be it really sequences and
now beyond like data structures right so

4014
01:20:26,680 --> 01:20:26,690
now beyond like data structures right so
 

4015
01:20:26,690 --> 01:20:30,820
now beyond like data structures right so
that paradigm was tested in a very

that paradigm was tested in a very
 

4017
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:32,850
that paradigm was tested in a very
interesting way when we moved from

translating an image to its caption but
 

4023
01:20:38,090 --> 01:20:39,910
translating an image to its caption but
the beauty the beauty of it is that

the beauty the beauty of it is that
 

4025
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:41,680
the beauty the beauty of it is that
really and that's actually how it

4026
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:41,690
really and that's actually how it
 

4027
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,050
really and that's actually how it
happened I run I change the line of code

4028
01:20:44,050 --> 01:20:44,060
happened I run I change the line of code

translation I and I came the next day

4032
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:48,410
translation I and I came the next day
 

4033
01:20:48,410 --> 01:20:51,670
translation I and I came the next day
and I saw how it like it was producing

4034
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:51,680
and I saw how it like it was producing
 

4035
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,280
and I saw how it like it was producing

is really really working and the

4038
01:20:56,290 --> 01:20:56,300
is really really working and the
 

4039
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,710
is really really working and the
principle is the same right so I think I

4040
01:20:58,710 --> 01:20:58,720
principle is the same right so I think I
 

4041
01:20:58,720 --> 01:21:04,000
principle is the same right so I think I
don't see text vision speech waveforms

4042
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:04,010
don't see text vision speech waveforms
 

4043
01:21:04,010 --> 01:21:07,930
don't see text vision speech waveforms

you basically learn a function that will

4046
01:21:11,730 --> 01:21:11,740
you basically learn a function that will
 

4047
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:15,070
you basically learn a function that will
vector eyes you know these into and then

4048
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:15,080
vector eyes you know these into and then
 

4049
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,470
vector eyes you know these into and then
after we vectorize it we can then use

4050
01:21:17,470 --> 01:21:17,480
after we vectorize it we can then use
 

4051
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:19,900
after we vectorize it we can then use
you know transformers LS DMS whatever

01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,130
the flavor of the month of the model is

4056
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:24,140
and then as long as we have enough
 

4057
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:28,180

supervised data really this formula will

4058
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:28,190
supervised data really this formula will
 

4059
01:21:28,190 --> 01:21:30,820
supervised data really this formula will
work and we'll keep working I believe to

4060
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:30,830
work and we'll keep working I believe to
 

4061
01:21:30,830 --> 01:21:32,320
work and we'll keep working I believe to
some extent model of these

4062
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:32,330
some extent model of these

4064
01:21:33,670 --> 01:21:33,680
generalization issues that I mentioned
 

4065
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:36,580

before so but the testers to vectorize

4066
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:36,590
before so but the testers to vectorize
 

4067
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:38,410
before so but the testers to vectorize
sort of former representation that's

4068
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:38,420
sort of former representation that's
 

4069
01:21:38,420 --> 01:21:40,750
sort of former representation that's

now having worked with all this media is

4072
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:42,800
now having worked with all this media is
 

4073
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,760
now having worked with all this media is
that once you are able to form that

4074
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:45,770
that once you are able to form that
 

4075
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:47,230
that once you are able to form that
representation you can basically take

4076
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:47,240
representation you can basically take
 

4077
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:51,670
representation you can basically take
any things any sequence is there go back

4078
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:51,680
any things any sequence is there go back
 

4079
01:21:51,680 --> 01:21:53,470
any things any sequence is there go back
to Starcraft is there limits on the

4080
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:53,480
to Starcraft is there limits on the
 

4081
01:21:53,480 --> 01:21:57,310
to Starcraft is there limits on the
length so we didn't really touch on a

4082
01:21:57,310 --> 01:21:57,320
length so we didn't really touch on a
 

4083
01:21:57,320 --> 01:21:59,980
length so we didn't really touch on a
long term effect how did you overcome

4084
01:21:59,980 --> 01:21:59,990
long term effect how did you overcome
 

4085
01:21:59,990 --> 01:22:03,010
long term effect how did you overcome
the whole really long term aspect of

4086
01:22:03,010 --> 01:22:03,020
the whole really long term aspect of
 

4087
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:05,320
the whole really long term aspect of
things here is there some tricks or so

4088
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:05,330
things here is there some tricks or so
 

4089
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:08,800
things here is there some tricks or so
the main streak so Starcraft if you look

4090
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:08,810
the main streak so Starcraft if you look
 

4091
01:22:08,810 --> 01:22:10,990
the main streak so Starcraft if you look
at absolutely every frame you might

4092
01:22:10,990 --> 01:22:11,000
at absolutely every frame you might
 

4093
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,850
at absolutely every frame you might
think it's it's quite a long game so we

4094
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:12,860
think it's it's quite a long game so we
 

4095
01:22:12,860 --> 01:22:17,410
think it's it's quite a long game so we
would have to multiply 22 times 60

4096
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:17,420
would have to multiply 22 times 60
 

4097
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:19,960
would have to multiply 22 times 60
seconds per minute times maybe at least

4098
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:19,970
seconds per minute times maybe at least
 

4099
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:22,480
seconds per minute times maybe at least
10 minutes per game on average so there

4100
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:22,490
10 minutes per game on average so there
 

4101
01:22:22,490 --> 01:22:26,470
10 minutes per game on average so there
are quite a few frames but the trick

4102
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
are quite a few frames but the trick
 

4103
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:30,310
are quite a few frames but the trick
really was to only observe in fact which

4104
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:30,320
really was to only observe in fact which
 

4105
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:32,830
really was to only observe in fact which
might be seen as a limitation but

4106
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:32,840
might be seen as a limitation but
 

4107
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,529
might be seen as a limitation but
it is also computational advantage only

4108
01:22:35,529 --> 01:22:35,539
it is also computational advantage only
 

4109
01:22:35,539 --> 01:22:38,709
it is also computational advantage only
observe when you act and then what the

4110
01:22:38,709 --> 01:22:38,719
observe when you act and then what the
 

4111
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:40,810
observe when you act and then what the
neural network decides is what is the

4112
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:40,820
neural network decides is what is the
 

4113
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:44,740
neural network decides is what is the
gap gonna be until the next action and

4114
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:44,750
gap gonna be until the next action and
 

4115
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:48,189
gap gonna be until the next action and
if you look at most Starcraft games that

4116
01:22:48,189 --> 01:22:48,199
if you look at most Starcraft games that
 

4117
01:22:48,199 --> 01:22:49,930
if you look at most Starcraft games that
we have in the in the data set that

4118
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:49,940
we have in the in the data set that
 

4119
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:53,589
we have in the in the data set that
Blaser provided it turns out that most

Blaser provided it turns out that most
 

4121
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,740
Blaser provided it turns out that most

games are actually only I mean it is
 

4123
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,600
games are actually only I mean it is
still a long sequence but it may be like

4124
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:58,610
still a long sequence but it may be like
 

4125
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:03,399
still a long sequence but it may be like
a thousand to 1,500 actions which if you

4126
01:23:03,399 --> 01:23:03,409
a thousand to 1,500 actions which if you
 

4127
01:23:03,409 --> 01:23:07,000
a thousand to 1,500 actions which if you
start looking at L STM's large LST M's

4128
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:07,010
start looking at L STM's large LST M's
 

4129
01:23:07,010 --> 01:23:10,120
start looking at L STM's large LST M's
transformers it's it's not like it's not

4130
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:10,130
transformers it's it's not like it's not
 

4131
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:12,580
transformers it's it's not like it's not
that that difficult especially if you

4132
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:12,590
that that difficult especially if you
 

4133
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,919
that that difficult especially if you
have supervised learning if you had to

4134
01:23:14,919 --> 01:23:14,929
have supervised learning if you had to
 

4135
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:16,330
have supervised learning if you had to
do it with reinforcement learning the

4136
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:16,340
do it with reinforcement learning the
 

4137
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:18,339
do it with reinforcement learning the
credit assignment problem what is it

4138
01:23:18,339 --> 01:23:18,349
credit assignment problem what is it
 

4139
01:23:18,349 --> 01:23:19,720
credit assignment problem what is it
that in this game that made you win that

4140
01:23:19,720 --> 01:23:19,730
that in this game that made you win that
 

4141
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:22,240
that in this game that made you win that
would be really difficult but thankfully

4142
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,250
would be really difficult but thankfully
 

4143
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:25,209
would be really difficult but thankfully
because of imitation learning we didn't

4144
01:23:25,209 --> 01:23:25,219
because of imitation learning we didn't
 

4145
01:23:25,219 --> 01:23:27,010
because of imitation learning we didn't
kind of have to deal with these directly

4146
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:27,020
kind of have to deal with these directly
 

4147
01:23:27,020 --> 01:23:29,649
kind of have to deal with these directly
although if we had to we tried it and

4148
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:29,659
although if we had to we tried it and
 

4149
01:23:29,659 --> 01:23:31,450
although if we had to we tried it and
what happen is you just take all your

4150
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:31,460
what happen is you just take all your
 

4151
01:23:31,460 --> 01:23:33,640
what happen is you just take all your
workers and attack with them and that

4152
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:33,650
workers and attack with them and that
 

4153
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:35,740
workers and attack with them and that
sort of is kind of obvious in retrospect

4154
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:35,750
sort of is kind of obvious in retrospect
 

4155
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,720
sort of is kind of obvious in retrospect
because you start trying random actions

4156
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:37,730
because you start trying random actions
 

4157
01:23:37,730 --> 01:23:40,419
because you start trying random actions
one of the actions will be a worker that

4158
01:23:40,419 --> 01:23:40,429
one of the actions will be a worker that
 

4159
01:23:40,429 --> 01:23:42,100
one of the actions will be a worker that
goes to the enemy base and because it's

4160
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:42,110
goes to the enemy base and because it's
 

4161
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:44,140
goes to the enemy base and because it's
self play it's not gonna know how to

4162
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:44,150
self play it's not gonna know how to
 

4163
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:45,970
self play it's not gonna know how to
defend because it basically doesn't know

4164
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:45,980
defend because it basically doesn't know
 

4165
01:23:45,980 --> 01:23:47,830
defend because it basically doesn't know
almost anything and eventually what you

4166
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:47,840
almost anything and eventually what you
 

4167
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,379
almost anything and eventually what you
develop is this take our workers and

4168
01:23:50,379 --> 01:23:50,389
develop is this take our workers and
 

4169
01:23:50,389 --> 01:23:53,950
develop is this take our workers and
attack because the the create assignment

4170
01:23:53,950 --> 01:23:53,960
attack because the the create assignment
 

4171
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:56,049
attack because the the create assignment
issue in Arad is really really hard I do

4172
01:23:56,049 --> 01:23:56,059
issue in Arad is really really hard I do
 

4173
01:23:56,059 --> 01:23:57,910
issue in Arad is really really hard I do
believe we could do better and that's

4174
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
believe we could do better and that's
 

4175
01:23:57,920 --> 01:23:59,919
believe we could do better and that's
maybe a research challenge for the

4176
01:23:59,919 --> 01:23:59,929
maybe a research challenge for the
 

4177
01:23:59,929 --> 01:24:03,100
maybe a research challenge for the
future but yeah even even in StarCraft

4178
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:03,110
future but yeah even even in StarCraft
 

4179
01:24:03,110 --> 01:24:05,620
future but yeah even even in StarCraft
the sequences are maybe a thousand which

4180
01:24:05,620 --> 01:24:05,630
the sequences are maybe a thousand which
 

4181
01:24:05,630 --> 01:24:08,470
the sequences are maybe a thousand which
I believe there is within the realm of

4182
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:08,480
I believe there is within the realm of
 

4183
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:10,810
I believe there is within the realm of
what transformers can do yeah I guess

4184
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:10,820
what transformers can do yeah I guess
 

4185
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:12,580
what transformers can do yeah I guess
the difference between Starcraft and go

4186
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:12,590
the difference between Starcraft and go
 

4187
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:16,660
the difference between Starcraft and go
is in go and chest stuff starts

4188
01:24:16,660 --> 01:24:16,670
is in go and chest stuff starts
 

4189
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:18,490
is in go and chest stuff starts
happening right away right so there's

4190
01:24:18,490 --> 01:24:18,500
happening right away right so there's
 

4191
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:22,120
happening right away right so there's
not yeah it's pretty easy to self play

4192
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:22,130
not yeah it's pretty easy to self play
 

4193
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:24,100
not yeah it's pretty easy to self play
not easy but to sulfa is possible to

4194
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:24,110
not easy but to sulfa is possible to
 

4195
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:25,600
not easy but to sulfa is possible to
develop reasonable strategy as quickly

4196
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:25,610
develop reasonable strategy as quickly
 

4197
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:28,060
develop reasonable strategy as quickly
as opposed to Starcraft meaning go

4198
01:24:28,060 --> 01:24:28,070
as opposed to Starcraft meaning go
 

4199
01:24:28,070 --> 01:24:31,419
as opposed to Starcraft meaning go
there's only 400 actions but one action

4200
01:24:31,419 --> 01:24:31,429
there's only 400 actions but one action
 

4201
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:34,089
there's only 400 actions but one action
is what people would call the god action

4202
01:24:34,089 --> 01:24:34,099
is what people would call the god action
 

4203
01:24:34,099 --> 01:24:37,810
is what people would call the god action
that would be if you had expanded the

4204
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:37,820
that would be if you had expanded the
 

4205
01:24:37,820 --> 01:24:39,520
that would be if you had expanded the
whole search tree that's the best action

4206
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:39,530
whole search tree that's the best action
 

4207
01:24:39,530 --> 01:24:41,589
whole search tree that's the best action
if you did minimax or whatever algorithm

4208
01:24:41,589 --> 01:24:41,599
if you did minimax or whatever algorithm
 

4209
01:24:41,599 --> 01:24:43,000
if you did minimax or whatever algorithm
you would do if you had the

4210
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:43,010
you would do if you had the
 

4211
01:24:43,010 --> 01:24:44,570
you would do if you had the
computational capacity

4212
01:24:44,570 --> 01:24:44,580
computational capacity
 

4213
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:48,650
computational capacity
but in StarCraft the 400 is miniscule

4214
01:24:48,650 --> 01:24:48,660
but in StarCraft the 400 is miniscule
 

4215
01:24:48,660 --> 01:24:50,900
but in StarCraft the 400 is miniscule
like a in 400 you don't even like you

4216
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:50,910
like a in 400 you don't even like you
 

4217
01:24:50,910 --> 01:24:52,580
like a in 400 you don't even like you
you couldn't even click on the pixels

4218
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:52,590
you couldn't even click on the pixels
 

4219
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:55,310
you couldn't even click on the pixels
around a unit right so I think the

4220
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:55,320
around a unit right so I think the
 

4221
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,470
around a unit right so I think the
problem there is in terms of action

4222
01:24:57,470 --> 01:24:57,480
problem there is in terms of action
 

4223
01:24:57,480 --> 01:25:02,690
problem there is in terms of action
space size is way harder so and that

4224
01:25:02,690 --> 01:25:02,700
space size is way harder so and that
 

4225
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,760
space size is way harder so and that
surge is impossible so there's quite a

4226
01:25:04,760 --> 01:25:04,770
surge is impossible so there's quite a
 

4227
01:25:04,770 --> 01:25:07,210
surge is impossible so there's quite a
few challenges indeed that make this

4228
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:07,220
few challenges indeed that make this
 

4229
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:09,830
few challenges indeed that make this
kind of a step step up in terms of

4230
01:25:09,830 --> 01:25:09,840
kind of a step step up in terms of
 

4231
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:11,390
kind of a step step up in terms of
machine learning for humans

4232
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:11,400
machine learning for humans
 

4233
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,730
machine learning for humans
maybe they playing Starcraft it seems

4234
01:25:13,730 --> 01:25:13,740
maybe they playing Starcraft it seems
 

4235
01:25:13,740 --> 01:25:16,010
maybe they playing Starcraft it seems
more intuitive because it's looks real I

4236
01:25:16,010 --> 01:25:16,020
more intuitive because it's looks real I
 

4237
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:17,450
more intuitive because it's looks real I
mean you know like the graphics and

4238
01:25:17,450 --> 01:25:17,460
mean you know like the graphics and
 

4239
01:25:17,460 --> 01:25:18,500
mean you know like the graphics and
everything moves smoothly

4240
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:18,510
everything moves smoothly
 

4241
01:25:18,510 --> 01:25:20,600
everything moves smoothly
whereas I I don't know how to come in go

4242
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:20,610
whereas I I don't know how to come in go
 

4243
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:22,310
whereas I I don't know how to come in go
is a game that I wouldn't really mean to

4244
01:25:22,310 --> 01:25:22,320
is a game that I wouldn't really mean to
 

4245
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,200
is a game that I wouldn't really mean to
study it feels quite complicated but for

4246
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,210
study it feels quite complicated but for
 

4247
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:26,450
study it feels quite complicated but for
machines kind of maybe easier reverse

4248
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:26,460
machines kind of maybe easier reverse
 

4249
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:26,960
machines kind of maybe easier reverse
yes

4250
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:26,970
yes
 

4251
01:25:26,970 --> 01:25:28,850
yes
which shows you the gap actually between

4252
01:25:28,850 --> 01:25:28,860
which shows you the gap actually between
 

4253
01:25:28,860 --> 01:25:31,340
which shows you the gap actually between
deep learning and however the heck our

4254
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:31,350
deep learning and however the heck our
 

4255
01:25:31,350 --> 01:25:35,090
deep learning and however the heck our
brains work so you developed a lot of

4256
01:25:35,090 --> 01:25:35,100
brains work so you developed a lot of
 

4257
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:36,140
brains work so you developed a lot of
really interesting ideas it's

4258
01:25:36,140 --> 01:25:36,150
really interesting ideas it's
 

4259
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:37,940
really interesting ideas it's
interesting to just ask what's the

4260
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:37,950
interesting to just ask what's the
 

4261
01:25:37,950 --> 01:25:40,220
interesting to just ask what's the
what's your process of developing new

4262
01:25:40,220 --> 01:25:40,230
what's your process of developing new
 

4263
01:25:40,230 --> 01:25:40,880
what's your process of developing new
ideas

4264
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:40,890
ideas
 

4265
01:25:40,890 --> 01:25:43,010
ideas
do you like brainstorming with others do

4266
01:25:43,010 --> 01:25:43,020
do you like brainstorming with others do
 

4267
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:47,480
do you like brainstorming with others do
you like thinking alone do you like like

4268
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:47,490
you like thinking alone do you like like
 

4269
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:49,550
you like thinking alone do you like like
was it eating good fellow said he came

4270
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:49,560
was it eating good fellow said he came
 

4271
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:52,970
was it eating good fellow said he came
up with Gans after a few beers right he

4272
01:25:52,970 --> 01:25:52,980
up with Gans after a few beers right he
 

4273
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,620
up with Gans after a few beers right he
thinks beers are essential yeah coming

4274
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:54,630
thinks beers are essential yeah coming
 

4275
01:25:54,630 --> 01:25:56,930
thinks beers are essential yeah coming
up with new ideas we had beers to decide

4276
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:56,940
up with new ideas we had beers to decide
 

4277
01:25:56,940 --> 01:25:59,150
up with new ideas we had beers to decide
to play another game game of Starcraft

4278
01:25:59,150 --> 01:25:59,160
to play another game game of Starcraft
 

4279
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,210
to play another game game of Starcraft
after a week so it's really similar to

4280
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:02,220
after a week so it's really similar to
 

4281
01:26:02,220 --> 01:26:04,550
after a week so it's really similar to
that story actually I explained this in

4282
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:04,560
that story actually I explained this in
 

4283
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,680
that story actually I explained this in
a in a deep mind retreat and I said this

4284
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:06,690
a in a deep mind retreat and I said this
 

4285
01:26:06,690 --> 01:26:08,210
a in a deep mind retreat and I said this
is the same as the gun story I mean we

4286
01:26:08,210 --> 01:26:08,220
is the same as the gun story I mean we
 

4287
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:09,710
is the same as the gun story I mean we
were wearing a bar and we decided let's

4288
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:09,720
were wearing a bar and we decided let's
 

4289
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,240
were wearing a bar and we decided let's
play again next week and that's what

4290
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:11,250
play again next week and that's what
 

4291
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:12,860
play again next week and that's what
happened I feel like we're giving the

4292
01:26:12,860 --> 01:26:12,870
happened I feel like we're giving the
 

4293
01:26:12,870 --> 01:26:15,260
happened I feel like we're giving the
wrong message to young undergrads yeah

4294
01:26:15,260 --> 01:26:15,270
wrong message to young undergrads yeah
 

4295
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:17,570
wrong message to young undergrads yeah
but in general like yeah do you like

4296
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:17,580
but in general like yeah do you like
 

4297
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,250
but in general like yeah do you like
brainstorming do you like thinking alone

4298
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:19,260
brainstorming do you like thinking alone
 

4299
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,650
brainstorming do you like thinking alone
working stuff out and so I think I think

4300
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:21,660
working stuff out and so I think I think
 

4301
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:23,600
working stuff out and so I think I think
throughout the years also things changed

4302
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:23,610
throughout the years also things changed
 

4303
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:27,380
throughout the years also things changed
right so initially I was very fortunate

4304
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:27,390
right so initially I was very fortunate
 

4305
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:31,490
right so initially I was very fortunate
to be with great minds like Geoff Hinton

4306
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:31,500
to be with great minds like Geoff Hinton
 

4307
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:35,150
to be with great minds like Geoff Hinton
Jeff Dean Ilya sutskever I was really

4308
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:35,160
Jeff Dean Ilya sutskever I was really
 

4309
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:36,860
Jeff Dean Ilya sutskever I was really
fortunate to join brain at a very good

4310
01:26:36,860 --> 01:26:36,870
fortunate to join brain at a very good
 

4311
01:26:36,870 --> 01:26:40,220
fortunate to join brain at a very good
time so at that point it ideas I was

4312
01:26:40,220 --> 01:26:40,230
time so at that point it ideas I was
 

4313
01:26:40,230 --> 01:26:41,840
time so at that point it ideas I was
just kind of brainstorming with my

4314
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:41,850
just kind of brainstorming with my
 

4315
01:26:41,850 --> 01:26:44,720
just kind of brainstorming with my
colleagues and learned a lot and keep

4316
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:44,730
colleagues and learned a lot and keep
 

4317
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:46,490
colleagues and learned a lot and keep
learning is actually something you

4318
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:46,500
learning is actually something you
 

4319
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,290
learning is actually something you
should never stop doing right so

4320
01:26:48,290 --> 01:26:48,300
should never stop doing right so
 

4321
01:26:48,300 --> 01:26:51,440
should never stop doing right so
learning implies reading papers and also

4322
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:51,450
learning implies reading papers and also
 

4323
01:26:51,450 --> 01:26:53,360
learning implies reading papers and also
these casting ideas with others it's

4324
01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:53,370
these casting ideas with others it's
 

4325
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:55,670
these casting ideas with others it's
very hard at some point to not

4326
01:26:55,670 --> 01:26:55,680
very hard at some point to not
 

4327
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:57,890
very hard at some point to not
communicate that being reading

4328
01:26:57,890 --> 01:26:57,900
communicate that being reading
 

4329
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,689
communicate that being reading
paper forms from someone or actually

4330
01:26:59,689 --> 01:26:59,699
paper forms from someone or actually
 

4331
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:03,320
paper forms from someone or actually
discussing right so definitely that

4332
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:03,330
discussing right so definitely that
 

4333
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:05,270
discussing right so definitely that
communication aspect needs to be there

4334
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:05,280
communication aspect needs to be there
 

4335
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:09,729
communication aspect needs to be there
whether it's written or oral nowadays

4336
01:27:09,729 --> 01:27:09,739
whether it's written or oral nowadays
 

4337
01:27:09,739 --> 01:27:12,169
whether it's written or oral nowadays
I'm also trying to be a bit more

4338
01:27:12,169 --> 01:27:12,179
I'm also trying to be a bit more
 

4339
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:15,770
I'm also trying to be a bit more
strategic about what research to do so I

4340
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:15,780
strategic about what research to do so I
 

4341
01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,990
strategic about what research to do so I
was describing a little bit this sort of

4342
01:27:17,990 --> 01:27:18,000
was describing a little bit this sort of
 

4343
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,689
was describing a little bit this sort of
tension between research for the sake of

4344
01:27:20,689 --> 01:27:20,699
tension between research for the sake of
 

4345
01:27:20,699 --> 01:27:22,700
tension between research for the sake of
research and then you have on the other

4346
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:22,710
research and then you have on the other
 

4347
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,620
research and then you have on the other
hand applications that can drive the

4348
01:27:24,620 --> 01:27:24,630
hand applications that can drive the
 

4349
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:27,200
hand applications that can drive the
research right and honestly the formula

4350
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:27,210
research right and honestly the formula
 

4351
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:30,169
research right and honestly the formula
that has worked best for me is just find

4352
01:27:30,169 --> 01:27:30,179
that has worked best for me is just find
 

4353
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:33,470
that has worked best for me is just find
a hard problem and then try to see how

4354
01:27:33,470 --> 01:27:33,480
a hard problem and then try to see how
 

4355
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,540
a hard problem and then try to see how
research fits into it how it doesn't fit

4356
01:27:35,540 --> 01:27:35,550
research fits into it how it doesn't fit
 

4357
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,970
research fits into it how it doesn't fit
into it and then you must innovate so I

4358
01:27:37,970 --> 01:27:37,980
into it and then you must innovate so I
 

4359
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:41,600
into it and then you must innovate so I
think machine translation drove sequence

4360
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:41,610
think machine translation drove sequence
 

4361
01:27:41,610 --> 01:27:44,890
think machine translation drove sequence
to sequence then maybe like learning

4362
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:44,900
to sequence then maybe like learning
 

4363
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:47,300
to sequence then maybe like learning
algorithms that had to like

4364
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:47,310
algorithms that had to like
 

4365
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:48,979
algorithms that had to like
combinatorial algorithms led to pointer

4366
01:27:48,979 --> 01:27:48,989
combinatorial algorithms led to pointer
 

4367
01:27:48,989 --> 01:27:52,610
combinatorial algorithms led to pointer
networks Starcraft led to really scaling

4368
01:27:52,610 --> 01:27:52,620
networks Starcraft led to really scaling
 

4369
01:27:52,620 --> 01:27:54,470
networks Starcraft led to really scaling
a permutation learning and the Alpha

4370
01:27:54,470 --> 01:27:54,480
a permutation learning and the Alpha
 

4371
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,810
a permutation learning and the Alpha
star league so that's been a formula

4372
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:56,820
star league so that's been a formula
 

4373
01:27:56,820 --> 01:27:59,090
star league so that's been a formula
that I personally like but the other one

4374
01:27:59,090 --> 01:27:59,100
that I personally like but the other one
 

4375
01:27:59,100 --> 01:28:01,910
that I personally like but the other one
is also about it and I seen it succeed a

4376
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:01,920
is also about it and I seen it succeed a
 

4377
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:03,979
is also about it and I seen it succeed a
lot of the times where you just want to

4378
01:28:03,979 --> 01:28:03,989
lot of the times where you just want to
 

4379
01:28:03,989 --> 01:28:07,220
lot of the times where you just want to
investigate model-based RL as a kind of

4380
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:07,230
investigate model-based RL as a kind of
 

4381
01:28:07,230 --> 01:28:09,740
investigate model-based RL as a kind of
a research topic and then you must then

4382
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:09,750
a research topic and then you must then
 

4383
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,110
a research topic and then you must then
start to think well how are the tests

4384
01:28:12,110 --> 01:28:12,120
start to think well how are the tests
 

4385
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,419
start to think well how are the tests
how are you going to test these ideas

4386
01:28:13,419 --> 01:28:13,429
how are you going to test these ideas
 

4387
01:28:13,429 --> 01:28:15,669
how are you going to test these ideas
you need to kind of a minimal

4388
01:28:15,669 --> 01:28:15,679
you need to kind of a minimal
 

4389
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:18,200
you need to kind of a minimal
environment to try things you need to

4390
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:18,210
environment to try things you need to
 

4391
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:19,850
environment to try things you need to
read a lot of papers and so on and

4392
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:19,860
read a lot of papers and so on and
 

4393
01:28:19,860 --> 01:28:21,350
read a lot of papers and so on and
that's also very fun to do and something

4394
01:28:21,350 --> 01:28:21,360
that's also very fun to do and something
 

4395
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:24,439
that's also very fun to do and something
I've also done quite a few times both at

4396
01:28:24,439 --> 01:28:24,449
I've also done quite a few times both at
 

4397
01:28:24,449 --> 01:28:26,510
I've also done quite a few times both at
brain at the mine and obviously as as a

4398
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:26,520
brain at the mine and obviously as as a
 

4399
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,939
brain at the mine and obviously as as a
PhD so so I think besides that the ideas

4400
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:31,949
PhD so so I think besides that the ideas
 

4401
01:28:31,949 --> 01:28:34,070
PhD so so I think besides that the ideas
and discussions I think it's important

4402
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:34,080
and discussions I think it's important
 

4403
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,490
and discussions I think it's important
also because you start sort of guiding

4404
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:37,500
also because you start sort of guiding
 

4405
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:40,700
also because you start sort of guiding
not only your own goals but other

4406
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:40,710
not only your own goals but other
 

4407
01:28:40,710 --> 01:28:43,850
not only your own goals but other
people's goes to the next breakthrough

4408
01:28:43,850 --> 01:28:43,860
people's goes to the next breakthrough
 

4409
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:45,860
people's goes to the next breakthrough
so you you must really kind of

4410
01:28:45,860 --> 01:28:45,870
so you you must really kind of
 

4411
01:28:45,870 --> 01:28:48,380
so you you must really kind of
understand these you know feasibility

4412
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:48,390
understand these you know feasibility
 

4413
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:50,330
understand these you know feasibility
also as we were discussing before right

4414
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:50,340
also as we were discussing before right
 

4415
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,820
also as we were discussing before right
whether whether these domain is ready to

4416
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:52,830
whether whether these domain is ready to
 

4417
01:28:52,830 --> 01:28:54,680
whether whether these domain is ready to
be tackled or not and you don't want to

4418
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:54,690
be tackled or not and you don't want to
 

4419
01:28:54,690 --> 01:28:56,450
be tackled or not and you don't want to
be too early you obviously don't want to

4420
01:28:56,450 --> 01:28:56,460
be too early you obviously don't want to
 

4421
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:57,979
be too early you obviously don't want to
be too late so it's it's really

4422
01:28:57,979 --> 01:28:57,989
be too late so it's it's really
 

4423
01:28:57,989 --> 01:29:00,020
be too late so it's it's really
interesting and this is a strategic

4424
01:29:00,020 --> 01:29:00,030
interesting and this is a strategic
 

4425
01:29:00,030 --> 01:29:02,540
interesting and this is a strategic
component of research which I think as a

4426
01:29:02,540 --> 01:29:02,550
component of research which I think as a
 

4427
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:05,030
component of research which I think as a
grad student I just had no idea to you

4428
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,040
grad student I just had no idea to you
 

4429
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,010
grad student I just had no idea to you
know I just read papers and discussed

4430
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:07,020
know I just read papers and discussed
 

4431
01:29:07,020 --> 01:29:08,600
know I just read papers and discussed
ideas and I think this has been maybe

4432
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:08,610
ideas and I think this has been maybe
 

4433
01:29:08,610 --> 01:29:11,270
ideas and I think this has been maybe
the major change and I recommend

4434
01:29:11,270 --> 01:29:11,280
the major change and I recommend
 

4435
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:14,090
the major change and I recommend
people kind of feed forward to success

4436
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:14,100
people kind of feed forward to success
 

4437
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:15,860
people kind of feed forward to success
how it looks like and try to backtrack

4438
01:29:15,860 --> 01:29:15,870
how it looks like and try to backtrack
 

4439
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:17,960
how it looks like and try to backtrack
other than just kind of looking out

4440
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:17,970
other than just kind of looking out
 

4441
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,340
other than just kind of looking out
these looks cool these looks cool and

4442
01:29:19,340 --> 01:29:19,350
these looks cool these looks cool and
 

4443
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:21,200
these looks cool these looks cool and
then you do a bit of random work which

4444
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:21,210
then you do a bit of random work which
 

4445
01:29:21,210 --> 01:29:22,910
then you do a bit of random work which
sometimes you stumble upon some

4446
01:29:22,910 --> 01:29:22,920
sometimes you stumble upon some
 

4447
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:25,220
sometimes you stumble upon some
interesting things but in general it's

4448
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:25,230
interesting things but in general it's
 

4449
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:27,980
interesting things but in general it's
it's also good to plan a bit yeah I like

4450
01:29:27,980 --> 01:29:27,990
it's also good to plan a bit yeah I like
 

4451
01:29:27,990 --> 01:29:28,510
it's also good to plan a bit yeah I like
it

4452
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:28,520
it
 

4453
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,800
it
especially like your approach I've taken

4454
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:30,810
especially like your approach I've taken
 

4455
01:29:30,810 --> 01:29:32,840
especially like your approach I've taken
a really hard problem stepping right in

4456
01:29:32,840 --> 01:29:32,850
a really hard problem stepping right in
 

4457
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:34,850
a really hard problem stepping right in
and then being super skeptical about

4458
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:34,860
and then being super skeptical about
 

4459
01:29:34,860 --> 01:29:38,900
and then being super skeptical about
yeah being robbed I mean there's a

4460
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:38,910
yeah being robbed I mean there's a
 

4461
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:41,320
yeah being robbed I mean there's a
balance of both right there's a silly

4462
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:41,330
balance of both right there's a silly
 

4463
01:29:41,330 --> 01:29:45,880
balance of both right there's a silly
optimism and and a critical sort of

4464
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:45,890
optimism and and a critical sort of
 

4465
01:29:45,890 --> 01:29:48,740
optimism and and a critical sort of
skepticism that's good to balance which

4466
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:48,750
skepticism that's good to balance which
 

4467
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:49,940
skepticism that's good to balance which
is why it's good to have a team of

4468
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:49,950
is why it's good to have a team of
 

4469
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:53,000
is why it's good to have a team of
people that that balance that you don't

4470
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:53,010
people that that balance that you don't
 

4471
01:29:53,010 --> 01:29:54,470
people that that balance that you don't
do that on your own you have both

4472
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:54,480
do that on your own you have both
 

4473
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,680
do that on your own you have both
mentors that have seen or you obviously

4474
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:57,690
mentors that have seen or you obviously
 

4475
01:29:57,690 --> 01:30:00,290
mentors that have seen or you obviously
wanna chat and discuss whether it's the

4476
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:00,300
wanna chat and discuss whether it's the
 

4477
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:03,830
wanna chat and discuss whether it's the
right time I mean Demi's came in 2014

4478
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:03,840
right time I mean Demi's came in 2014
 

4479
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:06,020
right time I mean Demi's came in 2014
and he said maybe in a bit we'll do

4480
01:30:06,020 --> 01:30:06,030
and he said maybe in a bit we'll do
 

4481
01:30:06,030 --> 01:30:08,900
and he said maybe in a bit we'll do
starcraft and maybe he knew and that's

4482
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:08,910
starcraft and maybe he knew and that's
 

4483
01:30:08,910 --> 01:30:10,850
starcraft and maybe he knew and that's
and I'm just following his lead which is

4484
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:10,860
and I'm just following his lead which is
 

4485
01:30:10,860 --> 01:30:12,530
and I'm just following his lead which is
great because he's he's brilliant right

4486
01:30:12,530 --> 01:30:12,540
great because he's he's brilliant right
 

4487
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,990
great because he's he's brilliant right
so these these things are obviously

4488
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:15,000
so these these things are obviously
 

4489
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,400
so these these things are obviously
quite important that you wanna be

4490
01:30:19,400 --> 01:30:19,410
quite important that you wanna be
 

4491
01:30:19,410 --> 01:30:21,650
quite important that you wanna be
surrounded by people who you know are

4492
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:21,660
surrounded by people who you know are
 

4493
01:30:21,660 --> 01:30:23,660
surrounded by people who you know are
diverse they they have their knowledge

4494
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:23,670
diverse they they have their knowledge
 

4495
01:30:23,670 --> 01:30:26,900
diverse they they have their knowledge
there's also important too I mean I I've

4496
01:30:26,900 --> 01:30:26,910
there's also important too I mean I I've
 

4497
01:30:26,910 --> 01:30:29,440
there's also important too I mean I I've
learned a lot from people who actually

4498
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:29,450
learned a lot from people who actually
 

4499
01:30:29,450 --> 01:30:32,180
learned a lot from people who actually
have an idea that I might not think it's

4500
01:30:32,180 --> 01:30:32,190
have an idea that I might not think it's
 

4501
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:34,400
have an idea that I might not think it's
good but if I give them the space to try

4502
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:34,410
good but if I give them the space to try
 

4503
01:30:34,410 --> 01:30:36,290
good but if I give them the space to try
it I've been proven wrong many many

4504
01:30:36,290 --> 01:30:36,300
it I've been proven wrong many many
 

4505
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:37,910
it I've been proven wrong many many
times as well so that's that's great

4506
01:30:37,910 --> 01:30:37,920
times as well so that's that's great
 

4507
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:41,120
times as well so that's that's great
it's I think it's your colleagues are

4508
01:30:41,120 --> 01:30:41,130
it's I think it's your colleagues are
 

4509
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:43,340
it's I think it's your colleagues are
more important than yourself I think so

4510
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:43,350
more important than yourself I think so
 

4511
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:47,000
more important than yourself I think so
sure now let's real quick talk about

4512
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:47,010
sure now let's real quick talk about
 

4513
01:30:47,010 --> 01:30:49,820
sure now let's real quick talk about
another impossible problem AGI right

4514
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:49,830
another impossible problem AGI right
 

4515
01:30:49,830 --> 01:30:51,590
another impossible problem AGI right
what do you think it takes to build a

4516
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:51,600
what do you think it takes to build a
 

4517
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:53,390
what do you think it takes to build a
system that's human level intelligence

4518
01:30:53,390 --> 01:30:53,400
system that's human level intelligence
 

4519
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:55,160
system that's human level intelligence
we talked a little bit about the

4520
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:55,170
we talked a little bit about the
 

4521
01:30:55,170 --> 01:30:56,900
we talked a little bit about the
Tauranga stark after all these have

4522
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:56,910
Tauranga stark after all these have
 

4523
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,180
Tauranga stark after all these have
echoes of general intelligence but if

4524
01:30:59,180 --> 01:30:59,190
echoes of general intelligence but if
 

4525
01:30:59,190 --> 01:31:01,700
echoes of general intelligence but if
you think about just something that you

4526
01:31:01,700 --> 01:31:01,710
you think about just something that you
 

4527
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:03,760
you think about just something that you
would sit back and say wow this is

4528
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:03,770
would sit back and say wow this is
 

4529
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:06,920
would sit back and say wow this is
really something that resembles human

4530
01:31:06,920 --> 01:31:06,930
really something that resembles human
 

4531
01:31:06,930 --> 01:31:08,270
really something that resembles human
level intelligence what do you think it

4532
01:31:08,270 --> 01:31:08,280
level intelligence what do you think it
 

4533
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:12,820
level intelligence what do you think it
takes to build that so I find that AGI

4534
01:31:12,820 --> 01:31:12,830
takes to build that so I find that AGI
 

4535
01:31:12,830 --> 01:31:16,360
takes to build that so I find that AGI
oftentimes is maybe not by well defined

4536
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:16,370
oftentimes is maybe not by well defined
 

4537
01:31:16,370 --> 01:31:19,430
oftentimes is maybe not by well defined
so what I'm trying to then come up with

4538
01:31:19,430 --> 01:31:19,440
so what I'm trying to then come up with
 

4539
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,480
so what I'm trying to then come up with
for myself is what would be a result

4540
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:22,490
for myself is what would be a result
 

4541
01:31:22,490 --> 01:31:24,860
for myself is what would be a result
look like that you would

4542
01:31:24,860 --> 01:31:24,870
look like that you would
 

4543
01:31:24,870 --> 01:31:26,770
look like that you would
start to believe that you would have

4544
01:31:26,770 --> 01:31:26,780
start to believe that you would have
 

4545
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:29,210
start to believe that you would have
agents or neural nets that no longer

4546
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:29,220
agents or neural nets that no longer
 

4547
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,400
agents or neural nets that no longer
sort of over feet to a single task right

4548
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:31,410
sort of over feet to a single task right
 

4549
01:31:31,410 --> 01:31:36,440
sort of over feet to a single task right
but actually kind of learn the skill of

4550
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:36,450
but actually kind of learn the skill of
 

4551
01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:39,290
but actually kind of learn the skill of
learning so to speak and that actually

4552
01:31:39,290 --> 01:31:39,300
learning so to speak and that actually
 

4553
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,630
learning so to speak and that actually
is a field that I am fascinated by which

4554
01:31:41,630 --> 01:31:41,640
is a field that I am fascinated by which
 

4555
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:44,060
is a field that I am fascinated by which
is the learning to learn or meta

4556
01:31:44,060 --> 01:31:44,070
is the learning to learn or meta
 

4557
01:31:44,070 --> 01:31:46,400
is the learning to learn or meta
learning which is about no longer

4558
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:46,410
learning which is about no longer
 

4559
01:31:46,410 --> 01:31:49,220
learning which is about no longer
learning about a single domain so you

4560
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:49,230
learning about a single domain so you
 

4561
01:31:49,230 --> 01:31:50,960
learning about a single domain so you
can think about the learning algorithm

4562
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:50,970
can think about the learning algorithm
 

4563
01:31:50,970 --> 01:31:53,270
can think about the learning algorithm
itself is general right so the same

4564
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:53,280
itself is general right so the same
 

4565
01:31:53,280 --> 01:31:56,210
itself is general right so the same
formula we applied for alpha star or

4566
01:31:56,210 --> 01:31:56,220
formula we applied for alpha star or
 

4567
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,100
formula we applied for alpha star or
Starcraft we can now apply to kind of

4568
01:31:58,100 --> 01:31:58,110
Starcraft we can now apply to kind of
 

4569
01:31:58,110 --> 01:32:00,050
Starcraft we can now apply to kind of
almost any video game or you could apply

4570
01:32:00,050 --> 01:32:00,060
almost any video game or you could apply
 

4571
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:03,710
almost any video game or you could apply
to many other problems and domains but

4572
01:32:03,710 --> 01:32:03,720
to many other problems and domains but
 

4573
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:05,600
to many other problems and domains but
the algorithm is what's kind of

4574
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:05,610
the algorithm is what's kind of
 

4575
01:32:05,610 --> 01:32:08,060
the algorithm is what's kind of
generalizing but the neural network the

4576
01:32:08,060 --> 01:32:08,070
generalizing but the neural network the
 

4577
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:10,490
generalizing but the neural network the
weights those weights are useless even

4578
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:10,500
weights those weights are useless even
 

4579
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,440
weights those weights are useless even
to play another race right I train a

4580
01:32:12,440 --> 01:32:12,450
to play another race right I train a
 

4581
01:32:12,450 --> 01:32:14,660
to play another race right I train a
network to play very well at Protoss vs.

4582
01:32:14,660 --> 01:32:14,670
network to play very well at Protoss vs.
 

4583
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:16,550
network to play very well at Protoss vs.
Protoss I need to throw away those

4584
01:32:16,550 --> 01:32:16,560
Protoss I need to throw away those
 

4585
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,190
Protoss I need to throw away those
weights if I want to play now

4586
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:19,200
weights if I want to play now
 

4587
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:22,010
weights if I want to play now
terran vs terran i would need to retrain

4588
01:32:22,010 --> 01:32:22,020
terran vs terran i would need to retrain
 

4589
01:32:22,020 --> 01:32:24,170
terran vs terran i would need to retrain
a network from scratch with the same

4590
01:32:24,170 --> 01:32:24,180
a network from scratch with the same
 

4591
01:32:24,180 --> 01:32:26,030
a network from scratch with the same
algorithm that's beautiful

4592
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:26,040
algorithm that's beautiful
 

4593
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,740
algorithm that's beautiful
but the network itself will not be

4594
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:27,750
but the network itself will not be
 

4595
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,440
but the network itself will not be
useful so I think when I if I see an

4596
01:32:30,440 --> 01:32:30,450
useful so I think when I if I see an
 

4597
01:32:30,450 --> 01:32:34,820
useful so I think when I if I see an
approach that can observe or start

4598
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:34,830
approach that can observe or start
 

4599
01:32:34,830 --> 01:32:38,090
approach that can observe or start
solving new problems without the need to

4600
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:38,100
solving new problems without the need to
 

4601
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,640
solving new problems without the need to
kind of restart the process I think that

4602
01:32:40,640 --> 01:32:40,650
kind of restart the process I think that
 

4603
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:43,880
kind of restart the process I think that
to me would be a nice way to define some

4604
01:32:43,880 --> 01:32:43,890
to me would be a nice way to define some
 

4605
01:32:43,890 --> 01:32:47,090
to me would be a nice way to define some
form of AGI again I don't know the grand

01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:47,100
form of AGI again I don't know the grand
 

4607
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:48,950
form of AGI again I don't know the grand
views like age I mean so it should

4608
01:32:48,950 --> 01:32:48,960
views like age I mean so it should
 

4609
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:50,810
views like age I mean so it should
Turing test nice or before AGI I mean I

4610
01:32:50,810 --> 01:32:50,820
Turing test nice or before AGI I mean I
 

4611
01:32:50,820 --> 01:32:53,060
Turing test nice or before AGI I mean I
don't know I think I think concretely I

4612
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:53,070
don't know I think I think concretely I
 

4613
01:32:53,070 --> 01:32:55,880

would like to see clearly that meta

4614
01:32:55,880 --> 01:32:55,890
would like to see clearly that meta
 

4615
01:32:55,890 --> 01:32:58,100
would like to see clearly that meta
learning happened meaning there there is

4616
01:32:58,100 --> 01:32:58,110
learning happened meaning there there is
 

4617
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:01,730

an architecture or network that as it

4618
01:33:01,730 --> 01:33:01,740
an architecture or network that as it
 

4619
01:33:01,740 --> 01:33:03,890
an architecture or network that as it
sees new new problem or new data it

4620
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:03,900
sees new new problem or new data it
 

4621
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:07,430
sees new new problem or new data it
solves it and to make it kind of a

4622
01:33:07,430 --> 01:33:07,440
solves it and to make it kind of a
 

4623
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,470
solves it and to make it kind of a
benchmark it should solve it at the same

4624
01:33:09,470 --> 01:33:09,480
benchmark it should solve it at the same
 

4625
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:11,510
benchmark it should solve it at the same
speed that we do solve new problems when

4626
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:11,520
speed that we do solve new problems when
 

4627
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:13,760
speed that we do solve new problems when
I define your new object and you have to

4628
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:13,770
I define your new object and you have to
 

4629
01:33:13,770 --> 01:33:15,560
I define your new object and you have to
recognize it when I when you start

4630
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:15,570
recognize it when I when you start
 

4631
01:33:15,570 --> 01:33:16,940
recognize it when I when you start
playing a new game you played all the

4632
01:33:16,940 --> 01:33:16,950
playing a new game you played all the
 

4633
01:33:16,950 --> 01:33:18,830
playing a new game you played all the
times but now you play a new Atari game

4634
01:33:18,830 --> 01:33:18,840
times but now you play a new Atari game
 

4635
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,350
times but now you play a new Atari game
well you you're gonna be pretty quickly

4636
01:33:21,350 --> 01:33:21,360
well you you're gonna be pretty quickly
 

4637
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:23,570
well you you're gonna be pretty quickly
pretty good at the game so that's

4638
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:23,580
pretty good at the game so that's
 

4639
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:26,300
pretty good at the game so that's
perhaps what's the domain and what's the

4640
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:26,310
perhaps what's the domain and what's the
 

4641
01:33:26,310 --> 01:33:28,070
perhaps what's the domain and what's the
exact benchmark is a bit difficult I

4642
01:33:28,070 --> 01:33:28,080
exact benchmark is a bit difficult I
 

4643
01:33:28,080 --> 01:33:29,990
exact benchmark is a bit difficult I
think as a community we might need to do

4644
01:33:29,990 --> 01:33:30,000
think as a community we might need to do
 

4645
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,060
think as a community we might need to do
some work to define it

4646
01:33:32,060 --> 01:33:32,070
some work to define it
 

4647
01:33:32,070 --> 01:33:34,910
some work to define it
but I think this first step I could see

4648
01:33:34,910 --> 01:33:34,920
but I think this first step I could see
 

4649
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:38,330
but I think this first step I could see
it happen relatively soon but then the

4650
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:38,340
it happen relatively soon but then the
 

4651
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:41,000
it happen relatively soon but then the
whole what a GI means and so on I am a

4652
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:41,010
whole what a GI means and so on I am a
 

4653
01:33:41,010 --> 01:33:43,399
whole what a GI means and so on I am a
bit more confused about what I think

4654
01:33:43,399 --> 01:33:43,409
bit more confused about what I think
 

4655
01:33:43,409 --> 01:33:45,049
bit more confused about what I think
people mean different things there's an

4656
01:33:45,049 --> 01:33:45,059
people mean different things there's an
 

4657
01:33:45,059 --> 01:33:50,779
people mean different things there's an
emotional psychological level that like

4658
01:33:50,779 --> 01:33:50,789
emotional psychological level that like
 

4659
01:33:50,789 --> 01:33:52,370
emotional psychological level that like
the even the Turing test passing the

4660
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:52,380
the even the Turing test passing the
 

4661
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:54,169
the even the Turing test passing the
Turing test is something that we just

4662
01:33:54,169 --> 01:33:54,179
Turing test is something that we just
 

4663
01:33:54,179 --> 01:33:56,089
Turing test is something that we just
passed judgment on human beings what it

4664
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:56,099
passed judgment on human beings what it
 

4665
01:33:56,099 --> 01:34:02,270
passed judgment on human beings what it
means to be you know as a as a dog in a

4666
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:02,280
means to be you know as a as a dog in a
 

4667
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,850
means to be you know as a as a dog in a
GI system yeah like what level what does

4668
01:34:04,850 --> 01:34:04,860
GI system yeah like what level what does
 

4669
01:34:04,860 --> 01:34:07,609
GI system yeah like what level what does
it mean right yeah what does it mean but

4670
01:34:07,609 --> 01:34:07,619
it mean right yeah what does it mean but
 

4671
01:34:07,619 --> 01:34:09,410
it mean right yeah what does it mean but
I like the generalization and maybe as a

4672
01:34:09,410 --> 01:34:09,420
I like the generalization and maybe as a
 

4673
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:12,140
I like the generalization and maybe as a
community would converge towards a group

4674
01:34:12,140 --> 01:34:12,150
community would converge towards a group
 

4675
01:34:12,150 --> 01:34:13,790
community would converge towards a group
of domains that are sufficiently far

4676
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:13,800
of domains that are sufficiently far
 

4677
01:34:13,800 --> 01:34:15,890
of domains that are sufficiently far
away that would be really damn

4678
01:34:15,890 --> 01:34:15,900
away that would be really damn
 

4679
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:17,750
away that would be really damn
impressive if we're able to generalize

4680
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:17,760
impressive if we're able to generalize
 

4681
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,299
impressive if we're able to generalize
some perhaps not as close as Protoss and

4682
01:34:20,299 --> 01:34:20,309
some perhaps not as close as Protoss and
 

4683
01:34:20,309 --> 01:34:24,200
some perhaps not as close as Protoss and
Zerg but like Wikipedia step be a good

4684
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:24,210
Zerg but like Wikipedia step be a good
 

4685
01:34:24,210 --> 01:34:26,509
Zerg but like Wikipedia step be a good
stuff and then a really good step but

4686
01:34:26,509 --> 01:34:26,519
stuff and then a really good step but
 

4687
01:34:26,519 --> 01:34:28,549
stuff and then a really good step but
then then like Wickham Starcraft 2

4688
01:34:28,549 --> 01:34:28,559
then then like Wickham Starcraft 2
 

4689
01:34:28,559 --> 01:34:31,580
then then like Wickham Starcraft 2
Wikipedia yeah I'm back yeah that kind

4690
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:31,590
Wikipedia yeah I'm back yeah that kind
 

4691
01:34:31,590 --> 01:34:33,080
Wikipedia yeah I'm back yeah that kind
of thing and that that feels also quite

4692
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:33,090
of thing and that that feels also quite
 

4693
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:36,529
of thing and that that feels also quite
hard and far but I think there's as long

4694
01:34:36,529 --> 01:34:36,539
hard and far but I think there's as long
 

4695
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:38,479
hard and far but I think there's as long
as you put the benchmark out as we

4696
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:38,489
as you put the benchmark out as we
 

4697
01:34:38,489 --> 01:34:40,609
as you put the benchmark out as we
discovered for instance with image net

4698
01:34:40,609 --> 01:34:40,619
discovered for instance with image net
 

4699
01:34:40,619 --> 01:34:43,129
discovered for instance with image net
then tremendous progress can be had so I

4700
01:34:43,129 --> 01:34:43,139
then tremendous progress can be had so I
 

4701
01:34:43,139 --> 01:34:45,549
then tremendous progress can be had so I
think maybe there's a lack of benchmark

4702
01:34:45,549 --> 01:34:45,559
think maybe there's a lack of benchmark
 

4703
01:34:45,559 --> 01:34:48,049
think maybe there's a lack of benchmark
but I'm sure we'll find one and yeah a

4704
01:34:48,049 --> 01:34:48,059
but I'm sure we'll find one and yeah a
 

4705
01:34:48,059 --> 01:34:50,149
but I'm sure we'll find one and yeah a
community will will then work towards

4706
01:34:50,149 --> 01:34:50,159
community will will then work towards
 

4707
01:34:50,159 --> 01:34:54,620
community will will then work towards
that and then beyond what a GI might

4708
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:54,630
that and then beyond what a GI might
 

4709
01:34:54,630 --> 01:34:58,189
that and then beyond what a GI might
mean or would imply I really am hopeful

4710
01:34:58,189 --> 01:34:58,199
mean or would imply I really am hopeful
 

4711
01:34:58,199 --> 01:35:01,370
mean or would imply I really am hopeful
to see basically machine learning or AI

4712
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:01,380
to see basically machine learning or AI
 

4713
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:04,759
to see basically machine learning or AI
just scaling up and helping you know

4714
01:35:04,759 --> 01:35:04,769
just scaling up and helping you know
 

4715
01:35:04,769 --> 01:35:06,560
just scaling up and helping you know
people that might not have the resources

4716
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:06,570
people that might not have the resources
 

4717
01:35:06,570 --> 01:35:10,970
people that might not have the resources
to hire an assistant or that they might

4718
01:35:10,970 --> 01:35:10,980
to hire an assistant or that they might
 

4719
01:35:10,980 --> 01:35:12,529
to hire an assistant or that they might
not even know what the weather is like

4720
01:35:12,529 --> 01:35:12,539
not even know what the weather is like
 

4721
01:35:12,539 --> 01:35:15,439
not even know what the weather is like
but you know so I think there's in terms

4722
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:15,449
but you know so I think there's in terms
 

4723
01:35:15,449 --> 01:35:17,779
but you know so I think there's in terms
of the impact the positive impact of AI

4724
01:35:17,779 --> 01:35:17,789
of the impact the positive impact of AI
 

4725
01:35:17,789 --> 01:35:20,779
of the impact the positive impact of AI
I think that's maybe what we should also

4726
01:35:20,779 --> 01:35:20,789
I think that's maybe what we should also
 

4727
01:35:20,789 --> 01:35:22,790
I think that's maybe what we should also
not lose focus right the research

4728
01:35:22,790 --> 01:35:22,800
not lose focus right the research
 

4729
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,470
not lose focus right the research
community building AG I mean that's a

4730
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:24,480
community building AG I mean that's a
 

4731
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:26,959
community building AG I mean that's a
real nice girl but man I think the way

4732
01:35:26,959 --> 01:35:26,969
real nice girl but man I think the way
 

4733
01:35:26,969 --> 01:35:28,939
real nice girl but man I think the way
that deep mind puts it is and then use

4734
01:35:28,939 --> 01:35:28,949
that deep mind puts it is and then use
 

4735
01:35:28,949 --> 01:35:31,250
that deep mind puts it is and then use
it to solve everything else right so I

4736
01:35:31,250 --> 01:35:31,260
it to solve everything else right so I
 

4737
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:34,160
it to solve everything else right so I
think we should paralyze yeah we

4738
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:34,170
think we should paralyze yeah we
 

4739
01:35:34,170 --> 01:35:35,899
think we should paralyze yeah we
shouldn't forget about all the positive

4740
01:35:35,899 --> 01:35:35,909
shouldn't forget about all the positive
 

4741
01:35:35,909 --> 01:35:37,100
shouldn't forget about all the positive
things that are actually coming out of

4742
01:35:37,100 --> 01:35:37,110
things that are actually coming out of
 

4743
01:35:37,110 --> 01:35:39,250
things that are actually coming out of
it already and I are not going to be

4744
01:35:39,250 --> 01:35:39,260
it already and I are not going to be
 

4745
01:35:39,260 --> 01:35:42,669
it already and I are not going to be
coming out right but

4746
01:35:42,669 --> 01:35:42,679
coming out right but
 

4747
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:45,490
coming out right but
that I know let me ask relative the

4748
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:45,500
that I know let me ask relative the
 

4749
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:48,189
that I know let me ask relative the
popular perception do you have any worry

4750
01:35:48,189 --> 01:35:48,199
popular perception do you have any worry
 

4751
01:35:48,199 --> 01:35:49,750
popular perception do you have any worry
about the existential threat of

4752
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:49,760
about the existential threat of
 

4753
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,880
about the existential threat of
artificial intelligence in the near or

4754
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:51,890
artificial intelligence in the near or
 

4755
01:35:51,890 --> 01:35:55,330
artificial intelligence in the near or
far future that some people have I think

4756
01:35:55,330 --> 01:35:55,340
far future that some people have I think
 

4757
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:58,090
far future that some people have I think
I'm in the near future I'm I'm skeptical

4758
01:35:58,090 --> 01:35:58,100
I'm in the near future I'm I'm skeptical
 

4759
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,229
I'm in the near future I'm I'm skeptical
so I hope I'm not wrong but I'm I'm not

4760
01:36:01,229 --> 01:36:01,239
so I hope I'm not wrong but I'm I'm not
 

4761
01:36:01,239 --> 01:36:04,180
so I hope I'm not wrong but I'm I'm not
concerned but I I appreciate efforts

4762
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:04,190
concerned but I I appreciate efforts
 

4763
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:07,300
concerned but I I appreciate efforts
ongoing efforts and even like whole

4764
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:07,310
ongoing efforts and even like whole
 

4765
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:09,220
ongoing efforts and even like whole
research fields on AI safety emerging

4766
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:09,230
research fields on AI safety emerging
 

4767
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:10,810
research fields on AI safety emerging
and in conferences and so on I think

4768
01:36:10,810 --> 01:36:10,820
and in conferences and so on I think
 

4769
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:14,649
and in conferences and so on I think
that's great in the long term I really

4770
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:14,659
that's great in the long term I really
 

4771
01:36:14,659 --> 01:36:18,189
that's great in the long term I really
hope we just can simply have the

4772
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:18,199
hope we just can simply have the
 

4773
01:36:18,199 --> 01:36:20,229
hope we just can simply have the
benefits outweigh the potential dangers

4774
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:20,239
benefits outweigh the potential dangers
 

4775
01:36:20,239 --> 01:36:24,370
benefits outweigh the potential dangers
I am hopeful for that but also we must

4776
01:36:24,370 --> 01:36:24,380
I am hopeful for that but also we must
 

4777
01:36:24,380 --> 01:36:26,680
I am hopeful for that but also we must
remain vigilant to kind of monitor and

4778
01:36:26,680 --> 01:36:26,690
remain vigilant to kind of monitor and
 

4779
01:36:26,690 --> 01:36:28,810
remain vigilant to kind of monitor and
assess whether the trade-offs are are

4780
01:36:28,810 --> 01:36:28,820
assess whether the trade-offs are are
 

4781
01:36:28,820 --> 01:36:31,290
assess whether the trade-offs are are
there and and we have you know enough

4782
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:31,300
there and and we have you know enough
 

4783
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:34,899
there and and we have you know enough
also lead time to prevent or to redirect

4784
01:36:34,899 --> 01:36:34,909
also lead time to prevent or to redirect
 

4785
01:36:34,909 --> 01:36:37,930
also lead time to prevent or to redirect
our efforts if need be right so but I'm

4786
01:36:37,930 --> 01:36:37,940
our efforts if need be right so but I'm
 

4787
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:40,390
our efforts if need be right so but I'm
quite I'm quite optimistic about the

4788
01:36:40,390 --> 01:36:40,400
quite I'm quite optimistic about the
 

4789
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:43,660
quite I'm quite optimistic about the
technology and definitely more fearful

4790
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:43,670
technology and definitely more fearful
 

4791
01:36:43,670 --> 01:36:46,720
technology and definitely more fearful
of other threats in terms of planetary

4792
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:46,730
of other threats in terms of planetary
 

4793
01:36:46,730 --> 01:36:49,689
of other threats in terms of planetary
level at this point but obviously that's

4794
01:36:49,689 --> 01:36:49,699
level at this point but obviously that's
 

4795
01:36:49,699 --> 01:36:52,149
level at this point but obviously that's
the one I kind of have more like power

4796
01:36:52,149 --> 01:36:52,159
the one I kind of have more like power
 

4797
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:55,419
the one I kind of have more like power
on so clearly I do start thinking more

4798
01:36:55,419 --> 01:36:55,429
on so clearly I do start thinking more
 

4799
01:36:55,429 --> 01:36:57,160
on so clearly I do start thinking more
and more about this and it's kind of

4800
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:57,170
and more about this and it's kind of
 

4801
01:36:57,170 --> 01:37:00,370
and more about this and it's kind of
it's groaning me actually to to start

01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:00,380
it's groaning me actually to to start
 

4803
01:37:00,380 --> 01:37:02,649
it's groaning me actually to to start

that so far I have not really

4806
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:04,489
that so far I have not really
 

4807
01:37:04,489 --> 01:37:06,399
that so far I have not really
contributed to but maybe there's

4808
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:06,409
contributed to but maybe there's
 

4809
01:37:06,409 --> 01:37:07,810
contributed to but maybe there's
something to be done there as well I

4810
01:37:07,810 --> 01:37:07,820
something to be done there as well I
 

4811
01:37:07,820 --> 01:37:09,250
something to be done there as well I
think it's really important you know I

4812
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:09,260
think it's really important you know I
 

4813
01:37:09,260 --> 01:37:11,590
think it's really important you know I
would talk about this issue folks but

4814
01:37:11,590 --> 01:37:11,600
would talk about this issue folks but
 

4815
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,169
would talk about this issue folks but
it's important to ask you and shove it

4816
01:37:14,169 --> 01:37:14,179
it's important to ask you and shove it
 

4817
01:37:14,179 --> 01:37:15,610
it's important to ask you and shove it
in your head because you're at the

4818
01:37:15,610 --> 01:37:15,620
in your head because you're at the
 

4819
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:18,399
in your head because you're at the
leading edge of actually what people are

4820
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:18,409
leading edge of actually what people are
 

4821
01:37:18,409 --> 01:37:20,380
leading edge of actually what people are
excited about nay I I mean the work with

4822
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:20,390
excited about nay I I mean the work with
 

4823
01:37:20,390 --> 01:37:23,290
excited about nay I I mean the work with
alpha star it it's arguably at the very

4824
01:37:23,290 --> 01:37:23,300
alpha star it it's arguably at the very
 

4825
01:37:23,300 --> 01:37:25,330
alpha star it it's arguably at the very
cutting edge of the kind of thing that

4826
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:25,340
cutting edge of the kind of thing that
 

4827
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,390
cutting edge of the kind of thing that
people are afraid of and so you speaking

4828
01:37:28,390 --> 01:37:28,400
people are afraid of and so you speaking
 

4829
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:31,540
people are afraid of and so you speaking
to that fact and that we're actually

4830
01:37:31,540 --> 01:37:31,550
to that fact and that we're actually
 

4831
01:37:31,550 --> 01:37:33,640
to that fact and that we're actually
quite far away to the kind of thing that

4832
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:33,650
quite far away to the kind of thing that
 

4833
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:35,820
quite far away to the kind of thing that
people might be afraid of but it's still

4834
01:37:35,820 --> 01:37:35,830
people might be afraid of but it's still
 

4835
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:38,470
people might be afraid of but it's still
something worthwhile to think about and

4836
01:37:38,470 --> 01:37:38,480
something worthwhile to think about and
 

4837
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:41,250
something worthwhile to think about and
it's also good that you're

4838
01:37:41,250 --> 01:37:41,260
it's also good that you're
 

4839
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,859
it's also good that you're
the you're not as worried and you're

4840
01:37:43,859 --> 01:37:43,869
the you're not as worried and you're
 

4841
01:37:43,869 --> 01:37:45,779
the you're not as worried and you're
also open to us yeah me Maura

4842
01:37:45,779 --> 01:37:45,789
also open to us yeah me Maura
 

4843
01:37:45,789 --> 01:37:47,339
also open to us yeah me Maura
there's two aspects I mean me not being

4844
01:37:47,339 --> 01:37:47,349
there's two aspects I mean me not being
 

4845
01:37:47,349 --> 01:37:50,160
there's two aspects I mean me not being
worried but obviously we should prepare

4846
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:50,170
worried but obviously we should prepare
 

4847
01:37:50,170 --> 01:37:52,649
worried but obviously we should prepare
for for for it right for for like

4848
01:37:52,649 --> 01:37:52,659
for for for it right for for like
 

4849
01:37:52,659 --> 01:37:54,839
for for for it right for for like
forever for things that could go wrong

4850
01:37:54,839 --> 01:37:54,849
forever for things that could go wrong
 

4851
01:37:54,849 --> 01:37:57,449
forever for things that could go wrong
misuse of the technologies as with any

4852
01:37:57,449 --> 01:37:57,459
misuse of the technologies as with any
 

4853
01:37:57,459 --> 01:38:00,839
misuse of the technologies as with any
technologies right so I think there's

4854
01:38:00,839 --> 01:38:00,849
technologies right so I think there's
 

4855
01:38:00,849 --> 01:38:03,270
technologies right so I think there's
there's always trade-offs and I I as a

4856
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:03,280
there's always trade-offs and I I as a
 

4857
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:05,879
there's always trade-offs and I I as a
society we've kind of solved these to

4858
01:38:05,879 --> 01:38:05,889
society we've kind of solved these to
 

4859
01:38:05,889 --> 01:38:07,560
society we've kind of solved these to
some extent within the past so I'm

4860
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:07,570
some extent within the past so I'm
 

4861
01:38:07,570 --> 01:38:10,620
some extent within the past so I'm
hoping that by having the researchers

4862
01:38:10,620 --> 01:38:10,630
hoping that by having the researchers
 

4863
01:38:10,630 --> 01:38:13,589
hoping that by having the researchers
and the whole community brainstorm and

4864
01:38:13,589 --> 01:38:13,599
and the whole community brainstorm and
 

4865
01:38:13,599 --> 01:38:15,719
and the whole community brainstorm and
come up with interesting solutions to

4866
01:38:15,719 --> 01:38:15,729
come up with interesting solutions to
 

4867
01:38:15,729 --> 01:38:17,580
come up with interesting solutions to
the new things that will happen in the

4868
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:17,590
the new things that will happen in the
 

4869
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:18,080
the new things that will happen in the
future

4870
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:18,090
future
 

4871
01:38:18,090 --> 01:38:20,790
future
that we can still also push the research

4872
01:38:20,790 --> 01:38:20,800
that we can still also push the research
 

4873
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,459
that we can still also push the research
to the Avenue that I think is kind of

4874
01:38:23,459 --> 01:38:23,469
to the Avenue that I think is kind of
 

4875
01:38:23,469 --> 01:38:25,979
to the Avenue that I think is kind of
the greatest Avenue which is to

4876
01:38:25,979 --> 01:38:25,989
the greatest Avenue which is to
 

4877
01:38:25,989 --> 01:38:28,350
the greatest Avenue which is to
understand intelligence right how are we

4878
01:38:28,350 --> 01:38:28,360
understand intelligence right how are we
 

4879
01:38:28,360 --> 01:38:30,689
understand intelligence right how are we
doing what we're doing and you know

4880
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:30,699
doing what we're doing and you know
 

4881
01:38:30,699 --> 01:38:32,279
doing what we're doing and you know
obviously from a scientific standpoint

4882
01:38:32,279 --> 01:38:32,289
obviously from a scientific standpoint
 

4883
01:38:32,289 --> 01:38:35,160
obviously from a scientific standpoint
that is kind of the drive my personal

4884
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:35,170
that is kind of the drive my personal
 

4885
01:38:35,170 --> 01:38:37,529
that is kind of the drive my personal
driver of all the time that I spend

4886
01:38:37,529 --> 01:38:37,539
driver of all the time that I spend
 

4887
01:38:37,539 --> 01:38:40,379
driver of all the time that I spend
doing what I'm doing really what do you

4888
01:38:40,379 --> 01:38:40,389
doing what I'm doing really what do you
 

4889
01:38:40,389 --> 01:38:42,629
doing what I'm doing really what do you
see the deep learning as a field heading

4890
01:38:42,629 --> 01:38:42,639
see the deep learning as a field heading
 

4891
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,910
see the deep learning as a field heading
what do you think the next big big

4892
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:44,920
what do you think the next big big
 

4893
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:47,669
what do you think the next big big
breakthrough might be so I think deep

4894
01:38:47,669 --> 01:38:47,679
breakthrough might be so I think deep
 

4895
01:38:47,679 --> 01:38:49,830
breakthrough might be so I think deep
learning I I discuss a little of this

4896
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:49,840
learning I I discuss a little of this
 

4897
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,009
learning I I discuss a little of this
before deep learning has to be combined

4898
01:38:53,009 --> 01:38:53,019
before deep learning has to be combined
 

4899
01:38:53,019 --> 01:38:55,890
before deep learning has to be combined
with some form of discretization program

4900
01:38:55,890 --> 01:38:55,900
with some form of discretization program
 

4901
01:38:55,900 --> 01:38:57,870
with some form of discretization program
synthesis I think that's kind of as a

4902
01:38:57,870 --> 01:38:57,880
synthesis I think that's kind of as a
 

4903
01:38:57,880 --> 01:38:59,699
synthesis I think that's kind of as a
research in itself is an interesting

4904
01:38:59,699 --> 01:38:59,709
research in itself is an interesting
 

4905
01:38:59,709 --> 01:39:02,339
research in itself is an interesting
topic to expand and start doing more

4906
01:39:02,339 --> 01:39:02,349
topic to expand and start doing more
 

4907
01:39:02,349 --> 01:39:06,419
topic to expand and start doing more
research and then as kind of what will

4908
01:39:06,419 --> 01:39:06,429
research and then as kind of what will
 

4909
01:39:06,429 --> 01:39:07,859
research and then as kind of what will
deep learning and able to do in the

4910
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:07,869
deep learning and able to do in the
 

4911
01:39:07,869 --> 01:39:09,449
deep learning and able to do in the
future I don't think that's gonna be

4912
01:39:09,449 --> 01:39:09,459
future I don't think that's gonna be
 

4913
01:39:09,459 --> 01:39:12,029
future I don't think that's gonna be
what's gonna happen this year but also

4914
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:12,039
what's gonna happen this year but also
 

4915
01:39:12,039 --> 01:39:15,629
what's gonna happen this year but also
this idea of starting not to throw away

4916
01:39:15,629 --> 01:39:15,639
this idea of starting not to throw away
 

4917
01:39:15,639 --> 01:39:17,549
this idea of starting not to throw away
all the weights that the this idea of

4918
01:39:17,549 --> 01:39:17,559
all the weights that the this idea of
 

4919
01:39:17,559 --> 01:39:20,419
all the weights that the this idea of
learning to learn and really having

4920
01:39:20,419 --> 01:39:20,429
learning to learn and really having
 

4921
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:24,149
learning to learn and really having
these agents not having to restart their

4922
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:24,159
these agents not having to restart their
 

4923
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:26,759
these agents not having to restart their
weights and you you can have an agent

4924
01:39:26,759 --> 01:39:26,769
weights and you you can have an agent
 

4925
01:39:26,769 --> 01:39:29,640
weights and you you can have an agent
that is kind of solving or classifying

4926
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:29,650
that is kind of solving or classifying
 

4927
01:39:29,650 --> 01:39:32,189
that is kind of solving or classifying
images on image net but also generating

4928
01:39:32,189 --> 01:39:32,199
images on image net but also generating
 

4929
01:39:32,199 --> 01:39:34,199
images on image net but also generating
speech if you ask it to generate some

4930
01:39:34,199 --> 01:39:34,209
speech if you ask it to generate some
 

4931
01:39:34,209 --> 01:39:36,180
speech if you ask it to generate some
speech and and it should really be kind

4932
01:39:36,180 --> 01:39:36,190
speech and and it should really be kind
 

4933
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:40,979
speech and and it should really be kind
of almost the same network but might not

4934
01:39:40,979 --> 01:39:40,989
of almost the same network but might not
 

4935
01:39:40,989 --> 01:39:42,330
of almost the same network but might not
be a neural networking might be a neural

4936
01:39:42,330 --> 01:39:42,340
be a neural networking might be a neural
 

4937
01:39:42,340 --> 01:39:44,609
be a neural networking might be a neural
network with a optimization algorithm

4938
01:39:44,609 --> 01:39:44,619
network with a optimization algorithm
 

4939
01:39:44,619 --> 01:39:47,209
network with a optimization algorithm
attached to it but I think this idea of

4940
01:39:47,209 --> 01:39:47,219
attached to it but I think this idea of
 

4941
01:39:47,219 --> 01:39:49,890
attached to it but I think this idea of
generalization to new tasks is something

4942
01:39:49,890 --> 01:39:49,900
generalization to new tasks is something
 

4943
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:51,600
generalization to new tasks is something
that we first must define good

4944
01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:51,610
that we first must define good
 

4945
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:53,969
that we first must define good
benchmarks but then I think that's gonna

4946
01:39:53,969 --> 01:39:53,979
benchmarks but then I think that's gonna
 

4947
01:39:53,979 --> 01:39:55,140
benchmarks but then I think that's gonna
be exciting and I'm not

4948
01:39:55,140 --> 01:39:55,150
be exciting and I'm not
 

4949
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:57,149
be exciting and I'm not
sure how close we are but I think

4950
01:39:57,149 --> 01:39:57,159
sure how close we are but I think
 

4951
01:39:57,159 --> 01:39:59,040
sure how close we are but I think
there's the pet if you have a very

4952
01:39:59,040 --> 01:39:59,050
there's the pet if you have a very
 

4953
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:01,770
there's the pet if you have a very
limited domain I think we can start

4954
01:40:01,770 --> 01:40:01,780
limited domain I think we can start
 

4955
01:40:01,780 --> 01:40:05,189
limited domain I think we can start
doing some progress and much like how we

4956
01:40:05,189 --> 01:40:05,199
doing some progress and much like how we
 

4957
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:06,870
doing some progress and much like how we
did a lot of programs in computer vision

4958
01:40:06,870 --> 01:40:06,880
did a lot of programs in computer vision
 

4959
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:09,300
did a lot of programs in computer vision
we should start thinking am I really

4960
01:40:09,300 --> 01:40:09,310
we should start thinking am I really
 

4961
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:11,340
we should start thinking am I really
like a talk that gave that Leon blue to

4962
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:11,350
like a talk that gave that Leon blue to
 

4963
01:40:11,350 --> 01:40:14,010
like a talk that gave that Leon blue to
give gave at ICML a few years ago which

4964
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:14,020
give gave at ICML a few years ago which
 

4965
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:16,890
give gave at ICML a few years ago which
is this train test paradigm should be

4966
01:40:16,890 --> 01:40:16,900
is this train test paradigm should be
 

4967
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:18,720
is this train test paradigm should be
broken we we know we should stop

4968
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:18,730
broken we we know we should stop
 

4969
01:40:18,730 --> 01:40:20,760
broken we we know we should stop
thinking about a training test at

4970
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:20,770
thinking about a training test at
 

4971
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:23,040
thinking about a training test at
Acharya training set and a test set and

4972
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:23,050
Acharya training set and a test set and
 

4973
01:40:23,050 --> 01:40:25,200
Acharya training set and a test set and
these are closed you know things that

4974
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:25,210
these are closed you know things that
 

4975
01:40:25,210 --> 01:40:27,479
these are closed you know things that
are untouchable I think we should go

4976
01:40:27,479 --> 01:40:27,489
are untouchable I think we should go
 

4977
01:40:27,489 --> 01:40:29,580
are untouchable I think we should go
beyond these and in meta learning we

4978
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:29,590
beyond these and in meta learning we
 

4979
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:31,260
beyond these and in meta learning we
call these the meta training set and the

4980
01:40:31,260 --> 01:40:31,270
call these the meta training set and the
 

4981
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:34,560
call these the meta training set and the
meta test set which is really thinking

4982
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:34,570
meta test set which is really thinking
 

4983
01:40:34,570 --> 01:40:37,979
meta test set which is really thinking
about if I know about imagenet why would

4984
01:40:37,979 --> 01:40:37,989
about if I know about imagenet why would
 

4985
01:40:37,989 --> 01:40:40,260
about if I know about imagenet why would
that network not work on M NIST which is

4986
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:40,270
that network not work on M NIST which is
 

4987
01:40:40,270 --> 01:40:42,030
that network not work on M NIST which is
a much simpler problem but right now it

4988
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:42,040
a much simpler problem but right now it
 

4989
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,729
a much simpler problem but right now it
really doesn't it you know yeah and but

4990
01:40:44,729 --> 01:40:44,739
really doesn't it you know yeah and but
 

4991
01:40:44,739 --> 01:40:46,649
really doesn't it you know yeah and but
it just feels wrong right so I think

4992
01:40:46,649 --> 01:40:46,659
it just feels wrong right so I think
 

4993
01:40:46,659 --> 01:40:50,310
it just feels wrong right so I think
that's kind of the there's the on the

4994
01:40:50,310 --> 01:40:50,320
that's kind of the there's the on the
 

4995
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:52,530
that's kind of the there's the on the
application or the benchmark sites we we

4996
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:52,540
application or the benchmark sites we we
 

4997
01:40:52,540 --> 01:40:55,350
application or the benchmark sites we we
probably will see quite a few more

4998
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:55,360
probably will see quite a few more
 

4999
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:56,970
probably will see quite a few more
interest and progress and hopefully

5000
01:40:56,970 --> 01:40:56,980
interest and progress and hopefully
 

5001
01:40:56,980 --> 01:40:59,700
interest and progress and hopefully
people defining new and exciting

5002
01:40:59,700 --> 01:40:59,710
people defining new and exciting
 

5003
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:02,310
people defining new and exciting
challenges really do you have any hope

5004
01:41:02,310 --> 01:41:02,320
challenges really do you have any hope
 

5005
01:41:02,320 --> 01:41:04,500
challenges really do you have any hope
or interest in knowledge graphs within

5006
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:04,510
or interest in knowledge graphs within
 

5007
01:41:04,510 --> 01:41:06,270
or interest in knowledge graphs within
this context so just kind of totally

5008
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:06,280
this context so just kind of totally
 

5009
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:09,330
this context so just kind of totally
yeah constructing graph so going back

5010
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:09,340
yeah constructing graph so going back
 

5011
01:41:09,340 --> 01:41:11,310
yeah constructing graph so going back
that graphs yap well okay neural

5012
01:41:11,310 --> 01:41:11,320
that graphs yap well okay neural
 

5013
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:12,510
that graphs yap well okay neural
networks and graphs but I mean a

5014
01:41:12,510 --> 01:41:12,520
networks and graphs but I mean a
 

5015
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:15,060
networks and graphs but I mean a
different kind of knowledge graph sort

5016
01:41:15,060 --> 01:41:15,070
different kind of knowledge graph sort
 

5017
01:41:15,070 --> 01:41:17,160
different kind of knowledge graph sort
of like semantic graphs or there's

5018
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:17,170
of like semantic graphs or there's
 

5019
01:41:17,170 --> 01:41:21,720
of like semantic graphs or there's
concepts yeah so I think I think the the

5020
01:41:21,720 --> 01:41:21,730
concepts yeah so I think I think the the
 

5021
01:41:21,730 --> 01:41:24,419
concepts yeah so I think I think the the
idea of graphs is is so I've been quite

5022
01:41:24,419 --> 01:41:24,429
idea of graphs is is so I've been quite
 

5023
01:41:24,429 --> 01:41:26,610
idea of graphs is is so I've been quite
interested in sequences first and then

5024
01:41:26,610 --> 01:41:26,620
interested in sequences first and then
 

5025
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:28,410
interested in sequences first and then
more interesting or different data

5026
01:41:28,410 --> 01:41:28,420
more interesting or different data
 

5027
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:30,959
more interesting or different data
structures like graphs and I've studied

5028
01:41:30,959 --> 01:41:30,969
structures like graphs and I've studied
 

5029
01:41:30,969 --> 01:41:33,899
structures like graphs and I've studied
graph narrow networks in the last three

5030
01:41:33,899 --> 01:41:33,909
graph narrow networks in the last three
 

5031
01:41:33,909 --> 01:41:36,959
graph narrow networks in the last three
years or so I found these models just

5032
01:41:36,959 --> 01:41:36,969
years or so I found these models just
 

5033
01:41:36,969 --> 01:41:40,229
years or so I found these models just
very interesting from like deep learning

5034
01:41:40,229 --> 01:41:40,239
very interesting from like deep learning
 

5035
01:41:40,239 --> 01:41:44,370
very interesting from like deep learning
sites standpoint but then how what do we

5036
01:41:44,370 --> 01:41:44,380
sites standpoint but then how what do we
 

5037
01:41:44,380 --> 01:41:46,140
sites standpoint but then how what do we
want why do we want these models and and

5038
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:46,150
want why do we want these models and and
 

5039
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:47,669
want why do we want these models and and
why would we use them what's the

5040
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:47,679
why would we use them what's the
 

5041
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:49,590
why would we use them what's the
application what's kind of the killer

5042
01:41:49,590 --> 01:41:49,600
application what's kind of the killer
 

5043
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:53,630
application what's kind of the killer
application of graphs right and perhaps

5044
01:41:53,630 --> 01:41:53,640
application of graphs right and perhaps
 

5045
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:58,209
application of graphs right and perhaps
if we could extract a knowledge

5046
01:41:58,209 --> 01:41:58,219
if we could extract a knowledge
 

5047
01:41:58,219 --> 01:42:00,520
if we could extract a knowledge

um that would be interesting because

5050
01:42:02,589 --> 01:42:02,599
um that would be interesting because
 

5051
01:42:02,599 --> 01:42:05,529
um that would be interesting because
then these graphs have this very

5052
01:42:05,529 --> 01:42:05,539
then these graphs have this very
 

5053
01:42:05,539 --> 01:42:07,750
then these graphs have this very
interesting structure that also is a bit

5054
01:42:07,750 --> 01:42:07,760
interesting structure that also is a bit
 

5055
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:09,430
interesting structure that also is a bit
more comfortable with this idea of

5056
01:42:09,430 --> 01:42:09,440
more comfortable with this idea of
 

5057
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:11,859
more comfortable with this idea of
programs and deep learning kind of

5058
01:42:11,859 --> 01:42:11,869
programs and deep learning kind of
 

5059
01:42:11,869 --> 01:42:12,790
programs and deep learning kind of
working together

5060
01:42:12,790 --> 01:42:12,800
working together
 

5061
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:14,919
working together
the jumping neighborhoods and so on you

5062
01:42:14,919 --> 01:42:14,929
the jumping neighborhoods and so on you
 

5063
01:42:14,929 --> 01:42:16,959
the jumping neighborhoods and so on you
could imagine defining some primitives

5064
01:42:16,959 --> 01:42:16,969
could imagine defining some primitives
 

5065
01:42:16,969 --> 01:42:20,620
could imagine defining some primitives
to go around graphs right so I think I

5066
01:42:20,620 --> 01:42:20,630
to go around graphs right so I think I
 

5067
01:42:20,630 --> 01:42:22,629
to go around graphs right so I think I
really like the idea of a knowledge

5068
01:42:22,629 --> 01:42:22,639
really like the idea of a knowledge
 

5069
01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:27,430
really like the idea of a knowledge
graph and in fact when we we started or

5070
01:42:27,430 --> 01:42:27,440
graph and in fact when we we started or
 

5071
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,799
graph and in fact when we we started or
you know as part of the research we did

5072
01:42:29,799 --> 01:42:29,809
you know as part of the research we did
 

5073
01:42:29,809 --> 01:42:31,959
you know as part of the research we did
for StarCraft I thought wouldn't it be

5074
01:42:31,959 --> 01:42:31,969
for StarCraft I thought wouldn't it be
 

5075
01:42:31,969 --> 01:42:35,200
for StarCraft I thought wouldn't it be
cool to give the graph of you know all

5076
01:42:35,200 --> 01:42:35,210
cool to give the graph of you know all
 

5077
01:42:35,210 --> 01:42:37,270
cool to give the graph of you know all
the prerequisites like this all these

5078
01:42:37,270 --> 01:42:37,280
the prerequisites like this all these
 

5079
01:42:37,280 --> 01:42:39,180
the prerequisites like this all these
buildings that depend on each other and

5080
01:42:39,180 --> 01:42:39,190
buildings that depend on each other and
 

5081
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,739
buildings that depend on each other and
units that have prerequisites of being

5082
01:42:41,739 --> 01:42:41,749
units that have prerequisites of being
 

5083
01:42:41,749 --> 01:42:44,799
units that have prerequisites of being
built by that and so this is information

5084
01:42:44,799 --> 01:42:44,809
built by that and so this is information
 

5085
01:42:44,809 --> 01:42:46,779
built by that and so this is information
that the network can learn and extract

5086
01:42:46,779 --> 01:42:46,789
that the network can learn and extract
 

5087
01:42:46,789 --> 01:42:49,899
that the network can learn and extract
but it would have been great to see um

5088
01:42:49,899 --> 01:42:49,909
but it would have been great to see um
 

5089
01:42:49,909 --> 01:42:52,029
but it would have been great to see um
or to think of really stack graph as a

5090
01:42:52,029 --> 01:42:52,039
or to think of really stack graph as a
 

5091
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:54,489
or to think of really stack graph as a
giant graph that even also as the game

5092
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:54,499
giant graph that even also as the game
 

5093
01:42:54,499 --> 01:42:56,589
giant graph that even also as the game
evolves use kind of star trek taking

5094
01:42:56,589 --> 01:42:56,599
evolves use kind of star trek taking
 

5095
01:42:56,599 --> 01:42:58,779
evolves use kind of star trek taking
branches and so on and we tried we read

5096
01:42:58,779 --> 01:42:58,789
branches and so on and we tried we read
 

5097
01:42:58,789 --> 01:43:00,580
branches and so on and we tried we read
a bit of research on these nothing too

5098
01:43:00,580 --> 01:43:00,590
a bit of research on these nothing too
 

5099
01:43:00,590 --> 01:43:03,640
a bit of research on these nothing too
relevant but I I really like the idea

5100
01:43:03,640 --> 01:43:03,650
relevant but I I really like the idea
 

5101
01:43:03,650 --> 01:43:05,799
relevant but I I really like the idea
and it has elements that are which

5102
01:43:05,799 --> 01:43:05,809
and it has elements that are which
 

5103
01:43:05,809 --> 01:43:07,509
and it has elements that are which
something you also worked with in terms

5104
01:43:07,509 --> 01:43:07,519
something you also worked with in terms
 

5105
01:43:07,519 --> 01:43:09,459
something you also worked with in terms
of visualizing your networks as elements

5106
01:43:09,459 --> 01:43:09,469
of visualizing your networks as elements
 

5107
01:43:09,469 --> 01:43:13,600
of visualizing your networks as elements
of having human interpretable being able

5108
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:13,610
of having human interpretable being able
 

5109
01:43:13,610 --> 01:43:15,609
of having human interpretable being able
to generate knowledge representations

5110
01:43:15,609 --> 01:43:15,619
to generate knowledge representations
 

5111
01:43:15,619 --> 01:43:17,469
to generate knowledge representations
that are human interpretable that maybe

5112
01:43:17,469 --> 01:43:17,479
that are human interpretable that maybe
 

5113
01:43:17,479 --> 01:43:20,259
that are human interpretable that maybe
human experts can then tweak or at least

5114
01:43:20,259 --> 01:43:20,269
human experts can then tweak or at least
 

5115
01:43:20,269 --> 01:43:21,969
human experts can then tweak or at least
understand so there's there's a lot of

5116
01:43:21,969 --> 01:43:21,979
understand so there's there's a lot of
 

5117
01:43:21,979 --> 01:43:23,620
understand so there's there's a lot of
interesting aspect there and for me

5118
01:43:23,620 --> 01:43:23,630
interesting aspect there and for me
 

5119
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:24,700
interesting aspect there and for me
personally I'm just a huge fan of

5120
01:43:24,700 --> 01:43:24,710
personally I'm just a huge fan of
 

5121
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:28,299
personally I'm just a huge fan of
Wikipedia and it's it's a shame that our

5122
01:43:28,299 --> 01:43:28,309
Wikipedia and it's it's a shame that our
 

5123
01:43:28,309 --> 01:43:29,649
Wikipedia and it's it's a shame that our
neural networks aren't taking advantage

5124
01:43:29,649 --> 01:43:29,659
neural networks aren't taking advantage
 

5125
01:43:29,659 --> 01:43:31,509
neural networks aren't taking advantage
of all the structured knowledge that's

5126
01:43:31,509 --> 01:43:31,519
of all the structured knowledge that's
 

5127
01:43:31,519 --> 01:43:34,600
of all the structured knowledge that's
on the web what's next for for you

5128
01:43:34,600 --> 01:43:34,610
on the web what's next for for you
 

5129
01:43:34,610 --> 01:43:36,609
on the web what's next for for you
what's next for deep mind what are you

5130
01:43:36,609 --> 01:43:36,619
what's next for deep mind what are you
 

5131
01:43:36,619 --> 01:43:38,879
what's next for deep mind what are you
excited about what a four alpha star

5132
01:43:38,879 --> 01:43:38,889
excited about what a four alpha star
 

5133
01:43:38,889 --> 01:43:42,669
excited about what a four alpha star
yeah so I think the obvious next steps

5134
01:43:42,669 --> 01:43:42,679
yeah so I think the obvious next steps
 

5135
01:43:42,679 --> 01:43:47,379
yeah so I think the obvious next steps
would be to apply alpha star to other

5136
01:43:47,379 --> 01:43:47,389
would be to apply alpha star to other
 

5137
01:43:47,389 --> 01:43:49,509
would be to apply alpha star to other
races I mean that's sort of shows that

5138
01:43:49,509 --> 01:43:49,519
races I mean that's sort of shows that
 

5139
01:43:49,519 --> 01:43:53,080
races I mean that's sort of shows that
the algorithm works because we wouldn't

5140
01:43:53,080 --> 01:43:53,090
the algorithm works because we wouldn't
 

5141
01:43:53,090 --> 01:43:55,390
the algorithm works because we wouldn't
want to have created by mistake

5142
01:43:55,390 --> 01:43:55,400
want to have created by mistake
 

5143
01:43:55,400 --> 01:43:56,919
want to have created by mistake
something in the architecture that

5144
01:43:56,919 --> 01:43:56,929
something in the architecture that
 

5145
01:43:56,929 --> 01:43:59,259
something in the architecture that
happens to work for Protoss but not for

5146
01:43:59,259 --> 01:43:59,269
happens to work for Protoss but not for
 

5147
01:43:59,269 --> 01:44:01,600
happens to work for Protoss but not for
other races right so as verification I

5148
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:01,610
other races right so as verification I
 

5149
01:44:01,610 --> 01:44:03,430
other races right so as verification I
think that's an obvious next step that

5150
01:44:03,430 --> 01:44:03,440
think that's an obvious next step that
 

5151
01:44:03,440 --> 01:44:08,049
think that's an obvious next step that
we are working on and then I would like

5152
01:44:08,049 --> 01:44:08,059
we are working on and then I would like
 

5153
01:44:08,059 --> 01:44:11,379
we are working on and then I would like
to see so agents and players can

5154
01:44:11,379 --> 01:44:11,389
to see so agents and players can
 

5155
01:44:11,389 --> 01:44:12,640
to see so agents and players can
specialize on

5156
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:12,650
specialize on
 

5157
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:14,290
specialize on
different skill sets that allow them to

5158
01:44:14,290 --> 01:44:14,300
different skill sets that allow them to
 

5159
01:44:14,300 --> 01:44:17,020
different skill sets that allow them to
be very good I think we've seen alpha

5160
01:44:17,020 --> 01:44:17,030
be very good I think we've seen alpha
 

5161
01:44:17,030 --> 01:44:19,840
be very good I think we've seen alpha
star understanding very well when to

5162
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:19,850
star understanding very well when to
 

5163
01:44:19,850 --> 01:44:21,580
star understanding very well when to
take battles and when to not to do that

5164
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:21,590
take battles and when to not to do that
 

5165
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:23,890
take battles and when to not to do that
do that also very good at

5166
01:44:23,890 --> 01:44:23,900
do that also very good at
 

5167
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:25,810
do that also very good at
micromanagement and moving the units

5168
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:25,820
micromanagement and moving the units
 

5169
01:44:25,820 --> 01:44:28,450
micromanagement and moving the units
around and so on and also very good at

5170
01:44:28,450 --> 01:44:28,460
around and so on and also very good at
 

5171
01:44:28,460 --> 01:44:30,250
around and so on and also very good at
producing non-stop and trading of

5172
01:44:30,250 --> 01:44:30,260
producing non-stop and trading of
 

5173
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:34,419
producing non-stop and trading of
economy with building units but I have

5174
01:44:34,419 --> 01:44:34,429
economy with building units but I have
 

5175
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:37,030
economy with building units but I have
not perhaps seen as much as I would like

5176
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:37,040
not perhaps seen as much as I would like
 

5177
01:44:37,040 --> 01:44:39,189
not perhaps seen as much as I would like
this idea of the poker idea that you

5178
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:39,199
this idea of the poker idea that you
 

5179
01:44:39,199 --> 01:44:41,709
this idea of the poker idea that you
mentioned right I'm not sure Starcraft

5180
01:44:41,709 --> 01:44:41,719
mentioned right I'm not sure Starcraft
 

5181
01:44:41,719 --> 01:44:44,350
mentioned right I'm not sure Starcraft
or alpha star rather has developed a

5182
01:44:44,350 --> 01:44:44,360
or alpha star rather has developed a
 

5183
01:44:44,360 --> 01:44:47,290
or alpha star rather has developed a
very deep understanding of what the

5184
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:47,300
very deep understanding of what the
 

5185
01:44:47,300 --> 01:44:49,870
very deep understanding of what the
opponent is doing and reacting to that

5186
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:49,880
opponent is doing and reacting to that
 

5187
01:44:49,880 --> 01:44:52,600
opponent is doing and reacting to that
and sort of trying to to to trick the

5188
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:52,610
and sort of trying to to to trick the
 

5189
01:44:52,610 --> 01:44:55,240
and sort of trying to to to trick the
player to do something else or that you

5190
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:55,250
player to do something else or that you
 

5191
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:57,520
player to do something else or that you
know so this kind of reasoning I would

5192
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:57,530
know so this kind of reasoning I would
 

5193
01:44:57,530 --> 01:44:59,800
know so this kind of reasoning I would
like to see more so I think purely from

5194
01:44:59,800 --> 01:44:59,810
like to see more so I think purely from
 

5195
01:44:59,810 --> 01:45:02,020
like to see more so I think purely from
a research standpoint there's perhaps

5196
01:45:02,020 --> 01:45:02,030
a research standpoint there's perhaps
 

5197
01:45:02,030 --> 01:45:04,120
a research standpoint there's perhaps
also quite a few of you things to be

5198
01:45:04,120 --> 01:45:04,130
also quite a few of you things to be
 

5199
01:45:04,130 --> 01:45:05,800
also quite a few of you things to be
done there in the domain of StarCraft

5200
01:45:05,800 --> 01:45:05,810
done there in the domain of StarCraft
 

5201
01:45:05,810 --> 01:45:08,770
done there in the domain of StarCraft
yeah in a domain of games I've seen some

5202
01:45:08,770 --> 01:45:08,780
yeah in a domain of games I've seen some
 

5203
01:45:08,780 --> 01:45:11,290
yeah in a domain of games I've seen some
interesting work in sort of in even

5204
01:45:11,290 --> 01:45:11,300
interesting work in sort of in even
 

5205
01:45:11,300 --> 01:45:13,959
interesting work in sort of in even
auctions manipulating other players so

5206
01:45:13,959 --> 01:45:13,969
auctions manipulating other players so
 

5207
01:45:13,969 --> 01:45:16,570
auctions manipulating other players so
forming a belief state and just messing

5208
01:45:16,570 --> 01:45:16,580
forming a belief state and just messing
 

5209
01:45:16,580 --> 01:45:18,550
forming a belief state and just messing
with people yeah about theory of mind

5210
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
with people yeah about theory of mind
 

5211
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,970
with people yeah about theory of mind
yeah yeah yeah this is a theory of mine

5212
01:45:21,970 --> 01:45:21,980
yeah yeah yeah this is a theory of mine
 

5213
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:24,760
yeah yeah yeah this is a theory of mine
on star Kirby's kind of they're really

5214
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:24,770
on star Kirby's kind of they're really
 

5215
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:25,689
on star Kirby's kind of they're really
made for each other

5216
01:45:25,689 --> 01:45:25,699
made for each other
 

5217
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:27,790
made for each other
yeah so that would be very exciting to

5218
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:27,800
yeah so that would be very exciting to
 

5219
01:45:27,800 --> 01:45:29,950
yeah so that would be very exciting to
see those techniques applied to

5220
01:45:29,950 --> 01:45:29,960
see those techniques applied to
 

5221
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:32,410
see those techniques applied to
Starcraft or perhaps Starcraft driving

5222
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:32,420
Starcraft or perhaps Starcraft driving
 

5223
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:34,450
Starcraft or perhaps Starcraft driving
new techniques right as I said this is

5224
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:34,460
new techniques right as I said this is
 

5225
01:45:34,460 --> 01:45:36,850
new techniques right as I said this is
always the tension between the two well

5226
01:45:36,850 --> 01:45:36,860
always the tension between the two well
 

5227
01:45:36,860 --> 01:45:38,320
always the tension between the two well
Oriol thank you so much for talking

5228
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:38,330
Oriol thank you so much for talking
 

5229
01:45:38,330 --> 01:45:40,090
Oriol thank you so much for talking
today awesome it was great to be here

5230
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:40,100
today awesome it was great to be here
 

5231
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:48,080
