right
you're there wearing a headset now I'm

116
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,120
you're there wearing a headset now I'm
 

117
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,510
you're there wearing a headset now I'm
wearing a headset it's it's really

118
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,520
wearing a headset it's it's really
 

119
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,850
wearing a headset it's it's really
really incredible so what um can you

120
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:37,860
really incredible so what um can you
 

121
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,270
really incredible so what um can you
describe what it takes currently for us

122
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:41,280
describe what it takes currently for us
 

123
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,369
describe what it takes currently for us
to appear so photorealistic to each

124
00:02:43,369 --> 00:02:43,379
to appear so photorealistic to each
 

125
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,830
to appear so photorealistic to each
other yeah so I mean for for background

126
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:45,840
other yeah so I mean for for background
 

127
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,089
other yeah so I mean for for background
we both did these scans for uh This

128
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:50,099
we both did these scans for uh This
 

129
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,250
we both did these scans for uh This
research project that that we have at

130
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:52,260
research project that that we have at
 

131
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,150
research project that that we have at
meta called Kodak avatars and the idea

132
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,160
meta called Kodak avatars and the idea
 

133
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,970
meta called Kodak avatars and the idea
is that instead of actually instead of

134
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:58,980
is that instead of actually instead of
 

135
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,009
is that instead of actually instead of
our avatars being cartoony

136
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:01,019
our avatars being cartoony
 

137
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:02,210
our avatars being cartoony
um and instead of actually transmitting

138
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:02,220
um and instead of actually transmitting
 

139
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,110
um and instead of actually transmitting
a video what it does is we've sort of

140
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:06,120
a video what it does is we've sort of
 

141
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,910
a video what it does is we've sort of
scanned ourselves in a lot of different

142
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
scanned ourselves in a lot of different
 

143
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,210
scanned ourselves in a lot of different
expressions and we've built a computer

144
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:11,220
expressions and we've built a computer
 

145
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,470
expressions and we've built a computer
model of sort of each of our faces and

146
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:15,480
model of sort of each of our faces and
 

147
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,050
model of sort of each of our faces and
and bodies and the different Expressions

148
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:18,060
and bodies and the different Expressions
 

149
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,809
and bodies and the different Expressions
that we make and collapse that into a

150
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:20,819
that we make and collapse that into a
 

151
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:23,089
that we make and collapse that into a
codec that then when you have the

152
00:03:23,089 --> 00:03:23,099
codec that then when you have the
 

153
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,390
codec that then when you have the
headset on your head it can it sees your

154
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:26,400
headset on your head it can it sees your
 

155
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,630
headset on your head it can it sees your
face it's easier expression and it can

156
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:29,640
face it's easier expression and it can
 

157
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,490
face it's easier expression and it can
basically send

158
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:31,500
basically send
 

159
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,050
basically send
um an encoded version of what you're

160
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,060
um an encoded version of what you're
 

161
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,210
um an encoded version of what you're
supposed to look like over the wire so

162
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:35,220
supposed to look like over the wire so
 

163
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,110
supposed to look like over the wire so
um so in addition to being

164
00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:36,120
um so in addition to being
 

165
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,930
um so in addition to being
photorealistic it's also actually much

166
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:38,940
photorealistic it's also actually much
 

167
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,910
photorealistic it's also actually much
more bandwidth efficient than

168
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:40,920
more bandwidth efficient than
 

169
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,610
more bandwidth efficient than
transmitting a a full video or

170
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:43,620
transmitting a a full video or
 

171
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,430
transmitting a a full video or
especially a 3D immersive video of a

172
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:46,440
especially a 3D immersive video of a
 

173
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,589
especially a 3D immersive video of a
whole scene like this and it captures

174
00:03:48,589 --> 00:03:48,599
whole scene like this and it captures
 

175
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:52,430
whole scene like this and it captures
everything like the flaws like to me

176
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:52,440
everything like the flaws like to me
 

177
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,589
everything like the flaws like to me
the subtleties of the human face like

178
00:03:54,589 --> 00:03:54,599
the subtleties of the human face like
 

179
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,869
the subtleties of the human face like
even the flaws that's like that's all

180
00:03:56,869 --> 00:03:56,879
even the flaws that's like that's all
 

181
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,970
even the flaws that's like that's all
amazing it makes you uh

182
00:03:58,970 --> 00:03:58,980
amazing it makes you uh
 

183
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,770
amazing it makes you uh
it makes us so much more immersive it

184
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:00,780
it makes us so much more immersive it
 

185
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,330
it makes us so much more immersive it
makes you realize that like Perfection

186
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:02,340
makes you realize that like Perfection
 

187
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,089
makes you realize that like Perfection
isn't the thing that leads to immersion

188
00:04:05,089 --> 00:04:05,099
isn't the thing that leads to immersion
 

189
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:07,130
isn't the thing that leads to immersion
it's like the little subtle flaws like

190
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,140
it's like the little subtle flaws like
 

191
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,830
it's like the little subtle flaws like
freckles and like variations in color

192
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
freckles and like variations in color
 

193
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,850
freckles and like variations in color
and just yeah wrinkles

194
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:12,860
and just yeah wrinkles
 

195
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,189
and just yeah wrinkles
roses yeah asymmetry and just the

196
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:16,199
roses yeah asymmetry and just the
 

197
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:17,509
roses yeah asymmetry and just the
different like the corners of the eyes

198
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:17,519
different like the corners of the eyes
 

199
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,129
different like the corners of the eyes
like what your eyes do when you smile

200
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:19,139
like what your eyes do when you smile
 

201
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,590
like what your eyes do when you smile
all that kind of stuff yeah eyes are a

202
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:21,600
all that kind of stuff yeah eyes are a
 

203
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,510
all that kind of stuff yeah eyes are a
huge part of it yeah I mean there's all

204
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:23,520
huge part of it yeah I mean there's all
 

205
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,810
huge part of it yeah I mean there's all
the studies that most of communication

206
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:26,820
the studies that most of communication
 

207
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,790
the studies that most of communication
even when people are speaking is not

208
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:28,800
even when people are speaking is not
 

209
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,290
even when people are speaking is not
actually the words that they're saying

210
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,300
actually the words that they're saying
 

211
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,909
actually the words that they're saying
right it's kind of the expression and

212
00:04:31,909 --> 00:04:31,919
right it's kind of the expression and
 

213
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,310
right it's kind of the expression and
all that so we try to capture that with

214
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:34,320
all that so we try to capture that with
 

215
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,890
all that so we try to capture that with
the kind of classical

216
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:36,900
the kind of classical
 

217
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,469
the kind of classical
um expressive Avatar system that we have

218
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:39,479
um expressive Avatar system that we have
 

219
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,330
um expressive Avatar system that we have
that's the kind of more cartoon designed

220
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:41,340
that's the kind of more cartoon designed
 

221
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,129
that's the kind of more cartoon designed
one you can you can kind of put those

222
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:43,139
one you can you can kind of put those
 

223
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:44,749
one you can you can kind of put those
kind of Expressions on those faces as

224
00:04:44,749 --> 00:04:44,759
kind of Expressions on those faces as
 

225
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,430
kind of Expressions on those faces as
well but there's obviously a certain

226
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:46,440
well but there's obviously a certain
 

227
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,650
well but there's obviously a certain
realism that comes with delivering kind

228
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:48,660
realism that comes with delivering kind
 

229
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,170
realism that comes with delivering kind
of this photorealistic experience that

230
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:51,180
of this photorealistic experience that
 

231
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,189
of this photorealistic experience that
um I I don't know I just think it's

232
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:52,199
um I I don't know I just think it's
 

233
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,170
um I I don't know I just think it's
really magical I mean this gets to kind

234
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:54,180
really magical I mean this gets to kind
 

235
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,689
really magical I mean this gets to kind
of the core of what the vision around

236
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:56,699
of the core of what the vision around
 

237
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,790
of the core of what the vision around
virtual and augmented reality is of like

238
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:58,800
virtual and augmented reality is of like
 

239
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,530
virtual and augmented reality is of like
delivering a sense of presence is if

240
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:00,540
delivering a sense of presence is if
 

241
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,390
delivering a sense of presence is if
you're there together no matter where

242
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,400
you're there together no matter where
 

243
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,490
you're there together no matter where
you actually are in the world and I mean

244
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:04,500
you actually are in the world and I mean
 

245
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,830
you actually are in the world and I mean
this this uh experience I think is a

246
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:06,840
this this uh experience I think is a
 

247
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,210
this this uh experience I think is a
good embodiment of that where it's like

248
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:08,220
good embodiment of that where it's like
 

249
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,770
good embodiment of that where it's like
coming or in two completely different

250
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:09,780
coming or in two completely different
 

251
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,590
coming or in two completely different
states halfway across the country and it

252
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:12,600
states halfway across the country and it
 

253
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,850
states halfway across the country and it
just like you know looks like you're

254
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:13,860
just like you know looks like you're
 

255
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,110
just like you know looks like you're
just sitting right in front of me it's

256
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:15,120
just sitting right in front of me it's
 

257
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,790
just sitting right in front of me it's
uh it's pretty wild

258
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:16,800
uh it's pretty wild
 

259
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,249
uh it's pretty wild
yeah yeah I can't it's I'm almost

260
00:05:19,249 --> 00:05:19,259
yeah yeah I can't it's I'm almost
 

261
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:20,930
yeah yeah I can't it's I'm almost
getting emotional it's like it feels

262
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:20,940
getting emotional it's like it feels
 

263
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,909
getting emotional it's like it feels
like a totally

264
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:22,919
like a totally
 

265
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:24,830
like a totally
it's fundamentally new experience like

266
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:24,840
it's fundamentally new experience like
 

267
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,909
it's fundamentally new experience like
for me to have this kind of

268
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:25,919
for me to have this kind of
 

269
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,010
for me to have this kind of
conversations with loved ones

270
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:28,020
conversations with loved ones
 

271
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,590
conversations with loved ones
that would just change everything maybe

272
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:30,600
that would just change everything maybe
 

273
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,350
that would just change everything maybe
just to elaborate so the I went to

274
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
just to elaborate so the I went to
 

275
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,969
just to elaborate so the I went to
Pittsburgh and went through the whole

276
00:05:34,969 --> 00:05:34,979
Pittsburgh and went through the whole
 

277
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:36,770
Pittsburgh and went through the whole
scanning procedure which has so much

278
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:36,780
scanning procedure which has so much
 

279
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:40,189
scanning procedure which has so much
incredible uh technology so software and

280
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:40,199
incredible uh technology so software and
 

281
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,350
incredible uh technology so software and
Hardware going on

282
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:42,360
Hardware going on
 

283
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,810
Hardware going on
um but it is a lengthy process so what's

284
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:44,820
um but it is a lengthy process so what's
 

285
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,810
um but it is a lengthy process so what's
your vision for the future of this uh in

286
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:47,820
your vision for the future of this uh in
 

287
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,310
your vision for the future of this uh in
terms of making this more accessible to

288
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,320
terms of making this more accessible to
 

289
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,090
terms of making this more accessible to
people

290
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:50,100
people
 

291
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,969
people
you know it starts off with a small

292
00:05:52,969 --> 00:05:52,979
you know it starts off with a small
 

293
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,610
you know it starts off with a small
number of people doing these

294
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:55,620
number of people doing these
 

295
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,710
number of people doing these
um very detailed scans right which is

296
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:57,720
um very detailed scans right which is
 

297
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,450
um very detailed scans right which is
this that's the version that you did and

298
00:05:59,450 --> 00:05:59,460
this that's the version that you did and
 

299
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,730
this that's the version that you did and
that I did and you know before there are

300
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:01,740
that I did and you know before there are
 

301
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,950
that I did and you know before there are
a lot of people who who've done this

302
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:03,960
a lot of people who who've done this
 

303
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,189
a lot of people who who've done this
kind of a scan for we probably need to

304
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
kind of a scan for we probably need to
 

305
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,490
kind of a scan for we probably need to
kind of over collect

306
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:09,500
kind of over collect
 

307
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,450
kind of over collect
Expressions

308
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:11,460
Expressions
 

309
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,710
Expressions
um when we're doing the scanning because

310
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:12,720
um when we're doing the scanning because
 

311
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,570
um when we're doing the scanning because
we haven't figured out how much we can

312
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:14,580
we haven't figured out how much we can
 

313
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,090
we haven't figured out how much we can
reduce that down to a really streamlined

314
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,100
reduce that down to a really streamlined
 

315
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,969
reduce that down to a really streamlined
process and extrapolate from the the

316
00:06:19,969 --> 00:06:19,979
process and extrapolate from the the
 

317
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,129
process and extrapolate from the the
scans that have already been done but

318
00:06:22,129 --> 00:06:22,139
scans that have already been done but
 

319
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:23,749
scans that have already been done but
you know the goal and we have a project

320
00:06:23,749 --> 00:06:23,759
you know the goal and we have a project
 

321
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,450
you know the goal and we have a project
that's working on this already is just

322
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:26,460
that's working on this already is just
 

323
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,790
that's working on this already is just
to do a very quick scan with your cell

324
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:28,800
to do a very quick scan with your cell
 

325
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,350
to do a very quick scan with your cell
phone where you just take your phone

326
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:30,360
phone where you just take your phone
 

327
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,909
phone where you just take your phone
kind of wave it in front of your face

328
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:31,919
kind of wave it in front of your face
 

329
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:33,890
kind of wave it in front of your face
for a couple of minutes

330
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:33,900
for a couple of minutes
 

331
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,870
for a couple of minutes
um you know say a few sentences make a

332
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:35,880
um you know say a few sentences make a
 

333
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,409
um you know say a few sentences make a
bunch of Expressions but overall

334
00:06:39,409 --> 00:06:39,419
bunch of Expressions but overall
 

335
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,090
bunch of Expressions but overall
have the whole process just be two to

336
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:41,100
have the whole process just be two to
 

337
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,830
have the whole process just be two to
three minutes and then produce something

338
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:42,840
three minutes and then produce something
 

339
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,330
three minutes and then produce something
that's of the quality of what we have

340
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:44,340
that's of the quality of what we have
 

341
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,550
that's of the quality of what we have
right now so I think that that's one of

342
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:46,560
right now so I think that that's one of
 

343
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,409
right now so I think that that's one of
the big challenges that remains and

344
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:48,419
the big challenges that remains and
 

345
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,730
the big challenges that remains and
right now we have the ability to do the

346
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:49,740
right now we have the ability to do the
 

347
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,610
right now we have the ability to do the
scans if you you know have hours to sit

348
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:52,620
scans if you you know have hours to sit
 

349
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,730
scans if you you know have hours to sit
for one and with today is technology I

350
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:55,740
for one and with today is technology I
 

351
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,010
for one and with today is technology I
mean you're using a meta headset that

352
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,020
mean you're using a meta headset that
 

353
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,170
mean you're using a meta headset that
exists it's a product that's kind of for

354
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:00,180
exists it's a product that's kind of for
 

355
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,469
exists it's a product that's kind of for
sale now you can drive these with that

356
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:03,479
sale now you can drive these with that
 

357
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:07,610
sale now you can drive these with that
um but the production of of um these

358
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:07,620
um but the production of of um these
 

359
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,610
um but the production of of um these
scans in a very efficient way is one of

360
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:10,620
scans in a very efficient way is one of
 

361
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,529
scans in a very efficient way is one of
the last pieces that we still need to

362
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:12,539
the last pieces that we still need to
 

363
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,150
the last pieces that we still need to
really nail and then obviously there's

364
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,160
really nail and then obviously there's
 

365
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,590
really nail and then obviously there's
all the experiences around it I mean

366
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
all the experiences around it I mean
 

367
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,850
all the experiences around it I mean
right now we're kind of sitting in a

368
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:16,860
right now we're kind of sitting in a
 

369
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,350
right now we're kind of sitting in a
dark room which

370
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:18,360
dark room which
 

371
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,450
dark room which
um you know is you know familiar for for

372
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:20,460
um you know is you know familiar for for
 

373
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:22,850
um you know is you know familiar for for
your podcast but I think part of the the

374
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:22,860
your podcast but I think part of the the
 

375
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,650
your podcast but I think part of the the
vision for this over time

376
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:24,660
vision for this over time
 

377
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,830
vision for this over time
is um is you know not just having this

378
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:27,840
is um is you know not just having this
 

379
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,110
is um is you know not just having this
be like a video call I mean that's fine

380
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,120
be like a video call I mean that's fine
 

381
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,089
be like a video call I mean that's fine
it's it's cool or it feels like it's

382
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:32,099
it's it's cool or it feels like it's
 

383
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,710
it's it's cool or it feels like it's
immersive but

384
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:33,720
immersive but
 

385
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,790
immersive but
um you know you can you can do a video

386
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:34,800
um you know you can you can do a video
 

387
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,529
um you know you can you can do a video
call on your phone the thing that you

388
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:36,539
call on your phone the thing that you
 

389
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,390
call on your phone the thing that you
can do in the metaverse that is

390
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:38,400
can do in the metaverse that is
 

391
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,350
can do in the metaverse that is
different from what you can do on a

392
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:39,360
different from what you can do on a
 

393
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,570
different from what you can do on a
phone is like doing stuff where you're

394
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:41,580
phone is like doing stuff where you're
 

395
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,070
phone is like doing stuff where you're
physically there together and and

396
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,080
physically there together and and
 

397
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,510
physically there together and and
participating in things together and we

398
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:44,520
participating in things together and we
 

399
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,430
participating in things together and we
could play games like this

400
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:46,440
could play games like this
 

401
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,529
could play games like this
um we could have meetings uh like this

402
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:48,539
um we could have meetings uh like this
 

403
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,010
um we could have meetings uh like this
in in the future once you mix

404
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,020
in in the future once you mix
 

405
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,270
in in the future once you mix
um once you get mixed reality and

406
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:53,280
um once you get mixed reality and
 

407
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,309
um once you get mixed reality and
augmented reality we could have codec

408
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:55,319
augmented reality we could have codec
 

409
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:57,409
augmented reality we could have codec
avatars like this and go into a meeting

410
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:57,419
avatars like this and go into a meeting
 

411
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,730
avatars like this and go into a meeting
and have some people physically there

412
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:58,740
and have some people physically there
 

413
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,409
and have some people physically there
and have some people show up in this

414
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:00,419
and have some people show up in this
 

415
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,529
and have some people show up in this
photorealistic form uh superimposed on

416
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:03,539
photorealistic form uh superimposed on
 

417
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,809
photorealistic form uh superimposed on
the on the physical environment I've got

418
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:05,819
the on the physical environment I've got
 

419
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,189
the on the physical environment I've got
stuff like that is going to be super

420
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:07,199
stuff like that is going to be super
 

421
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,930
stuff like that is going to be super
powerful so we got to still build out

422
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:08,940
powerful so we got to still build out
 

423
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,909
powerful so we got to still build out
all those kind of applications and the

424
00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:10,919
all those kind of applications and the
 

425
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,010
all those kind of applications and the
use cases around it but I don't know I

426
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,020
use cases around it but I don't know I
 

427
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,570
use cases around it but I don't know I
think it's going to be a pretty wild uh

428
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:14,580
think it's going to be a pretty wild uh
 

429
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,029
think it's going to be a pretty wild uh
next few years around this I mean I just

430
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:17,039
next few years around this I mean I just
 

431
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,890
next few years around this I mean I just
I'm actually almost at a loss of Wars

432
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:18,900
I'm actually almost at a loss of Wars
 

433
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,350
I'm actually almost at a loss of Wars
this is just so incredible this is truly

434
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:21,360
this is just so incredible this is truly
 

435
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,089
this is just so incredible this is truly
incredible I I hope that people like

436
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:23,099
incredible I I hope that people like
 

437
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,670
incredible I I hope that people like
watching this can get a glimpse of like

438
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:25,680
watching this can get a glimpse of like
 

439
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,409
watching this can get a glimpse of like
how incredible it is it really feels

440
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:27,419
how incredible it is it really feels
 

441
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:28,730
how incredible it is it really feels
like we're in the same room like there

442
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:28,740
like we're in the same room like there
 

443
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,290
like we're in the same room like there
is that

444
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,300
is that
 

445
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,810
is that
um I guess there's an uncanny valley

446
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:31,820
um I guess there's an uncanny valley
 

447
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,250
um I guess there's an uncanny valley
that seems to have been crossed here

448
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,260
that seems to have been crossed here
 

449
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,850
that seems to have been crossed here
like it looks like you yeah I mean I

450
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:37,860
like it looks like you yeah I mean I
 

451
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,430
like it looks like you yeah I mean I
think there's still a bunch of tuning

452
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:40,440
think there's still a bunch of tuning
 

453
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,469
think there's still a bunch of tuning
that I think we'll want to do where

454
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:42,479
that I think we'll want to do where
 

455
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,829
that I think we'll want to do where
different people emote to different

456
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:45,839
different people emote to different
 

457
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,750
different people emote to different
extents right so I think one of the big

458
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:47,760
extents right so I think one of the big
 

459
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,750
extents right so I think one of the big
questions is you know like when you

460
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:50,760
questions is you know like when you
 

461
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,690
questions is you know like when you
smile how wide is your smile and how

462
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:53,700
smile how wide is your smile and how
 

463
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,850
smile how wide is your smile and how
wide do you want your smile to be

464
00:08:55,850 --> 00:08:55,860
wide do you want your smile to be
 

465
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,670
wide do you want your smile to be
um and I think getting that to be tuned

466
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:58,680
um and I think getting that to be tuned
 

467
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,190
um and I think getting that to be tuned
on a per person basis is

468
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:01,200
on a per person basis is
 

469
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,230
on a per person basis is
um is going to be one of the things that

470
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,240
um is going to be one of the things that
 

471
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,610
um is going to be one of the things that
we that we're going to need to figure

472
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:04,620
we that we're going to need to figure
 

473
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,810
we that we're going to need to figure
out

474
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:05,820
out
 

475
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,130
out
um you know it's like to what extent do

476
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:07,140
um you know it's like to what extent do
 

477
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,210
um you know it's like to what extent do
you want to give people control over

478
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:08,220
you want to give people control over
 

479
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,590
you want to give people control over
that

480
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:09,600
that
 

481
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,230
that
um you know some people might try to you

482
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
um you know some people might try to you

um you know some people might try to you
know might might prefer version of

484
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:13,680
know might might prefer version of
 

485
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,470
know might might prefer version of
themselves that's more emotive in their

Avatar than their actual faces you know
so for example you know I always get a

490
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:19,440
so for example you know I always get a
 

491
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,670
so for example you know I always get a
lot of critique and for

maybe you know for me I would it's
actually you know it's like I'd wanna

504
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:35,339
actually you know it's like I'd wanna
 

505
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,949
actually you know it's like I'd wanna
have my avatar really be able to better

506
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:36,959
have my avatar really be able to better
 

507

Express

508
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:38,459
Express
 

509
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:41,509
Express
um like how I'm feeling then then than

510

um like how I'm feeling then then than
 

511
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:42,710
um like how I'm feeling then then than
how I can do physically so I think

512
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:42,720
how I can do physically so I think
 

513
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,910
how I can do physically so I think
there's a question about how you want to

514
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:43,920
there's a question about how you want to
 

515
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,370
there's a question about how you want to
tune that but uh but overall yeah I mean

516
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,380
tune that but uh but overall yeah I mean
 

517
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,990
tune that but uh but overall yeah I mean
you we want to start from the Baseline

518
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:48,000
you we want to start from the Baseline
 

519
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,790
you we want to start from the Baseline
of capturing how people actually emote

520
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:49,800
of capturing how people actually emote
 

521
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,769
of capturing how people actually emote
and express themselves and I mean I

522
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:51,779
and express themselves and I mean I
 

523
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,449
and express themselves and I mean I
think the the initial version of this is

524
00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:53,459
think the the initial version of this is
 

525
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:55,009
think the the initial version of this is
has been pretty impressive and like you

526
00:09:55,009 --> 00:09:55,019
has been pretty impressive and like you
 

527
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:56,090
has been pretty impressive and like you

00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:58,320
um I do think we're we're kind of beyond
 

531
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,530
um I do think we're we're kind of beyond
the The Uncanny Valley here where it and

532
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,540
the The Uncanny Valley here where it and
 

533
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,690
the The Uncanny Valley here where it and
it does feel like you it doesn't feel uh

534
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:02,700
it does feel like you it doesn't feel uh
 

535
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,949
it does feel like you it doesn't feel uh
it doesn't feel weird or anything like

536
00:10:03,949 --> 00:10:03,959
it doesn't feel weird or anything like
 

537
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:04,790
it doesn't feel weird or anything like
that

538
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:04,800
that
 

539
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,130
that
I mean that's going to be the meme that

540
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:07,140
I mean that's going to be the meme that
 

541
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,290
I mean that's going to be the meme that
the two most monotone people are in a

542
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:09,300
the two most monotone people are in a
 

543
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,389
the two most monotone people are in a
metaverse together but I think that

544
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:11,399
metaverse together but I think that
 

545
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:14,930
metaverse together but I think that
actually makes it more difficult like

546
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:14,940
actually makes it more difficult like
 

547
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,970
actually makes it more difficult like
the the amazing thing here is that the

548
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:16,980
the the amazing thing here is that the
 

549
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,250
the the amazing thing here is that the
subtleties of the expression of the eyes

550
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,260
subtleties of the expression of the eyes
 

551
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,590
subtleties of the expression of the eyes
you know people say I'm monotone and

552
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:21,600
you know people say I'm monotone and
 

553
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,570
you know people say I'm monotone and
emotionless but I'm not it's just this

554
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:23,580
emotionless but I'm not it's just this
 

555
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:26,509
emotionless but I'm not it's just this
it may be my expression of emotion

556
00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:26,519
it may be my expression of emotion
 

557
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,210
it may be my expression of emotion
is more subtle usually like with the

558
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,220
is more subtle usually like with the
 

559
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,350
is more subtle usually like with the
eyes and that's one of the things I've

560
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:30,360
eyes and that's one of the things I've
 

561
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,930
eyes and that's one of the things I've
noticed is just how expressive the

562
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:32,940
noticed is just how expressive the
 

563
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,030
noticed is just how expressive the
subtle movement of the corners of the

564
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,040
subtle movement of the corners of the
 

565
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,590
subtle movement of the corners of the
eyes are in terms of displaying

566
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:36,600
eyes are in terms of displaying
 

567
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,750
eyes are in terms of displaying
happiness or boredom or all that kind of

568
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:38,760
happiness or boredom or all that kind of
 

569
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,970
happiness or boredom or all that kind of
stuff I'm curious to see just because

570
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:40,980
stuff I'm curious to see just because
 

571
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,110
stuff I'm curious to see just because
I've never done one of these before I've

572
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:42,120
I've never done one of these before I've
 

573
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,970
I've never done one of these before I've
never done a podcast as as one of these

574
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:43,980
never done a podcast as as one of these
 

575
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,889
never done a podcast as as one of these
codec avatars

576
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:45,899
codec avatars
 

577
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:48,470
codec avatars
um and I'm curious to see what what how

578
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:48,480
um and I'm curious to see what what how
 

579
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,329
um and I'm curious to see what what how
what people think of it because you know

580
00:10:50,329 --> 00:10:50,339
what people think of it because you know
 

581
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:51,889
what people think of it because you know
one of the issues that we've had in some

582
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:51,899
one of the issues that we've had in some
 

583
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:54,470
one of the issues that we've had in some
of the VR and and mixed reality work is

584
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:54,480
of the VR and and mixed reality work is
 

585
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,569
of the VR and and mixed reality work is
it tends to feel a lot more profound

586
00:10:56,569 --> 00:10:56,579
it tends to feel a lot more profound
 

587
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:58,970
it tends to feel a lot more profound
when you're in it than the 2D videos

588
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:58,980
when you're in it than the 2D videos
 

589
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,069
when you're in it than the 2D videos
capturing the experience so I think that

590
00:11:01,069 --> 00:11:01,079
capturing the experience so I think that
 

591
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:03,290
capturing the experience so I think that
this one because it's photorealistic

592
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:03,300
this one because it's photorealistic
 

593
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,769
this one because it's photorealistic
um may look kind of as amazing in 2D for

594
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:06,779
um may look kind of as amazing in 2D for
 

595
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:08,509
um may look kind of as amazing in 2D for
people watching it as it as it feels I

596
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:08,519
people watching it as it as it feels I
 

597
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:10,490
people watching it as it as it feels I
think to be in it but we've certainly

598
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:10,500
think to be in it but we've certainly
 

599
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,370
think to be in it but we've certainly
had this this um this issue where a lot

600
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:13,380
had this this um this issue where a lot
 

601
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,750
had this this um this issue where a lot
of the other things just it's like you

602
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:14,760
of the other things just it's like you
 

603
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,190
of the other things just it's like you
feel the sense of immersion when you're

604
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:16,200
feel the sense of immersion when you're
 

605
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,569
feel the sense of immersion when you're
in it that that doesn't quite translate

606
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:17,579
in it that that doesn't quite translate
 

607
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,610
in it that that doesn't quite translate
to a 2d screen but I don't know I'm

608
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:19,620
to a 2d screen but I don't know I'm
 

609
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,350
to a 2d screen but I don't know I'm
curious to see to see what people think

610
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,360
curious to see to see what people think
 

611
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,150
curious to see to see what people think
yeah I'm curious to see if people could

612
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:23,160
yeah I'm curious to see if people could
 

613
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,829
yeah I'm curious to see if people could
see that um

614
00:11:24,829 --> 00:11:24,839
see that um
 

615
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:26,690
see that um
like my heart is actually beating fast

616
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:26,700
like my heart is actually beating fast
 

617
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,170
like my heart is actually beating fast
now this is super interesting like the

618
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:30,180
now this is super interesting like the
 

619
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,850
now this is super interesting like the
that such

620
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:31,860
that such
 

621
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,650
that such
intimacy of conversation could be

622
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:33,660
intimacy of conversation could be
 

623
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,630
intimacy of conversation could be
achieved remotely there's been you know

624
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:35,640
achieved remotely there's been you know
 

625
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,850
achieved remotely there's been you know
I don't do remote podcasts for this

626
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:37,860
I don't do remote podcasts for this
 

627
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,090
I don't do remote podcasts for this
reason and this is like breaks all of

628
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:41,100
reason and this is like breaks all of
 

629
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,630
reason and this is like breaks all of
that this feels like just an incredible

630
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:43,640
that this feels like just an incredible
 

631
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:46,370
that this feels like just an incredible
transition to something else to the

632
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:46,380
transition to something else to the
 

633
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,170
transition to something else to the
different kind of communication breaks

634
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:48,180
different kind of communication breaks
 

635
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,269
different kind of communication breaks
all barriers like Geographic physical

636
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:50,279
all barriers like Geographic physical
 

637
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,870
all barriers like Geographic physical
barriers uh would you mentioned do you

638
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:53,880
barriers uh would you mentioned do you
 

639
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,610
barriers uh would you mentioned do you
have a sense of timeline in terms of how

640
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,620
have a sense of timeline in terms of how
 

641
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,889
have a sense of timeline in terms of how
many difficult things have to be solved

642
00:11:57,889 --> 00:11:57,899
many difficult things have to be solved
 

643
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:00,410
many difficult things have to be solved
to make this more accessible to like

644
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:00,420
to make this more accessible to like
 

645
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,389
to make this more accessible to like
scanning with a smartphone

646
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:02,399
scanning with a smartphone
 

647
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,550
scanning with a smartphone
yeah I mean I think we'll probably roll

648
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:04,560
yeah I mean I think we'll probably roll
 

649
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,410
yeah I mean I think we'll probably roll
this out progressively over time so it's

650
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:06,420
this out progressively over time so it's
 

651
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,790
this out progressively over time so it's
not gonna be like we roll it out and one

652
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:07,800
not gonna be like we roll it out and one
 

653
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,730
not gonna be like we roll it out and one
day everyone has a codec Avatar we want

654
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:10,740
day everyone has a codec Avatar we want
 

655
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,470
day everyone has a codec Avatar we want
to get more people scanned and into the

656
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:12,480
to get more people scanned and into the
 

657
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,370
to get more people scanned and into the
system

658
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:13,380
system
 

659
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,889
system
and then we want to start uh integrating

660
00:12:15,889 --> 00:12:15,899
and then we want to start uh integrating
 

661
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:18,170
and then we want to start uh integrating
it into each one of our apps right

662
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:18,180
it into each one of our apps right
 

663
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,750
it into each one of our apps right
making it so that you know I think that

664
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:20,760
making it so that you know I think that
 

665
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,430
making it so that you know I think that
for a lot of the work style things

666
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:22,440
for a lot of the work style things
 

667
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,050
for a lot of the work style things
productivity I think that this is going

668
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,060
productivity I think that this is going
 

669
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,850
productivity I think that this is going
to make a ton of sense in a lot of game

670
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:25,860
to make a ton of sense in a lot of game
 

671
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,410
to make a ton of sense in a lot of game
environments I mean this could be fine

672
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:27,420
environments I mean this could be fine
 

673
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,970
environments I mean this could be fine
but games tend to have their own style

674
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:28,980
but games tend to have their own style
 

675
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,130
but games tend to have their own style
right where you almost want to fit more

676
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:31,140
right where you almost want to fit more
 

677
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,590
right where you almost want to fit more
with the aesthetic style of the of the

678
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:33,600
with the aesthetic style of the of the
 

679
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,550
with the aesthetic style of the of the
game

680
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:34,560
game
 

681
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,530
game
um but I think for doing meetings and

682
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:36,540
um but I think for doing meetings and
 

683
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,150
um but I think for doing meetings and
one of the things that we get a lot of

684
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:38,160
one of the things that we get a lot of
 

685
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,970
one of the things that we get a lot of
feedback on work rooms where people are

686
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:40,980
feedback on work rooms where people are
 

687
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,590
feedback on work rooms where people are
pretty Blown Away by the experience and

688
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:42,600
pretty Blown Away by the experience and
 

689
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,150
pretty Blown Away by the experience and
this feeling that you can like

690
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
this feeling that you can like
 

691
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,970
this feeling that you can like
be remote but feel like you're

692
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:46,980
be remote but feel like you're
 

693
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,290
be remote but feel like you're
physically there around a table with

694
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:48,300
physically there around a table with
 

695
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,389
physically there around a table with
people but then you know we get some

696
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:50,399
people but then you know we get some
 

697
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:51,590
people but then you know we get some
feedback that people have a hard time

698
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:51,600
feedback that people have a hard time
 

699
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,690
feedback that people have a hard time
with the fact that the avatars are so

700
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:53,700
with the fact that the avatars are so
 

701
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,690
with the fact that the avatars are so
expressive and and and don't feel you

702
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:56,700
expressive and and and don't feel you
 

703
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,190
expressive and and and don't feel you
know as as realistic in that environment

704
00:12:58,190 --> 00:12:58,200
know as as realistic in that environment
 

705
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,050
know as as realistic in that environment
so I think something like this

706
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,060
so I think something like this
 

707
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,610
so I think something like this
um could make a very big difference for

708
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:01,620
um could make a very big difference for
 

709
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,290
um could make a very big difference for
those remote meetings and especially

710
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:03,300
those remote meetings and especially
 

711
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,269
those remote meetings and especially
with Quest 3 coming out which is going

00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:05,279
with Quest 3 coming out which is going
 

713
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,949
with Quest 3 coming out which is going
to be the first mainstream mixed reality

714
00:13:06,949 --> 00:13:06,959
to be the first mainstream mixed reality
 

715
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,150
to be the first mainstream mixed reality

or legs is that well we gotta get bad I
 

787
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,430
or legs is that well we gotta get bad I
mean that's that's its own challenge

um and and part of the question is also

790
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:24,060
um and and part of the question is also
 

791
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:27,650
um and and part of the question is also
so you have the scan then it takes a

792
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:27,660
so you have the scan then it takes a
 

793
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,970
so you have the scan then it takes a
certain amount of compute to go drive

794
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:28,980
certain amount of compute to go drive
 

795
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,069
certain amount of compute to go drive
that both for the sensors on the headset

796
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:31,079
that both for the sensors on the headset
 

797
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,269
that both for the sensors on the headset
and

798
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,279
and
 

799
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:34,670
and
um and then rendering it so one of the

800
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:34,680
um and then rendering it so one of the
 

801
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,230
um and then rendering it so one of the
things that we're working through is

802
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:36,240
things that we're working through is
 

803
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,509
things that we're working through is
what is the level of fidelity that is

804
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:38,519
what is the level of fidelity that is
 

805
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,189
what is the level of fidelity that is
optimal right you could do the full body

806
00:14:40,189 --> 00:14:40,199
optimal right you could do the full body
 

807
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,090
optimal right you could do the full body
in in kind of a codec and that can be

808
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:44,100
in in kind of a codec and that can be
 

809
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,490
in in kind of a codec and that can be
quite intensive but

810
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:46,500
quite intensive but
 

811
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,990
quite intensive but
um but one of the things that we're

812
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:48,000
um but one of the things that we're
 

813
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,370
um but one of the things that we're
we're thinking about is like all right

814
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:49,380
we're thinking about is like all right
 

815
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,410
we're thinking about is like all right
maybe you can kind of

816
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:51,420
maybe you can kind of
 

817
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,509
maybe you can kind of
Stitch a somewhat lower Fidelity version

818
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
Stitch a somewhat lower Fidelity version
 

819
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,670
Stitch a somewhat lower Fidelity version
of your body would still still have the

820
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:55,680
of your body would still still have the
 

821
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,030
of your body would still still have the
main kind of the major movements

822
00:14:59,030 --> 00:14:59,040
main kind of the major movements
 

823
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,730
main kind of the major movements
um but uh but but your face is really

824
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:01,740
um but uh but but your face is really
 

825
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,689
um but uh but but your face is really
the thing that we have the most

826
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:02,699
the thing that we have the most
 

827
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,370
the thing that we have the most
resolution on right in terms of being

828
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,380
resolution on right in terms of being
 

829
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,129
resolution on right in terms of being
able to read and express emotions I mean

830
00:15:07,129 --> 00:15:07,139
able to read and express emotions I mean
 

831
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,269
able to read and express emotions I mean
like you said

832
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:08,279
like you said
 

833
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:10,430
like you said
if you move your you know eyebrows like

834
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:10,440
if you move your you know eyebrows like
 

835
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,290
if you move your you know eyebrows like
a millimeter I mean that really changes

836
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:12,300
a millimeter I mean that really changes
 

837
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,670
a millimeter I mean that really changes
the expression and what you're you're

838
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
the expression and what you're you're
 

839
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,410
the expression and what you're you're
emoting whereas

840
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:15,420
emoting whereas
 

841
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,990
emoting whereas
you know I mean moving your your arm

842
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:18,000
you know I mean moving your your arm
 

843
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,509
you know I mean moving your your arm
like a an inch probably doesn't matter

844
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:20,519
like a an inch probably doesn't matter
 

845
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,610
like a an inch probably doesn't matter
quite as much so so yeah so I think that

846
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:22,620
quite as much so so yeah so I think that
 

847
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,290
quite as much so so yeah so I think that
we'll we do want to get all of that into

848
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:24,300
we'll we do want to get all of that into
 

849
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,970
we'll we do want to get all of that into
here and and that'll be some of the work

850
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:25,980
here and and that'll be some of the work
 

851
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,829
here and and that'll be some of the work
over the next period as well

852
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:27,839
over the next period as well
 

853
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,750
over the next period as well
so you mentioned Quest three that's

854
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:29,760
so you mentioned Quest three that's
 

855
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,730
so you mentioned Quest three that's
coming out I've gotten a chance to try

856
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:31,740
coming out I've gotten a chance to try
 

857
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,949
coming out I've gotten a chance to try
that too that's awesome so the how did

858
00:15:33,949 --> 00:15:33,959
that too that's awesome so the how did
 

859
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,150
that too that's awesome so the how did
you pull off the mixture so it's not

860
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,160
you pull off the mixture so it's not
 

861
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,949
you pull off the mixture so it's not
just virtual reality it's mixed reality

862
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:36,959
just virtual reality it's mixed reality
 

863
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,569
just virtual reality it's mixed reality
yeah I mean I think it's gonna be it's

864
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:38,579
yeah I mean I think it's gonna be it's
 

865
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,150
yeah I mean I think it's gonna be it's
gonna be the first mainstream

866
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,160
gonna be the first mainstream
 

867
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,650
gonna be the first mainstream
um mixed reality device I mean obviously

868
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:42,660
um mixed reality device I mean obviously
 

869
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,569
um mixed reality device I mean obviously
we ship Quest Pro

870
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:44,579
we ship Quest Pro
 

871
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:46,370
we ship Quest Pro
um last year but it was fifteen hundred

872
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:46,380
um last year but it was fifteen hundred
 

873
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,689
um last year but it was fifteen hundred
dollars

874
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:47,699
dollars
 

875
00:15:47,699 --> 00:15:50,030
dollars
um and well part of what I'm super proud

876
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,040
um and well part of what I'm super proud
 

877
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,530
um and well part of what I'm super proud
of is you know we try to innovate not

878
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:51,540
of is you know we try to innovate not
 

879
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,930
of is you know we try to innovate not
just on pushing the state of the art and

880
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:53,940
just on pushing the state of the art and
 

881
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,490
just on pushing the state of the art and
delivering new capabilities but making

882
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:55,500
delivering new capabilities but making
 

883
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,189
delivering new capabilities but making
it so it can be available to everyone

884
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:57,199
it so it can be available to everyone
 

885
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,689
it so it can be available to everyone
and you know we have this and it's

886
00:15:59,689 --> 00:15:59,699
and you know we have this and it's
 

887
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:02,329
and you know we have this and it's
coming out it's 500 and

888
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:02,339
coming out it's 500 and
 

889
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:04,189
coming out it's 500 and
um in in some ways I think the mixed

890
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:04,199
um in in some ways I think the mixed
 

891
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,750
um in in some ways I think the mixed
reality is actually better in quest 3

892
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:05,760
reality is actually better in quest 3
 

893
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,129
reality is actually better in quest 3
than it was

894
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:07,139
than it was
 

895
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:08,689
than it was
um than what we're using right now in

896
00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:08,699
um than what we're using right now in
 

897
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,790
um than what we're using right now in
quest Pro so I'm really proud of the

898
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:10,800
quest Pro so I'm really proud of the
 

899
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,769
quest Pro so I'm really proud of the
team for being able to deliver that kind

900
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:12,779
team for being able to deliver that kind
 

901
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,810
team for being able to deliver that kind
of an innovation and get it out but you

902
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:14,820
of an innovation and get it out but you
 

903
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,790
of an innovation and get it out but you
know some of this is just

904
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800
know some of this is just
 

905
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,509
know some of this is just
um

906
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:17,519
um
 

907
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,090
um
software you tune over time and get to

908
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,100
software you tune over time and get to
 

909
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,769
software you tune over time and get to
be better part of it is you put together

910
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:21,779
be better part of it is you put together
 

911
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,990
be better part of it is you put together
a product and you figure out what are

912
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,000
a product and you figure out what are
 

913
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,610
a product and you figure out what are
the bottlenecks in terms of making it a

914
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:25,620
the bottlenecks in terms of making it a
 

915
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,050
the bottlenecks in terms of making it a
good experience so we got the resolution

916
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,060
good experience so we got the resolution
 

917
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,569
good experience so we got the resolution
for the Mixed reality cameras and

918
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:29,579
for the Mixed reality cameras and
 

919
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,090
for the Mixed reality cameras and
sensors to be multiple times better in

920
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:32,100
sensors to be multiple times better in
 

921
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,009
sensors to be multiple times better in
quest 3 and we just figured that that

922
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:34,019
quest 3 and we just figured that that
 

923
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:35,689
quest 3 and we just figured that that
made a very big difference when we saw

924
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:35,699
made a very big difference when we saw
 

925
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,009
made a very big difference when we saw
the experience that we were able to put

926
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:37,019
the experience that we were able to put
 

927
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:38,530
the experience that we were able to put
together for Quest Pro

928
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:38,540
together for Quest Pro
 

929
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,090
together for Quest Pro
and part of it is also that you know

930
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,100
and part of it is also that you know
 

931
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,590
and part of it is also that you know
Qualcomm just came out with their next

932
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:42,600
Qualcomm just came out with their next
 

933
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:45,290
Qualcomm just came out with their next
Generation chipset for for VR and Mr

934
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:45,300
Generation chipset for for VR and Mr
 

935
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,389
Generation chipset for for VR and Mr
that we worked with them on a kind of

936
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:47,399
that we worked with them on a kind of
 

937
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,610
that we worked with them on a kind of
custom version of it but that was

938
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,620
custom version of it but that was
 

939
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,009
custom version of it but that was
available this year for Quest 3 and it

940
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:52,019
available this year for Quest 3 and it
 

941
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:53,990
available this year for Quest 3 and it
wasn't available in quest Pro so you

942
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
wasn't available in quest Pro so you
 

943
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,490
wasn't available in quest Pro so you
know in a way I'm Quest 3 even though

944
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:55,500
know in a way I'm Quest 3 even though
 

945
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,430
know in a way I'm Quest 3 even though
it's not you know the pro product

946
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:57,440
it's not you know the pro product
 

947
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,810
it's not you know the pro product
actually has a stronger chipset in it

948
00:16:59,810 --> 00:16:59,820
actually has a stronger chipset in it
 

949
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,910
actually has a stronger chipset in it
than the pro line at a third of the cost

950
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:01,920
than the pro line at a third of the cost
 

951
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,170
than the pro line at a third of the cost
so

952
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:03,180
so
 

953
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,030
so
um so I'm really excited to get this in

954
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:05,040
um so I'm really excited to get this in
 

955
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,130
um so I'm really excited to get this in
people's hands it um it does all the VR

956
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:07,140
people's hands it um it does all the VR
 

957
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,870
people's hands it um it does all the VR
stuff that that Quest 2 and the others

958
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:08,880
stuff that that Quest 2 and the others
 

959
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,909
stuff that that Quest 2 and the others
have done too it does it better because

960
00:17:10,909 --> 00:17:10,919
have done too it does it better because
 

961
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:13,789
have done too it does it better because
the display is better and and the chip

962
00:17:13,789 --> 00:17:13,799
the display is better and and the chip
 

963
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,169
the display is better and and the chip
is is better so you'll get better

964
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:15,179
is is better so you'll get better
 

965
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,890
is is better so you'll get better
graphics it's 40 thinner so it's um so

966
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:18,900
graphics it's 40 thinner so it's um so
 

967
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,010
graphics it's 40 thinner so it's um so
just more comfortable as well but but

968
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,020
just more comfortable as well but but
 

969
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,689
just more comfortable as well but but
the Mr is really the big capability

970
00:17:23,689 --> 00:17:23,699
the Mr is really the big capability
 

971
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:25,669
the Mr is really the big capability
shift and and part of what's exciting

972
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:25,679
shift and and part of what's exciting
 

973
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,890
shift and and part of what's exciting
about the whole Space right now is you

974
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:27,900
about the whole Space right now is you
 

975
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,169
about the whole Space right now is you
know this isn't like smartphones where

976
00:17:30,169 --> 00:17:30,179
know this isn't like smartphones where
 

977
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:31,370
know this isn't like smartphones where
you know companies put out a new

978
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,380
you know companies put out a new
 

979
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,570
you know companies put out a new
smartphone every year and you can almost

980
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:32,580
smartphone every year and you can almost
 

981
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,250
smartphone every year and you can almost
barely tell the difference between that

982
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:34,260
barely tell the difference between that
 

983
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,470
barely tell the difference between that
and the the one the year before it now

984
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
and the the one the year before it now
 

985
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,150
and the the one the year before it now
for this each time we put out a new

986
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:38,160
for this each time we put out a new
 

987
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,430
for this each time we put out a new
headset it has like a major new

988
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:40,440
headset it has like a major new
 

989
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,430
headset it has like a major new
capability and and the big one now

990
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:43,440
capability and and the big one now
 

991
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,350
capability and and the big one now
um is is mixed reality the ability to

992
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:45,360
um is is mixed reality the ability to
 

993
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,270
um is is mixed reality the ability to
basically take digital representations

994
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:47,280
basically take digital representations
 

995
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,169
basically take digital representations
of people or objects and and superimpose

996
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:51,179
of people or objects and and superimpose
 

997
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,390
of people or objects and and superimpose
them on the world and basically you know

998
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:53,400
them on the world and basically you know
 

999
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,909
them on the world and basically you know
I mean there's that one version of this

1000
00:17:55,909 --> 00:17:55,919
I mean there's that one version of this
 

1001
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,650
I mean there's that one version of this
is you're gonna kind of have these

1002
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:57,660
is you're gonna kind of have these
 

1003
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:01,070
is you're gonna kind of have these
augments or or Holograms and experiences

1004
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:01,080
augments or or Holograms and experiences
 

1005
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,570
augments or or Holograms and experiences
that you can kind of bring into your

1006
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:02,580
that you can kind of bring into your
 

1007
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,610
that you can kind of bring into your
living room or a meeting space or an

1008
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:04,620
living room or a meeting space or an
 

1009
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,930
living room or a meeting space or an
office

1010
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:05,940
office
 

1011
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,070
office
um another thing that I just think is

1012
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:07,080
um another thing that I just think is
 

1013
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,830
um another thing that I just think is
going to be a much kind of simpler

1014
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:09,840
going to be a much kind of simpler
 

1015
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,029
going to be a much kind of simpler
innovation

1016
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:11,039
innovation
 

1017
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,130
innovation
is that there are a lot of VR

1018
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,140
is that there are a lot of VR
 

1019
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,810
is that there are a lot of VR
experiences today that don't need to be

1020
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:14,820
experiences today that don't need to be
 

1021
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,850
experiences today that don't need to be
fully immersive and you know if you're

1022
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:16,860
fully immersive and you know if you're
 

1023
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,250
fully immersive and you know if you're
playing a shooter game or you're doing a

1024
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:19,260
playing a shooter game or you're doing a
 

1025
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,110
playing a shooter game or you're doing a
fitness experience now sometimes people

1026
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
fitness experience now sometimes people
 

1027
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,549
fitness experience now sometimes people
get worried about swinging their arms

1028
00:18:22,549 --> 00:18:22,559
get worried about swinging their arms
 

1029
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,049
get worried about swinging their arms
around like am I going to hit a lamp or

1030
00:18:24,049 --> 00:18:24,059
around like am I going to hit a lamp or
 

1031
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,870
around like am I going to hit a lamp or
something you know it's and and am I

1032
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:26,880
something you know it's and and am I
 

1033
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,370
something you know it's and and am I
going to run into something

1034
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:28,380
going to run into something
 

1035
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,049
going to run into something
so having that in mixed reality actually

1036
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:30,059
so having that in mixed reality actually
 

1037
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,450
so having that in mixed reality actually
is just a lot more comfortable for

1038
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:32,460
is just a lot more comfortable for
 

1039
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,010
is just a lot more comfortable for
people right you kind of still get the

1040
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,020
people right you kind of still get the
 

1041
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,409
people right you kind of still get the
immersion and the 3D experience

1042
00:18:36,409 --> 00:18:36,419
immersion and the 3D experience
 

1043
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:37,430
immersion and the 3D experience
um and you can you can have an

1044
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:37,440
um and you can you can have an
 

1045
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,450
um and you can you can have an
experience that just wouldn't be

1046
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:38,460
experience that just wouldn't be
 

1047
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,430
experience that just wouldn't be
possible in the physical world alone but

1048
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:40,440
possible in the physical world alone but
 

1049
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,049
possible in the physical world alone but
by being anchored to and be able to see

1050
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:42,059
by being anchored to and be able to see
 

1051
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,669
by being anchored to and be able to see
the physical world around you it's like

1052
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
the physical world around you it's like
 

1053
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,830
the physical world around you it's like
it just feels so much safer and more

1054
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:45,840
it just feels so much safer and more
 

1055
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,210

1101
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:29,090
the the fire yeah it's incredible how
it's all integrated but also like subtle

1102
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:29,100
it's all integrated but also like subtle
 

1103
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,789
it's all integrated but also like subtle
stuff like in a room with no windows you

1104
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:31,799
stuff like in a room with no windows you
 

1105

stuff like in a room with no windows you
can add Windows to it and you can look

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,430
but like it's still nice view outside
yeah yeah it's just it's really and so

1112
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:40,440
yeah yeah it's just it's really and so
 

1113
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,590
yeah yeah it's just it's really and so
that's pulled off by having cameras on

1114
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:42,600
that's pulled off by having cameras on
 

1115
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,990
that's pulled off by having cameras on
the outside of the headset that do the

1116
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,000
the outside of the headset that do the
 

1117
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,330
the outside of the headset that do the
pass-through in that technology is

1118
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:47,340
pass-through in that technology is
 

1119
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,130
pass-through in that technology is
incredible to do that on a oh yeah

1120
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,140
incredible to do that on a oh yeah
 

1121
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,350
incredible to do that on a oh yeah
headset yeah it's not just the cameras

1122
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:51,360
headset yeah it's not just the cameras
 

1123
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,570
headset yeah it's not just the cameras
you basically need to you need multiple

1124
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:53,580
you basically need to you need multiple
 

1125
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,669
you basically need to you need multiple
cameras to capture the different angles

1126
00:19:55,669 --> 00:19:55,679
cameras to capture the different angles
 

1127
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,370
cameras to capture the different angles
and and sort of the three-dimensional

1128
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:58,380
and and sort of the three-dimensional
 

1129
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,710
and and sort of the three-dimensional
space and then it's a pretty complex

1130
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:00,720
space and then it's a pretty complex
 

1131
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,930
space and then it's a pretty complex
compute problem an AI problem to map

1132
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:02,940
compute problem an AI problem to map
 

1133
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,270
compute problem an AI problem to map
that to your perspective right because

1134
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:05,280
that to your perspective right because
 

1135
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,590
that to your perspective right because
the cameras aren't exactly where your

1136
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:06,600
the cameras aren't exactly where your
 

1137
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,029
the cameras aren't exactly where your
eyes are because no two people's eyes

1138
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:08,039
eyes are because no two people's eyes
 

1139
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,590
eyes are because no two people's eyes
are you're not going to be in exactly

1140
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:09,600
are you're not going to be in exactly
 

1141
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,390
are you're not going to be in exactly
the same place you kind of need to to

1142
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:11,400
the same place you kind of need to to
 

1143
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,270
the same place you kind of need to to
get that to to to line up

1144
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,280
get that to to to line up
 

1145
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,010
get that to to to line up
um and then do that basically in real

1146
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:16,020
um and then do that basically in real
 

1147
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,750
um and then do that basically in real
time and then generate something that

1148
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:17,760
time and then generate something that
 

1149
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,570
time and then generate something that
looks that kind of feels natural

1150
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:20,580
looks that kind of feels natural
 

1151
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,370
looks that kind of feels natural
um and then

1152
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:22,380
um and then
 

1153
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,230
um and then
superimpose whatever digital objects you

1154
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:24,240
superimpose whatever digital objects you
 

1155
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,870
superimpose whatever digital objects you
want to put there so it's yeah it's a

1156
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:25,880
want to put there so it's yeah it's a
 

1157
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,390
want to put there so it's yeah it's a
very interesting technical Challenge and

1158
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:29,400
very interesting technical Challenge and
 

1159
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,070
very interesting technical Challenge and
um and we'll continue tuning this for

1160
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,080
um and we'll continue tuning this for
 

1161
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,529
um and we'll continue tuning this for
for the years to come as well but uh but

1162
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:33,539
for the years to come as well but uh but
 

1163
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,810
for the years to come as well but uh but
I'm pretty excited to to get this out

1164
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:35,820
I'm pretty excited to to get this out
 

1165
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,669
I'm pretty excited to to get this out
because I think quest 3 is going to be

1166
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:37,679
because I think quest 3 is going to be
 

1167
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,470
because I think quest 3 is going to be
the first device like this with that

1168
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:39,480
the first device like this with that
 

1169
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,669
the first device like this with that
millions of people are going to get

1170
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:40,679
millions of people are going to get
 

1171
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,770
millions of people are going to get
that's mixed reality and it's only when

1172
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:42,780
that's mixed reality and it's only when
 

1173
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,210
that's mixed reality and it's only when
you have millions of people using

1174
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:44,220
you have millions of people using
 

1175
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,650
you have millions of people using
something that you start getting the

1176
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:45,660
something that you start getting the
 

1177
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,029
something that you start getting the
whole developer Community really

1178
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:47,039
whole developer Community really
 

1179
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,610
whole developer Community really
starting to experiment and build stuff

1180
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:49,620
starting to experiment and build stuff
 

1181
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,570
starting to experiment and build stuff
because now they're going to be people

1182
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:50,580
because now they're going to be people
 

1183
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,250
because now they're going to be people
who actually use it

1184
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:52,260
who actually use it
 

1185
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:52,789
who actually use it
um

1186
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:52,799
um
 

1187
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,350
um
so I think we'll get you know we got

1188
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:54,360
so I think we'll get you know we got
 

1189
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,669
so I think we'll get you know we got
some of that flywheel going with Quest

1190
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:55,679
some of that flywheel going with Quest
 

1191
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,230
some of that flywheel going with Quest
Pro but I think it'll really get

1192
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:57,240
Pro but I think it'll really get
 

1193
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,970
Pro but I think it'll really get
accelerated once Quest 3 gets out there

1194
00:20:58,970 --> 00:20:58,980
accelerated once Quest 3 gets out there
 

1195
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,549
accelerated once Quest 3 gets out there
so yeah I'm I'm pretty excited about

1196
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:01,559
so yeah I'm I'm pretty excited about
 

1197
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,230
so yeah I'm I'm pretty excited about
this one plus there's hand tracking

1198
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:03,240
this one plus there's hand tracking
 

1199
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,210
this one plus there's hand tracking
without so you don't need to have a

1200
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:05,220
without so you don't need to have a
 

1201
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,130
without so you don't need to have a
control so this count the cameras aren't

1202
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:07,140
control so this count the cameras aren't
 

1203
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,690
control so this count the cameras aren't
interested in the pass-through

1204
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:08,700
interested in the pass-through
 

1205
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,570
interested in the pass-through
uh of the entire physical reality around

1206
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:11,580
uh of the entire physical reality around
 

1207
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:14,330
uh of the entire physical reality around
you is also tracking the details of your

1208
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:14,340
you is also tracking the details of your
 

1209
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,010
you is also tracking the details of your
hands in order to use that for like

1210
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:16,020
hands in order to use that for like
 

1211
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,510
hands in order to use that for like
gesture recognition this kind of stuff

1212
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:17,520
gesture recognition this kind of stuff
 

1213
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,730
gesture recognition this kind of stuff
yeah we've been able to get way further

1214
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:19,740
yeah we've been able to get way further
 

1215
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,250
yeah we've been able to get way further
on hand recognition in a shorter period

1216
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:22,260
on hand recognition in a shorter period
 

1217
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,289
on hand recognition in a shorter period
of time than I expected so that's been

1218
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:24,299
of time than I expected so that's been
 

1219
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:25,730
of time than I expected so that's been
pretty cool I don't know did you see the

1220
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:25,740
pretty cool I don't know did you see the
 

1221
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,390
pretty cool I don't know did you see the
the demo experience that we built around

1222
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:29,400
the demo experience that we built around
 

1223
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,430
the demo experience that we built around
um piano like yeah the piano learning to

1224
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:31,440
um piano like yeah the piano learning to
 

1225
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,010
um piano like yeah the piano learning to
play piano yeah it's incredible you're

1226
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:34,020
play piano yeah it's incredible you're
 

1227
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,810
play piano yeah it's incredible you're
basically playing piano on a table and

1228
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:35,820
basically playing piano on a table and
 

1229
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,029
basically playing piano on a table and
it's that's without any controller and

1230
00:21:38,029 --> 00:21:38,039
it's that's without any controller and
 

1231
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:40,130
it's that's without any controller and
like how well it matches physical

1232
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:40,140
like how well it matches physical
 

1233
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,909
like how well it matches physical
reality with no latency and it's not

1234
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:43,919
reality with no latency and it's not
 

1235
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,909
reality with no latency and it's not
it's tracking your hands with no latency

1236
00:21:45,909 --> 00:21:45,919
it's tracking your hands with no latency
 

1237
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:48,049
it's tracking your hands with no latency
and it's tracking all the people around

1238
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:48,059
and it's tracking all the people around
 

1239
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:50,630
and it's tracking all the people around
you with no latency integrating physical

1240
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:50,640
you with no latency integrating physical
 

1241
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,909
you with no latency integrating physical
reality and digital reality

1242
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:52,919
reality and digital reality
 

1243
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:54,950
reality and digital reality
obviously that connects exactly to this

1244
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:54,960
obviously that connects exactly to this
 

1245
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,029
obviously that connects exactly to this
Kodak Avatar which is in parallel allows

1246
00:21:59,029 --> 00:21:59,039
Kodak Avatar which is in parallel allows
 

1247
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,970
Kodak Avatar which is in parallel allows
us to have ultra realistic

1248
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:01,980
us to have ultra realistic
 

1249
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,549
us to have ultra realistic
copies of ourselves in this mixed

1250
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:04,559
copies of ourselves in this mixed
 

1251
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:05,570
copies of ourselves in this mixed
reality

1252
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:05,580
reality
 

1253
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:08,210
reality
it's uh so like it's all converging

1254
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:08,220
it's uh so like it's all converging
 

1255
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,890
it's uh so like it's all converging
towards like an incredible digital

1256
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:09,900
towards like an incredible digital
 

1257
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,230
towards like an incredible digital
experience in the metaverse to me

1258
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:12,240
experience in the metaverse to me
 

1259
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,669
experience in the metaverse to me
obviously I love the intimacy of

1260
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:13,679
obviously I love the intimacy of
 

1261
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,250
obviously I love the intimacy of
conversation so even this is awesome but

1262
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:16,260
conversation so even this is awesome but
 

1263
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,810
conversation so even this is awesome but
do you have other

1264
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:17,820
do you have other
 

1265
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,930
do you have other
ideas of what this unlocks of like

1266
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:20,940
ideas of what this unlocks of like
 

1267
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,390
ideas of what this unlocks of like
something like Kodak Avatar unlocks in

1268
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:23,400
something like Kodak Avatar unlocks in
 

1269
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,630
something like Kodak Avatar unlocks in
terms of applications in terms of uh

1270
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:26,640
terms of applications in terms of uh
 

1271
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,370
terms of applications in terms of uh
things we're able to do

1272
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:28,380
things we're able to do
 

1273
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,710
things we're able to do
well there's what you can do with

1274
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:30,720
well there's what you can do with
 

1275
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,090
well there's what you can do with
avatars overall in terms of

1276
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,100
avatars overall in terms of
 

1277
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,490
avatars overall in terms of
superimposing digital objects on the

1278
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:34,500
superimposing digital objects on the
 

1279
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,230
superimposing digital objects on the
physical world

1280
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:36,240
physical world
 

1281
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,430
physical world
um and then there's kind of

1282
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:37,440
um and then there's kind of
 

1283
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,570
um and then there's kind of
psychologically what is having

1284
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:38,580
psychologically what is having
 

1285
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,610
psychologically what is having
photorealistic do

1286
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:40,620
photorealistic do
 

1287
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,870
photorealistic do
um you know so

1288
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:41,880
um you know so
 

1289
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,549
um you know so
I I think we're moving towards a world

1290
00:22:43,549 --> 00:22:43,559
I I think we're moving towards a world
 

1291
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:44,570
I I think we're moving towards a world
where

1292
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:44,580
where
 

1293
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,490
where
you know we're going to have something

1294
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:46,500
you know we're going to have something
 

1295
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,909
you know we're going to have something
that looks like normal glasses where you

1296
00:22:49,909 --> 00:22:49,919
that looks like normal glasses where you
 

1297
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,529
that looks like normal glasses where you
can just see you see the physical world

1298
00:22:51,529 --> 00:22:51,539
can just see you see the physical world
 

1299
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:54,289
can just see you see the physical world
but you also see Holograms and in that

1300
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:54,299
but you also see Holograms and in that
 

1301
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:55,970
but you also see Holograms and in that
world I think that

1302
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:55,980
world I think that
 

1303
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,549
world I think that
they're going to be you know not too far

1304
00:22:58,549 --> 00:22:58,559
they're going to be you know not too far
 

1305
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,770
they're going to be you know not too far
off you know maybe you know by the end

1306
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:00,780
off you know maybe you know by the end
 

1307
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,510
off you know maybe you know by the end
of this decade we'll be living in a

1308
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:02,520
of this decade we'll be living in a
 

1309
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,070
of this decade we'll be living in a
world where there are kind of as many

1310
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:04,080
world where there are kind of as many
 

1311
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,230
world where there are kind of as many
Holograms when you walk into a room as

1312
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:06,240
Holograms when you walk into a room as
 

1313
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,630
Holograms when you walk into a room as
there are physical objects and it really

1314
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:08,640
there are physical objects and it really
 

1315
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,630
there are physical objects and it really
raises this interesting question about

1316
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:10,640
raises this interesting question about
 

1317
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,010
raises this interesting question about
what our

1318
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:13,020
what our
 

1319
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:15,770
what our
um about you know a lot of people have

1320
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:15,780
um about you know a lot of people have
 

1321
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,990
um about you know a lot of people have
this phrase where they they call the

1322
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:18,000
this phrase where they they call the
 

1323
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,450
this phrase where they they call the
physical world the real world and you

1324
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:20,460
physical world the real world and you
 

1325
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,310
physical world the real world and you
know I kind of think increasingly in the

1326
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:22,320
know I kind of think increasingly in the
 

1327
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,230
know I kind of think increasingly in the
physical world is super important but I

1328
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:24,240
physical world is super important but I
 

1329
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,909
physical world is super important but I
actually think the real world is the

1330
00:23:25,909 --> 00:23:25,919
actually think the real world is the
 

1331
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,830
actually think the real world is the
combination of the physical world and

1332
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
combination of the physical world and
 

1333
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,390
combination of the physical world and
the digital worlds coming together but

1334
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:29,400
the digital worlds coming together but
 

1335
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,010
the digital worlds coming together but
until this technology

1336
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:31,020
until this technology
 

1337
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,130
until this technology
they were sort of separate right it's

1338
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,140
they were sort of separate right it's
 

1339
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,330
they were sort of separate right it's
like you access the digital world

1340
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:35,340
like you access the digital world
 

1341
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,490
like you access the digital world
through a screen right and you know

1342
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:37,500
through a screen right and you know
 

1343
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,990
through a screen right and you know
maybe it's a small screen that you carry

1344
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,000
maybe it's a small screen that you carry
 

1345
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,430
maybe it's a small screen that you carry
around or it's a bigger screen when you

1346
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:40,440
around or it's a bigger screen when you
 

1347
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,830
around or it's a bigger screen when you
sit down at your desk and strap in for a

1348
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:42,840
sit down at your desk and strap in for a
 

1349
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,270
sit down at your desk and strap in for a
long session but

1350
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:44,280
long session but
 

1351
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,710
long session but
um but they're kind of fundamentally

1352
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:45,720
um but they're kind of fundamentally
 

1353
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,930
um but they're kind of fundamentally
divorced and disconnected and I think

1354
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:47,940
divorced and disconnected and I think
 

1355
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,370
divorced and disconnected and I think
part of what this technology is going to

1356
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:49,380
part of what this technology is going to
 

1357
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,710
part of what this technology is going to
do is bring those together into a single

1358
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:51,720
do is bring those together into a single
 

1359
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,990
do is bring those together into a single
coherent experience of what the modern

1360
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:54,000
coherent experience of what the modern
 

1361
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,450
coherent experience of what the modern
real world is which is it's got to be

1362
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:56,460
real world is which is it's got to be
 

1363
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,770
real world is which is it's got to be
physical because that we're physical

1364
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:57,780
physical because that we're physical
 

1365
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,990
physical because that we're physical
beings so the physical world is is

1366
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,000
beings so the physical world is is
 

1367
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,909
beings so the physical world is is
always going to be super important but

1368
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:01,919
always going to be super important but
 

1369
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,010
always going to be super important but
but increasingly I think a lot of the

1370
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,020
but increasingly I think a lot of the
 

1371
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,950
but increasingly I think a lot of the
things that we kind of think of

1372
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:06,960
things that we kind of think of
 

1373
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,230
things that we kind of think of
um can be digital Holograms I mean any

1374
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:09,240
um can be digital Holograms I mean any
 

1375
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,930
um can be digital Holograms I mean any
screen that you have can be a hologram

1376
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:11,940
screen that you have can be a hologram
 

1377
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,529
screen that you have can be a hologram
um you know any media in any book art

1378
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:15,539
um you know any media in any book art
 

1379
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,690
um you know any media in any book art
um you know it can basically be just as

1380
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:17,700
um you know it can basically be just as
 

1381
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,490
um you know it can basically be just as
effective as a hologram as a physical

1382
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:19,500
effective as a hologram as a physical
 

1383
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,830
effective as a hologram as a physical
object any game they were playing a

1384
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:21,840
object any game they were playing a
 

1385
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,450
object any game they were playing a
board game or

1386
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:23,460
board game or
 

1387
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,789
board game or
um or any kind of physical game cards

1388
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:25,799
um or any kind of physical game cards
 

1389
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,110
um or any kind of physical game cards
um you know ping pong things like that

1390
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,120
um you know ping pong things like that
 

1391
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,669
um you know ping pong things like that
they're they're often a lot better as

1392
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:28,679
they're they're often a lot better as
 

1393
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:30,169
they're they're often a lot better as
Holograms because you could just kind of

1394
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:30,179
Holograms because you could just kind of
 

1395
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,990
Holograms because you could just kind of
snap your fingers and them and have them

1396
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,000
snap your fingers and them and have them
 

1397
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,770
snap your fingers and them and have them
um

1398
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:33,780
um
 

1399
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,810
um
show up you know it's like you have a

1400
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:35,820
show up you know it's like you have a
 

1401
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,010
show up you know it's like you have a
ping pong table show up in your living

1402
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,020
ping pong table show up in your living
 

1403
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,149
ping pong table show up in your living
room but then you can snap your fingers

1404
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:38,159
room but then you can snap your fingers
 

1405
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,649
room but then you can snap your fingers
and have it be gone

1406
00:24:39,649 --> 00:24:39,659
and have it be gone
 

1407
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:42,409
and have it be gone
um so that's super powerful

1408
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:42,419
um so that's super powerful
 

1409
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:44,149
um so that's super powerful
um so I think that it's actually an

1410
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:44,159
um so I think that it's actually an
 

1411
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,430
um so I think that it's actually an
amazing thought experiment of like

1412
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:46,440
amazing thought experiment of like
 

1413
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,130
amazing thought experiment of like
how many physical things we have today

1414
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,140
how many physical things we have today
 

1415
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,810
how many physical things we have today
that could actually be better as

1416
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:50,820
that could actually be better as
 

1417
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,330
that could actually be better as
interactive Holograms

1418
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:53,340
interactive Holograms
 

1419
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,029
interactive Holograms
and that I think the the most important

1420
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:56,039
and that I think the the most important
 

1421
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,430
and that I think the the most important
thing obviously is people so the ability

1422
00:24:58,430 --> 00:24:58,440
thing obviously is people so the ability
 

1423
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,830
thing obviously is people so the ability
to you know have these mixed Hangouts

1424
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:00,840
to you know have these mixed Hangouts
 

1425
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,190
to you know have these mixed Hangouts
whether they're social or meetings where

1426
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:04,200
whether they're social or meetings where
 

1427
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,750
whether they're social or meetings where
you know you show up to a conference

1428
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:05,760
you know you show up to a conference
 

1429
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,090
you know you show up to a conference
room you're wearing glasses

1430
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,100
room you're wearing glasses
 

1431
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,470
room you're wearing glasses
um or a headset in the very near term

1432
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:09,480
um or a headset in the very near term
 

1433
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:11,330
um or a headset in the very near term
but you know hopefully by you know for

1434
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,340
but you know hopefully by you know for
 

1435
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,570
but you know hopefully by you know for
the next five years glasses or so and um

1436
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:14,580
the next five years glasses or so and um
 

1437
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,190
the next five years glasses or so and um
and you know you're there physically

1438
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:16,200
and you know you're there physically
 

1439
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,529
and you know you're there physically
some people are there physically

1440
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:18,539
some people are there physically
 

1441
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:20,270
some people are there physically
um but other people are just there as

1442
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:20,280
um but other people are just there as
 

1443
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,669
um but other people are just there as
Holograms and it feels like it's them

1444
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:22,679
Holograms and it feels like it's them
 

1445
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:24,769
Holograms and it feels like it's them
um who are right there and and also by

1446
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:24,779
um who are right there and and also by
 

1447
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:25,730
um who are right there and and also by
the way another thing that I think is

1448
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:25,740
the way another thing that I think is
 

1449
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,870
the way another thing that I think is
going to be fascinating about being able

1450
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:26,880
going to be fascinating about being able
 

1451
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,149
going to be fascinating about being able
to blend together the

1452
00:25:29,149 --> 00:25:29,159
to blend together the
 

1453
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,430
to blend together the
digital and physical worlds in this way

1454
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:31,440
digital and physical worlds in this way
 

1455
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,390
digital and physical worlds in this way
is we're also going to be able to embody

1456
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:35,400
is we're also going to be able to embody
 

1457
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,850
is we're also going to be able to embody
um AIS as well so I think you'll also

1458
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:37,860
um AIS as well so I think you'll also
 

1459
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,010
um AIS as well so I think you'll also
have meetings in the future where you're

1460
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:40,020
have meetings in the future where you're
 

1461
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,810
have meetings in the future where you're
basically you know maybe you're sitting

1462
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:41,820
basically you know maybe you're sitting
 

1463
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:44,029
basically you know maybe you're sitting
there physically and then you have you

1464
00:25:44,029 --> 00:25:44,039
there physically and then you have you
 

1465
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,049
there physically and then you have you
know a couple of other people who are

1466
00:25:45,049 --> 00:25:45,059
know a couple of other people who are
 

1467
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:47,210
know a couple of other people who are
there's Holograms and then you have like

1468
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:47,220
there's Holograms and then you have like
 

1469
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,549
there's Holograms and then you have like
Bob the AI who's an engineer on your

1470
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:49,559
Bob the AI who's an engineer on your
 

1471
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,710
Bob the AI who's an engineer on your
team who's helping with things and he

1472
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:51,720
team who's helping with things and he
 

1473
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,930
team who's helping with things and he
can now be embodied as a

1474
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:53,940
can now be embodied as a
 

1475
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,390
can now be embodied as a
um you know as as a a realistic Avatar

1476
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
um you know as as a a realistic Avatar
 

1477
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,070
um you know as as a a realistic Avatar
as well and just join the meeting

1478
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,080
as well and just join the meeting
 

1479
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,110
as well and just join the meeting
um in that way so I think that that

1480
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:00,120
um in that way so I think that that
 

1481
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,450
um in that way so I think that that
that's going to be pretty compelling

1482
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:02,460
that's going to be pretty compelling
 

1483
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,669
that's going to be pretty compelling
um as well so then okay so what can you

1484
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:04,679
um as well so then okay so what can you
 

1485
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,010
um as well so then okay so what can you
do with photorealistic avatars compared

1486
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:07,020
do with photorealistic avatars compared
 

1487
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,570
do with photorealistic avatars compared
to

1488
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:08,580
to
 

1489
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,950
to
um kind of the more expressive ones that

1490
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:09,960
um kind of the more expressive ones that
 

1491
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,890
um kind of the more expressive ones that
we have today well I think a lot of this

1492
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:12,900
we have today well I think a lot of this
 

1493
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,049
we have today well I think a lot of this
actually comes down to

1494
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:15,059
actually comes down to
 

1495
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:18,110
actually comes down to
acceptance of the technology

1496
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:18,120
acceptance of the technology
 

1497
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,490
acceptance of the technology
um and

1498
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:19,500
um and
 

1499
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,289
um and
because all the stuff that we're doing I

1500
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:21,299
because all the stuff that we're doing I
 

1501
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,390
because all the stuff that we're doing I
mean the the motion of your eyebrows the

1502
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:23,400
mean the the motion of your eyebrows the
 

1503
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,850
mean the the motion of your eyebrows the
motion of your eyes the cheeks and all

1504
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:25,860
motion of your eyes the cheeks and all
 

1505
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,890
motion of your eyes the cheeks and all
of that there's actually no reason why

1506
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:27,900
of that there's actually no reason why
 

1507
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,450
of that there's actually no reason why
you couldn't do that on an expressive

1508
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:29,460
you couldn't do that on an expressive
 

1509
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,950
you couldn't do that on an expressive
Avatar too I mean it wouldn't look

1510
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:30,960
Avatar too I mean it wouldn't look
 

1511
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,409
Avatar too I mean it wouldn't look
exactly like you but you could make a

1512
00:26:33,409 --> 00:26:33,419
exactly like you but you could make a
 

1513
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:35,450
exactly like you but you could make a
cartoon version of yourself and still

1514
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:35,460
cartoon version of yourself and still
 

1515
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,350
cartoon version of yourself and still
have it be almost as expressive but I I

1516
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:39,360
have it be almost as expressive but I I
 

1517
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,549
have it be almost as expressive but I I
do think that there's this bridge

1518
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:40,559
do think that there's this bridge
 

1519
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,350
do think that there's this bridge
between

1520
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,360
between
 

1521
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,570
between
the current state of of most our

1522
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:44,580
the current state of of most our
 

1523
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:46,909
the current state of of most our
interactions in the physical world and

1524
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:46,919
interactions in the physical world and
 

1525
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,049
interactions in the physical world and
where we're getting in the future with

1526
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:48,059
where we're getting in the future with
 

1527
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:50,570
where we're getting in the future with
this kind of hybrid physical and digital

1528
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:50,580
this kind of hybrid physical and digital
 

1529
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,450
this kind of hybrid physical and digital
world where I think it's gonna be a lot

1530
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:53,460
world where I think it's gonna be a lot
 

1531
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,230
world where I think it's gonna be a lot
easier for people to

1532
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:56,240
easier for people to
 

1533
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,549
easier for people to
kind of take some of these experiences

1534
00:26:58,549 --> 00:26:58,559
kind of take some of these experiences
 

1535
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,590
kind of take some of these experiences
seriously with the photorealistic

1536
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:00,600
seriously with the photorealistic
 

1537
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,630
seriously with the photorealistic
avatars to start and then I'm actually

1538
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:02,640
avatars to start and then I'm actually
 

1539
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,890
avatars to start and then I'm actually
really curious to see where it goes

1540
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:03,900
really curious to see where it goes
 

1541
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,510
really curious to see where it goes
longer term I could see a world where

1542
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:05,520
longer term I could see a world where
 

1543
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,370
longer term I could see a world where
people stick to the photo realistic and

1544
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:07,380
people stick to the photo realistic and
 

1545
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,590
people stick to the photo realistic and
maybe they modify them to make them a

1546
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:09,600
maybe they modify them to make them a
 

1547
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,330
maybe they modify them to make them a
little bit more interesting but maybe

1548
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:11,340
little bit more interesting but maybe
 

1549
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,130
little bit more interesting but maybe
fundamentally we like photorealistic

1550
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:13,140
fundamentally we like photorealistic
 

1551
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,390
fundamentally we like photorealistic
things

1552
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,400
things
 

1553
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,789
things
um but I could also see a world that

1554
00:27:16,789 --> 00:27:16,799
um but I could also see a world that
 

1555
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,529
um but I could also see a world that
once people get used to the photo the

1556
00:27:18,529 --> 00:27:18,539
once people get used to the photo the
 

1557
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,690
once people get used to the photo the
photorealistic avatars and they get used

1558
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:20,700
photorealistic avatars and they get used
 

1559
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:24,110
photorealistic avatars and they get used
to these experiences that I I actually

1560
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,120
to these experiences that I I actually
 

1561
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,190
to these experiences that I I actually
think that there could be a world where

1562
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:25,200
think that there could be a world where
 

1563
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,769
think that there could be a world where
people actually prefer

1564
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:27,779
people actually prefer
 

1565
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:28,310
people actually prefer
um

1566
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:28,320
um
 

1567
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,310
um
being able to express themselves in kind

1568
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:31,320
being able to express themselves in kind
 

1569
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,310
being able to express themselves in kind
of non you know ways that aren't so tied

1570
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:34,320
of non you know ways that aren't so tied
 

1571
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,769
of non you know ways that aren't so tied
to their physical reality and so I

1572
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:36,779
to their physical reality and so I
 

1573
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:37,909
to their physical reality and so I
that's one of the things that I'm really

1574
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:37,919
that's one of the things that I'm really
 

1575
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,250
that's one of the things that I'm really
curious about and I don't know in a

1576
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:40,260
curious about and I don't know in a
 

1577
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,110
curious about and I don't know in a
bunch of our internal experiments on

1578
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:42,120
bunch of our internal experiments on
 

1579
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,669
bunch of our internal experiments on
this one of the things that

1580
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:43,679
this one of the things that
 

1581
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,470
this one of the things that

we seem to like people just seem to just
think that that is completely normal

1610
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:18,840
think that that is completely normal
 

1611
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,210
think that that is completely normal

feel like it's weird
 

1615
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:23,269
feel like it's weird
um another thing that that we've

1616
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
um another thing that that we've
 

1617
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,210
um another thing that that we've
experienced with is um is basically you

1618

experienced with is um is basically you
 

1619
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,830
experienced with is um is basically you
have a photorealistic avatar that you're

1620
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:27,840

1621
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,510
have a photorealistic avatar that you're
talking to and then right next to them

1622
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
talking to and then right next to them
 

1623
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,370
talking to and then right next to them
you have an expressive kind of Cartoon

00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:31,380
you have an expressive kind of Cartoon
 

1625
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,430
you have an expressive kind of Cartoon
Avatar and that actually is pretty

1626
00:28:34,430 --> 00:28:34,440
Avatar and that actually is pretty
 

1627
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,769
Avatar and that actually is pretty
normal too right it's it's like it's not

1628
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:36,779
normal too right it's it's like it's not
 

1629
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:39,289
normal too right it's it's like it's not
that weird right to to basically being

1630
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:39,299
that weird right to to basically being
 

1631
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:40,970
that weird right to to basically being
interacting with with different people

1632
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:40,980
interacting with with different people
 

1633
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,250
interacting with with different people
in different modes like that so I'm not

1634
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:43,260
in different modes like that so I'm not
 

1635
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,510
in different modes like that so I'm not
sure I think it'll be an interesting

1636
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:44,520
sure I think it'll be an interesting
 

1637
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,310
sure I think it'll be an interesting
question to what extent these

1638
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:46,320
question to what extent these
 

1639
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,409
question to what extent these
photorealistic avatars are like

1640
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:48,419
photorealistic avatars are like
 

1641
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,590
photorealistic avatars are like
a key part of just transitioning from

1642
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:51,600
a key part of just transitioning from
 

1643
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,789
a key part of just transitioning from
being comfortable in the physical world

1644
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:52,799
being comfortable in the physical world
 

1645
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,490
being comfortable in the physical world
to this kind of new modern real world

1646
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:55,500
to this kind of new modern real world
 

1647
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,169
to this kind of new modern real world
that that kind of includes both the

1648
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:57,179
that that kind of includes both the
 

1649
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:59,330
that that kind of includes both the
digital and physical or if this is like

1650
00:28:59,330 --> 00:28:59,340
digital and physical or if this is like
 

1651
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:01,490
digital and physical or if this is like
the long-term way that it stays

1652
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:01,500
the long-term way that it stays
 

1653
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,230
the long-term way that it stays
um that's that's a I mean I think that

1654
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:03,240
um that's that's a I mean I think that
 

1655
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,430
um that's that's a I mean I think that
they're going to be useless for both the

1656
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:04,440
they're going to be useless for both the
 

1657
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,870
they're going to be useless for both the
expressive and the photorealistic over

1658
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:05,880
expressive and the photorealistic over
 

1659
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,010
expressive and the photorealistic over
time I just don't know what the balance

1660
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,020
time I just don't know what the balance
 

1661
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,930
time I just don't know what the balance
is going to be yeah it's a really good

1662
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:08,940
is going to be yeah it's a really good
 

1663
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,909
is going to be yeah it's a really good
interesting philosophical question but

1664
00:29:10,909 --> 00:29:10,919
interesting philosophical question but
 

1665
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,649
interesting philosophical question but
to me in the short term the

1666
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:12,659
to me in the short term the
 

1667
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:15,110
to me in the short term the
photorealistic is amazing to what I

1668
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,120
photorealistic is amazing to what I
 

1669
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,690
photorealistic is amazing to what I
would prefer like you said to work on

1670
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:17,700
would prefer like you said to work on
 

1671
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,570
would prefer like you said to work on
but like on a beach with a beer just to

1672
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:20,580
but like on a beach with a beer just to
 

1673
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,909
but like on a beach with a beer just to
see a buddy of mine remotely on a chair

1674
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:22,919
see a buddy of mine remotely on a chair
 

1675
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,789
see a buddy of mine remotely on a chair
next to me drinking a beer

00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:25,799
next to me drinking a beer
 

1677
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,149
next to me drinking a beer
I mean that as realistic as possible is

1678
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:29,159
I mean that as realistic as possible is
 

1679
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:31,070
I mean that as realistic as possible is
an incredible experience so I don't want

1680
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,080
an incredible experience so I don't want
 

1681
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,169
an incredible experience so I don't want

drinking beer looking at the ocean while
not being in the same place together I

1688
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:39,360
not being in the same place together I
 

1689
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,710
not being in the same place together I
mean that yeah that experience is just

1690
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:42,720
mean that yeah that experience is just
 

1691
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,909

1750
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,360
to shave this morning but but if I
 

1751
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,090
to shave this morning but but if I
hadn't you know I could still have this

1752
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:47,100
hadn't you know I could still have this
 

1753
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,490
hadn't you know I could still have this
photorealistic Avatar that is that is

1754
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:49,500
photorealistic Avatar that is that is
 

1755
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,769
photorealistic Avatar that is that is
more cleanly shaven right even if I'm

1756
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:51,779
more cleanly shaven right even if I'm
 

1757
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:54,049
more cleanly shaven right even if I'm
you know a few days in

1758
00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:54,059
you know a few days in
 

1759
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,510
you know a few days in
um physically so I do think that they're

1760
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:56,520
um physically so I do think that they're
 

1761
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,269
um physically so I do think that they're
gonna start to be these subtle questions

1762
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
gonna start to be these subtle questions
 

1763
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,210
gonna start to be these subtle questions
that seep in where the the Avatar is

1764
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:02,220
that seep in where the the Avatar is
 

1765
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,529
that seep in where the the Avatar is
realistic

1766
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:03,539
realistic
 

1767
00:31:03,539 --> 00:31:05,389
realistic
um in in the sense of this is kind of

1768
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:05,399
um in in the sense of this is kind of
 

1769
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,130
um in in the sense of this is kind of
what you looked like at the time of

1770
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:07,140
what you looked like at the time of
 

1771
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,769
what you looked like at the time of
capture but it's not necessarily

1772
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:08,779
capture but it's not necessarily
 

1773
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:12,169
capture but it's not necessarily
temporarily accurate to exactly what you

1774
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:12,179
temporarily accurate to exactly what you
 

1775
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,690
temporarily accurate to exactly what you
look like at this moment and I knew

1776
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:14,700
look like at this moment and I knew
 

1777
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,610
look like at this moment and I knew
they're gonna end up being

1778
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:16,620
they're gonna end up being
 

1779
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,590
they're gonna end up being
um a bunch of questions

1780
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:18,600
um a bunch of questions
 

1781
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,750
um a bunch of questions
that come from that over time that I

1782
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:20,760
that come from that over time that I
 

1783
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:21,950
that come from that over time that I
think are going to be fascinating too

1784
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:21,960
think are going to be fascinating too
 

1785
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,810
think are going to be fascinating too
you mean just like the nature of

1786
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:23,820
you mean just like the nature of
 

1787
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,149
you mean just like the nature of
identity of who we are are we the yeah

1788
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:26,159
identity of who we are are we the yeah
 

1789
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,549
identity of who we are are we the yeah
people you know how people do like like

1790
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:28,559
people you know how people do like like
 

1791
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,430
people you know how people do like like
summer Beachbody will people be for the

1792
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:31,440
summer Beachbody will people be for the
 

1793
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,169
summer Beachbody will people be for the
scan they'll try to lose some weight and

1794
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:33,179
scan they'll try to lose some weight and
 

1795
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:35,029
scan they'll try to lose some weight and
look their best and sexiest with the

1796
00:31:35,029 --> 00:31:35,039
look their best and sexiest with the
 

1797
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,889
look their best and sexiest with the
nice hair and everything like that I

1798
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:36,899
nice hair and everything like that I
 

1799
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,230
nice hair and everything like that I
mean it does

1800
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,240
mean it does
 

1801
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,289
mean it does
um it does raise the question of

1802
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:42,299
um it does raise the question of
 

1803
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,090
um it does raise the question of
you know if a lot of people interacting

1804
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,100
you know if a lot of people interacting
 

1805
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,590
you know if a lot of people interacting
with the digital version of ourselves

1806
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:45,600
with the digital version of ourselves
 

1807
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,769
with the digital version of ourselves
who are we really are we the The Entity

1808
00:31:48,769 --> 00:31:48,779
who are we really are we the The Entity
 

1809
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,310
who are we really are we the The Entity
driving the Avatar are we the Avatar

1810
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:51,320
driving the Avatar are we the Avatar
 

1811
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,750
driving the Avatar are we the Avatar
well I mean I think our physical bodies

1812
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
well I mean I think our physical bodies
 

1813
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,789
well I mean I think our physical bodies
also fluctuate and change over time too

1814
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:55,799
also fluctuate and change over time too
 

1815
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,409
also fluctuate and change over time too
so I think there's a similar question of

1816
00:31:57,409 --> 00:31:57,419
so I think there's a similar question of
 

1817
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:58,430
so I think there's a similar question of
like

1818
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,440
like
 

1819
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,409
like
which version of that are we right

1820
00:32:00,409 --> 00:32:00,419
which version of that are we right
 

1821
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,510
which version of that are we right
there's there's like the yeah I mean

1822
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:02,520
there's there's like the yeah I mean
 

1823
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,070
there's there's like the yeah I mean
it's and it's interesting identity

1824
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:04,080
it's and it's interesting identity
 

1825
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,010
it's and it's interesting identity
question because all right it's like

1826
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,020
question because all right it's like
 

1827
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,230
question because all right it's like
I don't know it's like weight fluctuates

1828
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:09,240
I don't know it's like weight fluctuates
 

1829
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,570
I don't know it's like weight fluctuates
or things like that it's like I I think

1830
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:11,580
or things like that it's like I I think
 

1831
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,830
or things like that it's like I I think
most people don't tend to think of

1832
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:12,840
most people don't tend to think of
 

1833
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,470
most people don't tend to think of
themselves as the uh well I don't know

1834
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:15,480
themselves as the uh well I don't know
 

1835
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,029
themselves as the uh well I don't know
it's an interesting psychological

1836
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:17,039
it's an interesting psychological
 

1837
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,130
it's an interesting psychological
question some maybe some people maybe a

1838
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,140
question some maybe some people maybe a
 

1839
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,149
question some maybe some people maybe a
lot of people do think about themselves

1840
00:32:20,149 --> 00:32:20,159
lot of people do think about themselves
 

1841
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,430
lot of people do think about themselves
as the kind of worst version

1842
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:22,440
as the kind of worst version
 

1843
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,230
as the kind of worst version
um but yeah but I think a lot of people

1844
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:24,240
um but yeah but I think a lot of people
 

1845
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,549
um but yeah but I think a lot of people
probably think about themselves the best

1846
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:25,559
probably think about themselves the best
 

1847
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,010
probably think about themselves the best
version and and uh and then it's like

1848
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:28,020
version and and uh and then it's like
 

1849
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:29,269
version and and uh and then it's like
what you are on a day-to-day basis

1850
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:29,279
what you are on a day-to-day basis
 

1851
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,510
what you are on a day-to-day basis
doesn't necessarily map to to um

1852
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:32,520
doesn't necessarily map to to um
 

1853
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,970
doesn't necessarily map to to um
to either of those so I know that's yeah

1854
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:34,980
to either of those so I know that's yeah
 

1855
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,710
to either of those so I know that's yeah
it is there will definitely be a bunch

1856
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:36,720
it is there will definitely be a bunch
 

1857
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,710
it is there will definitely be a bunch
of a bunch of social scientists and and

1858
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:39,720
of a bunch of social scientists and and
 

1859
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,350
of a bunch of social scientists and and
folks will have to you know in in

1860
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:42,360
folks will have to you know in in
 

1861
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,450
folks will have to you know in in
psychologists are really there's going

1862
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:44,460
psychologists are really there's going
 

1863
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,669
psychologists are really there's going
to be a lot to understand about how our

1864
00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:46,679
to be a lot to understand about how our
 

1865
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,370
to be a lot to understand about how our
perception of ourselves and others

1866
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:49,380
perception of ourselves and others
 

1867
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,230
perception of ourselves and others
um has shifted from this

1868
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:51,240
um has shifted from this
 

1869
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,389
um has shifted from this
well this might be a bit of a

1870
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:53,399
well this might be a bit of a
 

1871
00:32:53,399 --> 00:32:55,789
well this might be a bit of a
complicated and a dark question but one

1872
00:32:55,789 --> 00:32:55,799
complicated and a dark question but one
 

1873
00:32:55,799 --> 00:32:58,010
complicated and a dark question but one
of the first feelings I had

1874
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,020
of the first feelings I had
 

1875
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,350
of the first feelings I had
experiencing this is I would love to

1876
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:00,360
experiencing this is I would love to
 

1877
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,930
experiencing this is I would love to
talk to loved ones and the next question

1878
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:02,940
talk to loved ones and the next question
 

1879
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,789

I have is I would love to talk to people

1880
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:04,799
I have is I would love to talk to people
 

1881
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,830
I have is I would love to talk to people
who are no longer here that are loved

1882
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:06,840
who are no longer here that are loved
 

1883
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,950
who are no longer here that are loved
ones so like if you look into the future

1884
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:09,960
ones so like if you look into the future
 

1885
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,570
ones so like if you look into the future
is that something you think about who

1886
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:11,580
is that something you think about who
 

1887
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,789
is that something you think about who
people who pass away but they can still

1888
00:33:13,789 --> 00:33:13,799
people who pass away but they can still
 

1889
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,350
people who pass away but they can still
exist in the metaverse you can still

1890
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:15,360
exist in the metaverse you can still
 

1891
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,130
exist in the metaverse you can still
have

1892
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,140
have
 

1893
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,870
have
you know talk to your father talk to

1894
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:17,880
you know talk to your father talk to
 

1895
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,149
you know talk to your father talk to
your grandfather and grandmother and a

1896
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:20,159
your grandfather and grandmother and a
 

1897
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:21,950
your grandfather and grandmother and a
mother once they pass away

1898
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:21,960
mother once they pass away
 

1899
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,669
mother once they pass away
the power of that experience is one of

1900
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:25,679
the power of that experience is one of
 

1901
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,049
the power of that experience is one of
the first things my mind jumped to

1902
00:33:27,049 --> 00:33:27,059
the first things my mind jumped to
 

1903
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:30,710
the first things my mind jumped to
because it's like this is so real

1904
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:30,720
because it's like this is so real
 

1905
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,509
because it's like this is so real
yeah I think that

1906
00:33:32,509 --> 00:33:32,519
yeah I think that
 

1907
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,490
yeah I think that
there are a lot of norms and things that

1908
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:34,500
there are a lot of norms and things that
 

1909
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,009
there are a lot of norms and things that
people have to figure out around that

1910
00:33:36,009 --> 00:33:36,019
people have to figure out around that
 

1911
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:38,750
people have to figure out around that
there's probably some balance where you

1912
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:38,760
there's probably some balance where you
 

1913
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:41,090
there's probably some balance where you
know if someone is has lost a loved one

1914
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:41,100
know if someone is has lost a loved one
 

1915
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:44,630
know if someone is has lost a loved one
and is grieving there there may be

1916
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:44,640
and is grieving there there may be
 

1917
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,149
and is grieving there there may be
the way is in which you know being able

1918
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:47,159
the way is in which you know being able
 

1919
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:50,090
the way is in which you know being able
to interact or relive certain memories

1920
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:50,100
to interact or relive certain memories
 

1921
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,190
to interact or relive certain memories
could be helpful but then there's also

1922
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:52,200
could be helpful but then there's also
 

1923
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,110
could be helpful but then there's also
probably an extent to which it could

1924
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:54,120
probably an extent to which it could
 

1925
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,930
probably an extent to which it could
become unhealthy and I mean I'm not an

1926
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:56,940
become unhealthy and I mean I'm not an
 

1927
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,549
become unhealthy and I mean I'm not an
expert in that so I think we'd have to

1928
00:33:58,549 --> 00:33:58,559
expert in that so I think we'd have to
 

1929
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,710
expert in that so I think we'd have to
study that and understand it in more

1930
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:00,720
study that and understand it in more
 

1931
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,350
study that and understand it in more
detail we have you know a fair amount of

1932
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:03,360
detail we have you know a fair amount of
 

1933
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,669
detail we have you know a fair amount of
experience

1934
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:04,679
experience
 

1935
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,629
experience
with how to handle death and identity in

1936
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:08,639
with how to handle death and identity in
 

1937
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,430
with how to handle death and identity in
people's digital content through social

1938
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:10,440
people's digital content through social
 

1939
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,230
people's digital content through social
media already unfortunately right

1940
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,240
media already unfortunately right
 

1941
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,389
media already unfortunately right
whether you know there's

1942
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:14,399
whether you know there's
 

1943
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,589
whether you know there's
um you know unfortunately you know

1944
00:34:15,589 --> 00:34:15,599
um you know unfortunately you know
 

1945
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,290
um you know unfortunately you know
people who use our services die every

1946
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,300
people who use our services die every
 

1947
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,869
people who use our services die every
day and their families you know often

1948
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:20,879
day and their families you know often
 

1949
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,609
day and their families you know often
want to have access to their profiles

1950
00:34:22,609 --> 00:34:22,619
want to have access to their profiles
 

1951
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,710
want to have access to their profiles
and we have whole protocols that we go

1952
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:24,720
and we have whole protocols that we go
 

1953
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,570
and we have whole protocols that we go
through where there are certain parts of

1954
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:26,580
through where there are certain parts of
 

1955
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,710
through where there are certain parts of
it that

1956
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:27,720
it that
 

1957
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:29,869
it that
um that we try to memorialize so that

1958
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:29,879
um that we try to memorialize so that
 

1959
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:32,450
um that we try to memorialize so that
way the the family can can get access to

1960
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:32,460
way the the family can can get access to
 

1961
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,770
way the the family can can get access to
it that way the account doesn't just go

1962
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:33,780
it that way the account doesn't just go
 

1963
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,510
it that way the account doesn't just go
away immediately but then there are

1964
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:35,520
away immediately but then there are
 

1965
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,070
away immediately but then there are
other things that are you know important

1966
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,080
other things that are you know important
 

1967
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,690
other things that are you know important
kind of private things that that person

1968
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:38,700
kind of private things that that person
 

1969
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,710
kind of private things that that person
has like we're not going to give the

1970
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:39,720
has like we're not going to give the
 

1971
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,750
has like we're not going to give the
family access to someone's messages you

1972
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:41,760
family access to someone's messages you
 

1973
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:44,270
family access to someone's messages you
know for example so

1974
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:44,280
know for example so
 

1975
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,010
know for example so
um so yeah I think that there's there's

1976
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:46,020
um so yeah I think that there's there's
 

1977
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,470
um so yeah I think that there's there's
some best practices I think from the

1978
00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:48,480
some best practices I think from the
 

1979
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,149
some best practices I think from the
current digital world that will carry

1980
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
current digital world that will carry
 

1981
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,649
current digital world that will carry
over but

1982
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:51,659
over but
 

1983
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,270
over but
um but yeah I think that this will

1984
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:53,280
um but yeah I think that this will
 

1985
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,950
um but yeah I think that this will
enable some different things

1986
00:34:54,950 --> 00:34:54,960
enable some different things
 

1987
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,470
enable some different things
another version of this is is how this

1988
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:57,480
another version of this is is how this
 

1989
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,990
another version of this is is how this
intersects with AIS right because

1990
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
intersects with AIS right because
 

1991
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,650
intersects with AIS right because
and one of the the things that that were

1992
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:03,660
and one of the the things that that were
 

1993
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,770
and one of the the things that that were
really focused on is you know we we want

1994
00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:06,780
really focused on is you know we we want
 

1995
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,510
really focused on is you know we we want
there to we want the world to evolve in

1996
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:08,520
there to we want the world to evolve in
 

1997
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,790
there to we want the world to evolve in
a way where there isn't like a single AI

1998
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:10,800
a way where there isn't like a single AI
 

1999
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,890
a way where there isn't like a single AI
super intelligence but where you know a

2000
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:12,900
super intelligence but where you know a
 

2001
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:15,410
super intelligence but where you know a
lot of people are empowered by having AI

2002
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:15,420
lot of people are empowered by having AI
 

2003
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:18,109
lot of people are empowered by having AI
tools to to do their jobs and you know

2004
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:18,119
tools to to do their jobs and you know
 

2005
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:20,089
tools to to do their jobs and you know
make their lives better and if you're a

2006
00:35:20,089 --> 00:35:20,099
make their lives better and if you're a
 

2007
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,190
make their lives better and if you're a
Creator right and

2008
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,200
Creator right and
 

2009
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,890
Creator right and
or if you run a you know podcast like

2010
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:24,900
or if you run a you know podcast like
 

2011
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,230
or if you run a you know podcast like
you do then you know you have a big

2012
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:27,240
you do then you know you have a big
 

2013
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,270
you do then you know you have a big
community of people who are super

2014
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:29,280

00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:36,300
online outside of the the podcast as
 

2023
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,450
online outside of the the podcast as
well but I mean there's way more demand

2024
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:38,460
well but I mean there's way more demand

community more but you just are limited
 

2031
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,730
community more but you just are limited
by the number of hours in the day so you

2032
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:46,740
by the number of hours in the day so you
 

2033
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,950
by the number of hours in the day so you
know at some point I think making it so

2034
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:48,960
know at some point I think making it so
 

2035
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,770
know at some point I think making it so
that you could build

2036
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:51,780
that you could build
 

2037
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:54,950
that you could build
um an AI version of yourself that could

2038
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:54,960
um an AI version of yourself that could
 

2039
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,569
um an AI version of yourself that could
interact with people you know not after

2040
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:56,579
interact with people you know not after
 

2041
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,430
interact with people you know not after
you die but but while you're here to

00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,829
um you know help help people kind of
fulfill this desire to interact with you

2048
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:03,839

and your desire to build a community and

2050
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:06,119
and your desire to build a community and
 

2051
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,990

there's a a lot of interesting questions

2052
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,000
there's a a lot of interesting questions
 

2053
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,550
there's a a lot of interesting questions
around that

2054
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:10,560
around that
 

2055
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,810
around that
um and you know that's obviously it's

2056
00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:11,820
um and you know that's obviously it's
 

2057
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,970
um and you know that's obviously it's
not just in in the metaverse I think you

2058
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:13,980
not just in in the metaverse I think you
 

2059
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,950
not just in in the metaverse I think you
know we'd want to make that work you

2060
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:15,960
know we'd want to make that work you
 

2061
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,230
know we'd want to make that work you
know across all the messaging platforms

2062
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:18,240
know across all the messaging platforms
 

2063
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,030
know across all the messaging platforms
you know WhatsApp and messenger and

2064
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,040
you know WhatsApp and messenger and
 

2065
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,530
you know WhatsApp and messenger and
Instagram Direct but you know there's

2066
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:21,540
Instagram Direct but you know there's
 

2067
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,030
Instagram Direct but you know there's
certainly you know a version of that

2068
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:23,040
certainly you know a version of that
 

2069
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,370
certainly you know a version of that
where if you could have an avatar

2070
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:25,380
where if you could have an avatar
 

2071
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,750
where if you could have an avatar
version of yourself in the metaverse

2072
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:26,760
version of yourself in the metaverse
 

2073
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,130
version of yourself in the metaverse
that people could interact with and you

2074
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:28,140
that people could interact with and you
 

2075
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:30,770
that people could interact with and you
could Define that sort of an AI

2076
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:30,780
could Define that sort of an AI
 

2077
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,089
could Define that sort of an AI
um version where you know people who

2078
00:36:32,089 --> 00:36:32,099
um version where you know people who
 

2079
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:33,589
um version where you know people who
know that they're interacting with an AI

2080
00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:33,599
know that they're interacting with an AI
 

2081
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:35,990
know that they're interacting with an AI
that it's not you know the the kind of

2082
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:36,000
that it's not you know the the kind of
 

2083
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,030
that it's not you know the the kind of
physical version of you but maybe that

2084
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:38,040
physical version of you but maybe that
 

2085
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,770
physical version of you but maybe that
AI even if they know it's an AI is the

2086
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:39,780
AI even if they know it's an AI is the
 

2087
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,270
AI even if they know it's an AI is the
next best thing because they're probably

2088
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:41,280
next best thing because they're probably
 

2089
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,770
next best thing because they're probably
not gonna you know necessarily all get

2090
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:42,780
not gonna you know necessarily all get
 

2091
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,010
not gonna you know necessarily all get
to interact with you directly I I think

2092
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:46,020
to interact with you directly I I think
 

2093
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,870
to interact with you directly I I think
that could be a really compelling

2094
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:47,880
that could be a really compelling
 

2095
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,250
that could be a really compelling
experience there's a lot of things that

2096
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:49,260
experience there's a lot of things that
 

2097
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,230
experience there's a lot of things that
we need to get right about it

2098
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:51,240
we need to get right about it
 

2099
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,930
we need to get right about it
um that you know it's we're not ready to

2100
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:53,940
um that you know it's we're not ready to
 

2101
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,970
um that you know it's we're not ready to
release the the version that a Creator

2102
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:55,980
release the the version that a Creator
 

2103
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,470
release the the version that a Creator
can can kind of build a version of

2104
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:57,480
can can kind of build a version of
 

2105
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,329
can can kind of build a version of
themselves yet but we're starting to

2106
00:36:59,329 --> 00:36:59,339
themselves yet but we're starting to
 

2107
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:01,910
themselves yet but we're starting to
experiment with it in terms of releasing

2108
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:01,920
experiment with it in terms of releasing
 

2109
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,890
experiment with it in terms of releasing
a number of AIS that people can interact

2110
00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:03,900
a number of AIS that people can interact
 

2111
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,690
a number of AIS that people can interact
with in different ways

2112
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:05,700
with in different ways
 

2113
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,390
with in different ways
um and I think that that is is also just

2114
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
um and I think that that is is also just
 

2115
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,609
um and I think that that is is also just
going to be a very powerful

2116
00:37:10,609 --> 00:37:10,619
going to be a very powerful
 

2117
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:11,990
going to be a very powerful
um you know set of capabilities that

2118
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,000
um you know set of capabilities that
 

2119
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,750
um you know set of capabilities that
people have over time so you've made

2120
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:14,760
people have over time so you've made
 

2121
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,470
people have over time so you've made
major strides in developing these early

2122
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:18,480
major strides in developing these early
 

2123
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,109
major strides in developing these early
AI personalities

2124
00:37:21,109 --> 00:37:21,119
AI personalities
 

2125
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,790
AI personalities
um with the idea where you can talk to

2126
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
um with the idea where you can talk to
 

2127
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,190
um with the idea where you can talk to
them Across The Meta apps and have like

2128
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:25,200
them Across The Meta apps and have like
 

2129
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,950
them Across The Meta apps and have like
interesting Unique Kind of

2130
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:27,960
interesting Unique Kind of
 

2131
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,650
interesting Unique Kind of
conversations what can you describe your

2132
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:30,660
conversations what can you describe your
 

2133
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,329
conversations what can you describe your
vision there in these early strides and

2134
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:32,339
vision there in these early strides and
 

2135
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,490
vision there in these early strides and
what are some technical challenges there

2136
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:34,500
what are some technical challenges there
 

2137
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,430
what are some technical challenges there
yeah so I mean a lot of the vision comes

2138
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,440
yeah so I mean a lot of the vision comes
 

2139
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,670
yeah so I mean a lot of the vision comes
from this idea that you know I I don't I

2140
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:40,680
from this idea that you know I I don't I
 

2141
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,930
from this idea that you know I I don't I
don't think we necessarily want there to

2142
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:41,940
don't think we necessarily want there to
 

2143
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:44,329
don't think we necessarily want there to
be like one big super intelligence we

2144
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:44,339
be like one big super intelligence we
 

2145
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:47,030
be like one big super intelligence we
want to empower everyone to both you

2146
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:47,040
want to empower everyone to both you
 

2147
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,470
want to empower everyone to both you
know have more fun accomplish their

2148
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:48,480
know have more fun accomplish their
 

2149
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,329
know have more fun accomplish their
business goals you know it's just

2150
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:50,339
business goals you know it's just
 

2151
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:52,609
business goals you know it's just
everything that they're trying to do and

2152
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:52,619
everything that they're trying to do and
 

2153
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,170
everything that they're trying to do and
you know we don't tend to have

2154
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:54,180
you know we don't tend to have
 

2155
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,089
you know we don't tend to have
you know one person that we work with on

2156
00:37:56,089 --> 00:37:56,099
you know one person that we work with on
 

2157
00:37:56,099 --> 00:37:57,050
you know one person that we work with on
everything and I don't think in the

2158
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:57,060
everything and I don't think in the
 

2159
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,849
everything and I don't think in the
future we're going to have you know one

2160
00:37:58,849 --> 00:37:58,859
future we're going to have you know one
 

2161
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,349
future we're going to have you know one
AI that we work with I think you're

2162
00:38:00,349 --> 00:38:00,359
AI that we work with I think you're
 

2163
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,270
AI that we work with I think you're
going to want a

2164
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:02,280
going to want a
 

2165
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,370
going to want a
variety of these

2166
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:04,380
variety of these
 

2167
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,109
variety of these
um so there are a bunch of different

2168
00:38:06,109 --> 00:38:06,119
um so there are a bunch of different
 

2169
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:07,550
um so there are a bunch of different
uses

2170
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:07,560
uses
 

2171
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,170
uses
um if some will be kind of more

2172
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:09,180
um if some will be kind of more
 

2173
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,810
um if some will be kind of more
assistant oriented there's a sort of the

2174
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:11,820
assistant oriented there's a sort of the
 

2175
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,609
assistant oriented there's a sort of the
kind of plain and simple one that we

2176
00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:13,619
kind of plain and simple one that we
 

2177
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:15,349
kind of plain and simple one that we
that we're building is called just meta

2178
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:15,359
that we're building is called just meta
 

2179
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,530
that we're building is called just meta
AI it's simple it you can chat with it

2180
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:18,540
AI it's simple it you can chat with it
 

2181
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,329
AI it's simple it you can chat with it
in any of your threads

2182
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:20,339
in any of your threads
 

2183
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,890
in any of your threads
um it doesn't have a face right it's

2184
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:21,900
um it doesn't have a face right it's
 

2185
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:23,630
um it doesn't have a face right it's
just it's

2186
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:23,640
just it's
 

2187
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,730
just it's
um it's just kind of more vanilla and

2188
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:25,740
um it's just kind of more vanilla and
 

2189
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:28,670
um it's just kind of more vanilla and
and neutral and and kind of factual but

2190
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:28,680
and neutral and and kind of factual but
 

2191
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,290
and neutral and and kind of factual but
it can help you with a bunch of stuff

2192
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:30,300
it can help you with a bunch of stuff
 

2193
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:33,010
it can help you with a bunch of stuff
then there were a bunch of cases that

2194
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:33,020
then there were a bunch of cases that
 

2195
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,050
then there were a bunch of cases that
are more kind of business oriented let's

2196
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:36,060
are more kind of business oriented let's
 

2197
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,849
are more kind of business oriented let's
say you want to contact a a small

2198
00:38:37,849 --> 00:38:37,859
say you want to contact a a small
 

2199
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:39,290
say you want to contact a a small
business

2200
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:39,300
business
 

2201
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,390
business
um you know similarly you know that

2202

00:41:18,589 --> 00:41:18,599
is easier because it doesn't need to
 

2347
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:22,370
is easier because it doesn't need to
stick exactly to what you know that

it's just a new character that we
 

2355
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,130
it's just a new character that we
created so even though there's a snoop

in that case is you know he's

2358
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:30,300
in that case is you know he's
 

2359
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,550
in that case is you know he's
um you know he's basically an actor

2360
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:31,560
um you know he's basically an actor
 

2361
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,170
um you know he's basically an actor
right he's playing the the dungeon

2362
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:33,180
right he's playing the the dungeon
 

2363
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,730
right he's playing the the dungeon
master but it's not Snoop Dogg right

2364
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:34,740
master but it's not Snoop Dogg right
 

2365
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,890
master but it's not Snoop Dogg right
it's it's um you know over the the

2366
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:36,900
it's it's um you know over the the
 

2367
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,690
it's it's um you know over the the
dungeon master is

2368
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:38,700
dungeon master is
 

2369
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,349
dungeon master is
um

2370
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:39,359
um
 

2371
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,270
um
if you want to actually make it so that

2372
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:41,280
if you want to actually make it so that
 

2373
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,109
if you want to actually make it so that
you have an AI embodying a real creator

2374
00:41:45,109 --> 00:41:45,119
you have an AI embodying a real creator
 

2375
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,210
you have an AI embodying a real creator
there's a whole set of things that you

2376
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:47,220
there's a whole set of things that you
 

2377
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,210
there's a whole set of things that you
need to do to make sure that that AI is

2378
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,220
need to do to make sure that that AI is
 

2379
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,550
need to do to make sure that that AI is
not going to say things that the creator

2380
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:52,560
not going to say things that the creator
 

2381
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,190
not going to say things that the creator
doesn't want right and

2382
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,200
doesn't want right and
 

2383
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,089
doesn't want right and
um and that the AI is gonna you know

2384
00:41:59,089 --> 00:41:59,099
um and that the AI is gonna you know
 

2385
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,710
um and that the AI is gonna you know
know things and be able to represent

2386
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:00,720
know things and be able to represent
 

2387
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,329
know things and be able to represent
things in the way that the Creator would

2388
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:02,339
things in the way that the Creator would
 

2389
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,170
things in the way that the Creator would
want

2390
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:03,180
want
 

2391
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,630
want
um the way that the Creator would know

2392
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:05,640
um the way that the Creator would know
 

2393
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,250
um the way that the Creator would know
um

2394
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:06,260
um
 

2395
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,150
um
so I think that it's less of a

2396
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,160
so I think that it's less of a
 

2397
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,069
so I think that it's less of a
it's less of a question around like

2398
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:13,079
it's less of a question around like
 

2399
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:15,410
it's less of a question around like
having the Avatar Express them I mean

2400
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:15,420
having the Avatar Express them I mean
 

2401
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,970
having the Avatar Express them I mean
that that I think where you know it's

2402
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:16,980
that that I think where you know it's
 

2403
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,250
that that I think where you know it's
like well we have our kind of V1 of that

2404
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:19,260
like well we have our kind of V1 of that
 

2405
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,050
like well we have our kind of V1 of that
that will release soon

2406
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:21,060
that will release soon
 

2407
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,569
that will release soon
um after connect but you know that'll

2408
00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:23,579
um after connect but you know that'll
 

2409
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:25,730
um after connect but you know that'll
get better over time but a lot of this

2410
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:25,740
get better over time but a lot of this
 

2411
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,890
get better over time but a lot of this
is really just about continuing to make

2412
00:42:27,890 --> 00:42:27,900
is really just about continuing to make
 

2413
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:30,349
is really just about continuing to make
the models for these AIS it's that

2414
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:30,359
the models for these AIS it's that
 

2415
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:32,750
the models for these AIS it's that
they're just more and more I don't know

2416
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:32,760
they're just more and more I don't know
 

2417
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,210
they're just more and more I don't know
you could say like

2418
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:34,220
you could say like
 

2419
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,650
you could say like
reliable or predictable in terms of what

2420
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:36,660
reliable or predictable in terms of what
 

2421
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,210
reliable or predictable in terms of what
they'll communicate so that way you know

2422
00:42:38,210 --> 00:42:38,220
they'll communicate so that way you know
 

2423
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,970
they'll communicate so that way you know
when you want to create the Lex

2424
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:40,980
when you want to create the Lex
 

2425
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:43,550
when you want to create the Lex
um assistant AI that that your community

2426
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:43,560
um assistant AI that that your community
 

2427
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,170
um assistant AI that that your community
can talk to

2428
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:45,180
can talk to
 

2429
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:47,690
can talk to
um you can you know it's you don't

2430
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:47,700
um you can you know it's you don't
 

2431
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:49,069
um you can you know it's you don't
program them like normal computers

2432
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:49,079
program them like normal computers
 

2433
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,870
program them like normal computers
you're training them they're AI models

2434
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:50,880
you're training them they're AI models
 

2435
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,270
you're training them they're AI models
not not not um kind of normal computer

2436
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:53,280
not not not um kind of normal computer
 

2437
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,829
not not not um kind of normal computer
programs but

2438
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:54,839
programs but
 

2439
00:42:54,839 --> 00:42:55,970
programs but
um but you want to get it to be

2440
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:55,980
um but you want to get it to be
 

2441
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,069
um but you want to get it to be
predictable enough so that way you can

2442
00:42:58,069 --> 00:42:58,079
predictable enough so that way you can
 

2443
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,829
predictable enough so that way you can
set some parameters for it and even if

2444
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:00,839
set some parameters for it and even if
 

2445
00:43:00,839 --> 00:43:03,770
set some parameters for it and even if
it isn't perfect all the time

2446
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:03,780
it isn't perfect all the time
 

2447
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,690
it isn't perfect all the time
um you want to generally be able to stay

2448
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:05,700
um you want to generally be able to stay
 

2449
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:08,150
um you want to generally be able to stay
within those bounds so that's a lot of

2450
00:43:08,150 --> 00:43:08,160
within those bounds so that's a lot of
 

2451
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,690
within those bounds so that's a lot of
um

2452
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:08,700
um
 

2453
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:11,690
um
what what I think we need to nail for

2454
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:11,700
what what I think we need to nail for
 

2455
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,790
what what I think we need to nail for
for the creators and that's why that

2456
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:13,800
for the creators and that's why that
 

2457
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,650
for the creators and that's why that
one's actually a much harder problem I

2458
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:15,660
one's actually a much harder problem I
 

2459
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,109
one's actually a much harder problem I
think than starting with with uh with

2460
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:18,119
think than starting with with uh with
 

2461
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:19,370
think than starting with with uh with
new characters that you're creating from

2462
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:19,380
new characters that you're creating from
 

2463
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,990
new characters that you're creating from
scratch so that one I think will

2464
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:21,000
scratch so that one I think will
 

2465
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,609
scratch so that one I think will
probably

2466
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:22,619
probably
 

2467
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:25,609
probably
um start releasing sometime next year

2468
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:25,619
um start releasing sometime next year
 

2469
00:43:25,619 --> 00:43:27,890
um start releasing sometime next year
um not this year but experimenting with

2470
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:27,900
um not this year but experimenting with
 

2471
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,329
um not this year but experimenting with
existing characters and the assistant

2472
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:29,339
existing characters and the assistant
 

2473
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:31,250
existing characters and the assistant
and games and a bunch of different

2474
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:31,260
and games and a bunch of different
 

2475
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:33,890
and games and a bunch of different
personalities and experimenting with

2476
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:33,900
personalities and experimenting with
 

2477
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,050
personalities and experimenting with
some small businesses

2478
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:36,060
some small businesses
 

2479
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,309
some small businesses
um I think that that stuff we'll be

2480
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:37,319
um I think that that stuff we'll be
 

2481
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:38,690
um I think that that stuff we'll be
ready to do this year and we're rolling

2482
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:38,700
ready to do this year and we're rolling
 

2483
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,550
ready to do this year and we're rolling
it out you know basically right after

2484
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:40,560
it out you know basically right after
 

2485
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,990
it out you know basically right after

2488
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:44,760
yeah I'm deeply entertained by the
 

2489
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,250
yeah I'm deeply entertained by the
possibility of me sitting down with

2490
00:43:46,250 --> 00:43:46,260
possibility of me sitting down with
 

2491
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,230
possibility of me sitting down with
myself and saying hey man

2492
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:48,240
myself and saying hey man

or whatever the idea of a podcast
 

2497
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:59,230
or whatever the idea of a podcast
between you and AI assistant Lex podcast

2498
00:43:59,230 --> 00:43:59,240
between you and AI assistant Lex podcast
 

2499
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,089
between you and AI assistant Lex podcast
I mean there's uh just even the

2500
00:44:02,089 --> 00:44:02,099
I mean there's uh just even the
 

2501
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:04,609
I mean there's uh just even the
experience of a Kodak Avatar being able

2502
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:04,619
experience of a Kodak Avatar being able
 

2503
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:06,890
experience of a Kodak Avatar being able
to freeze yourself like to basically

2504
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:06,900
to freeze yourself like to basically
 

2505
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,870
to freeze yourself like to basically
first mimic yourself so everything you

2506
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:08,880
first mimic yourself so everything you
 

2507
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,970
first mimic yourself so everything you
do you get to see yourself do it that's

2508
00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:10,980
do you get to see yourself do it that's
 

2509
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:14,270
do you get to see yourself do it that's
a surreal experience it feels like uh if

2510
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,280
a surreal experience it feels like uh if
 

2511
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:15,890
a surreal experience it feels like uh if
I was like an ape looking in a mirror

2512
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:15,900
I was like an ape looking in a mirror
 

2513
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:18,230
I was like an ape looking in a mirror
for the first time realizing like oh

2514
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:18,240
for the first time realizing like oh
 

2515
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,569
for the first time realizing like oh
that's you but then freezing that and

2516
00:44:20,569 --> 00:44:20,579
that's you but then freezing that and
 

2517
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:22,130
that's you but then freezing that and
being able to look around like I'm

2518
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:22,140
being able to look around like I'm
 

2519
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,950
being able to look around like I'm
looking at you it's a

2520
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:24,960
looking at you it's a
 

2521
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,870
looking at you it's a
I don't know how to put it into Wars but

2522
00:44:26,870 --> 00:44:26,880
I don't know how to put it into Wars but
 

2523
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,730
I don't know how to put it into Wars but
it just feels like a fundamentally new

2524
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:28,740
it just feels like a fundamentally new
 

2525
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,069
it just feels like a fundamentally new
experience like I'm seeing maybe color

2526
00:44:31,069 --> 00:44:31,079
experience like I'm seeing maybe color
 

2527
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,690
experience like I'm seeing maybe color
for the first time I'm seeing I'm

2528
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:32,700
for the first time I'm seeing I'm
 

2529
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:35,750
for the first time I'm seeing I'm
experiencing a new

2530
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:35,760
experiencing a new
 

2531
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,790
experiencing a new
way of seeing the world for the first

2532
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:37,800
way of seeing the world for the first
 

2533
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,790
way of seeing the world for the first
time because it's physical reality

2534
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:40,800
time because it's physical reality
 

2535
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,630
time because it's physical reality
but it's digital like and realizing that

2536
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:44,640
but it's digital like and realizing that
 

2537
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,930
but it's digital like and realizing that
that's possible is just it's it's

2538
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:46,940
that's possible is just it's it's
 

2539
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:49,550
that's possible is just it's it's
blowing my mind it's just really

2540
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:49,560
blowing my mind it's just really
 

2541
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,589
blowing my mind it's just really
exciting because I I live most of my

2542
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:51,599
exciting because I I live most of my
 

2543
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,170
exciting because I I live most of my
life you know before the internet and

2544
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:54,180
life you know before the internet and
 

2545
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,490
life you know before the internet and
and experiencing the internet

2546
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:55,500
and experiencing the internet
 

2547
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,190
and experiencing the internet
experiencing voice communication video

2548
00:44:58,190 --> 00:44:58,200
experiencing voice communication video
 

2549
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,630
experiencing voice communication video
communication

2550
00:44:59,630 --> 00:44:59,640
communication
 

2551
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:02,030
communication
you think like well there's a ceiling to

2552
00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:02,040
you think like well there's a ceiling to
 

2553
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,910
you think like well there's a ceiling to
this but this is making me feel like uh

2554
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:04,920
this but this is making me feel like uh
 

2555
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,530
this but this is making me feel like uh
there might not be there might be that

2556
00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:06,540
there might not be there might be that
 

2557
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,109
there might not be there might be that
blend of physical reality and digital

2558
00:45:09,109 --> 00:45:09,119
blend of physical reality and digital
 

2559
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:11,210
blend of physical reality and digital
reality that's actually what the future

2560
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:11,220
reality that's actually what the future
 

2561
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,170
reality that's actually what the future
is

2562
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:12,180
is
 

2563
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:13,849
is
yeah I think it's a weird experience

2564
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:13,859
yeah I think it's a weird experience
 

2565
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:16,130
yeah I think it's a weird experience
it's just it feels like the early days

2566
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:16,140
it's just it feels like the early days
 

2567
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,329
it's just it feels like the early days
of like a totally new way of living and

2568
00:45:20,329 --> 00:45:20,339
of like a totally new way of living and
 

2569
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:21,589
of like a totally new way of living and
like there's a lot of people that kind

2570
00:45:21,589 --> 00:45:21,599
like there's a lot of people that kind
 

2571
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:23,329
like there's a lot of people that kind
of complain well you know

2572
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:23,339
of complain well you know
 

2573
00:45:23,339 --> 00:45:26,870
of complain well you know
the internet is not that's not reality

2574
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:26,880
the internet is not that's not reality
 

2575
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,210
the internet is not that's not reality
you need to turn all that off and go you

2576
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:29,220
you need to turn all that off and go you
 

2577
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:32,569
you need to turn all that off and go you
know in nature but this feels like this

2578
00:45:32,569 --> 00:45:32,579
know in nature but this feels like this
 

2579
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:34,430
know in nature but this feels like this
will make those people happy I feel like

2580
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:34,440
will make those people happy I feel like
 

2581
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,770
will make those people happy I feel like
because it feels real the flaws and

2582
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:36,780
because it feels real the flaws and
 

2583
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:39,170
because it feels real the flaws and
everything yeah well I mean a big part

2584
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:39,180
everything yeah well I mean a big part
 

2585
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,870
everything yeah well I mean a big part
of how we're trying to design this these

2586
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:41,880
of how we're trying to design this these
 

2587
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,030
of how we're trying to design this these
new Computing products is that they

2588
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:44,040
new Computing products is that they
 

2589
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,530
new Computing products is that they
should be physical but I think part

2590
00:45:45,530 --> 00:45:45,540
should be physical but I think part
 

2591
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,790
should be physical but I think part
that's a big part of the issue with

2592
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:46,800
that's a big part of the issue with
 

2593
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,970
that's a big part of the issue with
computers and TVs and even phones is

2594
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:49,980
computers and TVs and even phones is
 

2595
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,190
computers and TVs and even phones is
like yeah I mean maybe you can interact

2596
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:52,200
like yeah I mean maybe you can interact
 

2597
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,450
like yeah I mean maybe you can interact
with them in different places but

2598
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:53,460
with them in different places but
 

2599
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,710
with them in different places but
they're they're fundamentally like

2600
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
they're they're fundamentally like
 

2601
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:57,170
they're they're fundamentally like
you're sitting you're you're still and I

2602
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:57,180
you're sitting you're you're still and I
 

2603
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,670
you're sitting you're you're still and I
mean people are just not meant to be

2604
00:45:58,670 --> 00:45:58,680
mean people are just not meant to be
 

2605
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:00,470
mean people are just not meant to be
that way I mean I think you and I have

2606
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:00,480
that way I mean I think you and I have
 

2607
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,950
that way I mean I think you and I have
this shared passion for sports and

2608
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:03,960
this shared passion for sports and
 

2609
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,630
this shared passion for sports and
martial arts and doing stuff that we

2610
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:05,640
martial arts and doing stuff that we
 

2611
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,890
martial arts and doing stuff that we
were just moving around it's like so

2612
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:06,900
were just moving around it's like so
 

2613
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,290
were just moving around it's like so
much of what makes us people is like you

2614
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:09,300
much of what makes us people is like you
 

2615
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,790
much of what makes us people is like you
know you move around you're not we're

2616
00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:10,800
know you move around you're not we're
 

2617
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,410
know you move around you're not we're
not just like a brain in a tank right

2618
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:12,420
not just like a brain in a tank right
 

2619
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,809
not just like a brain in a tank right
it's the where you know The Human

2620
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:14,819
it's the where you know The Human
 

2621
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,690
it's the where you know The Human
Experience is a physical one then

2622
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:17,700
Experience is a physical one then
 

2623
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,670
Experience is a physical one then
um so it's not just about having the

2624
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:19,680
um so it's not just about having the
 

2625
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,170
um so it's not just about having the
immersive expression of the digital

2626
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:21,180
immersive expression of the digital
 

2627
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:23,030
immersive expression of the digital
world it's about being able to really

2628
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,040
world it's about being able to really
 

2629
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,510
world it's about being able to really
natively bring that together and and it

2630
00:46:26,510 --> 00:46:26,520
natively bring that together and and it
 

2631
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,309
natively bring that together and and it
I do really think that the the real

2632
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:28,319
I do really think that the the real
 

2633
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:30,589
I do really think that the the real
world is this mix of the physical and

2634
00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:30,599
world is this mix of the physical and
 

2635
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,150
world is this mix of the physical and
the digital right the digital is there's

2636
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:32,160
the digital right the digital is there's
 

2637
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,190
the digital right the digital is there's
too much digital at this point for it to

2638
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:34,200
too much digital at this point for it to
 

2639
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,530
too much digital at this point for it to
just be siled to a small screen but the

2640
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:36,540
just be siled to a small screen but the
 

2641
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,270
just be siled to a small screen but the
physical is too important so you don't

2642
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:38,280
physical is too important so you don't
 

2643
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,550
physical is too important so you don't
want to just sit down all day long

2644
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:40,560
want to just sit down all day long
 

2645
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,030
want to just sit down all day long
um at a desk so I I think that this is

2646
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:44,040
um at a desk so I I think that this is
 

2647
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,010
um at a desk so I I think that this is
uh yeah I do think that this is the

2648
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:46,020
uh yeah I do think that this is the
 

2649
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:48,970
uh yeah I do think that this is the
future this is I think the kind of

2650
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:48,980
future this is I think the kind of
 

2651
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:51,109
future this is I think the kind of
philosophical way that I would want the

2652
00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:51,119
philosophical way that I would want the
 

2653
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,609
philosophical way that I would want the
world to work in the future is a much

2654
00:46:52,609 --> 00:46:52,619
world to work in the future is a much
 

2655
00:46:52,619 --> 00:46:54,710
world to work in the future is a much
more coherently Blended physical and

2656
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:54,720
more coherently Blended physical and
 

2657
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,910
more coherently Blended physical and
digital world

2658
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:55,920
digital world
 

2659
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,730
digital world
there might be some difficult

2660
00:46:58,730 --> 00:46:58,740
there might be some difficult
 

2661
00:46:58,740 --> 00:47:00,950
there might be some difficult
philosophical and unethical questions we

2662
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:00,960
philosophical and unethical questions we
 

2663
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:03,349
philosophical and unethical questions we
have to figure out as a society uh maybe

2664
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:03,359
have to figure out as a society uh maybe
 

2665
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:05,690
have to figure out as a society uh maybe
you can comment on this so the the

2666
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:05,700
you can comment on this so the the
 

2667
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,730
you can comment on this so the the
metaverse seems to

2668
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:07,740
metaverse seems to
 

2669
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,589
metaverse seems to
enable

2670
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:09,599
enable
 

2671
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,870
enable
sort of unlock a lot of experiences that

2672
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:11,880
sort of unlock a lot of experiences that
 

2673
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,089
sort of unlock a lot of experiences that
we don't have in the physical world and

2674
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:14,099
we don't have in the physical world and
 

2675
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:15,950
we don't have in the physical world and
the question is

2676
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:15,960
the question is
 

2677
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,349
the question is
like what is and isn't allowed in the

2678
00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:18,359
like what is and isn't allowed in the
 

2679
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:20,930
like what is and isn't allowed in the
metaverse you know in video games we

2680
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:20,940
metaverse you know in video games we
 

2681
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,190
metaverse you know in video games we
allow

2682
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:22,200
allow
 

2683
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,950
allow
uh all kinds of crazy stuff

2684
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:24,960
uh all kinds of crazy stuff
 

2685
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,910
uh all kinds of crazy stuff
and in physical reality you know a lot

2686
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:28,920
and in physical reality you know a lot
 

2687
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,130
and in physical reality you know a lot
of that is illegal so where's that line

2688
00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:31,140
of that is illegal so where's that line
 

2689
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:32,930
of that is illegal so where's that line
where's that gray area between video

2690
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:32,940
where's that gray area between video
 

2691
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:35,089
where's that gray area between video
game and physical reality do you have a

2692
00:47:35,089 --> 00:47:35,099
game and physical reality do you have a
 

2693
00:47:35,099 --> 00:47:36,589
game and physical reality do you have a
sense of that

2694
00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:36,599
sense of that
 

2695
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:38,390
sense of that
well I think I mean there are there are

2696
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:38,400
well I think I mean there are there are
 

2697
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:40,069
well I think I mean there are there are
content policies and things like that

2698
00:47:40,069 --> 00:47:40,079
content policies and things like that
 

2699
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,109
content policies and things like that
right in terms of what what people are

2700
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:42,119
right in terms of what what people are
 

2701
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,030
right in terms of what what people are
allowed to create but I mean a lot of

2702
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:44,040
allowed to create but I mean a lot of
 

2703
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,430
allowed to create but I mean a lot of
the rules around physical I think who

2704
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:46,440
the rules around physical I think who
 

2705
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,130
the rules around physical I think who
try to have a society that is as free as

2706
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:49,140
try to have a society that is as free as
 

2707
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,750
try to have a society that is as free as
possible meaning that people can do as

2708
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:50,760
possible meaning that people can do as
 

2709
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,730
possible meaning that people can do as
much of what they want unless you're

2710
00:47:52,730 --> 00:47:52,740
much of what they want unless you're
 

2711
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,069
much of what they want unless you're
going to do damage to other people and

2712
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:55,079
going to do damage to other people and
 

2713
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,790
going to do damage to other people and
and infringe on on their rights and the

2714
00:47:58,790 --> 00:47:58,800
and infringe on on their rights and the
 

2715
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,829
and infringe on on their rights and the
idea of damage is somewhat different in

2716
00:48:00,829 --> 00:48:00,839
idea of damage is somewhat different in
 

2717
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:02,930
idea of damage is somewhat different in
a in a digital environment I mean when I

2718
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:02,940
a in a digital environment I mean when I
 

2719
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,809
a in a digital environment I mean when I
get into you know uh some world with my

2720
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:05,819
get into you know uh some world with my
 

2721
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:07,609
get into you know uh some world with my
friends the the first thing we start

2722
00:48:07,609 --> 00:48:07,619
friends the the first thing we start
 

2723
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,870
friends the the first thing we start
doing is shooting each other which

2724
00:48:08,870 --> 00:48:08,880
doing is shooting each other which
 

2725
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,950
doing is shooting each other which
obviously we would not do in the

2726
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:09,960
obviously we would not do in the
 

2727
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:11,990
obviously we would not do in the
physical world because you'd hurt each

2728
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
physical world because you'd hurt each
 

2729
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,770
physical world because you'd hurt each
other

2730
00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:12,780
other
 

2731
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,930
other
um but in in a game that's like just a

2732
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:14,940
um but in in a game that's like just a
 

2733
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,150
um but in in a game that's like just a
it's almost you know it's like just fun

2734
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:17,160
it's almost you know it's like just fun
 

2735
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,349
it's almost you know it's like just fun
and

2736
00:48:18,349 --> 00:48:18,359
and
 

2737
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,270
and
um and even like the lobby of a game

2738
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:20,280
um and even like the lobby of a game
 

2739
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,250
um and even like the lobby of a game
right it's like it just it's not even

2740
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:22,260
right it's like it just it's not even
 

2741
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,329
right it's like it just it's not even
bearing on the game which is kind of

2742
00:48:23,329 --> 00:48:23,339
bearing on the game which is kind of
 

2743
00:48:23,339 --> 00:48:24,770
bearing on the game which is kind of
like a funny

2744
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:24,780
like a funny
 

2745
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:27,230
like a funny
um sort of humorous thing to do so it's

2746
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:27,240
um sort of humorous thing to do so it's
 

2747
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,790
um sort of humorous thing to do so it's
like is that is that problematic I don't

2748
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
like is that is that problematic I don't
 

2749
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,349
like is that is that problematic I don't
think so because it's it's fundamentally

2750
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:30,359
think so because it's it's fundamentally
 

2751
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:32,329
think so because it's it's fundamentally
it's not you're not causing harm in that

2752
00:48:32,329 --> 00:48:32,339
it's not you're not causing harm in that
 

2753
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:35,030
it's not you're not causing harm in that
world so I think that the um

2754
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,040
world so I think that the um
 

2755
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,710
world so I think that the um
part of the question that I think we

2756
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:36,720
part of the question that I think we
 

2757
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:40,370
part of the question that I think we
need to figure out is what are the ways

2758
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:40,380
need to figure out is what are the ways
 

2759
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,349
need to figure out is what are the ways
where things could have been harmful in

2760
00:48:42,349 --> 00:48:42,359
where things could have been harmful in
 

2761
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:43,730
where things could have been harmful in
the physical world that we will now be

2762
00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:43,740
the physical world that we will now be
 

2763
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:45,109
the physical world that we will now be
freed from that and therefore there

2764
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:45,119
freed from that and therefore there
 

2765
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:46,430
freed from that and therefore there
should be fewer restrictions in the

2766
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:46,440
should be fewer restrictions in the
 

2767
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,109
should be fewer restrictions in the
Digital World

2768
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:48,119
Digital World
 

2769
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,690
Digital World
um and then there might be new ways in

2770
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:50,700
um and then there might be new ways in
 

2771
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:52,430
um and then there might be new ways in
which there could be harm in the digital

2772
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:52,440
which there could be harm in the digital
 

2773
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:53,930
which there could be harm in the digital
world that there weren't the case before

2774
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:53,940
world that there weren't the case before
 

2775
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,390
world that there weren't the case before
so there's more anonymity right it's um

2776
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:56,400
so there's more anonymity right it's um
 

2777
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,370
so there's more anonymity right it's um
you know when you when you show up to uh

2778
00:48:58,370 --> 00:48:58,380
you know when you when you show up to uh
 

2779
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,990
you know when you when you show up to uh
you know a restaurant or something it's

2780
00:48:59,990 --> 00:49:00,000
you know a restaurant or something it's
 

2781
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,670
you know a restaurant or something it's
like all the Norms where you pay the

2782
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:01,680
like all the Norms where you pay the
 

2783
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,589
like all the Norms where you pay the
bill at the end it's because you know

2784
00:49:03,589 --> 00:49:03,599
bill at the end it's because you know
 

2785
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,890
bill at the end it's because you know
you you have one identity and you know

2786
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:06,900
you you have one identity and you know
 

2787
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,809
you you have one identity and you know
the I you know if you if you stiff them

2788
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:08,819
the I you know if you if you stiff them
 

2789
00:49:08,819 --> 00:49:09,950
the I you know if you if you stiff them
then like

2790
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:09,960
then like
 

2791
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:11,870
then like
you know life is a repeat game and

2792
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:11,880
you know life is a repeat game and
 

2793
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,250
you know life is a repeat game and
that's not going to work out well for

2794
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:13,260
that's not going to work out well for
 

2795
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:14,750
that's not going to work out well for
you but you know in a digital world

2796
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:14,760
you but you know in a digital world
 

2797
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,849
you but you know in a digital world
where you can be anonymous and show up

2798
00:49:16,849 --> 00:49:16,859
where you can be anonymous and show up
 

2799
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:18,710
where you can be anonymous and show up
in different ways

2800
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:18,720
in different ways
 

2801
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,510
in different ways
um I think the incentive to act like a

2802
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:20,520
um I think the incentive to act like a
 

2803
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,790
um I think the incentive to act like a
good citizen can be a lot less and that

2804
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:22,800
good citizen can be a lot less and that
 

2805
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,170
good citizen can be a lot less and that
causes a lot of issues and toxic

2806
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:24,180
causes a lot of issues and toxic
 

2807
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,329
causes a lot of issues and toxic
Behavior so if that needs to get sorted

2808
00:49:26,329 --> 00:49:26,339
Behavior so if that needs to get sorted
 

2809
00:49:26,339 --> 00:49:27,349
Behavior so if that needs to get sorted
out

2810
00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
out
 

2811
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:28,130
out
um

2812
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:28,140
um
 

2813
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,290
um
so I think in terms of what is allowed I

2814
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:30,300
so I think in terms of what is allowed I
 

2815
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,730
so I think in terms of what is allowed I
think you want to just look at what what

2816
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:31,740
think you want to just look at what what
 

2817
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:33,710
think you want to just look at what what
what are the the damages but then

2818
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:33,720
what are the the damages but then
 

2819
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,750
what are the the damages but then
there's also other things that are not

2820
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:35,760
there's also other things that are not
 

2821
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,870
there's also other things that are not
related to kind of harm you know less

2822
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:38,880
related to kind of harm you know less
 

2823
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,670
related to kind of harm you know less
about what should be allowed and more

2824
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:40,680
about what should be allowed and more
 

2825
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:42,770
about what should be allowed and more
about what will be possible that are

2826
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:42,780
about what will be possible that are
 

2827
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:44,270
about what will be possible that are
more about the laws of physics so right

2828
00:49:44,270 --> 00:49:44,280
more about the laws of physics so right
 

2829
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,089
more about the laws of physics so right
it's like if you wanted to travel uh to

2830
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:47,099
it's like if you wanted to travel uh to
 

2831
00:49:47,099 --> 00:49:49,370
it's like if you wanted to travel uh to
see me in person you'd have to get on a

2832
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:49,380
see me in person you'd have to get on a
 

2833
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:52,190
see me in person you'd have to get on a
plane and and that would like you know

2834
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:52,200
plane and and that would like you know
 

2835
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,950
plane and and that would like you know
take a few hours to get here whereas you

2836
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:54,960
take a few hours to get here whereas you
 

2837
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,990
take a few hours to get here whereas you
know we could just jump in a conference

2838
00:49:56,990 --> 00:49:57,000
know we could just jump in a conference
 

2839
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,089
know we could just jump in a conference
room and you know put on these headsets

2840
00:49:59,089 --> 00:49:59,099
room and you know put on these headsets
 

2841
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:01,790
room and you know put on these headsets
and we've basically teleported into a

2842
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:01,800
and we've basically teleported into a
 

2843
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,829
and we've basically teleported into a
space where we're you know it feels like

2844
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:03,839
space where we're you know it feels like
 

2845
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,150
space where we're you know it feels like
we're together

2846
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:05,160
we're together
 

2847
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:08,210
we're together
that's a very novel experience that um

2848
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:08,220
that's a very novel experience that um
 

2849
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:10,609
that's a very novel experience that um
that it it breaks down some things that

2850
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:10,619
that it it breaks down some things that
 

2851
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,890
that it it breaks down some things that
previously would have defied the laws of

2852
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:12,900
previously would have defied the laws of
 

2853
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:14,270
previously would have defied the laws of
physics for what it would take to get

2854
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:14,280
physics for what it would take to get
 

2855
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,950
physics for what it would take to get
together and I think that that will

2856
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:15,960
together and I think that that will
 

2857
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,809
together and I think that that will
create a lot of new opportunities right

2858
00:50:17,809 --> 00:50:17,819
create a lot of new opportunities right
 

2859
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:18,890
create a lot of new opportunities right
so

2860
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:18,900
so
 

2861
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,089
so
um and one of the things that I'm

2862
00:50:20,089 --> 00:50:20,099
um and one of the things that I'm
 

2863
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:21,710
um and one of the things that I'm
curious about is you know there are all

2864
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:21,720
curious about is you know there are all
 

2865
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,690
curious about is you know there are all
these debates right now about you know

2866
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:23,700
these debates right now about you know
 

2867
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:26,150
these debates right now about you know
remote work or people being together and

2868
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:26,160
remote work or people being together and
 

2869
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,470
remote work or people being together and
you know I think this gets us a lot

2870
00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:27,480
you know I think this gets us a lot
 

2871
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,630
you know I think this gets us a lot
closer to being able to work physically

2872
00:50:29,630 --> 00:50:29,640
closer to being able to work physically
 

2873
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:31,849
closer to being able to work physically
in different places but actually have it

2874
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:31,859
in different places but actually have it
 

2875
00:50:31,859 --> 00:50:33,410
in different places but actually have it
feel like we're together

2876
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:33,420
feel like we're together
 

2877
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,809
feel like we're together
um so you know I think that the dream is

2878
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:35,819
um so you know I think that the dream is
 

2879
00:50:35,819 --> 00:50:37,849
um so you know I think that the dream is
that is that people will one day be able

2880
00:50:37,849 --> 00:50:37,859
that is that people will one day be able
 

2881
00:50:37,859 --> 00:50:39,950
that is that people will one day be able
to just work wherever they want but

2882
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:39,960
to just work wherever they want but
 

2883
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:41,390
to just work wherever they want but
we'll have all the same opportunities

2884
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:41,400
we'll have all the same opportunities
 

2885
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,470
we'll have all the same opportunities
because you'll be able to feel like

2886
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:42,480
because you'll be able to feel like
 

2887
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,030
because you'll be able to feel like
you're physically together I think we're

2888
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:44,040
you're physically together I think we're
 

2889
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,550
you're physically together I think we're
not there today with with um with just

2890
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:46,560
not there today with with um with just
 

2891
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,109
not there today with with um with just
video conferencing and the basic

2892
00:50:48,109 --> 00:50:48,119
video conferencing and the basic
 

2893
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,849
video conferencing and the basic
technologies that we have but I think

2894
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:49,859
technologies that we have but I think
 

2895
00:50:49,859 --> 00:50:51,049
technologies that we have but I think
part of the idea is that with something

2896
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:51,059
part of the idea is that with something
 

2897
00:50:51,059 --> 00:50:53,089
part of the idea is that with something
like this over time you could get closer

2898
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:53,099
like this over time you could get closer
 

2899
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:54,710
like this over time you could get closer
to that and that would open up a lot of

2900
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:54,720
to that and that would open up a lot of
 

2901
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,970
to that and that would open up a lot of
opportunities right because then people

2902
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:55,980
opportunities right because then people
 

2903
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,950
opportunities right because then people
could live physically where they want

2904
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:57,960
could live physically where they want
 

2905
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:00,470
could live physically where they want
while still being able to get the

2906
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:00,480
while still being able to get the
 

2907
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,630
while still being able to get the
benefits of being physically or kind of

2908
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:02,640
benefits of being physically or kind of
 

2909
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,089
benefits of being physically or kind of
feeling like you're together with people

2910
00:51:05,089 --> 00:51:05,099
feeling like you're together with people
 

2911
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,430
feeling like you're together with people
at work all the ways that that helps to

2912
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:07,440
at work all the ways that that helps to
 

2913
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,230
at work all the ways that that helps to
build more culture and build better

2914
00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:09,240
build more culture and build better
 

2915
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:11,690
build more culture and build better
relationships and build trust which I

2916
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:11,700
relationships and build trust which I
 

2917
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,030
relationships and build trust which I
think are real issues that if you're not

2918
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:14,040
think are real issues that if you're not
 

2919
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:16,430
think are real issues that if you're not
seeing people you know in in person ever

2920
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:16,440
seeing people you know in in person ever
 

2921
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,349
seeing people you know in in person ever
so yeah I don't know I think it's going

2922
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:18,359
so yeah I don't know I think it's going
 

2923
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,270
so yeah I don't know I think it's going
to be it's very hard from first

2924
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:20,280
to be it's very hard from first
 

2925
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:22,309
to be it's very hard from first
principles to think about all the

2926
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:22,319
principles to think about all the
 

2927
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:24,349
principles to think about all the
implications of

2928
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:24,359
implications of
 

2929
00:51:24,359 --> 00:51:27,650
implications of
um of a technology like this and you

2930
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:27,660
um of a technology like this and you
 

2931
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:29,630
um of a technology like this and you
know all the good and and and the things

2932
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:29,640
know all the good and and and the things
 

2933
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,549
know all the good and and and the things
that you need to mitigate so you try to

2934
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:31,559
that you need to mitigate so you try to
 

2935
00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:33,530
that you need to mitigate so you try to
do your best to kind of Envision what

2936
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:33,540
do your best to kind of Envision what
 

2937
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,790
do your best to kind of Envision what
things are going to be like and

2938
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:34,800
things are going to be like and
 

2939
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,650
things are going to be like and
accentuate the things that they're going

2940
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:36,660
accentuate the things that they're going
 

2941
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,030
accentuate the things that they're going
to be awesome and hopefully mitigate

2942
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:38,040
to be awesome and hopefully mitigate
 

2943
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:40,130
to be awesome and hopefully mitigate
some of the the downside things but I

2944
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:40,140
some of the the downside things but I
 

2945
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,930
some of the the downside things but I
you know it's the reality is that we're

2946
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:41,940
you know it's the reality is that we're
 

2947
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,549
you know it's the reality is that we're
gonna be building this out one year at a

2948
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:43,559
gonna be building this out one year at a
 

2949
00:51:43,559 --> 00:51:45,530
gonna be building this out one year at a
time it's going to take a while

2950
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:45,540
time it's going to take a while
 

2951
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:47,270
time it's going to take a while
um so we're going to just get to see how

2952
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:47,280
um so we're going to just get to see how
 

2953
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,549
um so we're going to just get to see how
how it evolves and and what developers

2954
00:51:49,549 --> 00:51:49,559
how it evolves and and what developers
 

2955
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,950
how it evolves and and what developers
and different folks do with it

2956
00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:51,960
and different folks do with it
 

2957
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:55,010
and different folks do with it
uh if you could comment this might be a

2958
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:55,020
uh if you could comment this might be a
 

2959
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,990
uh if you could comment this might be a
a bit of a very specific technical

2960
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:57,000
a bit of a very specific technical
 

2961
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,930
a bit of a very specific technical
question but llama 2 is incredible it's

2962
00:51:59,930 --> 00:51:59,940
question but llama 2 is incredible it's
 

2963
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:03,349
question but llama 2 is incredible it's
the you've you've released it recently

2964
00:52:03,349 --> 00:52:03,359
the you've you've released it recently
 

2965
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:04,069
the you've you've released it recently
um

2966
00:52:04,069 --> 00:52:04,079
um
 

2967
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,690
um
there's already been a lot of exciting

2968
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:05,700
there's already been a lot of exciting
 

2969
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,270
there's already been a lot of exciting
developments around it is there what

2970
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:08,280
developments around it is there what
 

2971
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,730
developments around it is there what
what's your sense about its release and

2972
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:10,740
what's your sense about its release and
 

2973
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,750
what's your sense about its release and
is there a llama three uh in the future

2974
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:14,760
is there a llama three uh in the future
 

2975
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,490
is there a llama three uh in the future
yeah I mean I think on the last podcast

2976
00:52:16,490 --> 00:52:16,500
yeah I mean I think on the last podcast
 

2977
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,410
yeah I mean I think on the last podcast
that we did together we were talking

2978
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:18,420
that we did together we were talking
 

2979
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,730
that we did together we were talking
about the debate that we were having

2980
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:19,740
about the debate that we were having
 

2981
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,849
about the debate that we were having
around open sourcing llama too and I'm

2982
00:52:22,849 --> 00:52:22,859
around open sourcing llama too and I'm
 

2983
00:52:22,859 --> 00:52:25,190
around open sourcing llama too and I'm
I'm glad that we did

2984
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:25,200
I'm glad that we did
 

2985
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,930
I'm glad that we did
um you know I think at this point

2986
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:26,940
um you know I think at this point
 

2987
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:29,089
um you know I think at this point
yeah there's the the value of open

2988
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:29,099
yeah there's the the value of open
 

2989
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:32,270
yeah there's the the value of open
sourcing a foundation model like llama2

2990
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:32,280
sourcing a foundation model like llama2
 

2991
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:35,089
sourcing a foundation model like llama2
is significantly greater than

2992
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:35,099
is significantly greater than
 

2993
00:52:35,099 --> 00:52:37,190
is significantly greater than
um than the than the risks and in my

2994
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
um than the than the risks and in my
 

2995
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,569
um than the than the risks and in my
view I mean we did we spent a lot of

2996
00:52:38,569 --> 00:52:38,579
view I mean we did we spent a lot of
 

2997
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:39,530
view I mean we did we spent a lot of
time

2998
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:39,540
time
 

2999
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,210
time
we took a very rigorous assessment of

3000
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:41,220
we took a very rigorous assessment of
 

3001
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,950
we took a very rigorous assessment of
that and red teaming it

3002
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:42,960
that and red teaming it
 

3003
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,569
that and red teaming it
um but I'm I'm very glad that we release

3004
00:52:44,569 --> 00:52:44,579
um but I'm I'm very glad that we release
 

3005
00:52:44,579 --> 00:52:47,329
um but I'm I'm very glad that we release
llama too I think the reception has been

3006
00:52:47,329 --> 00:52:47,339
llama too I think the reception has been
 

3007
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:48,890
llama too I think the reception has been
um it's it's just been really exciting

3008
00:52:48,890 --> 00:52:48,900
um it's it's just been really exciting
 

3009
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:51,130
um it's it's just been really exciting
to see how excited people have have been

3010
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:51,140
to see how excited people have have been
 

3011
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:55,490
to see how excited people have have been
uh about it and it's gotten way more you

3012
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:55,500
uh about it and it's gotten way more you
 

3013
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,829
uh about it and it's gotten way more you
know downloads and usage than I than I I

3014
00:52:57,829 --> 00:52:57,839
know downloads and usage than I than I I
 

3015
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,210
know downloads and usage than I than I I
would have even expected I was pretty

3016
00:52:59,210 --> 00:52:59,220
would have even expected I was pretty
 

3017
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:01,250
would have even expected I was pretty
optimistic about it

3018
00:53:01,250 --> 00:53:01,260
optimistic about it
 

3019
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,130
optimistic about it
um that's that's been great

3020
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,140
um that's that's been great
 

3021
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,030
um that's that's been great
um

3022
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
um
 

3023
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:09,170
um
llama three uh I mean there's always

3024
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:09,180
llama three uh I mean there's always
 

3025
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:11,930
llama three uh I mean there's always
another model that we're training so I

3026
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:11,940
another model that we're training so I
 

3027
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:13,549
another model that we're training so I
mean it's you know for right now you

3028
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:13,559
mean it's you know for right now you
 

3029
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:16,790
mean it's you know for right now you
know we built we train llama two and we

3030
00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:16,800
know we built we train llama two and we
 

3031
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,410
know we built we train llama two and we
released it as an open source model and

3032
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,420
released it as an open source model and
 

3033
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:21,349
released it as an open source model and
right now the priority is building that

3034
00:53:21,349 --> 00:53:21,359
right now the priority is building that
 

3035
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,630
right now the priority is building that
into a bunch of the consumer products

3036
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:23,640
into a bunch of the consumer products
 

3037
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,849
into a bunch of the consumer products
all the different AIS and

3038
00:53:25,849 --> 00:53:25,859
all the different AIS and
 

3039
00:53:25,859 --> 00:53:27,890
all the different AIS and
um in a bunch of different

3040
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:27,900
um in a bunch of different
 

3041
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,690
um in a bunch of different
um products that we're basically

3042
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:29,700
um products that we're basically
 

3043
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,890
um products that we're basically
building as consumer products because

3044
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:30,900
building as consumer products because
 

3045
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,630
building as consumer products because
llama2 by itself it's not a consumer

3046
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:32,640
llama2 by itself it's not a consumer
 

3047
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,069
llama2 by itself it's not a consumer
product right it's more of a piece of

3048
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:34,079
product right it's more of a piece of
 

3049
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,809
product right it's more of a piece of
infrastructure that people could could

3050
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:35,819
infrastructure that people could could
 

3051
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,390
infrastructure that people could could
build things with so that's been the big

3052
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:38,400
build things with so that's been the big
 

3053
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,390
build things with so that's been the big
priority is kind of continuing to

3054
00:53:40,390 --> 00:53:40,400
priority is kind of continuing to
 

3055
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,290
priority is kind of continuing to
fine-tune and

3056
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:42,300
fine-tune and
 

3057
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:45,170
fine-tune and
um and and kind of just get llama two

3058
00:53:45,170 --> 00:53:45,180
um and and kind of just get llama two
 

3059
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,970
um and and kind of just get llama two
and and it's um

3060
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:46,980
and and it's um
 

3061
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,890
and and it's um
and it's little the branches that we've

3062
00:53:48,890 --> 00:53:48,900
and it's little the branches that we've
 

3063
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,530
and it's little the branches that we've
built off of it ready for Consumer

3064
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:51,540
built off of it ready for Consumer
 

3065
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,970
built off of it ready for Consumer
products that hopefully you know

3066
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:52,980
products that hopefully you know
 

3067
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,650
products that hopefully you know
hundreds of millions of people will will

3068
00:53:54,650 --> 00:53:54,660
hundreds of millions of people will will
 

3069
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,109
hundreds of millions of people will will
enjoy using those those products in

3070
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:57,119
enjoy using those those products in
 

3071
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,450
enjoy using those those products in
billions one day but yeah I mean we're

3072
00:53:59,450 --> 00:53:59,460
billions one day but yeah I mean we're
 

3073
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,450
billions one day but yeah I mean we're
also working on on the Future Foundation

3074
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:02,460
also working on on the Future Foundation
 

3075
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,730
also working on on the Future Foundation
models and

3076
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:04,740
models and
 

3077
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:07,130
models and
um and I don't have anything

3078
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:07,140
um and I don't have anything
 

3079
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:09,230
um and I don't have anything
new or news news on that I don't know

3080
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:09,240
new or news news on that I don't know
 

3081
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,790
new or news news on that I don't know
and I don't know exactly when it's going

3082
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
and I don't know exactly when it's going
 

3083
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,349
and I don't know exactly when it's going
to be ready

3084
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:12,359
to be ready
 

3085
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:14,030
to be ready
um I think just like we had a debate

3086
00:54:14,030 --> 00:54:14,040
um I think just like we had a debate
 

3087
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,569
um I think just like we had a debate
around llama 2 and open sourcing it

3088
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:17,579
around llama 2 and open sourcing it
 

3089
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:19,430
around llama 2 and open sourcing it
um I think we'll we'll need to have a

3090
00:54:19,430 --> 00:54:19,440
um I think we'll we'll need to have a
 

3091
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,589
um I think we'll we'll need to have a
similar debate and process to Red Team

3092
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:21,599
similar debate and process to Red Team
 

3093
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,569
similar debate and process to Red Team
this and make sure that this is safe but

3094
00:54:23,569 --> 00:54:23,579
this and make sure that this is safe but
 

3095
00:54:23,579 --> 00:54:25,730
this and make sure that this is safe but
and my hope is that we'll be able to to

3096
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:25,740
and my hope is that we'll be able to to
 

3097
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:27,410
and my hope is that we'll be able to to
open source this next version when it's

3098
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:27,420
open source this next version when it's
 

3099
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,390
open source this next version when it's
ready too but um but that's not that

3100
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:29,400
ready too but um but that's not that
 

3101
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,670
ready too but um but that's not that
we're not we're not you know close to

3102
00:54:31,670 --> 00:54:31,680
we're not we're not you know close to
 

3103
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,470
we're not we're not you know close to
doing that this month I mean this is um

3104
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:33,480
doing that this month I mean this is um
 

3105
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,910
doing that this month I mean this is um
that's just it's a thing that we're

3106
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:34,920
that's just it's a thing that we're
 

3107
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,130
that's just it's a thing that we're
we're still somewhat early and working

3108
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:37,140
we're still somewhat early and working
 

3109
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,770
we're still somewhat early and working
on well in general thank you so much for

on well in general thank you so much for
 

3111
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,390
on well in general thank you so much for
open sourcing llama 2 and for being

3112
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:41,400
open sourcing llama 2 and for being
 

3113
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:44,109
open sourcing llama 2 and for being
transparent about all the exciting

3114
00:54:44,109 --> 00:54:44,119
transparent about all the exciting
 

3115
00:54:44,119 --> 00:54:46,549
transparent about all the exciting
developments around AI I feel like

3116
00:54:46,549 --> 00:54:46,559
developments around AI I feel like
 

3117
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:47,870
developments around AI I feel like
that's

3118
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:47,880
that's
 

3119
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,670
that's
contributing to a really awesome

3120
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:49,680
contributing to a really awesome
 

3121
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,650
contributing to a really awesome
conversation about where we go with AI

3122
00:54:51,650 --> 00:54:51,660
conversation about where we go with AI
 

3123
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:54,410
conversation about where we go with AI
and obviously it's really interesting to

3124
00:54:54,410 --> 00:54:54,420
and obviously it's really interesting to
 

3125
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:55,790
and obviously it's really interesting to
see all the same kind of Technology

3126
00:54:55,790 --> 00:54:55,800
see all the same kind of Technology
 

3127
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,530
see all the same kind of Technology
integrated into

3128
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:57,540
integrated into
 

3129
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:00,650
integrated into
these personalized AI systems of with

3130
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:00,660
these personalized AI systems of with
 

3131
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,230
these personalized AI systems of with
the with the AI personas which I think

3132
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:03,240
the with the AI personas which I think
 

3133
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,210
the with the AI personas which I think
will when you put in people's hands and

3134
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:05,220
will when you put in people's hands and
 

3135
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:06,829
will when you put in people's hands and
they get to have conversations with

00:55:06,829 --> 00:55:06,839
they get to have conversations with
 

3137
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:10,069
they get to have conversations with
these AI personas you get to see like

3138
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
these AI personas you get to see like
 

3139
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:12,290
these AI personas you get to see like
interesting failure cases like where the

3140
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:12,300
interesting failure cases like where the
 

3141
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,450
interesting failure cases like where the
things are dumb or they go into weird

3142
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:14,460
things are dumb or they go into weird
 

3143
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,609
things are dumb or they go into weird
directions or and we get to learn as a

3144
00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:16,619
directions or and we get to learn as a
 

3145
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:19,069
directions or and we get to learn as a
society together what's what's too far

personalization is good how much generic
 

3151
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,329
personalization is good how much generic
is good and we get to learn all of this

3152
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:26,339
is good and we get to learn all of this
 

3153
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:27,829
is good and we get to learn all of this
you probably don't know this yourself

3154
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:27,839
you probably don't know this yourself
 

3155
00:55:27,839 --> 00:55:29,930
you probably don't know this yourself
like we have to all figure it out by

3156
00:55:29,930 --> 00:55:29,940
like we have to all figure it out by
 

3157
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,250
like we have to all figure it out by
using it right

3158
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:31,260
using it right
 

3159
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,750
using it right

3209
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,609
weird they take it what kind of memes
are generated from this and I think all

3210
00:56:25,609 --> 00:56:25,619
are generated from this and I think all
 

3211
00:56:25,619 --> 00:56:27,890
are generated from this and I think all
of it is uh especially in this early

3212
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:27,900
of it is uh especially in this early
 

3213
00:56:27,900 --> 00:56:30,470
of it is uh especially in this early
stages of development as we progress

3214
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
stages of development as we progress
 

3215
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,829
stages of development as we progress
towards AGI it's good to learn by by

3216
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:33,839
towards AGI it's good to learn by by
 

3217
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,210
towards AGI it's good to learn by by
playing with those systems and

3218
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:35,220
playing with those systems and
 

3219
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:37,130
playing with those systems and
interacting with them at like a large

3220
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:37,140
interacting with them at like a large
 

3221
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:39,470
interacting with them at like a large
scale like you said yeah totally I mean

3222
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:39,480
scale like you said yeah totally I mean
 

3223
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,210
scale like you said yeah totally I mean
that's why whilst we're starting out

3224
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:41,220
that's why whilst we're starting out
 

3225
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:44,210
that's why whilst we're starting out
with a set and then um we're also

3226
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:44,220
with a set and then um we're also
 

3227
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:46,970
with a set and then um we're also
working on this platform that we call AI

3228
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:46,980
working on this platform that we call AI
 

3229
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,010
working on this platform that we call AI
Studio that's going to make it so that

3230
00:56:49,010 --> 00:56:49,020
Studio that's going to make it so that
 

3231
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,650
Studio that's going to make it so that
over time anyone will be able to create

3232
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:51,660
over time anyone will be able to create
 

3233
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:54,829
over time anyone will be able to create
if one of these AI is almost like they

3234
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:54,839
if one of these AI is almost like they
 

3235
00:56:54,839 --> 00:56:57,470
if one of these AI is almost like they
create any other ugc content across the

3236
00:56:57,470 --> 00:56:57,480
create any other ugc content across the
 

3237
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,630
create any other ugc content across the
platform so I'm excited about that I

3238
00:56:59,630 --> 00:56:59,640
platform so I'm excited about that I
 

3239
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,490
platform so I'm excited about that I
think that to some degree we're not

3240
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:01,500
think that to some degree we're not
 

3241
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,710
think that to some degree we're not
going to see the full potential of this

3242
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:03,720
going to see the full potential of this
 

3243
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:06,710
going to see the full potential of this
until you just have the full creativity

3244
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:06,720
until you just have the full creativity
 

3245
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,210
until you just have the full creativity
of the whole Community being able to

3246
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:08,220
of the whole Community being able to
 

3247
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,950
of the whole Community being able to
build stuff but

3248
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:09,960
build stuff but
 

3249
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,510
build stuff but
there's a lot of a lot of stuff that we

3250
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:11,520
there's a lot of a lot of stuff that we
 

3251
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,130
there's a lot of a lot of stuff that we
need to go right so

3252
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:13,140
need to go right so
 

3253
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,809
need to go right so
um so I'm excited to take this in stages

3254
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:14,819
um so I'm excited to take this in stages
 

3255
00:57:14,819 --> 00:57:17,930
um so I'm excited to take this in stages
I don't I don't think anyone out there

3256
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:17,940
I don't I don't think anyone out there
 

3257
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,130

is really

3258
00:57:19,130 --> 00:57:19,140
is really
 

3259
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,410
is really
doing what we're doing here I think that

3260
00:57:21,410 --> 00:57:21,420
doing what we're doing here I think that
 

3261
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:23,569
doing what we're doing here I think that
there are there are people who are doing

3262
00:57:23,569 --> 00:57:23,579
there are there are people who are doing
 

3263
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,190
there are there are people who are doing
kind of like fictional or consumer

3264
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:25,200
kind of like fictional or consumer
 

3265
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,650
kind of like fictional or consumer
oriented character type stuff but the

3266
00:57:27,650 --> 00:57:27,660
oriented character type stuff but the
 

3267
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,809
oriented character type stuff but the
extent to which we're building it out

3268
00:57:29,809 --> 00:57:29,819
extent to which we're building it out
 

3269
00:57:29,819 --> 00:57:32,030
extent to which we're building it out
with the

3270
00:57:32,030 --> 00:57:32,040
with the
 

3271
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,490
with the
um you know avatars and expressiveness

3272
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:34,500
um you know avatars and expressiveness
 

3273
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,290
um you know avatars and expressiveness
and and making it so that they can

3274
00:57:36,290 --> 00:57:36,300
and and making it so that they can
 

3275
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,970
and and making it so that they can
interact across

well I'm still so we're talking about AI

3290
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:51,780
well I'm still so we're talking about AI
 

3291
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,569
well I'm still so we're talking about AI
but I'm still blown away this entire

3292
00:57:53,569 --> 00:57:53,579
but I'm still blown away this entire
 

3293
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:55,910
but I'm still blown away this entire
time that I'm talking to Mark Zuckerberg

3294
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
time that I'm talking to Mark Zuckerberg
 

3295
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,190
time that I'm talking to Mark Zuckerberg
and you're not here

3296
00:57:58,190 --> 00:57:58,200
and you're not here
 

3297
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,710
and you're not here
but you feel like you're here I've done

3298
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
but you feel like you're here I've done
 

3299
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,049
but you feel like you're here I've done
quite a few intimate conversations with

3300
00:58:03,049 --> 00:58:03,059
quite a few intimate conversations with
 

3301
00:58:03,059 --> 00:58:04,910
quite a few intimate conversations with
people alone in a room and this feels

3302
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:04,920
people alone in a room and this feels
 

3303
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,250
people alone in a room and this feels
like that so I keep forgetting for long

3304
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:07,260
like that so I keep forgetting for long
 

3305
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,890
like that so I keep forgetting for long
stretches of time that like we're not in

3306
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:09,900
stretches of time that like we're not in
 

3307
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:12,530
stretches of time that like we're not in
the same room and for me to imagine a

3308
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:12,540
the same room and for me to imagine a
 

3309
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,569
the same room and for me to imagine a
future where I can with a snap of a

3310
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:14,579
future where I can with a snap of a
 

3311
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,609
future where I can with a snap of a
finger do that with anyone in my life

3312
00:58:16,609 --> 00:58:16,619
finger do that with anyone in my life
 

3313
00:58:16,619 --> 00:58:18,890
finger do that with anyone in my life
the way we can just call right now and

3314
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:18,900
the way we can just call right now and
 

3315
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,270
the way we can just call right now and
have this kind of shallow 2D experience

3316
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:22,280
have this kind of shallow 2D experience
 

3317
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,770
have this kind of shallow 2D experience
uh to have this experience like we're

3318
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:24,780
uh to have this experience like we're
 

3319
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,290
uh to have this experience like we're
sitting next to each other it's like

3320
00:58:27,290 --> 00:58:27,300
sitting next to each other it's like
 

3321
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,630
sitting next to each other it's like
I I don't I don't think I can I don't

3322
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:29,640
I I don't I don't think I can I don't
 

3323
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,670
I I don't I don't think I can I don't
think we can even imagine what how that

3324
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:31,680
think we can even imagine what how that
 

3325
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:32,930
think we can even imagine what how that
changes things

3326
00:58:32,930 --> 00:58:32,940
changes things
 

3327
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:36,470
changes things
where you can immediately have intimate

3328
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:36,480
where you can immediately have intimate
 

3329
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,870
where you can immediately have intimate
one-on-one conversations with anyone

3330
00:58:38,870 --> 00:58:38,880
one-on-one conversations with anyone
 

3331
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,970
one-on-one conversations with anyone
that's that might like in a way we might

3332
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:40,980
that's that might like in a way we might
 

3333
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:43,970
that's that might like in a way we might
not even predict changed civilization

3334
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:43,980
not even predict changed civilization
 

3335
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,530
not even predict changed civilization
well I mean this is a lot of a thesis

3336
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:45,540
well I mean this is a lot of a thesis
 

3337
00:58:45,540 --> 00:58:47,630
well I mean this is a lot of a thesis
behind the whole meta versus giving

3338
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:47,640
behind the whole meta versus giving
 

3339
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,309
behind the whole meta versus giving
people the ability to feel like you're

3340
00:58:49,309 --> 00:58:49,319
people the ability to feel like you're
 

3341
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:51,109
people the ability to feel like you're
present with someone I mean this is like

3342
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:51,119
present with someone I mean this is like
 

3343
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:52,670
present with someone I mean this is like
the main thing I talk about all the time

3344
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:52,680
the main thing I talk about all the time
 

3345
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,710
the main thing I talk about all the time
but I I do think that there's a lot to

3346
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:54,720
but I I do think that there's a lot to
 

3347
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,109
but I I do think that there's a lot to
to process about it I mean from my

3348
00:58:57,109 --> 00:58:57,119
to process about it I mean from my
 

3349
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,089
to process about it I mean from my
perspective I mean I I'm definitely here

3350
00:58:59,089 --> 00:58:59,099
perspective I mean I I'm definitely here
 

3351
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:01,069
perspective I mean I I'm definitely here
we're just not we're we're not

3352
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:01,079
we're just not we're we're not
 

3353
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:02,510
we're just not we're we're not
physically in the same place it's not

3354
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:02,520
physically in the same place it's not
 

3355
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,890
physically in the same place it's not
like you're you know you're not talking

3356
00:59:03,890 --> 00:59:03,900
like you're you know you're not talking
 

3357
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:07,010
like you're you know you're not talking
to an AI right you're you know this is

3358
00:59:07,010 --> 00:59:07,020
to an AI right you're you know this is
 

3359
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,049
to an AI right you're you know this is
um so I think the the thing that's novel

3360
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:09,059
um so I think the the thing that's novel
 

3361
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,569
um so I think the the thing that's novel
is the ability to convey through

3362
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:11,579
is the ability to convey through
 

3363
00:59:11,579 --> 00:59:15,170
is the ability to convey through
technology a sense of almost physical

3364
00:59:15,170 --> 00:59:15,180
technology a sense of almost physical
 

3365
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:16,849
technology a sense of almost physical
presence

3366
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:16,859
presence
 

3367
00:59:16,859 --> 00:59:18,470
presence
um so the the thing that is not

3368
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:18,480
um so the the thing that is not
 

3369
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:21,049
um so the the thing that is not
physically real is

3370
00:59:21,049 --> 00:59:21,059
physically real is
 

3371
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:22,970
physically real is
um is us being in the same physical

3372
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:22,980
um is us being in the same physical
 

3373
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:25,970
um is us being in the same physical
place but uh but but kind of everything

3374
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:25,980
place but uh but but kind of everything
 

3375
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,569
place but uh but but kind of everything
else is and I think that gets to this

3376
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:28,579
else is and I think that gets to this
 

3377
00:59:28,579 --> 00:59:30,970
else is and I think that gets to this
somewhat philosophical question about

3378
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:30,980
somewhat philosophical question about
 

3379
00:59:30,980 --> 00:59:33,770
somewhat philosophical question about
what is the nature of kind of the modern

3380
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:33,780
what is the nature of kind of the modern
 

3381
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:35,329
what is the nature of kind of the modern
real world and I I just think that

3382
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:35,339
real world and I I just think that
 

3383
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:38,630
real world and I I just think that
that's it really is this combination of

3384
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:38,640
that's it really is this combination of
 

3385
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:41,210
that's it really is this combination of
a physical world and the presence that

3386
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:41,220
a physical world and the presence that
 

3387
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,609
a physical world and the presence that
we feel but also being able to combine

3388
00:59:43,609 --> 00:59:43,619
we feel but also being able to combine
 

3389
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,650
we feel but also being able to combine
that with this increasingly rich and

3390
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:45,660
that with this increasingly rich and
 

3391
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,109
that with this increasingly rich and
powerful and capable digital world that

3392
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:48,119
powerful and capable digital world that
 

3393
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:50,690
powerful and capable digital world that
we have and and all of the The

3394
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:50,700
we have and and all of the The
 

3395
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,190
we have and and all of the The
Innovation that's getting created there

3396
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:52,200
Innovation that's getting created there
 

3397
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,510
Innovation that's getting created there
so

3398
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:53,520
so
 

3399
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,950
so
um I think it's super exciting because I

3400
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:54,960
um I think it's super exciting because I
 

3401
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,510
um I think it's super exciting because I
mean the the digital world is just is

3402
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:56,520
mean the the digital world is just is
 

3403
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,069
mean the the digital world is just is
just increasing

3404
00:59:58,069 --> 00:59:58,079
just increasing
 

3405
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,230
just increasing
um in in its capability and our ability

3406
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:00,240
um in in its capability and our ability
 

3407
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,089
um in in its capability and our ability
to do awesome things but the physical

3408
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:02,099
to do awesome things but the physical
 

3409
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,130
to do awesome things but the physical
world is so profound and that's a lot of

3410
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:04,140
world is so profound and that's a lot of
 

3411
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,049
world is so profound and that's a lot of
what makes us human is is that we're

3412
01:00:06,049 --> 01:00:06,059
what makes us human is is that we're
 

3413
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:08,030
what makes us human is is that we're
we're physical beings so I don't think

3414
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:08,040
we're physical beings so I don't think
 

3415
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,349
we're physical beings so I don't think
we want to run away from that and just

3416
01:00:09,349 --> 01:00:09,359
we want to run away from that and just
 

3417
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,630
we want to run away from that and just
spend all day on a screen and that's

3418
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:11,640
spend all day on a screen and that's
 

3419
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,010
spend all day on a screen and that's
like you know it's one of the reasons

3420
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:13,020
like you know it's one of the reasons
 

3421
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:15,049
like you know it's one of the reasons
why I care so much about about helping

3422
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:15,059
why I care so much about about helping
 

3423
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:17,390
why I care so much about about helping
to shape and accelerate the these future

3424
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:17,400
to shape and accelerate the these future
 

3425
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,069
to shape and accelerate the these future
Computing platforms I just think this is

3426
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:19,079
Computing platforms I just think this is
 

3427
01:00:19,079 --> 01:00:21,410
Computing platforms I just think this is
so powerful and it's it's you know even

3428
01:00:21,410 --> 01:00:21,420
so powerful and it's it's you know even
 

3429
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:22,250
so powerful and it's it's you know even
though

3430
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:22,260
though
 

3431
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:23,809
though
the current version of this is like

3432
01:00:23,809 --> 01:00:23,819
the current version of this is like
 

3433
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:25,849
the current version of this is like
you're wearing a headset

3434
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:25,859
you're wearing a headset
 

3435
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:27,589
you're wearing a headset
um I just think this is going to be by

3436
01:00:27,589 --> 01:00:27,599
um I just think this is going to be by
 

3437
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,349
um I just think this is going to be by
far the most human and social Computing

3438
01:00:30,349 --> 01:00:30,359
far the most human and social Computing
 

3439
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:33,650
far the most human and social Computing
platform that has ever existed and uh

3440
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:33,660
platform that has ever existed and uh
 

3441
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:36,109
platform that has ever existed and uh
that that's what makes me excited

3442
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:36,119
that that's what makes me excited
 

3443
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:38,690
that that's what makes me excited
yeah I I think just to linger on this

3444
01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:38,700
yeah I I think just to linger on this
 

3445
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,210
yeah I I think just to linger on this
kind of changing nature of reality like

3446
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:41,220
kind of changing nature of reality like
 

3447
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,069
kind of changing nature of reality like
of what is real

3448
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:43,079
of what is real
 

3449
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,849
of what is real
maybe shifting it towards

3450
01:00:46,849 --> 01:00:46,859
maybe shifting it towards
 

3451
01:00:46,859 --> 01:00:49,849
maybe shifting it towards
the sort of Consciousness so what is

3452
01:00:49,849 --> 01:00:49,859
the sort of Consciousness so what is
 

3453
01:00:49,859 --> 01:00:53,150
the sort of Consciousness so what is
real is the subjective experience of a

3454
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:53,160
real is the subjective experience of a
 

3455
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,690
real is the subjective experience of a
thing that makes it feel real versus

3456
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:55,700
thing that makes it feel real versus
 

3457
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:57,470
thing that makes it feel real versus
necessarily being in the same physical

3458
01:00:57,470 --> 01:00:57,480
necessarily being in the same physical
 

3459
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,870
necessarily being in the same physical
space because it feels like we're in the

3460
01:00:59,870 --> 01:00:59,880
space because it feels like we're in the
 

3461
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:01,970
space because it feels like we're in the
same physical space yeah and that the

3462
01:01:01,970 --> 01:01:01,980
same physical space yeah and that the
 

3463
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,190
same physical space yeah and that the
conscious experience of it that's

3464
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:04,200
conscious experience of it that's
 

3465
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,309
conscious experience of it that's
probably what is real not like that the

3466
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:07,319
probably what is real not like that the
 

3467
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:10,069
probably what is real not like that the
space-time like the physics of it like

3468
01:01:10,069 --> 01:01:10,079
space-time like the physics of it like
 

3469
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:12,049
space-time like the physics of it like
you're basically breaking physics and

3470
01:01:12,049 --> 01:01:12,059
you're basically breaking physics and
 

3471
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:14,210
you're basically breaking physics and
focusing on the Consciousness that's

3472
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:14,220
focusing on the Consciousness that's
 

3473
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:16,190
focusing on the Consciousness that's
what's real because whatever's going on

3474
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:16,200
what's real because whatever's going on
 

3475
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,230
what's real because whatever's going on
inside my head but there are a lot of

3476
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:18,240
inside my head but there are a lot of
 

3477
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,450
inside my head but there are a lot of
Social and psychological things that go

3478
01:01:20,450 --> 01:01:20,460
Social and psychological things that go
 

3479
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:22,670
Social and psychological things that go
along with that

3480
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:22,680
along with that
 

3481
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,950
along with that
experience that was previously only

3482
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:24,960
experience that was previously only
 

3483
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,870
experience that was previously only
physical presence right I think there's

3484
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:26,880
physical presence right I think there's
 

3485
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,230
physical presence right I think there's
like an intimacy a trust

3486
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:30,240
like an intimacy a trust
 

3487
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,150
like an intimacy a trust
um you know there's a level of

3488
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:32,160
um you know there's a level of
 

3489
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,410
um you know there's a level of
communication because so much of

3490
01:01:33,410 --> 01:01:33,420
communication because so much of
 

3491
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:35,210
communication because so much of
communication is non-verbal and is based

3492
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:35,220
communication is non-verbal and is based
 

3493
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,750
communication is non-verbal and is based
on Expressions that you're kind of

3494
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:37,760
on Expressions that you're kind of
 

3495
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,309
on Expressions that you're kind of
you're you're sharing with with someone

3496
01:01:40,309 --> 01:01:40,319
you're you're sharing with with someone
 

3497
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:41,990
you're you're sharing with with someone
when you're in this kind of

3498
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:42,000
when you're in this kind of
 

3499
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,450
when you're in this kind of
environment and before those things

3500
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:44,460
environment and before those things
 

3501
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,370
environment and before those things
would have only been possible you know

3502
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:46,380
would have only been possible you know
 

3503
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:48,950
would have only been possible you know
had you know I gotten on a plane and and

3504
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:48,960
had you know I gotten on a plane and and
 

3505
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,530
had you know I gotten on a plane and and
flown to Austin and and sat you know

3506
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:51,540
flown to Austin and and sat you know
 

3507
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,150
flown to Austin and and sat you know
physically with you in the same place so

3508
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:53,160
physically with you in the same place so
 

3509
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,030
physically with you in the same place so
I think we're we're basically

3510
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:56,040
I think we're we're basically
 

3511
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:58,609
I think we're we're basically
shortcutting those laws of physics and

3512
01:01:58,609 --> 01:01:58,619
shortcutting those laws of physics and
 

3513
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:01,190
shortcutting those laws of physics and
delivering these social and

3514
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:01,200
delivering these social and
 

3515
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,049
delivering these social and
psychological benefits of being able to

3516
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:03,059
psychological benefits of being able to
 

3517
01:02:03,059 --> 01:02:05,210
psychological benefits of being able to
be present and and feel like you're

3518
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:05,220
be present and and feel like you're
 

3519
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,530
be present and and feel like you're
there with another person which I think

3520
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:06,540
there with another person which I think
 

3521
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,450
there with another person which I think
the real benefits

3522
01:02:08,450 --> 01:02:08,460
the real benefits
 

3523
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,349
the real benefits
um

3524
01:02:09,349 --> 01:02:09,359
um
 

3525
01:02:09,359 --> 01:02:11,630
um
to anyone in the world and I I think

3526
01:02:11,630 --> 01:02:11,640
to anyone in the world and I I think
 

3527
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,250
to anyone in the world and I I think
that that like you said I think that is

3528
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:13,260
that that like you said I think that is
 

3529
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,410
that that like you said I think that is
going to be a very profound thing and

3530
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:15,420
going to be a very profound thing and
 

3531
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:17,569
going to be a very profound thing and
that a lot of that is that's the promise

3532
01:02:17,569 --> 01:02:17,579
that a lot of that is that's the promise
 

3533
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:20,510
that a lot of that is that's the promise
of of the metaverse and what you know

3534
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:20,520
of of the metaverse and what you know
 

3535
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,670
of of the metaverse and what you know
why you know I I just

3536
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:22,680
why you know I I just
 

3537
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:23,809
why you know I I just
well I think that that's the next

3538
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:23,819
well I think that that's the next
 

3539
01:02:23,819 --> 01:02:25,609
well I think that that's the next
Frontier for for what we're working on

3540
01:02:25,609 --> 01:02:25,619
Frontier for for what we're working on
 

3541
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:27,410
Frontier for for what we're working on
you know I started working on social

3542
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:27,420
you know I started working on social
 

3543
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,030
you know I started working on social
networks when they were primarily text

3544
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,040
networks when they were primarily text
 

3545
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:31,430
networks when they were primarily text
or the first version of Facebook your

3546
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:31,440
or the first version of Facebook your
 

3547
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:33,410
or the first version of Facebook your
profile you know you had one photo and

3548
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:33,420
profile you know you had one photo and
 

3549
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,849
profile you know you had one photo and
the rest of it was like lists of things

3550
01:02:34,849 --> 01:02:34,859
the rest of it was like lists of things
 

3551
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:37,309
the rest of it was like lists of things
they were interested in and and then we

3552
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:37,319
they were interested in and and then we
 

3553
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:38,390
they were interested in and and then we
kind of went through the period we were

3554
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:38,400
kind of went through the period we were
 

3555
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,910
kind of went through the period we were
doing photos and you know now we're kind

3556
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:40,920
doing photos and you know now we're kind
 

3557
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,230
doing photos and you know now we're kind
of in the period where most of the

3558
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:42,240
of in the period where most of the
 

3559
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,170
of in the period where most of the
content is video but there's a clear

3560
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:45,180
content is video but there's a clear
 

3561
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,690
content is video but there's a clear
Trend where you know over time the way

3562
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:47,700
Trend where you know over time the way
 

3563
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:49,910
Trend where you know over time the way
that we want to express ourselves and

3564
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:49,920
that we want to express ourselves and
 

3565
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,910
that we want to express ourselves and
and kind of get insight and content

3566
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:52,920
and kind of get insight and content
 

3567
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,829
and kind of get insight and content
about the world around us gets

3568
01:02:54,829 --> 01:02:54,839
about the world around us gets
 

3569
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:57,049
about the world around us gets
increasingly just richer and more Vivid

3570
01:02:57,049 --> 01:02:57,059
increasingly just richer and more Vivid
 

3571
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:00,410
increasingly just richer and more Vivid
and I think the ability to be immersed

3572
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:00,420
and I think the ability to be immersed
 

3573
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:02,329
and I think the ability to be immersed
and feel present with the people around

3574
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:02,339
and feel present with the people around
 

3575
01:03:02,339 --> 01:03:05,150
and feel present with the people around
you or the people who you care about is

3576
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:05,160
you or the people who you care about is
 

3577
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,670
you or the people who you care about is
from my perspective clearly the next

3578
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:07,680
from my perspective clearly the next
 

3579
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,730
from my perspective clearly the next
Frontier it just so happens that it's

3580
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:09,740
Frontier it just so happens that it's
 

3581
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,809
Frontier it just so happens that it's
incredibly technologically difficult

3582
01:03:11,809 --> 01:03:11,819
incredibly technologically difficult
 

3583
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:13,789
incredibly technologically difficult
right it requires building up these new

3584
01:03:13,789 --> 01:03:13,799
right it requires building up these new
 

3585
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:15,530
right it requires building up these new
Computing platforms and completely new

3586
01:03:15,530 --> 01:03:15,540
Computing platforms and completely new
 

3587
01:03:15,540 --> 01:03:18,170
Computing platforms and completely new
software Stacks to deliver that but I

3588
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:18,180
software Stacks to deliver that but I
 

3589
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:19,130
software Stacks to deliver that but I
mean I kind of feel like that's what

3590
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:19,140
mean I kind of feel like that's what
 

3591
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,069
mean I kind of feel like that's what
we're here to do as a company

3592
01:03:21,069 --> 01:03:21,079
we're here to do as a company
 

3593
01:03:21,079 --> 01:03:24,770
we're here to do as a company
well I really love the connection you

have through the conversation and so for
 

3597
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:29,210
have through the conversation and so for
me this photo realism is really really

3598
01:03:29,210 --> 01:03:29,220
me this photo realism is really really
 

3599
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:31,730
me this photo realism is really really
exciting I'm I'm uh really excited for

3600
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:31,740
