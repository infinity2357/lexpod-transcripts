563
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,060
champion you know by the rules could
retain his title in case of a tie so we

564
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:31,070
retain his title in case of a tie so we
 

565
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,550
retain his title in case of a tie so we
still have no before game 16 we have

566
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:33,560
still have no before game 16 we have
 

567
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,400
still have no before game 16 we have
nine games to go and also it was some

00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,340
nine games to go and also it was some
sort of a bluff because

570
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:38,350
sort of a bluff because
 

571
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:41,560
sort of a bluff because
neither me nor Karpov saw the reputation

572
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:41,570
neither me nor Karpov saw the reputation
 

573
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,830
neither me nor Karpov saw the reputation
of this opening idea and and I think it

574
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:44,840
of this opening idea and and I think it
 

575
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,570
of this opening idea and and I think it
says for carpel it was double blow

576
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:46,580
says for carpel it was double blow
 

577

because not that he lost the game I
 

579
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,870
because not that he lost the game I
should triple blow he lost the game it

580
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:49,880
should triple blow he lost the game it

it's in the 80s in the 90s it does
 

609
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,100
it's in the 80s in the 90s it does
happen these days because everybody has

and it has been discovered generation
 

815
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,580
and it has been discovered generation
after generation we added more and more

816
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:44,590

knowledge to the game of chess it's

818
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,020
knowledge to the game of chess it's
 

819
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:50,310
knowledge to the game of chess it's
about the gap between the world champion

820
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:50,320
about the gap between the world champion
 

821
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,260
about the gap between the world champion
and the rest of the field so it's the

822
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,270
and the rest of the field so it's the
 

823
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,680
and the rest of the field so it's the
now if you look at the gap then proud

824
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:55,690
now if you look at the gap then proud
 

825
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:58,470
now if you look at the gap then proud
official you know could be on top but

826
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:58,480
official you know could be on top but
 

827
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,120
official you know could be on top but
very short period of time then you

828
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,130
very short period of time then you
 

829
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:02,370
very short period of time then you
should also add a time factor yeah I was

830
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:02,380
should also add a time factor yeah I was
 

831
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:05,610
should also add a time factor yeah I was
on top not as big as but but much longer

832
00:18:05,610 --> 00:18:05,620
on top not as big as but but much longer
 

833
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,820
on top not as big as but but much longer
so so and also unlike Fischer I will

834
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:08,830
so so and also unlike Fischer I will
 

835
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:11,700
so so and also unlike Fischer I will
succeed in beating next generation yeah

836
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:11,710
succeed in beating next generation yeah
 

837
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,649
succeed in beating next generation yeah
here's the question yeah let's see if

838
00:18:13,649 --> 00:18:13,659
here's the question yeah let's see if
 

839
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,299
here's the question yeah let's see if
you still got the fire speaking of the

840
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:15,309
you still got the fire speaking of the
 

841
00:18:15,309 --> 00:18:17,159
you still got the fire speaking of the
next generation because you did succeed

842
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:17,169
next generation because you did succeed
 

843
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:19,649
next generation because you did succeed
beating the next generation it's close

844
00:18:19,649 --> 00:18:19,659
beating the next generation it's close
 

845
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:22,740
beating the next generation it's close

00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:09,020
the and and actually my answer when it
 

979
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,630
the and and actually my answer when it
just where that just you know I because

980
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:10,640
just where that just you know I because
 

981
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
just where that just you know I because
I I was asked this question as well so I

982
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:12,890
I I was asked this question as well so I
 

983
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,740
I I was asked this question as well so I
say that is this while it's impossible

984
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:14,750
say that is this while it's impossible
 

985
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,480
say that is this while it's impossible
to make a choice I would sue probably go

986
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:16,490
to make a choice I would sue probably go

with Maradona for simple reason the

988
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:18,070
with Maradona for simple reason the

Brazilian team in 1970 could have won

990
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:20,510
Brazilian team in 1970 could have won
 

991
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,960
Brazilian team in 1970 could have won
without Collette it was absolutely great

992
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:22,970
without Collette it was absolutely great
 

993
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,040
without Collette it was absolutely great
still could have won

994
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,050
still could have won
 

995
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:27,130
still could have won
maybe but it is the Argentinian team in

996
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:27,140
maybe but it is the Argentinian team in
 

997
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,230
maybe but it is the Argentinian team in
1986 without Maradona would not be in

998
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:29,240
1986 without Maradona would not be in
 

999
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,640
1986 without Maradona would not be in
the 5s so this is and Messi he still has

1000
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:32,650
the 5s so this is and Messi he still has
 

1001
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,310
the 5s so this is and Messi he still has
that's not good argue for that for an

1002
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:35,320
that's not good argue for that for an
 

1003
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
that's not good argue for that for an
hour but yes you could say if you ask

1004
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,330
hour but yes you could say if you ask
 

1005
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,600
hour but yes you could say if you ask
Maradona if you look in his eyes

1006
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:39,610
Maradona if you look in his eyes
 

1007
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:43,710
Maradona if you look in his eyes
especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he

1008
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:43,720
especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he
 

1009
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,410
especially let's say Gary Kasparov 99 he
would have said I was sure as hell would

1010
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:46,420
would have said I was sure as hell would
 

1011
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,260
would have said I was sure as hell would
be magnus carlsen it's just simply the

1012
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:49,270
be magnus carlsen it's just simply the
 

1013
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,960
be magnus carlsen it's just simply the
confidence fire simply because simply

1014
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:51,970
confidence fire simply because simply
 

1015
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,060
confidence fire simply because simply
because again it's just a so mean action

1016
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,070
because again it's just a so mean action
 

1017
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,770
because again it's just a so mean action
so this again it's it's the age factor

1018
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:55,780
so this again it's it's the age factor
 

1019
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,170
so this again it's it's the age factor
as important therefore is a passion and

1020
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:58,180
as important therefore is a passion and
 

1021
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,210
as important therefore is a passion and
energy and and being equipped with all

1022
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:00,220
energy and and being equipped with all
 

1023
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,780
energy and and being equipped with all
modern ideas but again then you make in

1024
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:03,790
modern ideas but again then you make in
 

1025
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,730
modern ideas but again then you make in
a very just important assumption that

1026
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:05,740
a very just important assumption that
 

1027
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:08,880
a very just important assumption that
you could empower Gary Kasparov 89 with

1028
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:08,890
you could empower Gary Kasparov 89 with
 

1029
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,470
you could empower Gary Kasparov 89 with
all ideas that have been accumulated

1030
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:10,480
all ideas that have been accumulated
 

1031
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
all ideas that have been accumulated
over 30 years that would not be Garrigus

1032
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:12,490
over 30 years that would not be Garrigus
 

1033
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:14,430
over 30 years that would not be Garrigus
part that would be someone else because

1034
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:14,440
part that would be someone else because
 

1035
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,370
part that would be someone else because
again I belong to 1989 I was way ahead

1036
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:17,380
again I belong to 1989 I was way ahead
 

1037
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:20,610
again I belong to 1989 I was way ahead
of the field and I you know a bit Karpov

1038
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:20,620
of the field and I you know a bit Karpov
 

1039
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,500
of the field and I you know a bit Karpov
several times in World Championship

1040
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,510
several times in World Championship
 

1041
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,680
several times in World Championship
matches and I crossed 2,800 which by the

1042
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:25,690
matches and I crossed 2,800 which by the
 

1043
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,050
matches and I crossed 2,800 which by the
way if you look at the chest in rating

1044
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,060
way if you look at the chest in rating
 

1045
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,830
way if you look at the chest in rating
which is just it's even today so this is

1046
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:31,840
which is just it's even today so this is
 

1047
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,960
which is just it's even today so this is
this is the rating that I retire so that

1048
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:33,970
this is the rating that I retire so that
 

1049
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,520
this is the rating that I retire so that
says it's still you know it's just it's

1050
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:35,530
says it's still you know it's just it's
 

1051
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,500
says it's still you know it's just it's
a it's a top two to three so that says

1052
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:37,510
a it's a top two to three so that says
 

1053
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,180
a it's a top two to three so that says
this is kerwin and eaglets about the

1054
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:39,190
this is kerwin and eaglets about the
 

1055
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:42,030
this is kerwin and eaglets about the
same rating now and I crossed 2,100 in

1056
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,040
same rating now and I crossed 2,100 in
 

1057
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,090
same rating now and I crossed 2,100 in
1990 we just look at the inflation when

1058
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:45,100
1990 we just look at the inflation when
 

1059
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,700
1990 we just look at the inflation when
I cross 2,800 in in 1990 there was only

1060
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:47,710
I cross 2,800 in in 1990 there was only
 

1061
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,040
I cross 2,800 in in 1990 there was only
one player in 2700 category Anatoly

1062
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:50,050
one player in 2700 category Anatoly
 

1063
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,590
one player in 2700 category Anatoly
Karpov now he had more than 50 so just

1064
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:52,600
Karpov now he had more than 50 so just
 

1065
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,490
Karpov now he had more than 50 so just
you see this

1066
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:53,500
you see this
 

1067
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,070
you see this
so if you add inflation so I think my

1068
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,080
so if you add inflation so I think my
 

1069
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,280
so if you add inflation so I think my
28:51 it could probably could be more

1070
00:22:59,280 --> 00:22:59,290
28:51 it could probably could be more
 

1071
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:02,510
28:51 it could probably could be more
valuable as Magnus 2882 which was

1072
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:02,520
valuable as Magnus 2882 which was
 

1073
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,280
valuable as Magnus 2882 which was
highest rating but anyway yeah you know

1074
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,290
highest rating but anyway yeah you know
 

1075
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:08,370
highest rating but anyway yeah you know
so many hypotheticals you're lost to IBM

1076
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:08,380
so many hypotheticals you're lost to IBM
 

1077
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,150
so many hypotheticals you're lost to IBM
gee blue in 1997 in my eyes there's one

1078
00:23:12,150 --> 00:23:12,160
gee blue in 1997 in my eyes there's one
 

1079
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,530
gee blue in 1997 in my eyes there's one
of the most seminal moments in the

1080
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:13,540
of the most seminal moments in the
 

1081
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,880
of the most seminal moments in the
history again I apologize for being

1082
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:16,890
history again I apologize for being
 

1083
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,960
history again I apologize for being
romanticized in the notion but in the

1084
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:18,970
romanticized in the notion but in the
 

1085
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,110
romanticized in the notion but in the
history of our civilization because

1285
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,690

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:16,490
we played against new chess engines like
 

1307
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,450
we played against new chess engines like
Fritz and other programs and then it

Steve was Israeli problem jr. that
appeared in yeah so there were several

1312
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:24,770
appeared in yeah so there were several
 

1313
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,250
appeared in yeah so there were several
problems I you know I lost few games in

1314
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:27,260
problems I you know I lost few games in
 

1315
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,830
problems I you know I lost few games in
blitz I lost one match against the

1316
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:29,840
blitz I lost one match against the
 

1317
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,440
blitz I lost one match against the
computer a chess engine 1994 rapid chess

1318

computer a chess engine 1994 rapid chess
 

1319
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,070
computer a chess engine 1994 rapid chess
so I lost one game 2d blue in 1996 match

1320
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:36,080
so I lost one game 2d blue in 1996 match
 

1321
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,440
so I lost one game 2d blue in 1996 match
the manner the match chef I want some

1322
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:38,450
the manner the match chef I want some
 

1323
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,060
the manner the match chef I want some
people you know tend to forget about it

1324
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,070
people you know tend to forget about it
 

1325
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,830
people you know tend to forget about it
that I won the first match yes

1326
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:41,840
that I won the first match yes
 

1327
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,020
that I won the first match yes
but it's it's we we made a very

1328
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:47,030
but it's it's we we made a very
 

1329
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,430
but it's it's we we made a very
important psychological mistake thinking

1330
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:48,440
important psychological mistake thinking
 

1331
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,830
important psychological mistake thinking
that the reason we lost blitz matches

1332
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:50,840
that the reason we lost blitz matches
 

1333
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,049
that the reason we lost blitz matches
five five minutes games the reason we

1334
00:28:53,049 --> 00:28:53,059
five five minutes games the reason we
 

1335
00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:54,880
five five minutes games the reason we
lost some of the rapid chess matches

1336
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:54,890
lost some of the rapid chess matches
 

1337
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,980
lost some of the rapid chess matches
twenty five minutes just because we

1338
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:56,990
twenty five minutes just because we
 

1339
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,080
twenty five minutes just because we
didn't have enough time if you play a

1340
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,090
didn't have enough time if you play a
 

1341
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:00,909
didn't have enough time if you play a
longer match we will not make the same

1342
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:00,919
longer match we will not make the same
 

1343
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:04,060
longer match we will not make the same
mistake nonsense so this yeah we had

1344
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:04,070
mistake nonsense so this yeah we had
 

1345
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:06,220
mistake nonsense so this yeah we had
more time but we still make mistakes and

1346
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,230
more time but we still make mistakes and
 

1347
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:07,930
more time but we still make mistakes and
machine also has more time and machines

1348
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:07,940
machine also has more time and machines
 

1349
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,600
machine also has more time and machines
machine will always you know I will

1350
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:10,610
machine will always you know I will
 

1351
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:13,570
machine will always you know I will
always be stated inconsistent compared

1352
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:13,580
always be stated inconsistent compared
 

1353
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,440
always be stated inconsistent compared
to humans instabilities and

1354
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,450
to humans instabilities and
 

1355
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:20,020
to humans instabilities and
inconsistencies and today we are at a

1356
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:20,030
inconsistencies and today we are at a
 

1357
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:22,180
inconsistencies and today we are at a
point where yes nobody talks about you

1358
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:22,190
point where yes nobody talks about you
 

1359
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,399
point where yes nobody talks about you
know humans playing use machines

1360
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:24,409
know humans playing use machines
 

1361
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:27,010
know humans playing use machines
machines can offer handicap two to two

1362
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,020
machines can offer handicap two to two
 

1363
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,830
machines can offer handicap two to two
top players still you know will will

1364
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:29,840
top players still you know will will
 

1365
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,080
top players still you know will will
will be favoring I think we're just

1366
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:32,090
will be favoring I think we're just
 

1367
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,090
will be favoring I think we're just
learning that is it's it's no longer

1368
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:34,100
learning that is it's it's no longer
 

1369
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,399
learning that is it's it's no longer
human versus machines it's about human

1370
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:36,409
human versus machines it's about human
 

1371
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:38,320
human versus machines it's about human
working with machines that's what I

1372
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:38,330
working with machines that's what I
 

1373
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:42,610
working with machines that's what I
recognized in 1998 just after licking my

1374
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:42,620
recognized in 1998 just after licking my
 

1375
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,440
recognized in 1998 just after licking my
wounds and spending one year in just in

1376
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:44,450
wounds and spending one year in just in
 

1377
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,840
wounds and spending one year in just in
a ruminating Saudi so what's happened at

1378
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:46,850
a ruminating Saudi so what's happened at
 

1379
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,960
a ruminating Saudi so what's happened at
in this match and I knew that though we

1380
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:49,970
in this match and I knew that though we
 

1381
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:51,640
in this match and I knew that though we
still could play against the machines I

1382
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:51,650
still could play against the machines I
 

1383
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:54,250
still could play against the machines I
had two more matches in 2003 playing

1384
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:54,260
had two more matches in 2003 playing
 

1385
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,830
had two more matches in 2003 playing
both a deep freeze and deep jr. both

1386
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:56,840
both a deep freeze and deep jr. both
 

1387
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,799
both a deep freeze and deep jr. both
matches and there's a tie mmm-hmm though

1388
00:29:59,799 --> 00:29:59,809
matches and there's a tie mmm-hmm though
 

1389
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:02,470
matches and there's a tie mmm-hmm though
this machines were not weaker at least I

1390
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:02,480
this machines were not weaker at least I
 

1391
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,320
this machines were not weaker at least I
promise stronger and II blue and by the

1392
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:05,330
promise stronger and II blue and by the
 

1393
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,740
promise stronger and II blue and by the
way today just app on your mobile phone

1394
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:08,750
way today just app on your mobile phone
 

1395
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,029
way today just app on your mobile phone
is probably stronger than the blue

1396
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:10,039
is probably stronger than the blue
 

1397
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,649
is probably stronger than the blue
individual I'm not speaking of any bit

1398
00:30:11,649 --> 00:30:11,659
individual I'm not speaking of any bit
 

1399
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:13,210
individual I'm not speaking of any bit
about chess engines that are so much

1400
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:13,220
about chess engines that are so much
 

1401
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:15,850
about chess engines that are so much
superior and by the way when you analyze

1402
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:15,860
superior and by the way when you analyze
 

1403
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,710
superior and by the way when you analyze
games who played against the blue 90 97

1404
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:17,720
games who played against the blue 90 97
 

1405
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,780
games who played against the blue 90 97
on your chess engine they'll be laughing

1406
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:19,790
on your chess engine they'll be laughing
 

1407
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:22,210
on your chess engine they'll be laughing
yeah so this is and it's also shows

1408
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,220
yeah so this is and it's also shows
 

1409
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,220
yeah so this is and it's also shows
that's how it just changed because

1410
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,230
that's how it just changed because
 

1411
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:26,289
that's how it just changed because
just commentators they look at some of

1412
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:26,299
just commentators they look at some of
 

1413
00:30:26,299 --> 00:30:28,570
just commentators they look at some of
our games like game for Game five and

1414
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:28,580
our games like game for Game five and
 

1415
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,879
our games like game for Game five and
idea now you asked stockfish you asked

1416
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:33,889
idea now you asked stockfish you asked
 

1417
00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:35,049
idea now you asked stockfish you asked
Houdini

1418
00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:35,059
Houdini
 

1419
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:36,489
Houdini
you asked Commodore all the leading

1420
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:36,499
you asked Commodore all the leading
 

1421
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,560
you asked Commodore all the leading
chess engines yeah within 30 seconds

1422
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:38,570
chess engines yeah within 30 seconds
 

1423
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,940
chess engines yeah within 30 seconds
they will show you how many mistakes

1424
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:39,950
they will show you how many mistakes
 

1425
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:43,779
they will show you how many mistakes
booze Gary and D blue mate in the game

1426
00:30:43,779 --> 00:30:43,789
booze Gary and D blue mate in the game
 

1427
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:48,539
booze Gary and D blue mate in the game
that was from Pettitte as the as a great

1428
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:48,549
that was from Pettitte as the as a great
 

1429
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:52,299
that was from Pettitte as the as a great
chess match in 1997 well okay so you've

1430
00:30:52,299 --> 00:30:52,309
chess match in 1997 well okay so you've
 

1431
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,700
chess match in 1997 well okay so you've
made an interesting if you can untangle

1432
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:54,710
made an interesting if you can untangle
 

1433
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,320
made an interesting if you can untangle
that comment so now in retrospect it was

1434
00:30:59,320 --> 00:30:59,330
that comment so now in retrospect it was
 

1435
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,930
that comment so now in retrospect it was
a mistake to see chess as the peak of

1436
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:01,940
a mistake to see chess as the peak of
 

1437
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,509
a mistake to see chess as the peak of
human intellect nevertheless that was

1438
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:04,519
human intellect nevertheless that was
 

1439
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:05,799
human intellect nevertheless that was
done for centuries

1440
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:05,809
done for centuries
 

1441
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:10,389
done for centuries
so even in Europe because you know you

1442
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:10,399
so even in Europe because you know you
 

1443
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,739
so even in Europe because you know you
move to the far east they will go there

1444
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:13,749
move to the far east they will go there
 

1445
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:16,480
move to the far east they will go there
shogi games again I guess some of the

1446
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:16,490
shogi games again I guess some of the
 

1447
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:20,259
shogi games again I guess some of the
games like you look our board games yes

1448
00:31:20,259 --> 00:31:20,269
games like you look our board games yes
 

1449
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:23,499
games like you look our board games yes
yes yeah so if I push back a little bit

1450
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:23,509
yes yeah so if I push back a little bit
 

1451
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:27,279
yes yeah so if I push back a little bit
so now you say that okay but it was a

1452
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:27,289
so now you say that okay but it was a
 

1453
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:29,230
so now you say that okay but it was a
mistake to see chess as the epitome and

1454
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:29,240
mistake to see chess as the epitome and
 

1455
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,509
mistake to see chess as the epitome and
now and then now there's other things

1456
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
now and then now there's other things
 

1457
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,509
now and then now there's other things
maybe like language that conversation

1458
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:34,519
maybe like language that conversation
 

1459
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:36,430
maybe like language that conversation
like some of the things that in your

1460
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:36,440
like some of the things that in your
 

1461
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,159
like some of the things that in your
view is still way out of reach of

1462
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:39,169
view is still way out of reach of
 

1463
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:41,230
view is still way out of reach of
computers but inside humans do you think

1464
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:41,240
computers but inside humans do you think
 

1465
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,180
computers but inside humans do you think
can you talk about what those things

1466
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:43,190
can you talk about what those things
 

1467
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:46,060
can you talk about what those things
might be and do you think just like

1468
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,070
might be and do you think just like
 

1469
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,019
might be and do you think just like
chess that might fall soon with the same

1470
00:31:50,019 --> 00:31:50,029
chess that might fall soon with the same
 

1471
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:51,820
chess that might fall soon with the same
set of approaches if you look at alpha

1472
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:51,830
set of approaches if you look at alpha
 

1473
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,190
set of approaches if you look at alpha
zero the same kind of learning

1474
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:54,200
zero the same kind of learning
 

1475
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,859
zero the same kind of learning
approaches as the machines grow in size

1476
00:31:56,859 --> 00:31:56,869
approaches as the machines grow in size
 

1477
00:31:56,869 --> 00:31:59,710
approaches as the machines grow in size
no no it's not about in size it's about

1478
00:31:59,710 --> 00:31:59,720
no no it's not about in size it's about
 

1479
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,960
no no it's not about in size it's about
again it's about understanding the

1480
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:01,970
again it's about understanding the
 

1481
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,549
again it's about understanding the
difference but in closed system an

1482
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:03,559
difference but in closed system an
 

1483
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,249
difference but in closed system an
open-ended system so you think that key

1484
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:06,259
open-ended system so you think that key
 

1485
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:09,220
open-ended system so you think that key
difference so the board games are closed

1486
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,230
difference so the board games are closed
 

1487
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,680
difference so the board games are closed
in terms of the rules that they actions

1488
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:11,690
in terms of the rules that they actions
 

1489
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,180
in terms of the rules that they actions
simple the state space

1490
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,190
simple the state space
 

1491
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,359
simple the state space
everything is just constrained you think

1492
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:16,369
everything is just constrained you think
 

1493
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,080
everything is just constrained you think
once you open it the machines are lost

1494
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,090
once you open it the machines are lost
 

1495
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:22,239
once you open it the machines are lost
not lost but again the effectiveness is

1496
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:22,249
not lost but again the effectiveness is
 

1497
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:24,639
not lost but again the effectiveness is
very different because machine does not

1498
00:32:24,639 --> 00:32:24,649
very different because machine does not
 

1499
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,080
very different because machine does not
understand the moment it's reaching the

1500
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,090
understand the moment it's reaching the
 

1501
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:28,210
understand the moment it's reaching the
territory of diminishing returns hmm

1502
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:28,220
territory of diminishing returns hmm
 

1503
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,019
territory of diminishing returns hmm
it's the simple in a different way

1504
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:32,029
it's the simple in a different way
 

1505
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,289
it's the simple in a different way
machine doesn't know how to ask right

1506
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:35,299
machine doesn't know how to ask right
 

1507
00:32:35,299 --> 00:32:37,299
machine doesn't know how to ask right
questions it can ask questions but

1508
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:37,309
questions it can ask questions but
 

1509
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:38,769
questions it can ask questions but
we'll never tell you which questions are

1510
00:32:38,769 --> 00:32:38,779
we'll never tell you which questions are
 

1511
00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:40,690
we'll never tell you which questions are
relevant so this D it's like about the

1512
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:40,700
relevant so this D it's like about the
 

1513
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,239
relevant so this D it's like about the
it's the it's a direction so these it's

1514
00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:43,249
it's the it's a direction so these it's
 

1515
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:45,369
it's the it's a direction so these it's
I think is in human relations we have to

1516
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:45,379
I think is in human relations we have to
 

1517
00:32:45,379 --> 00:32:48,519
I think is in human relations we have to
consider so our role and people many

1518
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:48,529
consider so our role and people many
 

1519
00:32:48,529 --> 00:32:50,379
consider so our role and people many
people feel uncomfortable that is the

1520
00:32:50,379 --> 00:32:50,389
people feel uncomfortable that is the
 

1521
00:32:50,389 --> 00:32:53,320
people feel uncomfortable that is the
territory that that belongs to us is is

1522
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,330
territory that that belongs to us is is
 

1523
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:56,950
territory that that belongs to us is is
shrinking I'm saying so what you know is

1524
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
shrinking I'm saying so what you know is
 

1525
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,989
shrinking I'm saying so what you know is
this is eventually will belong to the

1526
00:32:58,989 --> 00:32:58,999
this is eventually will belong to the
 

1527
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,509
this is eventually will belong to the
last few decimal points but it's like

1528
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:01,519
last few decimal points but it's like
 

1529
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,860
last few decimal points but it's like
having so very powerful gun that's and

1530
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:05,870
having so very powerful gun that's and
 

1531
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:08,289
having so very powerful gun that's and
and and and all you can do there is

1532
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:08,299
and and and all you can do there is
 

1533
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:11,200
and and and all you can do there is
slightly you know alter direction of the

1534
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,210
slightly you know alter direction of the
 

1535
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:13,259
slightly you know alter direction of the
bullet maybe you know point one the

1536
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:13,269
bullet maybe you know point one the
 

1537
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:17,379
bullet maybe you know point one the
degree of this angle but that means a

1538
00:33:17,379 --> 00:33:17,389
degree of this angle but that means a
 

1539
00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:21,820
degree of this angle but that means a
mile away ten meters of tourists so so

1540
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:21,830
mile away ten meters of tourists so so
 

1541
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,340
mile away ten meters of tourists so so
that's we have to recognize that is a

1542
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:24,350
that's we have to recognize that is a
 

1543
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,739
that's we have to recognize that is a
certain unique human qualities that

1544
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:26,749
certain unique human qualities that
 

1545
00:33:26,749 --> 00:33:30,340
certain unique human qualities that
machine's in the foreseeable future will

1546
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:30,350
machine's in the foreseeable future will
 

1547
00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:33,909
machine's in the foreseeable future will
not be able to reproduce and and the

1548
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:33,919
not be able to reproduce and and the
 

1549
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:35,680
not be able to reproduce and and the
effectiveness of this cooperation

1550
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:35,690
effectiveness of this cooperation
 

1551
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,450
effectiveness of this cooperation
collaboration depends on our

1552
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:37,460
collaboration depends on our
 

1553
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,399
collaboration depends on our
understanding what exactly we can bring

1554
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:39,409
understanding what exactly we can bring
 

1555
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:42,430
understanding what exactly we can bring
into the game so the greatest danger is

1556
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:42,440
into the game so the greatest danger is
 

1557
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,320
into the game so the greatest danger is
when we try to interfere with machines

1558
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:44,330
when we try to interfere with machines
 

1559
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,090
when we try to interfere with machines
superior knowledge so that's why I

1560
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:46,100

00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,770
I I know that certain witnesses there
now if these wings are exposed and that

1716
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:05,780
now if these wings are exposed and that
 

1717
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,630
now if these wings are exposed and that
question is how many games will it take

1718
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:07,640
question is how many games will it take
 

1719
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,910
question is how many games will it take
for alpha zero to correct it the answer

1720
00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:09,920
for alpha zero to correct it the answer
 

1721
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,010
for alpha zero to correct it the answer
is hundreds of thousands even if it

1722
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:12,020
is hundreds of thousands even if it
 

1723
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,320
is hundreds of thousands even if it
keeps losing it it's this because the

1724
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:14,330
keeps losing it it's this because the
 

1725
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:17,980
keeps losing it it's this because the
whole system is based yes so it's now

1726
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:17,990
whole system is based yes so it's now
 

1727
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,540
whole system is based yes so it's now
imagine so that says you can have a

1728
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:19,550
imagine so that says you can have a
 

1729
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,790
imagine so that says you can have a
human by just making few tweaks so

1730
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:21,800
human by just making few tweaks so
 

1731
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,910
human by just making few tweaks so
humans are still more flexible and and

1732
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:24,920
humans are still more flexible and and
 

1733
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,490
humans are still more flexible and and
as long as we recognize what is what is

1734
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:27,500
as long as we recognize what is what is
 

1735
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:31,120
as long as we recognize what is what is
our raw where we can play sort of so the

1736
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:31,130
our raw where we can play sort of so the
 

1737
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,970
our raw where we can play sort of so the
most valuable part in this collaboration

1738
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:33,980
most valuable part in this collaboration
 

1739
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:36,640
most valuable part in this collaboration
so it's it will help us to understand

1740
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:36,650
so it's it will help us to understand
 

1741
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,650
so it's it will help us to understand
what are the next steps in human machine

1742
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:38,660
what are the next steps in human machine
 

1743
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,290
what are the next steps in human machine
collaboration beautifully put

1744
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:41,300
collaboration beautifully put
 

1745
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,670
collaboration beautifully put
so let's talk about the thing that

1746
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:42,680
so let's talk about the thing that
 

1747
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,470
so let's talk about the thing that
machine's certainly don't know how to do

1748
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:44,480
machine's certainly don't know how to do
 

1749
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,780
machine's certainly don't know how to do
yet which is morality machines and

1750
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:46,790
yet which is morality machines and
 

1751
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,460
yet which is morality machines and
morality but it's another question that

1752
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:48,470
morality but it's another question that
 

1753
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,470
morality but it's another question that
I know just it's that's as being asked

1754
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:50,480
I know just it's that's as being asked
 

1755
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,330
I know just it's that's as being asked
all the time these days and I I think

1756
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:52,340
all the time these days and I I think
 

1757
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:56,260
all the time these days and I I think
it's another phantom that is haunting a

1758
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,270
it's another phantom that is haunting a
 

1759
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,300
it's another phantom that is haunting a
general public because it's just being

1760
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:58,310
general public because it's just being
 

1761
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:01,180
general public because it's just being
fed with this you know illusions is that

1762
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,190
fed with this you know illusions is that
 

1763
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:05,080
fed with this you know illusions is that
how can we vote machines you know having

1764
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,090
how can we vote machines you know having
 

1765
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,040
how can we vote machines you know having
bias need prejudices you cannot because

1766
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,050
bias need prejudices you cannot because
 

1767
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:10,599
bias need prejudices you cannot because
it's like looking in the mirror and

1768
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:10,609
it's like looking in the mirror and
 

1769
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:12,460
it's like looking in the mirror and
complaining about what you see if you

1770
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:12,470
complaining about what you see if you
 

1771
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:15,190
complaining about what you see if you
have certain bias in the society machine

1772
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
have certain bias in the society machine
 

1773
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,010
have certain bias in the society machine
will will just follow it it's just it's

1774
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,020
will will just follow it it's just it's
 

1775
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,870
will will just follow it it's just it's
it's you know you look at the mirror you

1776
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:19,880
it's you know you look at the mirror you
 

1777
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,160
it's you know you look at the mirror you
don't like what you see there you can

1778
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,170
don't like what you see there you can
 

1779
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,430
don't like what you see there you can
you know you can break it you can try to

1780
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:24,440
you know you can break it you can try to
 

1781
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,320
you know you can break it you can try to
distort it or you can try to actually

1782
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:26,330
distort it or you can try to actually
 

1783
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,170
distort it or you can try to actually
change something just itself yes

1784
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:29,180
change something just itself yes
 

1785
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,420
change something just itself yes
by yourself yes so it's very important

1786
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:31,430
by yourself yes so it's very important
 

1787
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,710
by yourself yes so it's very important
to understand is this is you cannot

1788
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:32,720
to understand is this is you cannot
 

1789
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,620
to understand is this is you cannot
expect machines to to improve the ease

1790
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:35,630
expect machines to to improve the ease
 

1791
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,680
expect machines to to improve the ease
of our society and moreover machines

1792
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:38,690
of our society and moreover machines
 

1793
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:40,900
of our society and moreover machines
will simply know just you know amplified

1794
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:40,910
will simply know just you know amplified
 

1795
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,950
will simply know just you know amplified
yes yeah but the thing is people are

1796
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:43,960
yes yeah but the thing is people are
 

1797
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,650
yes yeah but the thing is people are
more comfortable with other people doing

1798
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:47,660
more comfortable with other people doing
 

1799
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,260
more comfortable with other people doing
injustice would being biased

1800
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,270
injustice would being biased
 

1801
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:52,030
injustice would being biased
we're not comfortable with machines

1802
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:52,040
we're not comfortable with machines
 

1803
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:56,109
we're not comfortable with machines
having the same kind of bias so that's a

1804
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:56,119
having the same kind of bias so that's a
 

1805
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:58,329
having the same kind of bias so that's a
that's an interesting standard that we

1806
00:38:58,329 --> 00:38:58,339
that's an interesting standard that we
 

1807
00:38:58,339 --> 00:38:59,859
that's an interesting standard that we
place on machines with autonomous

1808
00:38:59,859 --> 00:38:59,869
place on machines with autonomous
 

1809
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:02,460
place on machines with autonomous
vehicles they have to be much safer with

1810
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:02,470
vehicles they have to be much safer with
 

1811
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,540
vehicles they have to be much safer with
automated systems because they're much

1812
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:04,550
automated systems because they're much
 

1813
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,670
automated systems because they're much
safer statistically they're much safer

1814
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:06,680
safer statistically they're much safer
 

1815
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,520
safer statistically they're much safer
than then of course why would they it's

1816
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:09,530
than then of course why would they it's
 

1817
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:13,290
than then of course why would they it's
not of course it's it's not given

1818
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:13,300
not of course it's it's not given
 

1819
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,760
not of course it's it's not given
autonomous vehicles you have to work

1820
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:15,770
autonomous vehicles you have to work
 

1821
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,440
autonomous vehicles you have to work
really hard to make them

1822
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,450
really hard to make them
 

1823
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:22,270
really hard to make them
is safer i I think it just goes without

1824
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:22,280
is safer i I think it just goes without
 

1825
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,060
is safer i I think it just goes without
saying is the the outcome of the of this

1826
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:25,070
saying is the the outcome of the of this
 

1827
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,700
saying is the the outcome of the of this
alcohol competition but comparison is

1828
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:27,710
alcohol competition but comparison is
 

1829
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:30,430
alcohol competition but comparison is
very clear but the problem is not about

1830
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:30,440
very clear but the problem is not about
 

1831
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:34,540
very clear but the problem is not about
being in a safer it's the forty thousand

1832
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:34,550
being in a safer it's the forty thousand
 

1833
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:36,579
being in a safer it's the forty thousand
people will show every year died in car

1834
00:39:36,579 --> 00:39:36,589
people will show every year died in car
 

1835
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:39,010
people will show every year died in car
accidents United States and it's its

1836
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:39,020
accidents United States and it's its
 

1837
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,470
accidents United States and it's its
statistics one accident ways with

1838
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:41,480
statistics one accident ways with
 

1839
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,359
statistics one accident ways with
autonomous vehicle and it's front page

1840
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:43,369
autonomous vehicle and it's front page
 

1841
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:47,410
autonomous vehicle and it's front page
of a newspaper yeah this was cycle so

1842
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:47,420
of a newspaper yeah this was cycle so
 

1843
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,750
of a newspaper yeah this was cycle so
it's while people you know kill each

1844
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:49,760
it's while people you know kill each
 

1845
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,160
it's while people you know kill each
other in car accidents because they make

1846
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,170
other in car accidents because they make
 

1847
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,020
other in car accidents because they make
mistakes they make more mistakes for me

1848
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,030
mistakes they make more mistakes for me
 

1849
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,819
mistakes they make more mistakes for me
it's it's it's not a question of course

1850
00:39:54,819 --> 00:39:54,829
it's it's it's not a question of course
 

1851
00:39:54,829 --> 00:39:56,620
it's it's it's not a question of course
we make more mistakes because we human

1852
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:56,630
we make more mistakes because we human
 

1853
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,440
we make more mistakes because we human
yes machines old and by the way no

1854
00:39:59,440 --> 00:39:59,450
yes machines old and by the way no
 

1855
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,819
yes machines old and by the way no
machine will ever reach hundred percent

1856
00:40:00,819 --> 00:40:00,829
machine will ever reach hundred percent
 

1857
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,170
machine will ever reach hundred percent
perfection that's not that that's

1858
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:02,180
perfection that's not that that's
 

1859
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,180
perfection that's not that that's
another important take story that that

1860
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:04,190
another important take story that that
 

1861
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,829
another important take story that that
that is being fed to the public if

1862
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:05,839
that is being fed to the public if
 

1863
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:07,780
that is being fed to the public if
machine doesn't reach hundreds and

1864
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:07,790
machine doesn't reach hundreds and
 

1865
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,390
machine doesn't reach hundreds and
performance is not safe no all you can

1866
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:10,400
performance is not safe no all you can
 

1867
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,339
performance is not safe no all you can
ask any computer whether it's you know

1868
00:40:12,339 --> 00:40:12,349
ask any computer whether it's you know
 

1869
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:15,099
ask any computer whether it's you know
playing chess or or doing the stock

1870
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:15,109
playing chess or or doing the stock
 

1871
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:17,410
playing chess or or doing the stock
market calculations or driving your

1872
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:17,420
market calculations or driving your
 

1873
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,630
market calculations or driving your
autonomous vehicle it's to make fewer

1874
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:19,640
autonomous vehicle it's to make fewer
 

1875
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:22,960
autonomous vehicle it's to make fewer
mistakes and yes I know it's not you

1876
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:22,970
mistakes and yes I know it's not you
 

1877
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,730
mistakes and yes I know it's not you
know it's not easy for us to accept

1878
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:24,740
know it's not easy for us to accept
 

1879
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,800
know it's not easy for us to accept
because ah if you know if you have to

1880
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:26,810
because ah if you know if you have to
 

1881
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,460
because ah if you know if you have to
humans

1882
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:27,470
humans
 

1883
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,550
humans
you know colliding in their cars okay

1884
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:30,560
you know colliding in their cars okay
 

1885
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,069
you know colliding in their cars okay
it's like if one of one of these cars is

1886
00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:33,079
it's like if one of one of these cars is
 

1887
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:34,569
it's like if one of one of these cars is
autonomous very vehicle and by the way

1888
00:40:34,569 --> 00:40:34,579
autonomous very vehicle and by the way
 

1889
00:40:34,579 --> 00:40:36,309
autonomous very vehicle and by the way
even if it's humans fault

1890
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:36,319
even if it's humans fault
 

1891
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,470
even if it's humans fault
terrible how could you allow a machine

1892
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:38,480
terrible how could you allow a machine
 

1893
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,680
terrible how could you allow a machine
to do it you to run without driver ID at

1894
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:41,690
to do it you to run without driver ID at
 

1895
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:42,339
to do it you to run without driver ID at
the wheel

1896
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:42,349
the wheel
 

1897
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:44,470
the wheel
so you know let's think of that for a

1898
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:44,480
so you know let's think of that for a
 

1899
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,290
so you know let's think of that for a
second that double standard the way you

1900
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:47,300
second that double standard the way you
 

1901
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,859
second that double standard the way you
felt with your first loss against D blue

1902
00:40:50,859 --> 00:40:50,869
felt with your first loss against D blue
 

1903
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,460
felt with your first loss against D blue
were you treating the Machine

1904
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:53,470
were you treating the Machine
 

1905
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,770
were you treating the Machine
differently than you would have a human

1906
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:55,780
differently than you would have a human
 

1907
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:58,210
differently than you would have a human
or so what do you think about that

1908
00:40:58,210 --> 00:40:58,220
or so what do you think about that
 

1909
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,530
or so what do you think about that
difference between the way we see

1910
00:40:59,530 --> 00:40:59,540
difference between the way we see
 

1911
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:04,420
difference between the way we see
machines and humans no it's a match and

1912
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:04,430
machines and humans no it's a match and
 

1913
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,890
machines and humans no it's a match and
that's why I was angry because I believe

1914
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:05,900
that's why I was angry because I believe
 

1915
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,690
that's why I was angry because I believe
they're lost the match was not you know

1916
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:07,700
they're lost the match was not you know
 

1917
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,870
they're lost the match was not you know
fairly organized so the states

1918
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:09,880
fairly organized so the states
 

1919
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,859
fairly organized so the states
definitely they were unfair advantages

1920
00:41:11,859 --> 00:41:11,869
definitely they were unfair advantages
 

1921
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:13,900
definitely they were unfair advantages
for for IBM and I want to play there

1922
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:13,910
for for IBM and I want to play there
 

1923
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,960
for for IBM and I want to play there
another match like rubble mess

1924
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:16,970
another match like rubble mess
 

1925
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:19,870
another match like rubble mess
so you're angered or displeasure was a

1926
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:19,880
so you're angered or displeasure was a
 

1927
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,180
so you're angered or displeasure was a
more like at the humans behind IBM

1928
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:22,190
more like at the humans behind IBM
 

1929
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,069
more like at the humans behind IBM
versus the actual your absolute

1930
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:24,079
versus the actual your absolute
 

1931
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,349
versus the actual your absolute
algorithm absolutely look I I knew at

1932
00:41:26,349 --> 00:41:26,359
algorithm absolutely look I I knew at
 

1933
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:27,569
algorithm absolutely look I I knew at
the time and by the way I was

1934
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:27,579
the time and by the way I was
 

1935
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:29,950
the time and by the way I was
objectively speaking I was stronger at

1936
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:29,960
objectively speaking I was stronger at
 

1937
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,390
objectively speaking I was stronger at
that time so that's that

1938
00:41:31,390 --> 00:41:31,400
that time so that's that
 

1939
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,099
that time so that's that
we added to my anger because I knew I

1940
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:33,109
we added to my anger because I knew I
 

1941
00:41:33,109 --> 00:41:35,140
we added to my anger because I knew I
could beat machine yeah yeah so this and

1942
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:35,150
could beat machine yeah yeah so this and
 

1943
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:37,240
could beat machine yeah yeah so this and
that's the and I lost and I knew I was

1944
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:37,250
that's the and I lost and I knew I was
 

1945
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,220
that's the and I lost and I knew I was
not well prepared so because they I have

1946
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:39,230
not well prepared so because they I have
 

1947
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,569
not well prepared so because they I have
to give them credit they did some good

1948
00:41:40,569 --> 00:41:40,579
to give them credit they did some good
 

1949
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:44,170
to give them credit they did some good
work from 1996 and I but I still could

1950
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:44,180
work from 1996 and I but I still could
 

1951
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,180
work from 1996 and I but I still could
beat the machine so I made too many

1952
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:46,190
beat the machine so I made too many
 

1953
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:48,190
beat the machine so I made too many
mistakes also this is the hole is this

1954
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:48,200
mistakes also this is the hole is this
 

1955
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,370
mistakes also this is the hole is this
the publicity around the match so I

1956
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:50,380
the publicity around the match so I
 

1957
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,569
the publicity around the match so I
underestimated the effect you know just

1958
00:41:52,569 --> 00:41:52,579
underestimated the effect you know just
 

1959
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:54,190
underestimated the effect you know just
it's Andy and being called the you know

1960
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:54,200
it's Andy and being called the you know
 

1961
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,510
it's Andy and being called the you know
the the brains lost and ounce okay no

1962
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:58,520
the the brains lost and ounce okay no
 

1963
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,510
the the brains lost and ounce okay no
pressure okay well let me ask so I was

1964
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:04,520
pressure okay well let me ask so I was
 

1965
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,059
pressure okay well let me ask so I was
born also in the Soviet Union what

1966
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:07,069
born also in the Soviet Union what
 

1967
00:42:07,069 --> 00:42:08,799
born also in the Soviet Union what
lessons do you draw from the rise and

1968
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:08,809
lessons do you draw from the rise and
 

1969
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:10,240
lessons do you draw from the rise and
fall of the Soviet Union

1970
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,250
fall of the Soviet Union
 

1971
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,130
fall of the Soviet Union
in the 20th century when you just look

1972
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,140
in the 20th century when you just look
 

1973
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:17,349
in the 20th century when you just look
at this nation that is now look I'm

1974
00:42:17,349 --> 00:42:17,359
at this nation that is now look I'm
 

1975
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:19,390
at this nation that is now look I'm
pushing forward into what Russia is if

1976
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:19,400
pushing forward into what Russia is if
 

1977
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,460
pushing forward into what Russia is if
you look at the long arc of history of

1978
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:21,470
you look at the long arc of history of
 

1979
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:26,220
you look at the long arc of history of
the 20th century what do we take away

1980
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,230
the 20th century what do we take away
 

1981
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:29,170
the 20th century what do we take away
what do we take away from that I think

1982
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:29,180
what do we take away from that I think
 

1983
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:35,050
what do we take away from that I think
the lesson of history is clear

1984
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:35,060

 

1985
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,460

undemocratic systems totalitarian

1986
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:37,470
undemocratic systems totalitarian
 

1987
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:40,780
undemocratic systems totalitarian
regimes systems that are based on

1988
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:40,790
regimes systems that are based on
 

1989
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:43,540
regimes systems that are based on
controlling their citizens and just

1990
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:43,550
controlling their citizens and just
 

1991
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:47,480
controlling their citizens and just
every aspect of their life not offering

1992
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:47,490
every aspect of their life not offering
 

1993
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,190
every aspect of their life not offering
opportunities to for private initiative

1994
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:52,200
opportunities to for private initiative
 

1995
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,260
opportunities to for private initiative
central planning systems they duped they

1996
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:55,270
central planning systems they duped they
 

1997
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:58,650
central planning systems they duped they
just you know they they cannot be

1998
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:58,660
just you know they they cannot be
 

1999
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,050
just you know they they cannot be
driving force for innovation so they in

2000
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:01,060
driving force for innovation so they in
 

2001
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:03,030
driving force for innovation so they in
in history timeline I mean they could

2002
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,040
in history timeline I mean they could
 

2003
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,030
in history timeline I mean they could
cause certain you know

2004
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,040
cause certain you know
 

2005
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,530
cause certain you know
distortion of the concept of progress

2006
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:10,540
distortion of the concept of progress
 

2007
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:12,550
distortion of the concept of progress
they by the way call themselves

2008
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:12,560
they by the way call themselves
 

2009
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,800
they by the way call themselves
progressive but we know that is this the

2010
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:14,810
progressive but we know that is this the
 

2011
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,440
progressive but we know that is this the
damage that they cost to to humanity is

2012
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:17,450
damage that they cost to to humanity is
 

2013
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:19,270
damage that they cost to to humanity is
just it's it's it's yet to be measured

2014
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:19,280
just it's it's it's yet to be measured
 

2015
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,940
just it's it's it's yet to be measured
but at the end of the day they fail they

2016
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:21,950
but at the end of the day they fail they
 

2017
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,400
but at the end of the day they fail they
fail and it's and the end of the Cold

2018
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:24,410
fail and it's and the end of the Cold
 

2019

fail and it's and the end of the Cold
War was a great triumph of the free

2020
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:27,260
War was a great triumph of the free
 

2021
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:29,440
War was a great triumph of the free
world it's not that the free world is

2022
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:29,450
world it's not that the free world is
 

2023
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,120
world it's not that the free world is
