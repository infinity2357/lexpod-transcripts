00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:02,960
especially if uh if it's
 

467
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,469
especially if uh if it's
you're they're young and uh they die

468

but i think that's great and i also
think that it's going to be possible

478
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:14,560
think that it's going to be possible
 

479
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,950
think that it's going to be possible
especially when we're recording some of

480
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:16,960
especially when we're recording some of
 

481
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,629
especially when we're recording some of
us every aspect of our lives whether

482
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:18,639
us every aspect of our lives whether
 

483

us every aspect of our lives whether
it's

484
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:19,280
it's
 

485
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,550
it's
our face or uh things we see right

our face or uh things we see right
 

487
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,469
our face or uh things we see right
eventually one day everything we see can

488
00:08:24,469 --> 00:08:24,479
eventually one day everything we see can
 

489
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,189
eventually one day everything we see can
be recorded and then you can

490
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:27,199
be recorded and then you can
 

491
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,110
be recorded and then you can
you can build somebody's experience and

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,590
to me offline
that you're really excited about all the

662
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:09,600
that you're really excited about all the
 

663
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,350
that you're really excited about all the
different wearables and all the

664
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:11,360
different wearables and all the
 

665
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,350
different wearables and all the
different ways we can collect

666
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:13,360
different ways we can collect
 

667
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,030
different ways we can collect
information about our bodies about uh

668
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
information about our bodies about uh
 

669
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,190
information about our bodies about uh
well the whole thing is what's most

670
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:19,200
well the whole thing is what's most
 

671
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,150
well the whole thing is what's most
exciting to you

672
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:20,160
exciting to you
 

673
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,470
exciting to you
in terms of collecting the the

674
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:22,480
in terms of collecting the the
 

675
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,069
in terms of collecting the the
biological

676
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:24,079
biological
 

677
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,670
biological
uh data about a human being

678
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:27,680
uh data about a human being
 

679
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,389
uh data about a human being
well so i'm a biologist i find animals

680
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:30,399
well so i'm a biologist i find animals
 

681
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,190
well so i'm a biologist i find animals
and humans

682
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:31,200
and humans
 

683
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,310
and humans
as machines very interesting it's one of

684
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:34,320
as machines very interesting it's one of
 

685
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,350
as machines very interesting it's one of
the reasons i didn't become

686
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:35,360
the reasons i didn't become
 

687
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,670
the reasons i didn't become
an engineer or a surgeon i wanted to

688
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
an engineer or a surgeon i wanted to
 

689
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,550
an engineer or a surgeon i wanted to
understand how we actually are built

690
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:40,560
understand how we actually are built
 

691
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,389
understand how we actually are built
and so i think a lot about machines

692
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:44,399
and so i think a lot about machines
 

693
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,030
and so i think a lot about machines
merging with humans and the first of

694
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:47,040
merging with humans and the first of
 

695
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,870
merging with humans and the first of
that are the bio wearables

696
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:48,880
that are the bio wearables
 

697
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,470
that are the bio wearables
and so i talked a lot about this i wrote

698
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:50,480
and so i talked a lot about this i wrote
 

699
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,190
and so i talked a lot about this i wrote
about it um in life span the book and

700
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:53,200
about it um in life span the book and
 

701
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,350
about it um in life span the book and
pictured a future where you would be

702
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:55,360
pictured a future where you would be
 

703
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,790
pictured a future where you would be
monitored constantly

704
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:56,800
monitored constantly
 

705
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,629
monitored constantly
so that you wouldn't suddenly have a

706
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:58,639
so that you wouldn't suddenly have a
 

707
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,150
so that you wouldn't suddenly have a
heart attack you'd know that was coming

708
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
heart attack you'd know that was coming
 

709
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:00,710
heart attack you'd know that was coming
or you

710
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:00,720
or you
 

711
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,350
or you
you wouldn't go to the doctor and they

712
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
you wouldn't go to the doctor and they
 

713
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,150
you wouldn't go to the doctor and they
don't know if it's

714
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,160
don't know if it's
 

715
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,509
don't know if it's
you need an antibiotic or not um

716
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:07,519
you need an antibiotic or not um
 

717
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,590
you need an antibiotic or not um
long term how old are you how to fix

718
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:09,600
long term how old are you how to fix
 

719
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,030
long term how old are you how to fix
things what should you eat what should

720
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:11,040
things what should you eat what should
 

721
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,150
things what should you eat what should
you take what should you

00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,160
you take what should you

do these devices i predicted would be

724
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:15,120
do these devices i predicted would be
 

725
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,990
do these devices i predicted would be
smarter

726
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,000
smarter

physician and would augment them

730
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:19,600
physician and would augment them
 

731
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,790
physician and would augment them
and then there'd be a human that would

732
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:20,800
and then there'd be a human that would
 

733
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,150
and then there'd be a human that would
just tick off to see if that it's

734
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,160
just tick off to see if that it's
 

735
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,150
just tick off to see if that it's
correct and they approve

736
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:24,160
correct and they approve

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,350
correct and they approve
i also was predicting in the book that

738
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
i also was predicting in the book that
 

739
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,269
i also was predicting in the book that
we would have video conferences with our

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:29,279
we would have video conferences with our
 

741
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,110
we would have video conferences with our
doctors and that medicines would be

742
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:31,120
doctors and that medicines would be
 

743
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,910
doctors and that medicines would be
delivered

and that we could even have pills that

752
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:38,000
and that we could even have pills that
 

753
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,310
and that we could even have pills that
were synthesized or delivered

00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:46,240
what's amazing about that is that what
 

761
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,030
what's amazing about that is that what
are we now

762
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,040
are we now
 

763
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,350
are we now
two years since the book came out even

something is pneumonia
 

957
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,590
something is pneumonia
or just a rhinovirus that can be treated

958
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
or just a rhinovirus that can be treated
 

959
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,790
or just a rhinovirus that can be treated
or not

960
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:02,800
or not
 

961
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,350
or not
right this is really going to not just

962
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:05,360
right this is really going to not just
 

963
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,710
right this is really going to not just
revolutionize medicine but i think

964
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
revolutionize medicine but i think
 

965
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,389
revolutionize medicine but i think
extend lives dramatically

966
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:08,399
extend lives dramatically
 

967
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,550
extend lives dramatically
because if i have if i'm going to have a

968
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:10,560
because if i have if i'm going to have a
 

969
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,829
because if i have if i'm going to have a
heart attack next week and that's

970
00:16:11,829 --> 00:16:11,839
heart attack next week and that's
 

971
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:12,870
heart attack next week and that's
possible

972
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:12,880
possible
 

973
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,870
possible
this device should know that and i'll be

974
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:14,880
this device should know that and i'll be
 

975
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,949
this device should know that and i'll be
in hospital before i even have it

976
00:16:16,949 --> 00:16:16,959
in hospital before i even have it
 

977
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,389
in hospital before i even have it
maybe you can talk a little bit about

978
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:18,399
maybe you can talk a little bit about
 

979
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,990
maybe you can talk a little bit about
inside tracker because i saw that

980
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,000
inside tracker because i saw that
 

981
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,949
inside tracker because i saw that
there's some really cool things in there

982
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:22,959
there's some really cool things in there
 

983
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:23,430
there's some really cool things in there
like it

984
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:23,440
like it
 

985
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,990
like it
actually so maybe you can talk about i

986
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:26,000
actually so maybe you can talk about i
 

987
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,590
actually so maybe you can talk about i
guess that you're collecting blood

988
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:27,600
guess that you're collecting blood
 

989
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,629
guess that you're collecting blood
and to give it the data so

990
00:16:30,629 --> 00:16:30,639
and to give it the data so
 

991
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,550
and to give it the data so
and it has like basic recommendations on

992
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:32,560
and it has like basic recommendations on
 

993
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,069
and it has like basic recommendations on
how to improve your life

994
00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:34,079
how to improve your life
 

995
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,150
how to improve your life
so we're not just talking about diseases

996
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,160
so we're not just talking about diseases
 

997
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,990
so we're not just talking about diseases
right like anticipating

998
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,000
right like anticipating
 

999
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,350
right like anticipating
having a particular disease but it's

1000
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:39,360
having a particular disease but it's
 

1001
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,590
having a particular disease but it's
almost like guiding your trajectory to

1002
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
almost like guiding your trajectory to
 

1003
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,470
almost like guiding your trajectory to
life how to

1004
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
life how to
 

1005
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,710
life how to
whether it's extend your your life or

1006
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:44,720
whether it's extend your your life or
 

1007
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,509
whether it's extend your your life or
just

1008
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:45,519
just
 

1009
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,350
just
live a more fulfilling like improve the

1010
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:47,360
live a more fulfilling like improve the
 

1011
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,790
live a more fulfilling like improve the
quality of life i suppose this is the

1012
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:48,800
quality of life i suppose this is the
 

1013
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,230
quality of life i suppose this is the
right way to say it

1014
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,240
right way to say it
 

1015
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,470
right way to say it
what how does inside tracker work uh

1016
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:52,480
what how does inside tracker work uh
 

1017
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,670
what how does inside tracker work uh
what the heck is it because i thought

1018
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:53,680
what the heck is it because i thought
 

1019
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,030
what the heck is it because i thought
there was also pretty cool

1020
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:55,040
there was also pretty cool
 

1021
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,189
there was also pretty cool
yeah what is it is it something other

1022
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
yeah what is it is it something other
 

1023
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,230
yeah what is it is it something other
people can use

1024
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,240
people can use
 

1025
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,990
people can use
you can definitely use it uh you can

1026
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,000
you can definitely use it uh you can
 

1027
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,829
you can definitely use it uh you can
sign up it's consumer

1028
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:01,839
sign up it's consumer
 

1029
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,430
sign up it's consumer
it's like a company consumer facebook

1030
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:03,440
it's like a company consumer facebook
 

1031
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,590
it's like a company consumer facebook
company it is yes

1032
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:05,600
company it is yes
 

1033
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,549
company it is yes
uh and i also want to democratize the

1034
00:17:08,549 --> 00:17:08,559
uh and i also want to democratize the
 

1035
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:09,429
uh and i also want to democratize the
ability to

1036
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:09,439
ability to
 

1037
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,110
ability to
to just take a mouth swab eventually we

1038
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:11,120
to just take a mouth swab eventually we
 

1039
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,470
to just take a mouth swab eventually we
don't need to have a blood test

1040
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:12,480
don't need to have a blood test
 

1041
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,429
don't need to have a blood test
necessarily

1042
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:13,439
necessarily
 

1043
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,270
necessarily
but for now it's a blood test and and

1044
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:15,280
but for now it's a blood test and and
 

1045
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,110
but for now it's a blood test and and
you'd go to a lab core request in the

1046
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,120
you'd go to a lab core request in the

it provides recommendations and this
 

1069
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,230
it provides recommendations and this
isn't just a bunch of bs it sounds like

1070
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
isn't just a bunch of bs it sounds like
 

1071
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,270
isn't just a bunch of bs it sounds like
it might be

1072
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:41,280
it might be
 

1073
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,870
it might be
to say i'll go eat this or go to that

1074
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:42,880
to say i'll go eat this or go to that
 

1075
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,549
to say i'll go eat this or go to that
restaurant and order that but it's

00:17:44,549 --> 00:17:44,559
restaurant and order that but it's
 

1077
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,310
restaurant and order that but it's
actually based on

that supplement what works

1102
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:07,520
that supplement what works
 

1103
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,270
that supplement what works
and i was a co-author on a paper that

1104
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:09,280
and i was a co-author on a paper that
 

1105
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,510
and i was a co-author on a paper that
showed that the recommendations for

showed that the recommendations for
 

1107
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,029
showed that the recommendations for
food and supplements um

1108
00:18:15,029 --> 00:18:15,039
food and supplements um
 

1109
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,789
food and supplements um
was better than the leading drug for

00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:16,799
was better than the leading drug for

type 2 diabetes
 

1113
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,630
type 2 diabetes
that's so cool the idea that you can

1114
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:20,640
that's so cool the idea that you can
 

1115
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,789
that's so cool the idea that you can
connect like skipping

1116
00:18:22,789 --> 00:18:22,799
connect like skipping
 

1117
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,190
connect like skipping
the human having to do this work you can

1118
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:25,200
the human having to do this work you can
 

1119
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,350
the human having to do this work you can
connect the scientific papers

1120
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:27,360
connect the scientific papers
 

1121
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,990
connect the scientific papers
almost like meta-analysis of the science

1122
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,000
almost like meta-analysis of the science
 

1123
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,470
almost like meta-analysis of the science
connected to the individual data

1124
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:32,480
connected to the individual data
 

1125
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,789
connected to the individual data
and then based on that sort of connect

1126
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:34,799
and then based on that sort of connect
 

1127
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:35,990
and then based on that sort of connect
your data to

1128
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
your data to
 

1129

whatever the scientific paper is
 

1133
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,190
whatever the scientific paper is
to make the suggestion of how how like

1134
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:43,200
to make the suggestion of how how like
 

1135
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,870
to make the suggestion of how how like
how that work

1136
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:44,880
how that work
 

1137
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,590
how that work
applies to your life and then that

1138
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
applies to your life and then that
 

1139
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,590
applies to your life and then that
ultimately maps to like a recommendation

1140
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
ultimately maps to like a recommendation
 

1141
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,190
ultimately maps to like a recommendation
what you should do with your life

1142
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:51,200
what you should do with your life
 

1143
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,470
what you should do with your life
like it all like this giant system

1144
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
like it all like this giant system
 

1145
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,909
like it all like this giant system
that ultimately recommends you should

1146
00:18:55,909 --> 00:18:55,919
that ultimately recommends you should
 

1147
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,390
that ultimately recommends you should
drink more coffee or less

1148
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:58,400
drink more coffee or less
 

1149
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,830
drink more coffee or less
right and and we'll have the genome in

1150
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
right and and we'll have the genome in
 

1151
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,669
right and and we'll have the genome in
there as well you can upload that yeah

1152
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:01,679
there as well you can upload that yeah
 

1153
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,150
there as well you can upload that yeah
uh and so so these programs will know us

1154
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:04,160
uh and so so these programs will know us
 

1155
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,190
uh and so so these programs will know us
way better than

1156
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:05,200
way better than
 

1157
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,510
way better than
we do and and our doctors as well the

1158
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:07,520
we do and and our doctors as well the
 

1159
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,870
we do and and our doctors as well the

annual checkup and having you know males
 

1165
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,630

get a finger up their butt and
 

1167
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,590
get a finger up their butt and
uh you know you cough that that to me is

1168
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,600
uh you know you cough that that to me is
 

1169
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,270
uh you know you cough that that to me is

doctor and just
 

1183
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,350
doctor and just
look at him and like realize you know

look at him and like realize you know
 

1185

00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,000
us what evolution
 

1311
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,590
us what evolution
not only didn't give us but took away

1312
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:37,600
not only didn't give us but took away
 

1313
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,430
not only didn't give us but took away
from us you know we're pathetic look at

1314
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
from us you know we're pathetic look at
 

1315
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,549
from us you know we're pathetic look at
our bodies

1316
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:40,559
our bodies
 

1317
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,310
our bodies
these arms if any of us even the

1318
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:42,320
these arms if any of us even the
 

1319
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,430
these arms if any of us even the
strongest person in the world went in a

1320
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:43,440
strongest person in the world went in a
 

1321
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,870
strongest person in the world went in a
cage with a chimpanzee

1322
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:44,880
cage with a chimpanzee
 

1323
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,149
cage with a chimpanzee
the chimp could knock that person's head

1324
00:21:46,149 --> 00:21:46,159
the chimp could knock that person's head
 

1325
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,310
the chimp could knock that person's head
off no question so we're pathetic so we

1326
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
off no question so we're pathetic so we
 

1327
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,750
off no question so we're pathetic so we
need to engineer ourselves to be

1328
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:49,760
need to engineer ourselves to be
 

1329
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,430
need to engineer ourselves to be
healthier and longer lived

1330

so getting to aging we we can do better

1332
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:55,200
so getting to aging we we can do better
 

1333

00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:06,400
suppressed the cause of aging which was
 

1473
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,070
suppressed the cause of aging which was
the dysregulation of information in the

1474
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:08,080
the dysregulation of information in the
 

1475
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:08,950
the dysregulation of information in the

cell
 

1477
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,669
cell
and then so fast forward to now i've

1478
00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:11,679
and then so fast forward to now i've
 

1479
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,710
and then so fast forward to now i've
been looking

1480
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:12,720
been looking
 

1481
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,269
been looking
in humans and mice because they live

1482
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:15,279
in humans and mice because they live
 

1483
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:15,990
in humans and mice because they live
shorter and

1484
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
shorter and
 

1485
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,549
shorter and
cheaper to study where the loss of

1486
00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:18,559
cheaper to study where the loss of
 

1487
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,269
cheaper to study where the loss of
information

1488
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:19,279
information
 

1489
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,470
information
in our bodies is a root cause of aging

1490
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:22,480
in our bodies is a root cause of aging
 

1491
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,590
in our bodies is a root cause of aging
and i think it is your boldness

1492
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:25,600
and i think it is your boldness
 

1493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,230
and i think it is your boldness
in viewing biology in this way is

1494
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:28,240
in viewing biology in this way is
 

1495
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,430
in viewing biology in this way is
fascinating

1496
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:29,440
fascinating
 

1497
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,990
fascinating
because that also leads to a kind of

1498
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000

 

1499
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,310

uh it's almost like allows for a theory

1500
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:38,320
uh it's almost like allows for a theory
 

1501
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,510
uh it's almost like allows for a theory
of aging like like you could boil it

1502
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:41,520
of aging like like you could boil it
 

1503
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,029
of aging like like you could boil it
down to a single equation

1504
00:24:43,029 --> 00:24:43,039
down to a single equation
 

1505
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,990
down to a single equation
and it leads to a perhaps a metric that

1506
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:46,000
and it leads to a perhaps a metric that
 

1507
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,590
and it leads to a perhaps a metric that
allows you to optimize

1508
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:47,600
allows you to optimize
 

1509
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,830
allows you to optimize
aging sort of in the fight against

1510
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:49,840
aging sort of in the fight against
 

1511
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,430
aging sort of in the fight against

um to up regulate these genes so we we
 

1587
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,190
um to up regulate these genes so we we
made a mouse that has more of this so t1

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,110
there are two types of

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,080
one we all
 

1609
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,990
one we all
read about and know about is the dna the

1610
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:28,000
read about and know about is the dna the
 

1611
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,510
read about and know about is the dna the
genome and that's

1612
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:29,520
genome and that's
 

1613
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,630
genome and that's
base four information atcg the four

1614
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
base four information atcg the four
 

1615
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,630
base four information atcg the four
chemicals that make up the various

1616
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:34,640
chemicals that make up the various
 

1617
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,390
chemicals that make up the various
sequences of the genome billions of

and that also degrades over time but

1622
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,000
and that also degrades over time but
 

1623
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,590
and that also degrades over time but
what's been fascinating

1624
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:41,600
what's been fascinating
 

1625
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,669
what's been fascinating
is that we find that that information is

1626
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:43,679
is that we find that that information is
 

1627
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,029
is that we find that that information is
pretty much intact

1628
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
pretty much intact
 

1629
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,830
pretty much intact
in old animals and people you can clone

1630
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:47,840
in old animals and people you can clone
 

1631
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,190
in old animals and people you can clone
a dog one of my friends in l.a just

1632
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:49,200
a dog one of my friends in l.a just
 

1633
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,870
a dog one of my friends in l.a just
cloned his dog three times

1634
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:50,880
cloned his dog three times
 

1635
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,549
cloned his dog three times
so this is doable right it means that

1636
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
so this is doable right it means that
 

1637
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,070
so this is doable right it means that

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,470
you can just write a new version
like right that not every new version

1800
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,480
like right that not every new version
 

1801
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,029
like right that not every new version
but go to the backup and restore it

1802
00:29:29,029 --> 00:29:29,039
but go to the backup and restore it
 

1803
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,350
but go to the backup and restore it
right that's really all we're talking

1804
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:31,360
right that's really all we're talking
 

1805
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,389
right that's really all we're talking
about it's not that hard

1806
00:29:32,389 --> 00:29:32,399
about it's not that hard
 

1807
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:34,950
about it's not that hard
once you know the trick and for people

1808
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:34,960
once you know the trick and for people
 

1809
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,789
once you know the trick and for people
that actually remember

1810
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:36,799
that actually remember
 

1811
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,830
that actually remember
uh like dvds and scratches on them how

1812
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
uh like dvds and scratches on them how
 

1813
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,190
uh like dvds and scratches on them how
frustrating it is

1814
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:41,200
frustrating it is
 

1815
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,510
frustrating it is
that that's a brilliant metaphor for

that that's a brilliant metaphor for
 

1817
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,750
that that's a brilliant metaphor for
aging

1818

and then the the reader is uh

1820
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:48,799
and then the the reader is uh
 

1821
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,350
and then the the reader is uh
is the thing that skips and then it

1822
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:51,360
is the thing that skips and then it
 

1823
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,269
is the thing that skips and then it
could destroy your experience

1824
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:53,279
could destroy your experience
 

1825
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,110
could destroy your experience
the richness of the experience that is

1826
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:55,120
the richness of the experience that is
 

1827
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,029
the richness of the experience that is
uh listening to your favorite song

1828
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:57,039
uh listening to your favorite song
 

1829
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,870
uh listening to your favorite song
right but in biology it's even worse

1830
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:58,880
right but in biology it's even worse
 

1831
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,149
right but in biology it's even worse
because you'll lose your memory your

1832
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:00,159
because you'll lose your memory your
 

1833
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,510
because you'll lose your memory your
kidneys will fail you'll

1834
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
kidneys will fail you'll
 

1835
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,590
kidneys will fail you'll
you'll get diabetes your heart will fail

1836
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:03,600
you'll get diabetes your heart will fail
 

1837
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,950
you'll get diabetes your heart will fail
and we call that aging

1838
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:04,960
and we call that aging
 

1839
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,830
and we call that aging
and age-related diseases so it's it most

1840
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:07,840
and age-related diseases so it's it most
 

1841
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,110
and age-related diseases so it's it most
people forget that

1842
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,120
people forget that
 

1843
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,510
people forget that
diseases that we get when we get old are

80 to 90
 

1847
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,549
80 to 90
caused by aging and we've been trying to

1848
00:30:14,549 --> 00:30:14,559
caused by aging and we've been trying to
 

1849
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,310
caused by aging and we've been trying to
fix things with band-aids after they

1850
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:16,320
fix things with band-aids after they
 

1851
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,029
fix things with band-aids after they
occur

1852
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:17,039
occur
 

1853
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,510
occur
without even generally talking about the

without even generally talking about the
 

1855
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,350
without even generally talking about the

1856
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
root cause of the problem
 

1857
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,470
root cause of the problem
is there um the scratches

1858
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:24,480
is there um the scratches
 

1859
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,149
is there um the scratches
do those come from

1860
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:28,159

 

1861
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,029

are those programmed or are they

1862
00:30:31,029 --> 00:30:31,039
are those programmed or are they
 

1863
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,830
are those programmed or are they
failures

1864
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:31,840
failures
 

1865
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,269
failures
meaning is it so if it's

1866
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
meaning is it so if it's
 

1867
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,269
meaning is it so if it's
by design then there's like a encoded

1868
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:39,279
by design then there's like a encoded
 

1869
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,990
by design then there's like a encoded
timeline schedule that the body's just

1870
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,000
timeline schedule that the body's just
 

1871
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,950

on purpose
 

1873
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,789
on purpose
degrading the whole thing and then

1874
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
degrading the whole thing and then
 

1875
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,990
degrading the whole thing and then
there's the just

1876
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,000
there's the just
 

1877
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,990
there's the just
the wear and tear of like the scratches

1878
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:48,000
the wear and tear of like the scratches
 

1879
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,269
the wear and tear of like the scratches
and a disc that happen

1880
00:30:49,269 --> 00:30:49,279
and a disc that happen
 

1881
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:51,430
and a disc that happen
uh through time which which one is it

1882
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:51,440
uh through time which which one is it
 

1883
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,830
uh through time which which one is it
that's the source of aging

1884
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:53,840
that's the source of aging
 

1885
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,510
that's the source of aging
uh it's more akin to wear and tear there

1886
00:30:55,510 --> 00:30:55,520
uh it's more akin to wear and tear there
 

1887
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,430
uh it's more akin to wear and tear there
isn't a program um getting back to

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:23,509
uh but so it's and i but i don't like to
think of it as wear and tear because

think of it as wear and tear because
there's

there's

1925
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,149

you when you're young

1934
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:39,440
you when you're young
 

1935
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,789
you when you're young

00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,149
can cause problems when you're older
so we've been looking what what is the

00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:44,159
so we've been looking what what is the
 

1939
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,070
so we've been looking what what is the
cause of the main causes of the noise

1940
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:46,080
cause of the main causes of the noise
 

1941
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,750
cause of the main causes of the noise
and we've come we found two of them

1942
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:47,760
and we've come we found two of them
 

1943
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,190
and we've come we found two of them
definitively

the cell has to panic because that's
 

1951
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,269
the cell has to panic because that's
either going to cause a cancer or kill

1952
00:31:57,269 --> 00:31:57,279
either going to cause a cancer or kill
 

1953
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:58,149
either going to cause a cancer or kill
the cell

the cell

00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,509
the cell
there's only two outcomes it's pretty

there's only two outcomes it's pretty
 

1957
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,990
there's only two outcomes it's pretty
much a problem uh and so what the cell

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,349
levels of normal
breakage and if we're right those mice

2120
00:34:37,349 --> 00:34:37,359
breakage and if we're right those mice
 

2121
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,190
breakage and if we're right those mice
should get old

2122
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,200
should get old
 

2123
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,510
should get old
and they do we can actually we've we've

2124
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:41,520
and they do we can actually we've we've
 

2125
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,270
and they do we can actually we've we've
created these breaks in a way that's

2126
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:43,280
created these breaks in a way that's
 

2127
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,190
created these breaks in a way that's
titratable we can it's like a rheostat

2128
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:45,200
titratable we can it's like a rheostat
 

2129
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,349
titratable we can it's like a rheostat
we can send it to 11.

2130
00:34:47,349 --> 00:34:47,359
we can send it to 11.
 

2131
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,109
we can send it to 11.
you know i drove my tesla here i'm a big

2132
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:49,119
you know i drove my tesla here i'm a big
 

2133
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,470

spinal tap two going to 11. if we go to

2136
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:52,639
spinal tap two going to 11. if we go to
 

2137
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,550
spinal tap two going to 11. if we go to
11 we can make a mouse old in a matter

2138
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:54,560
11 we can make a mouse old in a matter
 

2139
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,669
11 we can make a mouse old in a matter
of months

2140
00:34:55,669 --> 00:34:55,679
of months
 

2141
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,470
of months
we prefer to go to a level of about four

2142
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:58,480
we prefer to go to a level of about four
 

2143
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,069
we prefer to go to a level of about four
and it gets old in 10 months

2144
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:00,079
and it gets old in 10 months
 

2145
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,069
and it gets old in 10 months
but it's definitely old it's got all of

2146
00:35:02,069 --> 00:35:02,079
but it's definitely old it's got all of
 

2147
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:03,589
but it's definitely old it's got all of
the hallmarks of aging

2148
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:03,599
the hallmarks of aging
 

2149
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,310
the hallmarks of aging
it's got diseases it looks old its skin

2150
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:06,320
it's got diseases it looks old its skin
 

2151
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,910
it's got diseases it looks old its skin
is old it's got gray hair

2152
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:07,920
is old it's got gray hair
 

2153
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,829
is old it's got gray hair
but importantly we can now measure age

2154
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:09,839
but importantly we can now measure age
 

2155
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,270
but importantly we can now measure age
by looking at the scratches

2156
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:11,280
by looking at the scratches
 

2157
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,550
by looking at the scratches
we can look at the epigenome we can

2158
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:12,560
we can look at the epigenome we can
 

2159
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,550
we can look at the epigenome we can
measure it and use machine learning to

2160
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:14,560
measure it and use machine learning to
 

2161
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,670
measure it and use machine learning to
give us a number

2162
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:15,680
give us a number
 

2163
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,030
give us a number
and those mice are 50 older than normal

2164
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:19,040
and those mice are 50 older than normal
 

2165
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,550
and those mice are 50 older than normal
so you can replicate the aging process

2166
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:20,560
so you can replicate the aging process
 

2167
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,310
so you can replicate the aging process
in a controlled way you can all

2168
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:22,320
in a controlled way you can all
 

2169
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,390
in a controlled way you can all
i mean in a way that you i mean you

2170
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:24,400
i mean in a way that you i mean you
 

2171
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,270
i mean in a way that you i mean you
could accelerate it

2172
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:27,280
could accelerate it
 

2173
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,510
could accelerate it
in a controlled way and measure how much

2174
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:29,520
in a controlled way and measure how much
 

2175
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,630
in a controlled way and measure how much
exactly

2176
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:30,640
exactly
 

2177
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,670
exactly
it's aging and that gives you step one

2178
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:33,680
it's aging and that gives you step one
 

2179
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,430
it's aging and that gives you step one
of a two-step process to when you can

2180
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:35,440
of a two-step process to when you can
 

2181
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,109
of a two-step process to when you can
then figure out what how can we

2182
00:35:37,109 --> 00:35:37,119
then figure out what how can we
 

2183
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,030
then figure out what how can we
reverse this and now we're reversing

2184
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:39,040
reverse this and now we're reversing
 

2185
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,510
reverse this and now we're reversing
those mice is there a good

2186
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:41,520
those mice is there a good
 

2187
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,270
those mice is there a good
i love what you said i mean in biology

2188
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:43,280
i love what you said i mean in biology
 

2189
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,349
i love what you said i mean in biology
you really don't know

2190
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:45,359
you really don't know
 

2191
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,390
you really don't know
it's it's such a beautiful mess uh

2192
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:48,400
it's it's such a beautiful mess uh
 

2193
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,190
it's it's such a beautiful mess uh
is is there is there ideas how to do

2194
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,200
is is there is there ideas how to do
 

2195
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,470
is is there is there ideas how to do
that is that on the

2196
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:52,480
that is that on the
 

2197
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,670
that is that on the
genetic engineering level is that uh

2198
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:55,680
genetic engineering level is that uh
 

2199
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,510
genetic engineering level is that uh
like what can you mess with

2200
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:57,520
like what can you mess with
 

2201
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,310
like what can you mess with
is it going to the trying to discover

2202
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:00,320
is it going to the trying to discover
 

2203
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,150
is it going to the trying to discover
the backup copies

2204
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:02,160
the backup copies
 

2205
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,870
the backup copies
and restoring from them like what's if

2206
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:04,880
and restoring from them like what's if
 

2207
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,390
and restoring from them like what's if
it's it's possible to convert it into

2208
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:06,400
it's it's possible to convert it into
 

2209
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,150
it's it's possible to convert it into
natural language words

2210
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:08,160
natural language words
 

2211
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,829
natural language words
what are the ideas here what is the

2212
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:09,839
what are the ideas here what is the
 

2213
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,510
what are the ideas here what is the
observer and how do we contact it

2214
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:11,520
observer and how do we contact it
 

2215
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,670
observer and how do we contact it
exactly what's the observer and how do

2216
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
exactly what's the observer and how do
 

2217
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,829
exactly what's the observer and how do
you contact or if there's other ideas

2218
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:15,839
you contact or if there's other ideas
 

2219
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,349
you contact or if there's other ideas
how to reverse the the the boss getting

2220
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:19,359
how to reverse the the the boss getting
 

2221
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:20,470
how to reverse the the the boss getting
lost process

2222
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:20,480
lost process
 

2223
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,109
lost process
yeah well you you can slow it down slow

2224
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:23,119
yeah well you you can slow it down slow
 

2225
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:23,510
yeah well you you can slow it down slow
it

2226
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
it
 

2227
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,310
it
but we found a reset switch recently we

2228
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:26,320
but we found a reset switch recently we
 

2229
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,870
but we found a reset switch recently we
just published this

2230
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:28,880
just published this
 

2231
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,950
just published this
in the december 2020 issue of nature

2232
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:32,960
in the december 2020 issue of nature
 

2233
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,069
in the december 2020 issue of nature
and what we found is that there are

2234
00:36:34,069 --> 00:36:34,079
and what we found is that there are
 

2235
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,069
and what we found is that there are
three embryonic

2236
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:36,079
three embryonic
 

2237
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,870
three embryonic
genes that we could put into the adult

2238
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:38,880
genes that we could put into the adult
 

2239
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,670
genes that we could put into the adult
animal

2240

animal
 

2241
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,150
animal
to reset the age of the tissues and it

2242
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:42,160
to reset the age of the tissues and it
 

2243
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,910
to reset the age of the tissues and it
only takes four to eight weeks to work

2244
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:43,920
only takes four to eight weeks to work
 

2245
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,550
only takes four to eight weeks to work
well

2246
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:44,560
well
 

2247
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,470
well
and we can take a blind mouse that's

2248
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,480
and we can take a blind mouse that's
 

2249
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,230
and we can take a blind mouse that's
lost its vision due to aging

2250
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:48,240
lost its vision due to aging
 

2251
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,750
lost its vision due to aging
neurons aren't working well towards the

2252
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:49,760
neurons aren't working well towards the
 

2253
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,670
neurons aren't working well towards the
brain reset those neurons back to a

2254
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:51,680
brain reset those neurons back to a
 

2255
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,470
brain reset those neurons back to a
younger age

2256
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:52,480
younger age
 

2257
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,349
younger age
and now the mice can see again these

2258
00:36:55,349 --> 00:36:55,359
and now the mice can see again these
 

2259
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,150
and now the mice can see again these
three genes

2260
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
three genes
 

2261
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,990
three genes
are famous actually because they're a

2262
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:58,000
are famous actually because they're a
 

2263
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,430
are famous actually because they're a
set of four genes

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,430
generate
stem cells and this is i think well

2278
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,440
stem cells and this is i think well
 

2279
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,270
stem cells and this is i think well
known now that we can create stem cells

2280
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:15,280
known now that we can create stem cells
 

2281
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,069
known now that we can create stem cells
from adult

2282
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:16,079
from adult
 

2283
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,310
from adult
tissue but what wasn't known is can you

2284
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:18,320
tissue but what wasn't known is can you
 

2285
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,990
tissue but what wasn't known is can you
partially take age back without becoming

2286
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,000
partially take age back without becoming
 

2287
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,630
partially take age back without becoming
a tumor

2288
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:20,640
a tumor
 

2289
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,390
a tumor
or generating a stem cell in the eye

2290
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:22,400
or generating a stem cell in the eye
 

2291
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,910
or generating a stem cell in the eye
which would be a disaster

2292
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:23,920
which would be a disaster
 

2293
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,670
which would be a disaster
and the answer is yes there is a system

2294
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:25,680
and the answer is yes there is a system
 

2295
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,910
and the answer is yes there is a system
in the body that can take the age of a

2296
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:27,920
in the body that can take the age of a
 

2297
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,270
in the body that can take the age of a
cell back to a certain point but no

2298
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
cell back to a certain point but no
 

2299
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,990
cell back to a certain point but no
further

2300
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:30,000
further
 

2301
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,030
further
safely and reset the age

2302
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:33,040
safely and reset the age
 

2303
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,670
safely and reset the age
and uh we're now using that to reset the

2304
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:35,680
and uh we're now using that to reset the
 

2305
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,510
and uh we're now using that to reset the
age of the brain of those mice that we

2306
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:37,520
age of the brain of those mice that we
 

2307
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,190
age of the brain of those mice that we
age prematurely

2308
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,200
age prematurely
 

2309
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,630
age prematurely
and they're getting their ability to

2310
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:40,640
and they're getting their ability to
 

2311
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,390
and they're getting their ability to
learn back

2312
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:42,400
learn back
 

2313
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,390
learn back
this is really exciting right like

2314
00:37:44,390 --> 00:37:44,400
this is really exciting right like
 

2315
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,150
this is really exciting right like
what's uh what's the downside

2316
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:46,160
what's uh what's the downside
 

2317
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,750
what's uh what's the downside
of this well the downside is if you

2318
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:47,760
of this well the downside is if you
 

2319
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,230
of this well the downside is if you
overdo it and you don't get it right

2320
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:50,240
overdo it and you don't get it right
 

2321
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,750
overdo it and you don't get it right
uh you might cause tumors but we do

2322
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
uh you might cause tumors but we do
 

2323
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,750
uh you might cause tumors but we do
we do it very carefully and we also know

2324
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:55,760
we do it very carefully and we also know
 

2325
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,510
we do it very carefully and we also know
that in the eye it's very safe

2326
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:57,520
that in the eye it's very safe
 

2327
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,710
that in the eye it's very safe
yeah we also injected these we deliver

2328
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:00,720
yeah we also injected these we deliver
 

2329
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,390
yeah we also injected these we deliver
them by viruses so

2330
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:02,400
them by viruses so
 

2331
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,190
them by viruses so
we can control where and when they get

2332
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:05,200
we can control where and when they get
 

2333
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,790
we can control where and when they get
turned on

2334
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:06,800
turned on
 

2335
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,470
turned on
and in this paper we've published that

2336
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480
and in this paper we've published that
 

2337
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,470
and in this paper we've published that
if we put high levels in the mouse

2338
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:10,480
if we put high levels in the mouse
 

2339
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,390
if we put high levels in the mouse
into their veins throughout the body

2340
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
into their veins throughout the body
 

2341
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,710
into their veins throughout the body
they don't get cancer for over a year

2342
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:14,720
they don't get cancer for over a year
 

2343
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,270
they don't get cancer for over a year
so i'm so optimistic that we're going

2344
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
so i'm so optimistic that we're going
 

2345
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,470
so i'm so optimistic that we're going
into human studies

2346
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:18,480

actually not predicting telling you so
our daughter natalie was infected with

2438
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,040
our daughter natalie was infected with
 

2439
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,870
our daughter natalie was infected with
lyme disease a few years ago

2440
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:00,880
lyme disease a few years ago
 

2441
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,950
lyme disease a few years ago
almost went blind from it and the test

2442
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:02,960
almost went blind from it and the test
 

2443
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:05,030
almost went blind from it and the test
took four days and i thought

2444
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,040
took four days and i thought
 

2445
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,870
took four days and i thought
just give me the dna for my spinal fluid

2446
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:06,880
just give me the dna for my spinal fluid
 

2447
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,150
just give me the dna for my spinal fluid
i'll go tell you what's in it if it's

2448
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,160
i'll go tell you what's in it if it's
 

2449
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,270
i'll go tell you what's in it if it's
lyme disease or not

2450
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:09,280
lyme disease or not
 

2451
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,030
lyme disease or not
they refused and so at that point i said

2452
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:11,040
they refused and so at that point i said
 

2453
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,550
they refused and so at that point i said
this has to be done better

2454
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:12,560
this has to be done better
 

2455
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,870
this has to be done better
so i've started a company that now can

2456
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:14,880
so i've started a company that now can
 

2457
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,069
so i've started a company that now can
take a sample of any

2458
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079
take a sample of any
 

2459
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,990
take a sample of any
part of your body it's typically done

2460
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,000
part of your body it's typically done
 

2461
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,670
part of your body it's typically done
now with transplant

2462
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:19,680
now with transplant
 

2463
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,069
now with transplant
liver transplant patients to detect

2464
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:22,079
liver transplant patients to detect
 

2465

viruses
 

2467
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,190
viruses
that come out of their organs but that's

that's another area that ai is extremely
 

2471
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,030
that's another area that ai is extremely
important for

you know deep learning you've got a

2478
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:34,960
you know deep learning you've got a
 

2479
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,230
you know deep learning you've got a
problem because the amount of data that

problem because the amount of data that
 

2481
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,309

2495
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,309
bioinformaticians a lot of our work is
now just number crunching

2496
00:40:52,309 --> 00:40:52,319
now just number crunching
 

2497
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:55,030
now just number crunching
a part of that is collecting the data

2498
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:55,040
a part of that is collecting the data

something we've talked a little bit
 

2503
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,069
something we've talked a little bit
about but is there something you can say

about but is there something you can say
 

2505
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,630
about but is there something you can say
about how we can like can collect more

00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:02,640
about how we can like can collect more
 

2507
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,470
about how we can like can collect more
and more data

that ultimately ends up helping us
understand the human body and then

00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,160
understand the human body and then
 

2567
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,950
understand the human body and then
treat problems with the human body so we

2568
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:06,960
treat problems with the human body so we
 

2569
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,150
treat problems with the human body so we
are right in the middle

so that's now the way consumer health is
 

2723
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,750
so that's now the way consumer health is
going is that you can get better data

2724
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:31,760
going is that you can get better data
 

2725
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,349
going is that you can get better data
than your doctor can and but they like

2726
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:33,359
than your doctor can and but they like
 

2727

00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,470
you to do that
quick human question maybe you can

quick human question maybe you can
 

2731
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,230
quick human question maybe you can
educate me

2732
00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:38,240

and if i have data with me then i have
like

2758
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:00,160
like
 

2759
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,829
like
several orders of magnitude more

2760
00:45:01,829 --> 00:45:01,839
several orders of magnitude more
 

2761
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:04,470
several orders of magnitude more
knowledge and i think there's an aspect

2762
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:04,480
knowledge and i think there's an aspect
 

2763
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,790
knowledge and i think there's an aspect
to where the doctor has to

2764
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:06,800
to where the doctor has to
 

2765
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,710
to where the doctor has to
put their expert hat like

2766
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:10,720
put their expert hat like
 

2767
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,109

open-minded person and study
and look at that data do you think it's

2772
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:16,960
and look at that data do you think it's
 

2773
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,309
and look at that data do you think it's
possible to sort of

2774
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
possible to sort of
 

2775
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,870
possible to sort of

to where the doctors are almost
 

2779
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,510
to where the doctors are almost
as you said are excited to see the data

prevent heart attacks how many billions
 

2875
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,790
prevent heart attacks how many billions
if not trillions of dollars

2876

if not trillions of dollars
 

2877
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,309
if not trillions of dollars
will that save over the next decade

2878
00:46:58,309 --> 00:46:58,319
will that save over the next decade
 

2879
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,150
will that save over the next decade
yeah so when the public wakes up to this

2880

yeah so when the public wakes up to this
 

2881
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,349
yeah so when the public wakes up to this
they'll almost demand it

2882
00:47:01,349 --> 00:47:01,359
they'll almost demand it
 

2883
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,030
they'll almost demand it
like this this should be this should be

2884
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:03,040
like this this should be this should be
 

2885

and then maybe policy creates rules to
 

2925
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,069
and then maybe policy creates rules to
where

2926
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
where
 

2927
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,829
where

00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:32,079
protein and fat and it turns out that
 

3517
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:33,349
protein and fat and it turns out that
the only ones that lived longer were the

ones that only ate
 

3521
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,349
ones that only ate
once a day and so that if we're we're

3522
00:57:37,349 --> 00:57:37,359
once a day and so that if we're we're
 

3523
00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:39,109
once a day and so that if we're we're
not mice but i think that we're close

not mice but i think that we're close

that this tells us a lot but okay but i

that this tells us a lot but okay but i
 

3529
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,190
that this tells us a lot but okay but i
still think the best bang for the

00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:45,200
still think the best bang for the
 

3531
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,549
still think the best bang for the
longevity buck is to do both well eat

3532
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:48,559
longevity buck is to do both well eat
 

3533
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:51,670
longevity buck is to do both well eat
less often and eat the right things now

00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:09,760
i'll get to your question a second but
 

3557
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,990
i'll get to your question a second but
my microbiome right now and stomach is

3558
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:12,000
my microbiome right now and stomach is
 

3559
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,390
my microbiome right now and stomach is
at a point where if i try to overeat

3560
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:14,400
at a point where if i try to overeat
 

3561
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:16,630
at a point where if i try to overeat
on a steak which i did a couple of days

3562
00:58:16,630 --> 00:58:16,640
on a steak which i did a couple of days
 

3563
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,950
on a steak which i did a couple of days
ago i actually had a chicken

3564
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:18,960
ago i actually had a chicken
 

3565
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,150
ago i actually had a chicken
uh a fried chicken specifically

3566
00:58:22,150 --> 00:58:22,160
uh a fried chicken specifically
 

3567
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:24,150
uh a fried chicken specifically
for two days i felt terrible i couldn't

3568
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
for two days i felt terrible i couldn't
 

3569
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:25,910
for two days i felt terrible i couldn't
sleep it wouldn't go down

3570
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:25,920
sleep it wouldn't go down
 

3571
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,510
sleep it wouldn't go down
so i'm now at a point where even if i

3572
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:27,520
so i'm now at a point where even if i
 

3573
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:30,069
so i'm now at a point where even if i
want to binge on meat and fried foods i

3574
00:58:30,069 --> 00:58:30,079
want to binge on meat and fried foods i
 

3575
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,630
want to binge on meat and fried foods i
just can't it just feels bad

3576
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:32,640
just can't it just feels bad
 

3577
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,470
just can't it just feels bad
but what what do i recommend well what

3578
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:34,480
but what what do i recommend well what
 

3579
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,670

the data says

3580
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:35,680
the data says
 

3581
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:38,470
the data says
which i try to follow is that

3582
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:38,480
which i try to follow is that
 

3583
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,589
which i try to follow is that
plant-based foods will

3584
00:58:39,589 --> 00:58:39,599
plant-based foods will
 

3585
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,349
plant-based foods will
will be better than meat-based foods and

3586
00:58:41,349 --> 00:58:41,359
will be better than meat-based foods and
 

3587
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:42,470
will be better than meat-based foods and
i know that there are a lot of people

3588
00:58:42,470 --> 00:58:42,480
i know that there are a lot of people
 

3589
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,750
i know that there are a lot of people

3591
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:45,829

but one of the facts is there's a few
 

3593
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:47,270
but one of the facts is there's a few
facts one is that people who live a long

3594
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:47,280
facts one is that people who live a long
 

3595
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,710
facts one is that people who live a long
time tend to eat those type of diets

fact is that in
 

3607
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,589
fact is that in
animals we know that there's a there's a

3608
00:58:59,589 --> 00:58:59,599
animals we know that there's a there's a
 

3609
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:00,789
animals we know that there's a there's a
mechanism that's called

mtor little m capital tr that responds
 

3613
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,309
mtor little m capital tr that responds
to

3614
00:59:04,309 --> 00:59:04,319
to
 

3615
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,069
to
certain amino acids that are found in

3616
00:59:06,069 --> 00:59:06,079
certain amino acids that are found in
 

3617
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,430
certain amino acids that are found in
more abundance in meat

3618
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:07,440
more abundance in meat
 

3619
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,870
more abundance in meat
and when it responds it actually

3620
00:59:08,870 --> 00:59:08,880
and when it responds it actually
 

3621
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,870
and when it responds it actually
shortens lifespan and the converse if

3622
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:10,880
shortens lifespan and the converse if
 

3623
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,309
shortens lifespan and the converse if
you starve it of those

3624
00:59:12,309 --> 00:59:12,319
you starve it of those
 

3625
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:15,670
you starve it of those
three amino acids uh in mostly in meat

3626
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:15,680
three amino acids uh in mostly in meat
 

3627
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,750
three amino acids uh in mostly in meat
then it extends lifespan and there

3628
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:17,760
then it extends lifespan and there
 

3629
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,349
then it extends lifespan and there
there's a drug called rapamycin

3630
00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:19,359
there's a drug called rapamycin
 

3631
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:21,270
there's a drug called rapamycin
which some people are experimenting with

3632
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:21,280
which some people are experimenting with
 

3633
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,630
which some people are experimenting with
that does that

3634
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:22,640
that does that
 

3635
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,230
that does that
so you might be able to you know i'm

3636
00:59:24,230 --> 00:59:24,240
so you might be able to you know i'm
 

3637
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,910
so you might be able to you know i'm
just saying this here from

3638
00:59:25,910 --> 00:59:25,920
just saying this here from
 

3639
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,430
just saying this here from
my colleagues we don't know the results

3640
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:27,440
my colleagues we don't know the results
 

3641
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,870
my colleagues we don't know the results
here but you could potentially take a

3642
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:28,880
here but you could potentially take a
 

3643
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,549
here but you could potentially take a
rapamycin-like drug

3644
00:59:30,549 --> 00:59:30,559
rapamycin-like drug
 

3645
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:32,870
rapamycin-like drug
and counteract the effects of meat on in

3646
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:32,880
and counteract the effects of meat on in
 

3647
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,150
and counteract the effects of meat on in
the long run

3648
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:34,160
the long run
 

3649
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,670
the long run
don't know we should try that actually

3650
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:35,680
don't know we should try that actually
 

3651
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,270
don't know we should try that actually
we could do that in the lab

3652
00:59:37,270 --> 00:59:37,280
we could do that in the lab
 

3653
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,270
we could do that in the lab
but uh getting to the bottom of this

3654
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:39,280
but uh getting to the bottom of this
 

3655
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,109
but uh getting to the bottom of this
what i think is going on is that

3656
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:41,119
what i think is going on is that
 

3657
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,470
what i think is going on is that
just like testosterone and growth

3658
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:42,480
just like testosterone and growth
 

3659
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,190
just like testosterone and growth
hormone you will get temporary

3660
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:45,200
hormone you will get temporary
 

3661
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,589
hormone you will get temporary
maybe not temporary um immediate health

3662
00:59:47,589 --> 00:59:47,599
maybe not temporary um immediate health
 

3663
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:48,470
maybe not temporary um immediate health
benefits

3664
00:59:48,470 --> 00:59:48,480
benefits
 

3665
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,470
benefits
you'll feel great you'll get more muscle

3666
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:50,480
you'll feel great you'll get more muscle
 

3667
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,990
you'll feel great you'll get more muscle
energy

3668
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:52,000
energy
 

3669
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,750
energy
but the problem is i think it's at the

3670
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
but the problem is i think it's at the
 

3671
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,349
but the problem is i think it's at the
expense of long-term health and

3672
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:55,359
expense of long-term health and
 

3673
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:57,190
expense of long-term health and
longevity

3674
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:57,200
longevity
 

3675
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:59,829
longevity
well this is actually something i worry

3676
00:59:59,829 --> 00:59:59,839
well this is actually something i worry
 

3677
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:00,309
well this is actually something i worry
about

3678
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:00,319
about
 

3679
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:04,150
about
in terms of long-term effects or

3680
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:04,160
in terms of long-term effects or
 

3681
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,990
in terms of long-term effects or
the the cost in terms of longevity it's

3682
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:06,000
the the cost in terms of longevity it's
 

3683
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,190
the the cost in terms of longevity it's
very difficult to know

3684
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:07,200
very difficult to know
 

3685
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,829
very difficult to know
how your choices affect your longevity

3686
01:00:09,829 --> 01:00:09,839
how your choices affect your longevity
 

3687
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:10,549
how your choices affect your longevity
because

3688
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:10,559
because
 

3689
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,470
because
the impact is down the line like

3690
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:14,480
the impact is down the line like
 

3691
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:15,990
the impact is down the line like
just because something makes me feel

3692
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:16,000
just because something makes me feel
 

3693
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,589
just because something makes me feel
good now

3694
01:00:17,589 --> 01:00:17,599
good now
 

3695
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:19,589
good now
like eating only meat makes me feel good

3696
01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:19,599
like eating only meat makes me feel good
 

3697
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:21,829
like eating only meat makes me feel good
now i wonder what are the costs down the

3698
01:00:21,829 --> 01:00:21,839
now i wonder what are the costs down the
 

3699
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:22,230
now i wonder what are the costs down the
line

3700
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:22,240
line
 

3701
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,750
line
well think about what i i was saying

3702
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:23,760
well think about what i i was saying
 

3703
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:26,150
well think about what i i was saying
about the trade-offs between

3704
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:26,160
about the trade-offs between
 

3705
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,589
about the trade-offs between
growth and reproduction which is what a

3706

growth and reproduction which is what a
 

3707
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,750
growth and reproduction which is what a
mouse does and a whale that

3708
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:29,760
mouse does and a whale that
 

3709

mouse does and a whale that
grows slowly reproduces slowly lives a

it's called the disposable soma theory

it's called the disposable soma theory
 

3715
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,549
it's called the disposable soma theory
um kirk would just

3716
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:36,559

screaming so you want the
 

3887
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,750
screaming so you want the
that he's basically uh the the

3888
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:31,760
that he's basically uh the the
 

3889
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,270
that he's basically uh the the
the xeno-harmonic version of a human

3890
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:35,280
the xeno-harmonic version of a human
 

3891
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,829
the xeno-harmonic version of a human
um i like it so these are the molecules

3892
01:03:37,829 --> 01:03:37,839
um i like it so these are the molecules
 

3893
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:39,190
um i like it so these are the molecules
that are representative of

3894
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:39,200
that are representative of
 

3895
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:42,390
that are representative of
the stress that's been um

3896
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:42,400
the stress that's been um
 

3897
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,789
the stress that's been um
that a plant has been under yeah the

3898
01:03:44,789 --> 01:03:44,799
that a plant has been under yeah the
 

3899
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:46,710
that a plant has been under yeah the
best example of that is resveratrol

3900
01:03:46,710 --> 01:03:46,720
best example of that is resveratrol
 

3901
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,150
best example of that is resveratrol

vines produce that in abundance when

3906
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:52,880
vines produce that in abundance when

they're
 

3909
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:55,910
they're
dried out or they have too much light or

fungus
 

3913
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,309
fungus
and that we've shown activates the so2

3914
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:00,319
and that we've shown activates the so2
 

3915
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,230

01:04:02,230 --> 01:04:02,240
enzyme in our bodies which remember is
 

3917
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,069
enzyme in our bodies which remember is
what extends lifespan in yeast and

3918
01:04:04,069 --> 01:04:04,079
what extends lifespan in yeast and
 

3919
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,069
what extends lifespan in yeast and
slows down aging in the brain that's

that um i rarely would
 

3935
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:24,390
that um i rarely would
add sugar to anything occasionally i

3936
01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:24,400
add sugar to anything occasionally i
 

3937
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,230
add sugar to anything occasionally i
would um

3938
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:26,240
would um
 

3939
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,150
would um
eat a slice of cheesecake but that would

3940
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:28,160
eat a slice of cheesecake but that would
 

3941
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,109
eat a slice of cheesecake but that would
be you know maybe once or twice a year

3942
01:04:31,109 --> 01:04:31,119
be you know maybe once or twice a year
 

3943
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,109
be you know maybe once or twice a year
you have to give in occasionally but

3944
01:04:33,109 --> 01:04:33,119
you have to give in occasionally but
 

3945

yeah anything that's sweet i would
rather substitute something like stevia

3948
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:37,440
rather substitute something like stevia
 

3949
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,789
rather substitute something like stevia
if i need a sugar hit

3950
01:04:40,789 --> 01:04:40,799
if i need a sugar hit
 

3951
01:04:40,799 --> 01:04:45,270
if i need a sugar hit
what about exercise your favorite topic

3952
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
what about exercise your favorite topic
 

3953
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,029
what about exercise your favorite topic
is there uh is there anybody talking

3954
01:04:47,029 --> 01:04:47,039
is there uh is there anybody talking
 

3955
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,510
is there uh is there anybody talking
about it yeah okay great is there

3956
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:49,520
about it yeah okay great is there
 

3957
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,910
about it yeah okay great is there
benefits to longevity

3958
01:04:51,910 --> 01:04:51,920
benefits to longevity
 

3959
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,470
benefits to longevity
from exercise well no doubt that's

3960
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
from exercise well no doubt that's
 

3961
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:55,510
from exercise well no doubt that's
that's proven

3962
01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,520
that's proven
 

3963
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:57,430
that's proven
um just like fasting it's pretty clear

3964
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:57,440
um just like fasting it's pretty clear
 

3965
01:04:57,440 --> 01:04:58,710
um just like fasting it's pretty clear
that that works

3966
01:04:58,710 --> 01:04:58,720
that that works
 

3967
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,630
that that works
uh for example there are studies of

3968
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:00,640
uh for example there are studies of
 

3969
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:01,750
uh for example there are studies of
cyclists

3970
01:05:01,750 --> 01:05:01,760
cyclists
 

3971
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:04,150
cyclists
it was something like people that cycle

3972
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:04,160
it was something like people that cycle
 

3973
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,069
it was something like people that cycle
over 80 miles a week

3974
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:06,079
over 80 miles a week
 

3975
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:08,230
over 80 miles a week
have a 40 reduction in a variety of

3976
01:05:08,230 --> 01:05:08,240
have a 40 reduction in a variety of
 

3977
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,230
have a 40 reduction in a variety of
diseases certainly heart disease

3978
01:05:10,230 --> 01:05:10,240
diseases certainly heart disease
 

3979
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:11,670
diseases certainly heart disease
so that that's not even a question but

3980
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:11,680
so that that's not even a question but
 

3981
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,109
so that that's not even a question but
what's interesting is that we're

3982
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:13,119
what's interesting is that we're
 

3983
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:13,829
what's interesting is that we're
learning that

3984
01:05:13,829 --> 01:05:13,839
learning that
 

3985
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:15,190
learning that
you don't need much to have a big

3986
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:15,200
you don't need much to have a big
 

3987
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,510
you don't need much to have a big
benefit it's an asymptotic curve

3988
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:17,520
benefit it's an asymptotic curve
 

3989
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:19,270
benefit it's an asymptotic curve
and in fact if you overdo it you

3990
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
and in fact if you overdo it you
 

3991
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,549
and in fact if you overdo it you
probably have reduced benefits

3992
01:05:20,549 --> 01:05:20,559
probably have reduced benefits
 

3993
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:21,750
probably have reduced benefits
particularly if you start to wear out

3994
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:21,760
particularly if you start to wear out
 

3995
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,349
particularly if you start to wear out
joints that kind of thing

3996
01:05:23,349 --> 01:05:23,359
joints that kind of thing
 

3997
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:25,109
joints that kind of thing
but just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few

3998
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:25,119
but just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few
 

3999
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:26,549
but just 10 minutes on a treadmill a few
times a week getting your lose your

4000
01:05:26,549 --> 01:05:26,559
times a week getting your lose your
 

4001
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,549
times a week getting your lose your
breath get hypoxia because it's cold

4002
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
breath get hypoxia because it's cold
 

4003
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,190
breath get hypoxia because it's cold
seems to be very beneficial for

4004
01:05:31,190 --> 01:05:31,200
seems to be very beneficial for
 

4005
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,549
seems to be very beneficial for
long-term health

4006
01:05:32,549 --> 01:05:32,559
long-term health
 

4007
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:34,630
long-term health
um and that's the kind of exercise that

4008
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:34,640
um and that's the kind of exercise that
 

4009
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,309
um and that's the kind of exercise that
i like to do aerobic

4010
01:05:36,309 --> 01:05:36,319
i like to do aerobic
 

4011
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:39,190
i like to do aerobic
though i do enjoy uh lifting weights so

4012
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:39,200
though i do enjoy uh lifting weights so
 

4013
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:40,950
though i do enjoy uh lifting weights so
that is what i call my exercise which

4014
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:40,960
that is what i call my exercise which
 

4015
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,950
that is what i call my exercise which
has other benefits including

4016
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:42,960
has other benefits including
 

4017
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:45,430
has other benefits including
maintaining hormone levels male hormone

01:05:45,430 --> 01:05:45,440
maintaining hormone levels male hormone
 

4019
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,069

levels
 

4021
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:49,510
levels
but also really why i do it is i want to

4022
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:49,520
but also really why i do it is i want to
 

4023
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:50,630
but also really why i do it is i want to
be able to

4024
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:50,640
be able to
 

4025
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,150
be able to
counteract the effects of sitting for

4026
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:52,160
counteract the effects of sitting for
 

4027
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:53,670
counteract the effects of sitting for
most of the day yeah and

4028
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:53,680
most of the day yeah and
 

4029
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:55,670
most of the day yeah and
as you get older you lose muscle mass

4030
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:55,680
as you get older you lose muscle mass
 

4031
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:57,510
as you get older you lose muscle mass
it's a percent or so a year

4032
01:05:57,510 --> 01:05:57,520
it's a percent or so a year
 

4033

01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:55,119
started listening brown noise when i
 

4091
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:56,069
started listening brown noise when i
work

4092
01:06:56,069 --> 01:06:56,079

to like in a way that it felt like
 

4101
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,750
to like in a way that it felt like
really weird

01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:07,760
really weird
 

4103
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,190
really weird

mind is trying to focus
 

4113
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:21,829
mind is trying to focus
and then it just enabled that process of

4114
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:21,839
and then it just enabled that process of
 

4115
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:22,870
and then it just enabled that process of
trying to focus

4116
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:22,880
trying to focus
 

4117
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:24,870
trying to focus
on a particular problem i don't know if

4118
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:24,880
on a particular problem i don't know if
 

4119
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,470
on a particular problem i don't know if
this is generalizable to others people

4120
01:07:26,470 --> 01:07:26,480
this is generalizable to others people
 

4121
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:27,510
this is generalizable to others people
should definitely try it if you're

4122
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
should definitely try it if you're
 

4123
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:27,990
should definitely try it if you're
listening to

4124
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:28,000
listening to
 

4125
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:31,190
listening to
this maybe it's just my own mind but

4126
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:31,200
this maybe it's just my own mind but
 

4127
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:34,950
this maybe it's just my own mind but
it's funny like it made me brown noise

4128
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:34,960
it's funny like it made me brown noise
 

4129
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:36,789
it's funny like it made me brown noise
made me realize that there's probably

4130
01:07:36,789 --> 01:07:36,799
made me realize that there's probably
 

4131
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:38,710
made me realize that there's probably
hacks out there

4132
01:07:38,710 --> 01:07:38,720
hacks out there
 

4133
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:40,789
hacks out there
that work for me that i should be

4134
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:40,799
that work for me that i should be
 

4135
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,390
that work for me that i should be
constantly looking for it's almost like

4136
01:07:42,390 --> 01:07:42,400
constantly looking for it's almost like
 

4137
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:43,430
constantly looking for it's almost like
um

4138
01:07:43,430 --> 01:07:43,440
um
 

4139
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,549
um
an encouraging and motivating

4140
01:07:46,549 --> 01:07:46,559
an encouraging and motivating
 

4141
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,430
an encouraging and motivating
of event that maybe there's other stuff

4142
01:07:49,430 --> 01:07:49,440
of event that maybe there's other stuff
 

4143
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:50,950
of event that maybe there's other stuff
out there maybe there's other

4144
01:07:50,950 --> 01:07:50,960
out there maybe there's other
 

4145
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,109
out there maybe there's other
brown noise like things out there that

4146
01:07:53,109 --> 01:07:53,119
brown noise like things out there that
 

4147
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:55,190
brown noise like things out there that
truly like almost immediately make me

4148
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:55,200
truly like almost immediately make me
 

4149
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:55,990
truly like almost immediately make me
feel better

4150
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:56,000
feel better
 

4151
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,430
feel better
i don't know if it's generalizable to

4152
01:07:57,430 --> 01:07:57,440
i don't know if it's generalizable to
 

4153
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,750
i don't know if it's generalizable to
others but it does seem that

4154
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
others but it does seem that
 

4155
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,549
others but it does seem that
it's the case that there's probably for

4156
01:08:02,549 --> 01:08:02,559
it's the case that there's probably for
 

4157
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:03,670
it's the case that there's probably for
many others things

4158
01:08:03,670 --> 01:08:03,680
many others things
 

4159
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,910
many others things
like that that could be discovered and

4160
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:05,920
like that that could be discovered and
 

4161
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:06,950
like that that could be discovered and
so

4162
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:06,960
so
 

4163
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,029
so
it's always disappointing when i find

4164
01:08:09,029 --> 01:08:09,039
it's always disappointing when i find
 

4165
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,309
it's always disappointing when i find
things in life

4166
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:10,319
things in life
 

4167
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:13,109
things in life
that i wish i had found earlier like i

4168
01:08:13,109 --> 01:08:13,119
that i wish i had found earlier like i
 

4169
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:14,069
that i wish i had found earlier like i
got lasik

4170
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,079
got lasik
 

4171
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,269
got lasik
eye surgery a few years ago

4172
01:08:17,269 --> 01:08:17,279
eye surgery a few years ago
 

4173
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,870
eye surgery a few years ago
and the first thought i had like the

4174
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:18,880
and the first thought i had like the
 

4175
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:21,269
and the first thought i had like the
next day when i woke up is like

4176
01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:21,279
next day when i woke up is like
 

4177
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,070
next day when i woke up is like
damn it why didn't i do this way earlier

4178
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:24,080
damn it why didn't i do this way earlier
 

4179
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,149
damn it why didn't i do this way earlier
there's other stuff

4180
01:08:26,149 --> 01:08:26,159
there's other stuff
 

4181
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:29,030
there's other stuff
of that nature that um they're yet to be

4182
01:08:29,030 --> 01:08:29,040
of that nature that um they're yet to be
 

4183
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,590
of that nature that um they're yet to be
discovered so it pays to explore

4184
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:31,600
discovered so it pays to explore
 

4185
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,870
discovered so it pays to explore
yeah though you have a different mind

4186
01:08:32,870 --> 01:08:32,880
yeah though you have a different mind
 

4187
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:34,789
yeah though you have a different mind
you have quite a beautiful mind so i

4188
01:08:34,789 --> 01:08:34,799
you have quite a beautiful mind so i
 

4189
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:36,630
you have quite a beautiful mind so i
suspect brown noise helps you

4190
01:08:36,630 --> 01:08:36,640
suspect brown noise helps you
 

4191
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,149
suspect brown noise helps you
focus and because you're probably all

4192
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:38,159
focus and because you're probably all
 

4193
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:40,149
focus and because you're probably all
over the place if you don't control it

4194
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,159
over the place if you don't control it
 

4195
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:41,990
over the place if you don't control it
yeah exactly i mean it's something about

4196
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:42,000
yeah exactly i mean it's something about
 

4197
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,309
yeah exactly i mean it's something about
it it's a programmer thing i don't

4198
01:08:44,309 --> 01:08:44,319
it it's a programmer thing i don't
 

4199
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:47,510
it it's a programmer thing i don't
the programming is a really difficult

4200
01:08:47,510 --> 01:08:47,520
the programming is a really difficult
 

4201
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,550
the programming is a really difficult
um mental journey because you have to

4202
01:08:50,550 --> 01:08:50,560
um mental journey because you have to
 

4203
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,870
um mental journey because you have to
keep a lot of things in mind

4204
01:08:52,870 --> 01:08:52,880
keep a lot of things in mind
 

4205
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,110
keep a lot of things in mind
you have to uh so you're constantly

4206
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:55,120
you have to uh so you're constantly
 

4207
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:56,390
you have to uh so you're constantly
designing things

4208
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:56,400
designing things
 

4209
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,630
designing things
and you have to be extremely precise by

4210
01:08:58,630 --> 01:08:58,640
and you have to be extremely precise by
 

4211
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,030
and you have to be extremely precise by
making those things concrete in code

4212
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:01,040
making those things concrete in code
 

4213
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:04,829
making those things concrete in code
you also have to look stuff up on the

4214
01:09:04,829 --> 01:09:04,839
you also have to look stuff up on the
 

4215
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,149
you also have to look stuff up on the
internet

4216
01:09:06,149 --> 01:09:06,159
internet
 

4217
01:09:06,159 --> 01:09:08,870
internet
to sort of feed like information and

4218
01:09:08,870 --> 01:09:08,880
to sort of feed like information and
 

4219
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:10,390
to sort of feed like information and
looking up stuff on the internet

4220
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:10,400
looking up stuff on the internet
 

4221
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:12,070
looking up stuff on the internet
internet is full of like distracting

4222
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:12,080
internet is full of like distracting
 

4223
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,749
internet is full of like distracting
things so you have to be really focused

4224
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:13,759
things so you have to be really focused
 

4225
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:14,870
things so you have to be really focused
in the way you look stuff

4226
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:14,880
in the way you look stuff
 

4227
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:17,430
in the way you look stuff
up in pulling that information in so it

4228
01:09:17,430 --> 01:09:17,440
up in pulling that information in so it
 

4229
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:19,269
up in pulling that information in so it
requires a certain discipline and a

4230
01:09:19,269 --> 01:09:19,279
requires a certain discipline and a
 

4231
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:20,070
requires a certain discipline and a
certain focus

4232
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:20,080
certain focus
 

4233
01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:23,349
certain focus
that uh i've been very much exploring

4234
01:09:23,349 --> 01:09:23,359
that uh i've been very much exploring
 

4235
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:24,309
that uh i've been very much exploring
how to do like

4236
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:24,319
how to do like
 

4237
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:26,309
how to do like
i do it really well in the morning

01:09:27,910 --> 01:09:27,920
coffee is involved all those kinds of
 

4241
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,070
coffee is involved all those kinds of
things you're trying to optimize

things you're trying to optimize
 

4243
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,789
things you're trying to optimize
uh keeping very positive inspired no

social media all those kinds of things
 

4247

and trying to optimize for and everybody
 

4249
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:37,829

writers

4256
01:09:41,910 --> 01:09:41,920
writers
 

4257
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,229
writers
when you read about the habits of

4260
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:45,759
writers
 

4261
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:47,749
writers
like the habits they do in the morning

4262
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:47,759
like the habits they do in the morning
 

4263
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:49,269
like the habits they do in the morning
they usually write like two three four

4264
01:09:49,269 --> 01:09:49,279
they usually write like two three four
 

4265
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:50,870
they usually write like two three four
hours a day and that's it

4266
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
hours a day and that's it
 

4267
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:53,510
hours a day and that's it
it's like they optimize that ritual and

4268
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:53,520
it's like they optimize that ritual and
 

4269
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:55,430
it's like they optimize that ritual and
then there's always hunters thompson

4270
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:55,440
then there's always hunters thompson
 

4271
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:59,110
then there's always hunters thompson
so uh

4272
01:09:59,110 --> 01:09:59,120
so uh
 

4273
01:09:59,120 --> 01:10:01,430
so uh
sometimes it pays off to be wild what

4274
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:01,440
sometimes it pays off to be wild what
 

4275
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,229
sometimes it pays off to be wild what
about

4276
01:10:02,229 --> 01:10:02,239
about
 

4277
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,510
about
the sleep how important is sleep for

4278
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:05,520
the sleep how important is sleep for
 

4279
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,709
the sleep how important is sleep for
longevity

4280
01:10:06,709 --> 01:10:06,719
longevity
 

4281
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,790
longevity
i would guess based on the evidence that

4282
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:10,800
i would guess based on the evidence that
 

4283
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:12,149
i would guess based on the evidence that
it's really important

4284
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:12,159
it's really important
 

4285
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:15,110
it's really important
and because we don't know for sure but

4286
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:15,120
and because we don't know for sure but
 

4287
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,870
and because we don't know for sure but
what we know from animal studies

4288
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:16,880
what we know from animal studies
 

4289
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:18,550
what we know from animal studies
is the following if you restrict sleep

4290
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:18,560
is the following if you restrict sleep
 

4291
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:20,390
is the following if you restrict sleep
from a rat for just two weeks it'll

4292
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
from a rat for just two weeks it'll
 

4293
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,110
from a rat for just two weeks it'll
develop

4294
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
develop
 

4295
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,310
develop
type 2 diabetes it's that important

4296
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:24,320
type 2 diabetes it's that important
 

4297
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,229
type 2 diabetes it's that important
so that's the main thing what we also

4298
01:10:26,229 --> 01:10:26,239
so that's the main thing what we also
 

4299
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,470
so that's the main thing what we also
know is at the molecular level

4300
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:28,480
know is at the molecular level
 

4301
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:31,750
know is at the molecular level
that if you disrupt your

4302
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
that if you disrupt your
 

4303
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:33,830
that if you disrupt your
sleep wake cycle so we actually have

4304
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:33,840
sleep wake cycle so we actually have
 

4305
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:35,110
sleep wake cycle so we actually have
proteins that go up and down that

4306
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:35,120
proteins that go up and down that
 

4307
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,630
proteins that go up and down that
control our sleep wake

4308
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
control our sleep wake
 

4309
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:39,189
control our sleep wake
all of us most of our cells do that if

4310
01:10:39,189 --> 01:10:39,199
all of us most of our cells do that if
 

4311
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,110
all of us most of our cells do that if
you disrupt that you'll get premature

4312
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
you disrupt that you'll get premature
 

4313
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,430
you disrupt that you'll get premature
aging and guess what the opposite is

4314
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
aging and guess what the opposite is
 

4315
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,270
aging and guess what the opposite is
true that as you get older

4316
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:45,280
true that as you get older
 

4317
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:48,470
true that as you get older
that cycle the the amplitude becomes

4318
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:48,480
that cycle the the amplitude becomes
 

4319
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,350
that cycle the the amplitude becomes
diminished

4320
01:10:49,350 --> 01:10:49,360
diminished
 

4321
01:10:49,360 --> 01:10:50,950
diminished
and this is why it's harder to get to

4322
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
and this is why it's harder to get to
 

4323
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:52,550
and this is why it's harder to get to
sleep as you get older and then

4324
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:52,560
sleep as you get older and then
 

4325
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,790
sleep as you get older and then
you've got all sorts of problems and i

4326
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:54,800
you've got all sorts of problems and i
 

4327
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:56,149
you've got all sorts of problems and i
think what's going on is this positive

4328
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:56,159
think what's going on is this positive
 

4329
01:10:56,159 --> 01:10:57,590
think what's going on is this positive
feedback loop which

4330
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:57,600
feedback loop which
 

4331
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,590
feedback loop which
is is a disaster in your old age which

4332
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,600
is is a disaster in your old age which
 

4333
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,270
is is a disaster in your old age which
is um

4334
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:01,280
is um
 

4335
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:03,270
is um
right you're aging you can't at this

4336
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:03,280
right you're aging you can't at this
 

4337
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,390
right you're aging you can't at this
moment

4338
01:11:04,390 --> 01:11:04,400
moment
 

4339
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:05,990
moment
totally prevent that and then it's

4340
01:11:05,990 --> 01:11:06,000
totally prevent that and then it's
 

4341
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,430
totally prevent that and then it's
disrupting your sleep then you get not

4342
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
disrupting your sleep then you get not
 

4343
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,470
disrupting your sleep then you get not
enough sleep and then that's going to

4344
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:08,480
enough sleep and then that's going to
 

4345
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:10,390
enough sleep and then that's going to
accelerate your aging process

4346
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:10,400
accelerate your aging process
 

4347
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,709
accelerate your aging process
um and so it's known that that people

4348
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:12,719
um and so it's known that that people
 

4349
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:13,830
um and so it's known that that people
who are shift workers are more

4350
01:11:13,830 --> 01:11:13,840
who are shift workers are more
 

4351
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:14,790
who are shift workers are more
susceptible

4352
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:14,800
susceptible
 

4353
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,910
susceptible
to certain age-related diseases so your

4354
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:17,920
to certain age-related diseases so your
 

4355
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:19,510
to certain age-related diseases so your
bottom line you definitely want to work

4356
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:19,520
bottom line you definitely want to work
 

4357
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:20,790
bottom line you definitely want to work
on that it's one of the reasons i have

4358
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:20,800
on that it's one of the reasons i have
 

4359
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,310
on that it's one of the reasons i have
this ring on my finger which helps me

4360
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:22,320
this ring on my finger which helps me
 

4361
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,310
this ring on my finger which helps me
optimize my sleep and learn

4362
01:11:24,310 --> 01:11:24,320
optimize my sleep and learn
 

4363
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,950
optimize my sleep and learn
what i do the day before if it was a bad

4364
01:11:26,950 --> 01:11:26,960
what i do the day before if it was a bad
 

4365
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,470
what i do the day before if it was a bad
idea and i'll stop doing that like

4366
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:28,480
idea and i'll stop doing that like
 

4367
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:31,669
idea and i'll stop doing that like
eating a fried chicken

4368
01:11:31,669 --> 01:11:31,679

 

4369
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:33,270

i see you're still carrying the burdens

4370
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:33,280
i see you're still carrying the burdens
 

4371
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:34,790
i see you're still carrying the burdens
of that decision

4372
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:34,800
of that decision
 

4373
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:37,350
of that decision
but is yeah you know sleep is one of

4374
01:11:37,350 --> 01:11:37,360
but is yeah you know sleep is one of
 

4375
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,149
but is yeah you know sleep is one of
those things that's making me

4376
01:11:40,149 --> 01:11:40,159
those things that's making me
 

4377
01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:41,910
those things that's making me
wonder about the variability between

4378
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:41,920
wonder about the variability between
 

4379
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:43,669
wonder about the variability between
humans a little bit and how

4380
01:11:43,669 --> 01:11:43,679
humans a little bit and how
 

4381
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:47,430
humans a little bit and how
science is often focused on

4382
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:47,440
science is often focused on
 

4383
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:50,630
science is often focused on
like it's not often focused on high

4384
01:11:50,630 --> 01:11:50,640
like it's not often focused on high
 

4385
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:53,510
like it's not often focused on high
performers in a particular way

4386
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:53,520
performers in a particular way
 

4387
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,430
performers in a particular way
and it's looking at the aggregate versus

4388
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:55,440
and it's looking at the aggregate versus
 

4389
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:57,750
and it's looking at the aggregate versus
the individual cases

4390
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:57,760
the individual cases
 

4391
01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,590
the individual cases
for example like for me i don't know

4392
01:11:59,590 --> 01:11:59,600
for example like for me i don't know
 

4393
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:01,669
for example like for me i don't know
what the exact hours are but

4394
01:12:01,669 --> 01:12:01,679
what the exact hours are but
 

4395
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,390
what the exact hours are but
like power naps are incredible

4396
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:06,400

 

4397
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,189

i tend to look at the metric of stress

4398
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:09,199
i tend to look at the metric of stress
 

4399
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,630
i tend to look at the metric of stress
and happiness

4400
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:10,640
and happiness
 

4401
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,270
and happiness
and joy and try to optimize those so

4402
01:12:13,270 --> 01:12:13,280
and joy and try to optimize those so
 

4403
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,990
and joy and try to optimize those so
decreasing stress increasing happiness

4404
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,000
decreasing stress increasing happiness
 

4405
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,870
decreasing stress increasing happiness
and using sleep as just one of the tools

4406
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:18,880
and using sleep as just one of the tools
 

4407
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,070
and using sleep as just one of the tools
to do that

4408
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:20,080
to do that
 

4409
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:23,189
to do that
because like hitting the five six seven

4410
01:12:23,189 --> 01:12:23,199
because like hitting the five six seven
 

4411
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:25,669
because like hitting the five six seven
eight nine hour mark or whatever the

4412
01:12:25,669 --> 01:12:25,679
eight nine hour mark or whatever the
 

4413
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,110
eight nine hour mark or whatever the
correct mark is

4414
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:27,120
correct mark is
 

4415
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,990
correct mark is
i find that to be stress inducing for me

4416
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:30,000
i find that to be stress inducing for me
 

4417
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,950
i find that to be stress inducing for me
versus

4418
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:30,960
versus
 

4419
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:33,270
versus
stress relieving like thinking about

4420
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:33,280
stress relieving like thinking about
 

4421
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,070
stress relieving like thinking about
that i

4422
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:34,080
that i
 

4423
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,709
that i
i feel best if i sleep sometimes for

i feel best if i sleep sometimes for
eight hours sometimes for four hours and

01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:38,400
eight hours sometimes for four hours and
 

4427
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,510
eight hours sometimes for four hours and
then power nap

4428
01:12:39,510 --> 01:12:39,520
then power nap
 

4429
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,470

about
and it's almost like there's the jocko

kind of a celebration of the human
spirit that i really enjoy it

4482
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:30,960
spirit that i really enjoy it
 

4483
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,310
spirit that i really enjoy it
like uh and that's happiness and to sort

4484
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:34,320
like uh and that's happiness and to sort
 

4485
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:35,350
like uh and that's happiness and to sort
of

4486
01:13:35,350 --> 01:13:35,360
of
 

4487
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,110
of
then and i usually don't tell that kind

4488
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:37,120
then and i usually don't tell that kind
 

4489
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,550
then and i usually don't tell that kind
of stuff to people because

4490
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:38,560
of stuff to people because
 

4491
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:40,870
of stuff to people because
their first statement will be like you

4492
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:40,880
their first statement will be like you
 

4493
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,550
their first statement will be like you
should get more sleep

4494
01:13:42,550 --> 01:13:42,560
should get more sleep
 

4495
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,229
should get more sleep
it's like no i'm doing stuff i love

4496
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:46,239
it's like no i'm doing stuff i love
 

4497
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,910
it's like no i'm doing stuff i love
you should get more love in your life

4498
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:47,920
you should get more love in your life
 

4499
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:50,390
you should get more love in your life
bro that's right

4500
01:13:50,390 --> 01:13:50,400
bro that's right
 

4501
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,709
bro that's right
so but that said in aggregate when you

4502
01:13:52,709 --> 01:13:52,719
so but that said in aggregate when you
 

4503
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,350
so but that said in aggregate when you
look at the full span of life

4504
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:55,360
look at the full span of life
 

4505
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,390
look at the full span of life
it's probably you should be getting

4506
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:58,400
it's probably you should be getting
 

4507
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,110
it's probably you should be getting
a consistent amount of sleep and it

4508
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,120
a consistent amount of sleep and it
 

4509
01:14:01,120 --> 01:14:02,709
a consistent amount of sleep and it
seems like it's in that

4510
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:02,719
seems like it's in that
 

4511
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:05,270
seems like it's in that
seven eight hour range yeah but it's

4512
01:14:05,270 --> 01:14:05,280
seven eight hour range yeah but it's
 

4513
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,310
seven eight hour range yeah but it's
similar to food

4514
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:06,320
similar to food
 

4515
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:08,870
similar to food
it it's the quality not the quantity

4516
01:14:08,870 --> 01:14:08,880
it it's the quality not the quantity
 

4517
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,709
it it's the quality not the quantity
right and and when you get it

4518
01:14:10,709 --> 01:14:10,719
right and and when you get it
 

4519
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,390
right and and when you get it
so i i look at my my data pretty often

4520
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:14,400
so i i look at my my data pretty often
 

4521
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,310
so i i look at my my data pretty often
and what makes a difference to me is not

4522
01:14:16,310 --> 01:14:16,320
and what makes a difference to me is not
 

4523
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,830
and what makes a difference to me is not
the amount of hours but

4524
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:17,840
the amount of hours but
 

4525
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:20,390
the amount of hours but
the quality the depth and the deep sleep

4526
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
the quality the depth and the deep sleep
 

4527
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:21,189
the quality the depth and the deep sleep
is what

4528
01:14:21,189 --> 01:14:21,199
is what
 

4529
01:14:21,199 --> 01:14:22,630
is what
what'll do it so if i have a lot of

4530
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:22,640
what'll do it so if i have a lot of
 

4531
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:24,709
what'll do it so if i have a lot of
alcohol before going to sleep

4532
01:14:24,709 --> 01:14:24,719
alcohol before going to sleep
 

4533
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:25,990
alcohol before going to sleep
and i can see my heart rate being

4534
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:26,000
and i can see my heart rate being
 

4535
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,510
and i can see my heart rate being
different but what really kills me is

4536
01:14:27,510 --> 01:14:27,520
different but what really kills me is
 

4537
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:27,990
different but what really kills me is
that i don't

4538
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:28,000
that i don't
 

4539
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,590
that i don't
get a lot of that deep sleep and i wake

4540
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:29,600
get a lot of that deep sleep and i wake
 

4541
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,310
get a lot of that deep sleep and i wake
up you know barely remembering stuff

4542
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:32,320
up you know barely remembering stuff
 

4543
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:33,830
up you know barely remembering stuff
so that like you say if you're happy and

4544
01:14:33,830 --> 01:14:33,840
so that like you say if you're happy and
 

4545
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:35,110
so that like you say if you're happy and
contented and you're not don't have

4546

contented and you're not don't have
 

4547
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:35,990
contented and you're not don't have
these

4548
01:14:35,990 --> 01:14:36,000
these
 

4549
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,590
these
cortisol chemicals going through your

4550
01:14:37,590 --> 01:14:37,600
cortisol chemicals going through your
 

4551
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,430
cortisol chemicals going through your
body you will more naturally get into

4552
01:14:39,430 --> 01:14:39,440
body you will more naturally get into
 

4553
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,550
body you will more naturally get into
that deep state

4554
01:14:40,550 --> 01:14:40,560
that deep state
 

4555
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:42,470
that deep state
and even if you just get four hours way

4556
01:14:42,470 --> 01:14:42,480
and even if you just get four hours way
 

4557
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,350
and even if you just get four hours way
better than eight hours of none of that

4558
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:45,360
better than eight hours of none of that
 

4559
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:47,189
better than eight hours of none of that
yeah yeah that's beautiful and some of

4560
01:14:47,189 --> 01:14:47,199
yeah yeah that's beautiful and some of
 

4561
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:49,669
yeah yeah that's beautiful and some of
that could be genetic for me i just

4562
01:14:49,669 --> 01:14:49,679
that could be genetic for me i just
 

4563
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:52,390
that could be genetic for me i just
i just fall asleep like this if you want

4564
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:52,400
i just fall asleep like this if you want
 

4565
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:54,070
i just fall asleep like this if you want
me to fall asleep right now i can do it

4566
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:54,080
me to fall asleep right now i can do it
 

4567
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:57,189
me to fall asleep right now i can do it
it's it's no um i have no problem with

4568
01:14:57,189 --> 01:14:57,199
it's it's no um i have no problem with
 

4569
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,630
it's it's no um i have no problem with
the combined with coffee i just had two

4570
01:14:58,630 --> 01:14:58,640
the combined with coffee i just had two
 

4571
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,630
the combined with coffee i just had two
energy drinks i could probably

4572
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:00,640
energy drinks i could probably
 

4573
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:02,390
energy drinks i could probably
uh sleep so that i don't know if that's

4574
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:02,400
uh sleep so that i don't know if that's
 

4575
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,990
uh sleep so that i don't know if that's
genetics or

4576
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:04,000
genetics or
 

4577
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:07,350
genetics or
it's kind of um i don't know what it is

4578
01:15:07,350 --> 01:15:07,360
it's kind of um i don't know what it is
 

4579
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,950
it's kind of um i don't know what it is
or maybe that i don't have kids that i'm

4580
01:15:08,950 --> 01:15:08,960
or maybe that i don't have kids that i'm
 

4581
01:15:08,960 --> 01:15:10,950
or maybe that i don't have kids that i'm
single so i don't have uh

4582
01:15:10,950 --> 01:15:10,960
single so i don't have uh
 

4583
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:12,470
single so i don't have uh
i'm almost listening to some kind of

4584
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:12,480
i'm almost listening to some kind of
 

4585
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,310
i'm almost listening to some kind of
biological signal versus

4586
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:14,320
biological signal versus
 

4587
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:16,070
biological signal versus
societal signal on when i'm supposed to

4588
01:15:16,070 --> 01:15:16,080
societal signal on when i'm supposed to
 

4589
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:17,510
societal signal on when i'm supposed to
go to sleep so i just

4590
01:15:17,510 --> 01:15:17,520
go to sleep so i just
 

4591
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:20,229
go to sleep so i just
go to sleep whenever i feel like going

4592
01:15:20,229 --> 01:15:20,239
go to sleep whenever i feel like going
 

4593
01:15:20,239 --> 01:15:21,510
go to sleep whenever i feel like going
to sleep well that's because you're

4594
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:21,520
to sleep well that's because you're
 

4595
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,590
to sleep well that's because you're
self-employed so most people don't have

4596
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:23,600
self-employed so most people don't have
 

4597
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:24,550
self-employed so most people don't have
that luxury

4598
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:24,560
that luxury
 

4599
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,229
that luxury
but we're lucky the two of us that we

4600
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:26,239
but we're lucky the two of us that we
 

4601
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:27,910
but we're lucky the two of us that we
can make our own hours yeah

4602
01:15:27,910 --> 01:15:27,920
can make our own hours yeah
 

4603
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,990
can make our own hours yeah
um but yeah it's super important and

4604
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:30,000
um but yeah it's super important and
 

4605
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:30,950
um but yeah it's super important and
those people who have

4606
01:15:30,950 --> 01:15:30,960
those people who have
 

4607
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,110
those people who have
the shift work i mean they they really

4608
01:15:33,110 --> 01:15:33,120
the shift work i mean they they really
 

4609
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:34,229
the shift work i mean they they really
need to to

4610
01:15:34,229 --> 01:15:34,239
need to to
 

4611
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,669
need to to
change the way that works because

4612
01:15:35,669 --> 01:15:35,679
change the way that works because
 

4613
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:38,790
change the way that works because
they're literally killing those people

4614
01:15:38,790 --> 01:15:38,800
they're literally killing those people
 

4615
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,990
they're literally killing those people
is there something you can say about the

4616
01:15:41,990 --> 01:15:42,000
is there something you can say about the
 

4617
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,110
is there something you can say about the
the mind and stress

4618
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:45,120
the mind and stress
 

4619
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:48,310
the mind and stress
uh in terms of effect on longevity

4620
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:48,320
uh in terms of effect on longevity
 

4621
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,350
uh in terms of effect on longevity
sort of um because i don't know if you

4622
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:51,360
sort of um because i don't know if you
 

4623
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:53,110
sort of um because i don't know if you
think about it this way but

4624
01:15:53,110 --> 01:15:53,120
think about it this way but
 

4625
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:54,630
think about it this way but
when you talk about the biological

4626
01:15:54,630 --> 01:15:54,640
when you talk about the biological
 

4627
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,390
when you talk about the biological
machine it's always these mechanisms

4628
01:15:56,390 --> 01:15:56,400
machine it's always these mechanisms
 

4629
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,110
machine it's always these mechanisms
that don't are not necessarily directly

4630
01:15:59,110 --> 01:15:59,120
that don't are not necessarily directly
 

4631
01:15:59,120 --> 01:16:00,709
that don't are not necessarily directly
connected to the brain

4632
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
connected to the brain
 

4633
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:02,630
connected to the brain
or the operation of the brain like

4634
01:16:02,630 --> 01:16:02,640
or the operation of the brain like
 

4635
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:04,550
or the operation of the brain like
what's the role about

4636
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:04,560
what's the role about
 

4637
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:08,550
what's the role about
stress and happiness and uh

4638
01:16:08,550 --> 01:16:08,560
stress and happiness and uh
 

4639
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,630
stress and happiness and uh
yeah the sort of higher cognitive things

4640
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:10,640
yeah the sort of higher cognitive things
 

4641
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:11,910
yeah the sort of higher cognitive things
going on in the brain

4642
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:11,920
going on in the brain
 

4643
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:15,750
going on in the brain
on longevity right well that's a great

4644
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:15,760
on longevity right well that's a great
 

4645
01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:17,590
on longevity right well that's a great
point that the brain is is the center

4646
01:16:17,590 --> 01:16:17,600
point that the brain is is the center
 

4647
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,870
point that the brain is is the center
for longevity actually

4648
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:18,880
for longevity actually
 

4649
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,830
for longevity actually
we we do know that first start when when

4650
01:16:21,830 --> 01:16:21,840
we we do know that first start when when
 

4651
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:22,709
we we do know that first start when when
i'm stressed

4652
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:22,719
i'm stressed
 

4653
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:25,350
i'm stressed
i can see mentally stressed then i can

4654
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:25,360
i can see mentally stressed then i can
 

4655
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,110
i can see mentally stressed then i can
see it in my body

4656
01:16:27,110 --> 01:16:27,120
see it in my body
 

4657
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:29,510
see it in my body
heart rate hormones it's clear you know

4658
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:29,520
heart rate hormones it's clear you know
 

4659
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,229
heart rate hormones it's clear you know
that's no

4660
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:30,239
that's no
 

4661
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:32,149
that's no
true surprise so you've got to work on

4662
01:16:32,149 --> 01:16:32,159
true surprise so you've got to work on
 

4663
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:35,270
true surprise so you've got to work on
your brain first and foremost if you are

4664
01:16:35,270 --> 01:16:35,280
your brain first and foremost if you are
 

4665
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:38,630
your brain first and foremost if you are
totally freaked out agitated uh

4666
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:38,640
totally freaked out agitated uh
 

4667
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,430
totally freaked out agitated uh
all the time you will live shorter i'm

4668
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:41,440
all the time you will live shorter i'm
 

4669
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,030

fish i'm a big

4672
01:16:46,229 --> 01:16:46,239
fish i'm a big
 

4673
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:47,910
fish i'm a big
aquarium guy and you can see the

4674
01:16:47,910 --> 01:16:47,920
aquarium guy and you can see the
 

4675
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:49,590
aquarium guy and you can see the
difference between the the fish that's

4676
01:16:49,590 --> 01:16:49,600
difference between the the fish that's
 

4677
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:51,350
difference between the the fish that's
having a good time and dominant

4678
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:51,360
having a good time and dominant
 

4679
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,590
having a good time and dominant
and one that gets picked on yeah it just

4680
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:53,600
and one that gets picked on yeah it just
 

4681
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:55,110
and one that gets picked on yeah it just
looks like crap

4682
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:55,120
looks like crap
 

4683
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,229
looks like crap
you don't want to be that the little

you don't want to be that the little
 

4685
01:16:56,239 --> 01:16:57,990
you don't want to be that the little
fish getting picked on if you can help

4686
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:58,000
fish getting picked on if you can help
 

4687
01:16:58,000 --> 01:16:58,550
fish getting picked on if you can help
it

4688
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:58,560
it
 

4689
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,550

01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:48,480
in a better way if you manipulate the
 

4743
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:50,470
in a better way if you manipulate the
brain of an animal

i'll give you an example if we turn on

4746
01:17:51,910 --> 01:17:51,920
i'll give you an example if we turn on
 

4747
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:54,870
i'll give you an example if we turn on
this cert gene that i mentioned sir one

01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,470
shiny my did this
they upregulate the operate of that gene

4754
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:00,480
they upregulate the operate of that gene
 

4755
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,110
they upregulate the operate of that gene
just in the neurons of the animal

01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:03,120
just in the neurons of the animal
 

4757
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:05,750
just in the neurons of the animal
it lived longer so that's sufficient to

4758
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:05,760
it lived longer so that's sufficient to
 

4759
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:06,870
it lived longer so that's sufficient to
extend lifespan

01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:08,310
extend lifespan
we also know that you can manipulate the

we also know that you can manipulate the
 

4763
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:09,910
we also know that you can manipulate the
part of the brain

part of the brain
 

4765
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:11,669
part of the brain
called the hypothalamus which leaches a

that little organ
 

4777
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,950
that little organ
or part of the brain is sufficient to

make animals live longer as well
so get your brain in order first before

4782
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:26,719
so get your brain in order first before
 

4783
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:29,350
so get your brain in order first before
you tackle anything else i would say

4784
01:18:29,350 --> 01:18:29,360
you tackle anything else i would say
 

4785
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,070
you tackle anything else i would say
so you kind of mention this with the

4786
01:18:32,070 --> 01:18:32,080
so you kind of mention this with the
 

4787
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:33,030
so you kind of mention this with the
inside tracker

4788
01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:33,040
inside tracker
 

4789
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,510
inside tracker
there's a ability to take blood

4790
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:35,520
there's a ability to take blood
 

4791
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:36,149
there's a ability to take blood
measurement

4792

and then infer from that
 

4795
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,630
and then infer from that
a bunch of different things about your

4796
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:40,640
a bunch of different things about your
 

4797
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,390
a bunch of different things about your
body how you can improve

4798
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:42,400
body how you can improve
 

4799
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:44,709
body how you can improve
how you can improve the longevity and

4800
01:18:44,709 --> 01:18:44,719
how you can improve the longevity and
 

4801
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,229
how you can improve the longevity and
you've also mentioned

4802
01:18:46,229 --> 01:18:46,239
you've also mentioned
 

4803
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:49,910
you've also mentioned
saliva and more efficient ways

4804
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:49,920
saliva and more efficient ways
 

4805
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:54,149
saliva and more efficient ways
to uh to get data uh

4806
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:54,159
to uh to get data uh
 

4807
01:18:54,159 --> 01:18:55,990
to uh to get data uh
what does that involve what's the future

4808
01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:56,000
what does that involve what's the future
 

4809
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:57,430
what does that involve what's the future
of data collection look like yeah for

4810
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:57,440
of data collection look like yeah for
 

4811
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,189
of data collection look like yeah for
the human biological system

4812
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
the human biological system
 

4813
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,270
the human biological system
right well yeah the the issue with with

4814
01:19:01,270 --> 01:19:01,280
right well yeah the the issue with with
 

4815
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,709
right well yeah the the issue with with
blood is you need someone to take it

4816
01:19:02,709 --> 01:19:02,719
blood is you need someone to take it
 

4817
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:03,030
blood is you need someone to take it
it's

4818
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:03,040
it's
 

4819
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,709
it's
it i mean or you prick your finger which

4820
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:04,719
it i mean or you prick your finger which
 

4821
01:19:04,719 --> 01:19:06,790
it i mean or you prick your finger which
hurts yes so you gotta have something

4822
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:06,800
hurts yes so you gotta have something
 

4823
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:07,990
hurts yes so you gotta have something
better so i think what the future

4824
01:19:07,990 --> 01:19:08,000
better so i think what the future
 

4825
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,669
better so i think what the future
looks like is that you'll spit onto a

4826
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:11,679
looks like is that you'll spit onto a
 

4827
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:12,790
looks like is that you'll spit onto a
little piece of paper and stick it in a

4828
01:19:12,790 --> 01:19:12,800
little piece of paper and stick it in a
 

4829
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:14,630
little piece of paper and stick it in a
machine and it'll it'll do that for you

4830
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:14,640
machine and it'll it'll do that for you
 

4831
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:15,830
machine and it'll it'll do that for you
but we're not there yet so the

4832
01:19:15,830 --> 01:19:15,840
but we're not there yet so the
 

4833
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,310
but we're not there yet so the
intermediate um

4834
01:19:18,310 --> 01:19:18,320
intermediate um
 

4835
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,950
intermediate um
future that that i'm building right now

4836
01:19:20,950 --> 01:19:20,960
future that that i'm building right now
 

4837
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:22,390
future that that i'm building right now
is that you would take a

4838
01:19:22,390 --> 01:19:22,400
is that you would take a
 

4839
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,310
is that you would take a
swab of the inside of your mouth which

4840
01:19:24,310 --> 01:19:24,320
swab of the inside of your mouth which
 

4841
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,750
swab of the inside of your mouth which
is the easiest way to take cells out of

4842
01:19:25,750 --> 01:19:25,760
is the easiest way to take cells out of
 

4843
01:19:25,760 --> 01:19:26,709
is the easiest way to take cells out of
your body

4844
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:26,719
your body
 

4845
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,270
your body
and just ship them off okay so called a

4846
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
and just ship them off okay so called a
 

4847
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,390
and just ship them off okay so called a
buckle swab

4848
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
buckle swab
 

4849
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,229
buckle swab
um i think we we became very used to

4850
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:32,239
um i think we we became very used to
 

4851
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,510
um i think we we became very used to
that right right now

4852
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:33,520
that right right now
 

4853
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,030
that right right now
because of covert people don't like

4854
01:19:35,030 --> 01:19:35,040
because of covert people don't like
 

4855
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,229
because of covert people don't like
going to the doctor as much they don't

4856
01:19:36,229 --> 01:19:36,239
going to the doctor as much they don't
 

4857
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,510
going to the doctor as much they don't
like going out they just want to have

4858
01:19:37,510 --> 01:19:37,520
like going out they just want to have
 

4859
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:38,709
like going out they just want to have
home tests

4860
01:19:38,709 --> 01:19:38,719
home tests
 

4861
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:40,709
home tests
and so that i think is the next 10 years

4862
01:19:40,709 --> 01:19:40,719
and so that i think is the next 10 years
 

4863
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:43,030
and so that i think is the next 10 years
where you'll get a kit in the mail

4864
01:19:43,030 --> 01:19:43,040
where you'll get a kit in the mail
 

4865
01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:44,630
where you'll get a kit in the mail
you'll swab your cheek stick it back in

4866
01:19:44,630 --> 01:19:44,640
you'll swab your cheek stick it back in
 

4867

trajectory because we know that smoking
 

4941
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:50,709
trajectory because we know that smoking
increases the speed of that clock

4942

increases the speed of that clock
we also know that fasting and people who

non-stop a rapid antigen test
 

4961
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:09,590
non-stop a rapid antigen test
so let me say that particular one

4962
01:21:09,590 --> 01:21:09,600
so let me say that particular one
 

4963
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:11,590
so let me say that particular one
rapid antigen test they've been a source

rapid antigen test they've been a source
 

4965
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,270
rapid antigen test they've been a source
of frustration for me because like

4966
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:13,280
of frustration for me because like
 

4967
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,790
of frustration for me because like
everybody should be doing it

4968

bring them down from a few hundred bucks

4974
01:21:20,629 --> 01:21:20,639
bring them down from a few hundred bucks
 

4975

it's almost like uh like you know when
 

5027
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:09,990
it's almost like uh like you know when
you share if you had like

can have a conversation about like
 

5037
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:18,310
can have a conversation about like
well what are the hacks that you've

5038
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
well what are the hacks that you've
 

5039
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,310
well what are the hacks that you've
tried and have a conversation about like

of things
 

5045
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:24,149
of things
that's grounded in data that's exactly

5046
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:24,159
that's grounded in data that's exactly
 

5047
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,189
that's grounded in data that's exactly
that's what's that's what's going to

5048
01:22:25,189 --> 01:22:25,199
that's what's that's what's going to
 

5049
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:25,990
that's what's that's what's going to
happen now

5050
01:22:25,990 --> 01:22:26,000
happen now
 

5051
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,669
happen now
everything's anonymous of course we

5052
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:27,679
everything's anonymous of course we
 

5053
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:29,590
everything's anonymous of course we
talked about security there

5054
01:22:29,590 --> 01:22:29,600
talked about security there
 

5055
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,590
talked about security there
but once it's anonymized you can then

5056
01:22:31,590 --> 01:22:31,600
but once it's anonymized you can then
 

5057
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,990
but once it's anonymized you can then
plot these numbers and i've plotted my

5058
01:22:33,990 --> 01:22:34,000
plot these numbers and i've plotted my
 

5059
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,870
plot these numbers and i've plotted my
epigenetic age versus hundreds of other

5060
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:36,880
epigenetic age versus hundreds of other
 

5061
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:37,990
epigenetic age versus hundreds of other
people who have taken this

5062
01:22:37,990 --> 01:22:38,000
people who have taken this
 

5063
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:40,550
people who have taken this
test now and i can tell you where i fit

5064
01:22:40,550 --> 01:22:40,560
test now and i can tell you where i fit
 

5065
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:41,990
test now and i can tell you where i fit
relative to others in terms of my

5066
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:42,000
relative to others in terms of my
 

5067
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:43,430
relative to others in terms of my
biological age

5068
01:22:43,430 --> 01:22:43,440
biological age
 

5069
01:22:43,440 --> 01:22:44,950
biological age
and i'm happy to share that with you all

5070
01:22:44,950 --> 01:22:44,960
and i'm happy to share that with you all
 

5071
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,110
and i'm happy to share that with you all
because it's pretty low

5072
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:47,120
because it's pretty low
 

5073
01:22:47,120 --> 01:22:48,550
because it's pretty low
you can choose to share it of course not

5074
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:48,560
you can choose to share it of course not
 

5075
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:50,310
you can choose to share it of course not
everyone wants to share that

5076
01:22:50,310 --> 01:22:50,320
everyone wants to share that
 

5077
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,390
everyone wants to share that
but when you go to the doctor first of

5078
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:52,400
but when you go to the doctor first of
 

5079
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,070
but when you go to the doctor first of
all your doctor doesn't

5080
01:22:54,070 --> 01:22:54,080
all your doctor doesn't
 

5081
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:55,189
all your doctor doesn't
does treat you as though you're an

5082
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:55,199
does treat you as though you're an
 

5083
01:22:55,199 --> 01:22:56,870
does treat you as though you're an
average person and none of us are

5084
01:22:56,870 --> 01:22:56,880
average person and none of us are
 

5085
01:22:56,880 --> 01:22:58,470
average person and none of us are
average there's no such thing

5086
01:22:58,470 --> 01:22:58,480
average there's no such thing
 

5087
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,310
average there's no such thing
but second of all we never know how

5088
01:23:00,310 --> 01:23:00,320
but second of all we never know how
 

5089
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:01,830
but second of all we never know how
we're doing relative to others because

5090
01:23:01,830 --> 01:23:01,840
we're doing relative to others because
 

5091
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:03,510
we're doing relative to others because
we all

5092
01:23:03,510 --> 01:23:03,520
we all
 

5093
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:05,189
we all
most of us we we don't share our

5094
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:05,199
most of us we we don't share our
 

5095
01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:07,030
most of us we we don't share our
information so we might have this number

5096
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:07,040
information so we might have this number
 

5097
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:07,910
information so we might have this number
and that number

5098
01:23:07,910 --> 01:23:07,920
and that number
 

5099
01:23:07,920 --> 01:23:09,510
and that number
but do you know that your numbers are

5100
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:09,520
but do you know that your numbers are
 

5101
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,189
but do you know that your numbers are
good for your age or not

5102
01:23:11,189 --> 01:23:11,199
good for your age or not
 

5103
01:23:11,199 --> 01:23:13,270
good for your age or not
you have no idea no even your doctor

5104
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:13,280
you have no idea no even your doctor
 

5105
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,470
you have no idea no even your doctor
probably doesn't even know

5106
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:14,480
probably doesn't even know
 

5107
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:15,990
probably doesn't even know
so this this graph that i'm talking

5108
01:23:15,990 --> 01:23:16,000
so this this graph that i'm talking
 

5109
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:17,430
so this this graph that i'm talking
about is the beginning of a world where

5110
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:17,440
about is the beginning of a world where
 

5111
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:19,189
about is the beginning of a world where
you can say how am i doing

5112
01:23:19,189 --> 01:23:19,199
you can say how am i doing
 

5113
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,590
you can say how am i doing
i'm a you know for the two of us we're

5114
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:21,600
i'm a you know for the two of us we're
 

5115
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,629
i'm a you know for the two of us we're
white and we're male

5116
01:23:22,629 --> 01:23:22,639
white and we're male
 

5117
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:26,229
white and we're male
and we're this age and we do this

5118
01:23:26,229 --> 01:23:26,239
and we're this age and we do this
 

5119
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:27,430
and we're this age and we do this
are we good are we doing the right

5120
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:27,440
are we good are we doing the right
 

5121
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:28,870
are we good are we doing the right
things or the wrong things do we need to

5122
01:23:28,870 --> 01:23:28,880
things or the wrong things do we need to
 

5123
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,310
things or the wrong things do we need to
fix certain things

5124
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:30,320
fix certain things
 

5125
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:32,550
fix certain things
and this is what the future is it's

5126
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:32,560
and this is what the future is it's
 

5127
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,229
and this is what the future is it's
forget about

5128
01:23:34,229 --> 01:23:34,239
forget about
 

5129
01:23:34,239 --> 01:23:35,910
forget about
just experimenting and not knowing the

5130
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:35,920
just experimenting and not knowing the
 

5131
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:37,270
just experimenting and not knowing the
result i mean who doesn't experiment and

5132
01:23:37,270 --> 01:23:37,280
result i mean who doesn't experiment and
 

5133
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,390
result i mean who doesn't experiment and
doesn't look at the data

5134
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
doesn't look at the data
 

5135
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:40,470
doesn't look at the data
no one it makes no sense so we're going

5136
01:23:40,470 --> 01:23:40,480
no one it makes no sense so we're going
 

5137
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,590
no one it makes no sense so we're going
to enter a world where we have a

5138
01:23:41,590 --> 01:23:41,600
to enter a world where we have a
 

5139
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,350
to enter a world where we have a
dashboard in our body

5140
01:23:43,350 --> 01:23:43,360
dashboard in our body
 

5141
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:46,390
dashboard in our body
the swabs the blood tests the biosensors

5142
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:46,400
the swabs the blood tests the biosensors
 

5143
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:47,030
the swabs the blood tests the biosensors
where

5144
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:47,040
where
 

5145
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,870
where
our doctors can look at that but we can

5146
01:23:48,870 --> 01:23:48,880
our doctors can look at that but we can
 

5147
01:23:48,880 --> 01:23:50,070
our doctors can look at that but we can
also look at it

5148
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:50,080
also look at it
 

5149
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,750
also look at it
and they can recommend you know go to

terms of how long a person would live
 

5171
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:14,870
terms of how long a person would live
like what is the maximum longevity that

01:24:14,870 --> 01:24:14,880
like what is the maximum longevity that
 

5173
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,189
like what is the maximum longevity that
we can achieve through the methods

5174
01:24:17,189 --> 01:24:17,199
we can achieve through the methods
 

5175
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:20,149
we can achieve through the methods
that we have today of uh or are

01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:21,270
that we have today of uh or are
developing some of the things we've been

01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:21,280
developing some of the things we've been

developing some of the things we've been
talking about

5180
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:23,199
talking about
 

5181
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,430
talking about

what's is there a number

5186
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
what's is there a number
 

5187
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,669
what's is there a number
right uh well so it changes all the time

5188
01:24:31,669 --> 01:24:31,679
right uh well so it changes all the time
 

5189
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:33,270
right uh well so it changes all the time
because technology's changing so quickly

5190
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:33,280
because technology's changing so quickly
 

5191
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,870
because technology's changing so quickly
i keep revising the number

5192
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
i keep revising the number
 

5193
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:37,990
i keep revising the number
upward uh but i would say that if you do

5194
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:38,000
upward uh but i would say that if you do
 

5195
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,430
upward uh but i would say that if you do
the right things during your life and

5196
01:24:39,430 --> 01:24:39,440
the right things during your life and
 

5197
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:41,750
the right things during your life and
start at an early age let's say 25 we

5198
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:41,760
start at an early age let's say 25 we
 

5199
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,110
start at an early age let's say 25 we
don't want malnutrition starvation

5200
01:24:43,110 --> 01:24:43,120
don't want malnutrition starvation
 

5201
01:24:43,120 --> 01:24:44,950
don't want malnutrition starvation
that's not what i'm talking about

to 30 percent we don't know if that's
 

5213
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:58,390
to 30 percent we don't know if that's
true for humans and that would

5214
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:58,400
true for humans and that would
 

5215
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,910
true for humans and that would
you know even five percent more would be

5216
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
you know even five percent more would be

i think that we should all aim to at
 

5221
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,350
i think that we should all aim to at
least reach a century

01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:54,070
what i'm talking about
it's not a big deal so what's the

5266
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:54,080
it's not a big deal so what's the
 

5267
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,669
it's not a big deal so what's the
maximum well we know that

5268
01:25:55,669 --> 01:25:55,679
maximum well we know that
 

5269

teens i think that's also the next level

5274
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:02,080
teens i think that's also the next level
 

5275

of
 

5277
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:05,270
of
of uh of where we can get to with the

of uh of where we can get to with the
 

5279
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,709
of uh of where we can get to with the
types of technologies that i'm talking

there's one called metformin which is
 

5287
01:26:11,199 --> 01:26:12,709
there's one called metformin which is
the diabetes drug

the diabetes drug
 

5289
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:15,350
the diabetes drug
which i take that in combination with

5290
01:26:15,350 --> 01:26:15,360
which i take that in combination with
 

5291
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:16,950
which i take that in combination with
these lifestyle changes should get us

5292

these lifestyle changes should get us
 

5293
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,229
these lifestyle changes should get us
beyond a hundred

5294

beyond a hundred

01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:19,669
beyond a hundred
how long can we ultimately live well

5296
01:26:19,669 --> 01:26:19,679
how long can we ultimately live well
 

5297
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:21,669

there's no maximum limit to human
lifespan why can a whale live 300 years

5300
01:26:23,510 --> 01:26:23,520
lifespan why can a whale live 300 years
 

5301
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:24,470
lifespan why can a whale live 300 years
but we cannot

5302
01:26:24,470 --> 01:26:24,480
but we cannot
 

5303
01:26:24,480 --> 01:26:26,229

we're basically the same structure we

5304

we're basically the same structure we
 

5305
01:26:26,239 --> 01:26:27,750
we're basically the same structure we
just need to learn from them

5306
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:27,760
just need to learn from them
 

5307
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:30,229
just need to learn from them
so anyone who says oh you max max out at

5313
01:26:34,400 --> 01:26:35,910
i think is is full of it there's nothing
that i've seen that says biological

organisms have to die there are trees

5316
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:37,920
organisms have to die there are trees
 

5317
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:39,350
organisms have to die there are trees
that live for thousands of years

01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:39,360
that live for thousands of years
 

5319
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,790
that live for thousands of years
and their biochemistry is pretty close

5320
01:26:40,790 --> 01:26:40,800
and their biochemistry is pretty close
 

5321
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,550
and their biochemistry is pretty close
to ours

to ours
 

5323
01:26:42,560 --> 01:26:44,070

what do you think it means to live for a

5324
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:44,080
what do you think it means to live for a
 

5325
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:46,149
what do you think it means to live for a
very long time let's say if it's 200

5326
01:26:46,149 --> 01:26:46,159
very long time let's say if it's 200
 

5327
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,830
very long time let's say if it's 200
years we're talking about or a thousand

5328
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:48,840
years we're talking about or a thousand
 

5329
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:51,110

01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:54,470
years
there's some some sense you could argue

5332
01:26:54,470 --> 01:26:54,480
there's some some sense you could argue
 

5333
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:55,270
there's some some sense you could argue
that there is

5334
01:26:55,270 --> 01:26:55,280
that there is
 

5335
01:26:55,280 --> 01:26:57,430
that there is
immortal organisms already living on

immortal organisms already living on
 

5337
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:59,669

that in some fundamental way do not
 

5345
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:09,350
that in some fundamental way do not
die because they keep replicating their

5349
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:13,750

01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:13,760
they keep like cloning themselves
 

5351
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:17,189
they keep like cloning themselves
is is it the same human

5352
01:27:17,189 --> 01:27:17,199
is is it the same human
 

5353
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:21,270
is is it the same human
if we can somehow persist the human mind

5354
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:21,280
if we can somehow persist the human mind
 

5355
01:27:21,280 --> 01:27:24,149
if we can somehow persist the human mind
like copy clone certain aspects and just

5356
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:24,159
like copy clone certain aspects and just
 

5357
01:27:24,159 --> 01:27:25,270
like copy clone certain aspects and just
keep replacing

5358
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:25,280
keep replacing
 

5359
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:27,990
keep replacing
body parts um do you think that's

5360
01:27:27,990 --> 01:27:28,000
body parts um do you think that's
 

5361
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,390
body parts um do you think that's
another way to achieve immortality

5362
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:30,400
another way to achieve immortality
 

5363
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:32,629
another way to achieve immortality
to achieve of a prolonged sort of

5364
01:27:32,629 --> 01:27:32,639
to achieve of a prolonged sort of
 

5365
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,550
to achieve of a prolonged sort of
increased longevity is

5366
01:27:34,550 --> 01:27:34,560
increased longevity is
 

5367
01:27:34,560 --> 01:27:37,030
increased longevity is
to replace the parts that break easily

5368
01:27:37,030 --> 01:27:37,040
to replace the parts that break easily
 

5369
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:37,990
to replace the parts that break easily
and keep

5370
01:27:37,990 --> 01:27:38,000
and keep
 

5371
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:41,669
and keep
because actually from your theory of um

5372
01:27:41,669 --> 01:27:41,679
because actually from your theory of um
 

5373
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,310
because actually from your theory of um
aging as a degradation of information

5374
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:44,320
aging as a degradation of information
 

5375
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,910
aging as a degradation of information
it's an information theory view of

5376
01:27:45,910 --> 01:27:45,920
it's an information theory view of
 

5377
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:49,590
it's an information theory view of
aging like what is what is the key

5378
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:49,600
aging like what is what is the key
 

5379
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,350
aging like what is what is the key
information that makes a human

5380
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:51,360
information that makes a human
 

5381
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:53,750
information that makes a human
can we persist that information and just

5382
01:27:53,750 --> 01:27:53,760
can we persist that information and just
 

5383
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:54,709
can we persist that information and just
replace

5384
01:27:54,709 --> 01:27:54,719
replace
 

5385
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,910
replace
the the trivial parts uh yeah i mean the

5386
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:57,920
the the trivial parts uh yeah i mean the
 

5387
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,229
the the trivial parts uh yeah i mean the
short answer is yes we're already

5388
01:28:00,229 --> 01:28:00,239
short answer is yes we're already
 

5389
01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:01,669
short answer is yes we're already
replacing body parts but

5390
01:28:01,669 --> 01:28:01,679
replacing body parts but
 

5391
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:03,750
replacing body parts but
what makes us human is our brain

5392
01:28:03,750 --> 01:28:03,760
what makes us human is our brain
 

5393
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,229
what makes us human is our brain
everything else is is sub-optimal

5394
01:28:06,229 --> 01:28:06,239
everything else is is sub-optimal
 

5395
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:09,590
everything else is is sub-optimal
except our brain the

5396
01:28:09,590 --> 01:28:09,600
except our brain the
 

5397
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,149
except our brain the
ability to replace actual neurons is

5398
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:12,159
ability to replace actual neurons is
 

5399
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:13,510
ability to replace actual neurons is
really hard

5400
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:13,520
really hard
 

5401
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,149
really hard
right i think it might be easy to upload

5402
01:28:16,149 --> 01:28:16,159
right i think it might be easy to upload
 

5403
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:16,870
right i think it might be easy to upload
rather than

5404
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:16,880
rather than
 

5405
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,110
rather than
replace neurons because they're so tight

5406
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:19,120
replace neurons because they're so tight
 

5407
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:20,390
replace neurons because they're so tight
it's such a network

5408
01:28:20,390 --> 01:28:20,400
it's such a network
 

5409
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:22,950
it's such a network
and just perturbing the system you know

5410
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:22,960
and just perturbing the system you know
 

5411
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:23,430
and just perturbing the system you know
it's

5412
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:23,440
it's
 

5413
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:26,629
it's
it's uh it's stretching this cat you

5414
01:28:26,629 --> 01:28:26,639
it's uh it's stretching this cat you
 

5415
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:28,149
it's uh it's stretching this cat you
you change everything once you get in

5416
01:28:28,149 --> 01:28:28,159
you change everything once you get in
 

5417
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:30,709
you change everything once you get in
there the problem is um

5418
01:28:30,709 --> 01:28:30,719
there the problem is um
 

5419
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,070
there the problem is um
well i guess the solution let me go to

5420
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:32,080
well i guess the solution let me go to
 

5421
01:28:32,080 --> 01:28:33,990
well i guess the solution let me go to
the solution that's more interesting

5422
01:28:33,990 --> 01:28:34,000
the solution that's more interesting
 

5423
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,430
the solution that's more interesting
what we're learning is that if you

5424
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:35,440
what we're learning is that if you
 

5425
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:37,830
what we're learning is that if you
reverse the age of nerve cells

5426
01:28:37,830 --> 01:28:37,840
reverse the age of nerve cells
 

5427
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,430
reverse the age of nerve cells
they look it looks like they get their

5428
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:39,440
they look it looks like they get their
 

5429
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,110
they look it looks like they get their
memories back

5430
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:41,120
memories back
 

5431
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,550
memories back
right so the memories are not lost

5432
01:28:42,550 --> 01:28:42,560
right so the memories are not lost
 

5433
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:43,669
right so the memories are not lost
they're just that the cells don't know

5434
01:28:43,669 --> 01:28:43,679
they're just that the cells don't know
 

5435
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:44,470
they're just that the cells don't know
how to

5436
01:28:44,470 --> 01:28:44,480
how to
 

5437
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:46,790
how to
interpret them and function correctly

5438
01:28:46,790 --> 01:28:46,800
interpret them and function correctly
 

5439
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:47,590
interpret them and function correctly
and this is one of

5440
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:47,600
and this is one of
 

5441
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:48,790
and this is one of
the things we're starting in my lab if

5442
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:48,800
the things we're starting in my lab if
 

5443
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:50,070
the things we're starting in my lab if
you take an old mouse that has learned

5444
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:50,080
you take an old mouse that has learned
 

5445
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,270
you take an old mouse that has learned
something when it was young

5446
01:28:51,270 --> 01:28:51,280
something when it was young
 

5447
01:28:51,280 --> 01:28:54,070
something when it was young
but forgotten does it get that back and

5448
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:54,080
but forgotten does it get that back and
 

5449
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:56,310
but forgotten does it get that back and
all evidence points to that being true

5450
01:28:56,310 --> 01:28:56,320
all evidence points to that being true
 

5451
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,550
all evidence points to that being true
so i'd rather go in and rejuvenate the

5452
01:28:58,550 --> 01:28:58,560
so i'd rather go in and rejuvenate the
 

5453
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,390
so i'd rather go in and rejuvenate the
brain as it sits rather than replace

5454
01:29:00,390 --> 01:29:00,400
brain as it sits rather than replace
 

5455
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:01,830
brain as it sits rather than replace
individual cells which would be really

5456
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:01,840
individual cells which would be really
 

5457
01:29:01,840 --> 01:29:03,030
individual cells which would be really
hard

5458
01:29:03,030 --> 01:29:03,040
hard
 

5459
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,790
hard
what do you think about like efforts

5460
01:29:04,790 --> 01:29:04,800
what do you think about like efforts
 

5461
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:06,709
what do you think about like efforts
like neurolink

5462
01:29:06,709 --> 01:29:06,719
like neurolink
 

5463
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:10,149
like neurolink
which basically you mentioned uploading

5464
01:29:10,149 --> 01:29:10,159
which basically you mentioned uploading
 

5465
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:12,149
which basically you mentioned uploading
are trying to figure out so creating

01:29:12,149 --> 01:29:12,159
are trying to figure out so creating
 

5467
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:13,510
are trying to figure out so creating
brain computer interfaces

5468
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:13,520
brain computer interfaces
 

5469
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,110
brain computer interfaces
they're trying to figure out how to

5470
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:15,120
they're trying to figure out how to
 

5471
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:16,709
they're trying to figure out how to
communicate with the brain

5472
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:16,719
communicate with the brain
 

5473
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,390
communicate with the brain
but one of the features that is trying

5474
01:29:18,390 --> 01:29:18,400
but one of the features that is trying
 

5475
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,950
but one of the features that is trying
to record the human brain

5476
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:20,960
to record the human brain
 

5477
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:23,189
to record the human brain
more and more accurately do you have

5478
01:29:23,189 --> 01:29:23,199
more and more accurately do you have
 

5479
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,510
more and more accurately do you have
hope for that

5480
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:25,520
hope for that
 

5481
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:29,030
hope for that
to um of course there's uh it will lead

5482
01:29:29,030 --> 01:29:29,040
to um of course there's uh it will lead
 

5483
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:30,629
to um of course there's uh it will lead
to us better understanding

5484
01:29:30,629 --> 01:29:30,639
to us better understanding
 

5485
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:32,149
to us better understanding
from a neuroscience perspective the

5486
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:32,159
from a neuroscience perspective the
 

5487
01:29:32,159 --> 01:29:33,910
from a neuroscience perspective the
human mind but do you have

5488
01:29:33,910 --> 01:29:33,920
human mind but do you have
 

5489
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:36,070
human mind but do you have
hope for it increasing longevity in

5490
01:29:36,070 --> 01:29:36,080
hope for it increasing longevity in
 

5491
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:36,950
hope for it increasing longevity in
terms of

5492
01:29:36,950 --> 01:29:36,960
terms of
 

5493
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:39,430
terms of
how it's used i think that it can help

5494
01:29:39,430 --> 01:29:39,440
how it's used i think that it can help
 

5495
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:40,790
how it's used i think that it can help
with certain diseases

5496
01:29:40,790 --> 01:29:40,800
with certain diseases
 

5497
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,470
with certain diseases
uh but i see at least within our

5498
01:29:42,470 --> 01:29:42,480
uh but i see at least within our
 

5499
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:44,070
uh but i see at least within our
lifetime that's the best use of it is to

5500
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:44,080
lifetime that's the best use of it is to
 

5501
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:46,070
lifetime that's the best use of it is to
be able to replace parts of the body

5502
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:46,080
be able to replace parts of the body
 

5503
01:29:46,080 --> 01:29:46,550
be able to replace parts of the body
that

5504
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:46,560
that
 

5505
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:48,709
that
are not functioning such as the the

5506
01:29:48,709 --> 01:29:48,719
are not functioning such as the the
 

5507
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:50,870
are not functioning such as the the
retina and other parts the visual cortex

5508
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:50,880
retina and other parts the visual cortex
 

5509
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:51,750
retina and other parts the visual cortex
back here

5510
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:51,760
back here
 

5511
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,149
back here
that that's going to be doable in terms

5512
01:29:54,149 --> 01:29:54,159
that that's going to be doable in terms
 

5513
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:55,189
that that's going to be doable in terms
of longevity

5514
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:55,199
of longevity
 

5515
01:29:55,199 --> 01:29:57,110
of longevity
maybe we could put something on the

5516
01:29:57,110 --> 01:29:57,120
maybe we could put something on the
 

5517
01:29:57,120 --> 01:29:58,310
maybe we could put something on the
hypothalamus and

5518
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:58,320
hypothalamus and
 

5519
01:29:58,320 --> 01:29:59,750
hypothalamus and
start secreting those hormones and get

5520
01:29:59,750 --> 01:29:59,760
start secreting those hormones and get
 

5521
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:02,229
start secreting those hormones and get
that back

5522
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:02,239

 

5523
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:04,950

ultimately i think it the best way to

5524
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:04,960
ultimately i think it the best way to
 

5525
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:06,310
ultimately i think it the best way to
preserve the brain

5526
01:30:06,310 --> 01:30:06,320
preserve the brain
 

5527
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:09,430
preserve the brain
uh is going to be to uh

5528
01:30:09,430 --> 01:30:09,440
uh is going to be to uh
 

5529
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:11,910
uh is going to be to uh
record it but also i think it's going to

5530
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:11,920
record it but also i think it's going to
 

5531
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,750
record it but also i think it's going to
require death unfortunately

5532
01:30:13,750 --> 01:30:13,760
require death unfortunately
 

5533
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:17,590
require death unfortunately
to then do very detailed scans even

5534
01:30:17,590 --> 01:30:17,600
to then do very detailed scans even
 

5535
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,430
to then do very detailed scans even
if you have enough time and money atomic

5536
01:30:19,430 --> 01:30:19,440
if you have enough time and money atomic
 

5537
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:21,510
if you have enough time and money atomic
microscopy and rebuild the brain from

5538
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:21,520
microscopy and rebuild the brain from
 

5539
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,390

01:30:25,669 --> 01:30:25,679
rebuild from scratch yeah we are
 

5543
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,270
rebuild from scratch yeah we are
living more and more in the digital

5544
01:30:27,270 --> 01:30:27,280
living more and more in the digital
 

5545

world
 

5547
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:31,110

i wonder if if the scanning is good

5548
01:30:31,110 --> 01:30:31,120
i wonder if if the scanning is good
 

5549
01:30:31,120 --> 01:30:32,950
i wonder if if the scanning is good
enough for the critical things in terms

they're not they're not yeah we're not
we're not close yes but

5560
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:42,960
we're not close yes but
 

5561
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:44,709
we're not close yes but
we've made quite a bit of progress so

5562
01:30:44,709 --> 01:30:44,719
we've made quite a bit of progress so
 

5563
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,070
we've made quite a bit of progress so
it's uh

5564
01:30:46,070 --> 01:30:46,080
it's uh
 

5565
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:48,870
it's uh
if you're um if you're an exponential

5566
01:30:48,870 --> 01:30:48,880
if you're um if you're an exponential
 

5567
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,070
if you're um if you're an exponential

type of person
 

5569
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,030
type of person
yeah well let's dream a little here yes

5570
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:53,040
yeah well let's dream a little here yes
 

5571
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,629
yeah well let's dream a little here yes
the way it would work

5572
01:30:54,629 --> 01:30:54,639
the way it would work
 

5573
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:56,390
the way it would work
that i could see it working is so you

5574
01:30:56,390 --> 01:30:56,400
that i could see it working is so you
 

5575
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:59,270
that i could see it working is so you
take a single cell slice through your

5576
01:30:59,270 --> 01:30:59,280
take a single cell slice through your
 

5577
01:30:59,280 --> 01:31:01,910
take a single cell slice through your
your dead brain and we can now the

5578
01:31:01,910 --> 01:31:01,920
your dead brain and we can now the
 

5579
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,590
your dead brain and we can now the
problem the problem with the engineering

5580
01:31:03,590 --> 01:31:03,600
problem the problem with the engineering
 

5581
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,070
problem the problem with the engineering
aspect is that the engineering is the

01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:07,760
physical aspect of the brain is is
 

5585
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,310
physical aspect of the brain is is
not even half the problem the problem is

01:31:10,310 --> 01:31:10,320
not even half the problem the problem is
 

5587
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,350
not even half the problem the problem is
which genes are

01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:21,910
that will be preserved hopefully for for
a number of decades

brain so you can say okay
 

5623
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,149

we can recreate that but just scanning

5628
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:50,560
we can recreate that but just scanning
 

5629
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:51,750
we can recreate that but just scanning
the brain and looking how the nerves are

5630
01:31:51,750 --> 01:31:51,760
the brain and looking how the nerves are
 

5631
01:31:51,760 --> 01:31:53,030
the brain and looking how the nerves are
touching each other is not going to do

01:31:53,030 --> 01:31:53,040
touching each other is not going to do
 

5633
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:54,790
touching each other is not going to do
it

5634
01:31:54,790 --> 01:31:54,800
it
 

5635
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,950
it
wow okay so you have to scan the full

5636
01:31:56,950 --> 01:31:56,960
wow okay so you have to scan the full
 

5637
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,070
wow okay so you have to scan the full
biology

5638
01:31:58,070 --> 01:31:58,080
biology
 

5639
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,590
biology
the full details and look at the

5640
01:31:59,590 --> 01:31:59,600
the full details and look at the
 

5641
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,590
the full details and look at the
epigenome and the apogenome too yeah

5642
01:32:01,590 --> 01:32:01,600
epigenome and the apogenome too yeah
 

5643
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,030
epigenome and the apogenome too yeah
which genes are on and off

5644
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:03,040
which genes are on and off
 

5645
01:32:03,040 --> 01:32:05,030
which genes are on and off
it's just easier to reset the epigenome

5646
01:32:05,030 --> 01:32:05,040
it's just easier to reset the epigenome
 

5647
01:32:05,040 --> 01:32:06,229
it's just easier to reset the epigenome
and get them to work like they

5648
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
and get them to work like they
 

5649
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,629
and get them to work like they
just use we're doing that now use the

5650
01:32:08,629 --> 01:32:08,639
just use we're doing that now use the
 

5651
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:10,229
just use we're doing that now use the
hardware already have just figure out

5652
01:32:10,229 --> 01:32:10,239
hardware already have just figure out
 

5653
01:32:10,239 --> 01:32:11,189
hardware already have just figure out
how to uh

5654
01:32:11,189 --> 01:32:11,199
how to uh
 

5655
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:14,070
how to uh
make that hardware last longer right

5656
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:14,080
make that hardware last longer right
 

5657
01:32:14,080 --> 01:32:15,590
make that hardware last longer right
ultimately information will be lost

5658
01:32:15,590 --> 01:32:15,600
ultimately information will be lost

01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,390
ultimately information will be lost
even genetic information degrades slowly

5660
01:32:18,390 --> 01:32:18,400
even genetic information degrades slowly

01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:20,070
even genetic information degrades slowly
through mutations so we

5662
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:20,080
through mutations so we
 

5663

immortality is not achievable through

01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:23,990
immortality is not achievable through
that means though i think we could

5666
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:24,000
that means though i think we could
 

5667
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,669
that means though i think we could

okay so we talked about biology

5672
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:31,520
okay so we talked about biology
 

5673
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:33,990
okay so we talked about biology
let's forgive me but let's talk about

let's forgive me but let's talk about

sort of we

a deep fear of death the fact that we

a deep fear of death the fact that we

don't know what's
 

5709
01:33:17,120 --> 01:33:21,030
don't know what's
like we almost don't know what to do

01:33:21,030 --> 01:33:21,040
like we almost don't know what to do

01:33:28,470 --> 01:33:28,480
the way we draw meaning from life seems
 

5717
01:33:28,480 --> 01:33:30,790
the way we draw meaning from life seems
to be grounded in the fact that we exist

5718
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:30,800
to be grounded in the fact that we exist
 

5719
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:33,830
to be grounded in the fact that we exist
and that we some point will not exist is

5720
01:33:33,830 --> 01:33:33,840
and that we some point will not exist is
 

5721
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,270
and that we some point will not exist is
terrifying and so

5722
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:35,280
terrifying and so
 

5723
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:36,870
terrifying and so
we live in an illusion that we're not

we live in an illusion that we're not
 

5725
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,510
we live in an illusion that we're not
going to die and we run from that terror

5726
01:33:39,510 --> 01:33:39,520
going to die and we run from that terror
 

5727
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,669
going to die and we run from that terror

didn't think
 

5775
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:26,950
didn't think
but our brain has evolved the same

5776
01:34:26,950 --> 01:34:26,960
but our brain has evolved the same
 

5777
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:28,870
but our brain has evolved the same

survival aspect
of course we don't want to die but the

5780
01:34:30,790 --> 01:34:30,800
of course we don't want to die but the
 

5781
01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:32,390
of course we don't want to die but the
problem for us unfortunately

5782
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:32,400
problem for us unfortunately

it's a curse and a blessing is that

5784
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:34,000
it's a curse and a blessing is that
 

5785
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:35,990
it's a curse and a blessing is that
we're now conscious we know

we're now conscious we know
 

5787
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,310
we're now conscious we know
that we're going to die most species

5788

that we're going to die most species

that we're going to die most species
that have ever existed don't

5790

that have ever existed don't
 

5791
01:34:40,239 --> 01:34:42,390
that have ever existed don't
that's a burden that's a curse and so

5792
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:42,400
that's a burden that's a curse and so
 

5793
01:34:42,400 --> 01:34:43,510
that's a burden that's a curse and so
what i think's happened is

what i think's happened is

01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,070
what i think's happened is
we've evolved certainly to want to live

we've evolved certainly to want to live
for a long time perhaps

5798
01:34:47,430 --> 01:34:47,440
for a long time perhaps
 

5799
01:34:47,440 --> 01:34:50,229
for a long time perhaps
never want to die but the thought about

5800
01:34:50,229 --> 01:34:50,239
never want to die but the thought about
 

5801
01:34:50,239 --> 01:34:52,070
never want to die but the thought about
dying is so traumatic

5802

dying is so traumatic
 

5803
01:34:52,080 --> 01:34:55,030

01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,040
that there is an innate part of our
 

5805
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,070
that there is an innate part of our
brains and it's probably

5806
01:34:56,070 --> 01:34:56,080
brains and it's probably
 

5807
01:34:56,080 --> 01:35:00,709
brains and it's probably
genetically wired to not think about it

5808
01:35:00,709 --> 01:35:00,719
genetically wired to not think about it
 

5809
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:02,070
genetically wired to not think about it
i really think that's part of being

5810
01:35:02,070 --> 01:35:02,080
i really think that's part of being
 

5811
01:35:02,080 --> 01:35:04,070
i really think that's part of being
human and it because

5812
01:35:04,070 --> 01:35:04,080
human and it because
 

5813
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:05,430
human and it because
you know think about tribes that

5814
01:35:05,430 --> 01:35:05,440
you know think about tribes that
 

5815
01:35:05,440 --> 01:35:07,990
you know think about tribes that
obsessed with longevity every day and

5816
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:08,000
obsessed with longevity every day and
 

5817
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,830
obsessed with longevity every day and
that were going to die they probably

5818
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:09,840
that were going to die they probably
 

5819
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:11,750
that were going to die they probably
didn't make much technological

5820

didn't make much technological
 

5821
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:13,189
didn't make much technological
progress because they were just crying

5822
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:13,199
progress because they were just crying
 

5823
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:15,109
progress because they were just crying
in their hearts every day or you know on

5824
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:15,119
in their hearts every day or you know on

afraid
 

5933
01:37:04,960 --> 01:37:06,870
afraid
that i wouldn't enjoy it as much if i

5934
01:37:06,870 --> 01:37:06,880
that i wouldn't enjoy it as much if i
 

5935
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,109
that i wouldn't enjoy it as much if i
was immortal i'm almost afraid to want

5936
01:37:09,109 --> 01:37:09,119
was immortal i'm almost afraid to want
 

5937
01:37:09,119 --> 01:37:10,229
was immortal i'm almost afraid to want
to be immortal or

5938
01:37:10,229 --> 01:37:10,239
to be immortal or
 

5939
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:16,149
to be immortal or
to live longer because

5940
01:37:16,149 --> 01:37:16,159

 

5941
01:37:16,159 --> 01:37:18,390

it perhaps is a kind of justification

5942
01:37:18,390 --> 01:37:18,400
it perhaps is a kind of justification
 

5943
01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:19,189
it perhaps is a kind of justification
for me to

5944
01:37:19,189 --> 01:37:19,199
for me to
 

5945
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:22,149
for me to
accept that i'm going to die is saying

5946
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:22,159
accept that i'm going to die is saying
 

5947
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:23,750
accept that i'm going to die is saying
like oh if i was immortal i wouldn't be

5948
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:23,760
like oh if i was immortal i wouldn't be
 

5949
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,990
like oh if i was immortal i wouldn't be
able to enjoy life as much as i do

5950
01:37:25,990 --> 01:37:26,000
able to enjoy life as much as i do
 

5951
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,830
able to enjoy life as much as i do
but it's very possible that i wouldn't

5952
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:27,840
but it's very possible that i wouldn't
 

5953
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,229
but it's very possible that i wouldn't
enjoy just as much

5954
01:37:30,229 --> 01:37:30,239
enjoy just as much
 

5955
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:33,109
enjoy just as much
of course enjoying life whether you're

5956
01:37:33,109 --> 01:37:33,119
