that oftentimes you can tell
 

169
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,710
that oftentimes you can tell
what i believe really or what my

170
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:48,720
what i believe really or what my
 

171
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,470
what i believe really or what my
fundamental operating system is

172
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:50,480
fundamental operating system is
 

173
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,390
fundamental operating system is
based on my actions whether i'm aware i

174
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
based on my actions whether i'm aware i
 

175
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,750
based on my actions whether i'm aware i
have an operating system internally

176
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:53,760
have an operating system internally
 

177
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,430
have an operating system internally
whether i'm aware of it or not or

178
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:55,440
whether i'm aware of it or not or
 

179
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,030
whether i'm aware of it or not or
certainly whether i'm fully aware of it

180
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,040
certainly whether i'm fully aware of it
 

181
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,589
certainly whether i'm fully aware of it
so i guess uh when it comes to

182
00:02:59,589 --> 00:02:59,599
so i guess uh when it comes to
 

183
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,910
so i guess uh when it comes to
strategy i try to think about how things

184
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:01,920
strategy i try to think about how things
 

185
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,110
strategy i try to think about how things
interact you mentioned

186
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,120
interact you mentioned
 

187
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,430
interact you mentioned
systems thinking and i try to do my best

188
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:05,440
systems thinking and i try to do my best
 

189
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,509
systems thinking and i try to do my best
to understand how systems exist but i

190
00:03:07,509 --> 00:03:07,519
to understand how systems exist but i
 

191
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,149
to understand how systems exist but i
think that

192
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:08,159
think that
 

193
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,670
think that
systems have a fundamental strength and

194
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:09,680
systems have a fundamental strength and
 

195
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,190
systems have a fundamental strength and
a fundamental weakness

196
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:11,200
a fundamental weakness
 

197
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,910
a fundamental weakness
they work how they work and that's great

198
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:13,920
they work how they work and that's great
 

199
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,630
they work how they work and that's great
but they're

200
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:14,640
but they're
 

201
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,190
but they're
readable so if you are aware if i am

202
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:17,200
readable so if you are aware if i am
 

203
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,190
readable so if you are aware if i am
operating on a system

204
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:19,200
operating on a system
 

205
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,790
operating on a system
of which you're you're not really read

206
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:20,800
of which you're you're not really read
 

207
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,830
of which you're you're not really read
into then i think oftentimes i can seem

208
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:23,840
into then i think oftentimes i can seem
 

209
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,509
into then i think oftentimes i can seem
like

210
00:03:25,509 --> 00:03:25,519
like
 

211
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,509

shockingly effective particularly if my

212
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:27,519
shockingly effective particularly if my
 

213
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,670
shockingly effective particularly if my
system preys on certain weaknesses

214
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:29,680
system preys on certain weaknesses
 

215

so like as an end user i can change some
 

297
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,310
so like as an end user i can change some
of the bells and whistles that have

298
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,320
of the bells and whistles that have
 

299
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,909
of the bells and whistles that have
nothing to do with the underlying source

300

nothing to do with the underlying source
 

301

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,230
um you know i've been around in jiu
jitsu long enough to encounter like a

328
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:12,240
jitsu long enough to encounter like a
 

329
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,469
jitsu long enough to encounter like a
new wave of like good grapplers

330
00:05:14,469 --> 00:05:14,479
new wave of like good grapplers
 

331
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,070
new wave of like good grapplers
and it's very very interesting sometimes

332
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:16,080
and it's very very interesting sometimes
 

333
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,830
and it's very very interesting sometimes
how they're running systems they don't

334
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
how they're running systems they don't
 

335
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:18,950
how they're running systems they don't
realize they're running

336
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:18,960
realize they're running
 

337
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,550
realize they're running
like i'm like oh yeah i trained at

338
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:20,560
like i'm like oh yeah i trained at

you know and a big fan of marcellus was

342
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:24,720
you know and a big fan of marcellus was
 

343
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,469
you know and a big fan of marcellus was
a student there uh

00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:35,039
deep into foot locking and leg attacks
 

353
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,990

understand your system better than you

356
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:39,360
understand your system better than you
 

357
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,230
understand your system better than you
do or i may

358
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,240
do or i may
 

359
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,830
do or i may
and let's say you understand my system

360
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:41,840
and let's say you understand my system
 

361
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,270
and let's say you understand my system
better than i do that would be a huge

362
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:43,280
better than i do that would be a huge
 

363
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,230
better than i do that would be a huge
issue that was something that i

364
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:44,240
issue that was something that i
 

365
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,830
issue that was something that i
encountered a long time ago

366
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:45,840
encountered a long time ago
 

367
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,749

trying to come up in jiu jitsu where i

368
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:47,759
trying to come up in jiu jitsu where i
 

369
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,029
trying to come up in jiu jitsu where i
was trying to utilize

370
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:49,039
was trying to utilize
 

371
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,230
was trying to utilize
systems that were

372
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,240
systems that were
 

373
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,150
systems that were
created by let's say hoffman mendes or

374
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,160
created by let's say hoffman mendes or
 

375
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,749
created by let's say hoffman mendes or
someone else and i'm basically trying to

376
00:05:55,749 --> 00:05:55,759
someone else and i'm basically trying to
 

377
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,430
someone else and i'm basically trying to
do what you're doing i'm just not doing

378
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:57,440
do what you're doing i'm just not doing
 

379
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,189
do what you're doing i'm just not doing
as good of a version of it so not only

380
00:05:59,189 --> 00:05:59,199
as good of a version of it so not only
 

381
00:05:59,199 --> 00:05:59,590
as good of a version of it so not only
am i

382
00:05:59,590 --> 00:05:59,600
am i
 

383
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,189
am i
not doing it well but i'm entirely

384
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:01,199
not doing it well but i'm entirely
 

385
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,189
not doing it well but i'm entirely
predictable and i think that that can be

386
00:06:03,189 --> 00:06:03,199
predictable and i think that that can be
 

387
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,230
predictable and i think that that can be
a big issue so

388
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,240
a big issue so
 

389
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,990
a big issue so
to come back i think of systems a lot of

390
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:06,000
to come back i think of systems a lot of
 

391
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,189
to come back i think of systems a lot of
times now in terms of you know

392
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:07,199
times now in terms of you know
 

393
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,710
times now in terms of you know
particularly like end user type of

394
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:08,720
particularly like end user type of
 

395
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,830
particularly like end user type of
systems like uh

396
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:09,840
systems like uh
 

397
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,590
systems like uh
an iphone is a really really fast way

398
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:11,600
an iphone is a really really fast way
 

399
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,950
an iphone is a really really fast way
for me to be able to do all sorts of

400
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:12,960
for me to be able to do all sorts of
 

401
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,070
for me to be able to do all sorts of
things

402
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:14,080
things
 

403
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,350
things
if you were to take it from me i

404
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:15,360
if you were to take it from me i
 

405
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,189
if you were to take it from me i
couldn't recreate any of that so you

406
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:17,199
couldn't recreate any of that so you
 

407
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,670
couldn't recreate any of that so you
want to be

408
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:17,680
want to be
 

409
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,790
want to be
more the nsa unless the end user exactly

410
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:20,800
more the nsa unless the end user exactly
 

411
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,309
more the nsa unless the end user exactly
exactly that way that way i'm listening

412
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:22,319
exactly that way that way i'm listening
 

413
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,270
exactly that way that way i'm listening
i'm going to be the idol

414
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,280
i'm going to be the idol
 

415
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,550
i'm going to be the idol
of combat that's right we're watching

416
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:24,560
of combat that's right we're watching
 

417
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,950
of combat that's right we're watching
you p but basically

418
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:26,960
you p but basically
 

419
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,390
you p but basically
you know it's uh i guess what i would

420
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
you know it's uh i guess what i would
 

421
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,629
you know it's uh i guess what i would
what i would come back and say is uh

422
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:30,639
what i would come back and say is uh
 

423
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,230
what i would come back and say is uh
if you understand how things interact on

424
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:32,240
if you understand how things interact on
 

425
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,309
if you understand how things interact on
a fundamental level and what type of

426
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:34,319
a fundamental level and what type of
 

427
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,110
a fundamental level and what type of
games exist

428
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,120
games exist
 

429
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,710
games exist
and what type of interactions is this

430
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:36,720
and what type of interactions is this
 

431
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,110
and what type of interactions is this
then you can transcend a lot of the uh

432
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:39,120
then you can transcend a lot of the uh
 

433
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,870
then you can transcend a lot of the uh
the systems it's almost like a cook

434
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:40,880
the systems it's almost like a cook
 

435
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,710
the systems it's almost like a cook
versus if i can make certain things in

436
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
versus if i can make certain things in
 

437
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,749
versus if i can make certain things in
the kitchen i can

438
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
the kitchen i can
 

439
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,830
the kitchen i can
but i am not a chef you could give me a

440
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:45,840
but i am not a chef you could give me a
 

441
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,749
but i am not a chef you could give me a
bunch of ingredients and i

442
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:47,759
bunch of ingredients and i
 

443
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,749
bunch of ingredients and i
could probably cook not well but a

444
00:06:49,749 --> 00:06:49,759
could probably cook not well but a
 

445
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,270
could probably cook not well but a
couple of different things

446
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:51,280
couple of different things
 

447
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,150
couple of different things
but a master chef you know would be

448
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:54,160
but a master chef you know would be
 

449
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,990
but a master chef you know would be
aware of the implications of all of the

you know what you're doing with various
 

461
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,749
you know what you're doing with various
things and also they could make they

things and also they could make they
 

463
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,950
things and also they could make they
could turn all of these ingredients into

464
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
could turn all of these ingredients into
 

465
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,909
could turn all of these ingredients into
chinese food they could turn all these

466
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:07,919
chinese food they could turn all these
 

467
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,110
chinese food they could turn all these
ingredients into italian food and they

468

ingredients into italian food and they
 

469
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,990

into chicken parmesan or it could turn
 

475
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,909
into chicken parmesan or it could turn
into lasagna but

476
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:13,919
into lasagna but
 

477
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,990
into lasagna but
they're not limited to a specific thing

so to come back let's take rock paper

486
00:07:23,029 --> 00:07:23,039
so to come back let's take rock paper

yeah yeah i win yeah so even though i'm
 

757
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,949
yeah yeah i win yeah so even though i'm
asking the questions it's not impossible

758
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:42,959
asking the questions it's not impossible
 

759
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,030
asking the questions it's not impossible
that i arrive at a good outcome for me

760
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,040
that i arrive at a good outcome for me
 

761
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,949
that i arrive at a good outcome for me
but it's it's no longer guaranteed i

762
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:46,959
but it's it's no longer guaranteed i
 

763
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,550
but it's it's no longer guaranteed i
went from a situation where i literally

764
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:48,560
went from a situation where i literally
 

765
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,590
went from a situation where i literally
can't lose

766
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:49,600
can't lose
 

767
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,750
can't lose
yeah it's pretty low probability right

768
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:51,760
yeah it's pretty low probability right
 

769
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,030
yeah it's pretty low probability right
super low probability

770
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
super low probability
 

771
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,470
super low probability
and the second you realize what i'm

772
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:54,480
and the second you realize what i'm
 

773
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,150
and the second you realize what i'm
doing you would never let me win

774
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,160
doing you would never let me win
 

775
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,069
doing you would never let me win
because the ball is truly in your court

776
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
because the ball is truly in your court
 

777
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,150
because the ball is truly in your court
so i guess that that's kind of what i'm

778
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:00,160
so i guess that that's kind of what i'm
 

779
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,949
so i guess that that's kind of what i'm
fundamentally trying to put into play

780
00:12:02,949 --> 00:12:02,959
fundamentally trying to put into play

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,829
so i don't know if you know sort of the
more mathematical discipline of game

812
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
more mathematical discipline of game
 

813
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:36,629
more mathematical discipline of game
theory

814
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:36,639
theory
 

815
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,829
theory
there's something called mechanism

816
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:37,839
there's something called mechanism
 

817
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,790
there's something called mechanism
design so game theory is this

818
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:40,800
design so game theory is this
 

819
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,150
design so game theory is this
field where you model some kind of

820
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,160
field where you model some kind of
 

821
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,069
field where you model some kind of
interaction between human beings

822
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:46,079
interaction between human beings
 

823
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,470
interaction between human beings
you can model grappling that way you can

824
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:48,480
you can model grappling that way you can
 

825
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,269
you can model grappling that way you can
uh

826
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:49,279
uh
 

827
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,110
uh
model nuclear conflict between nations

828
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,120
model nuclear conflict between nations
 

829
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,509
model nuclear conflict between nations
that way and

830
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:53,519
that way and
 

831
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,990
that way and
you set up a set of rules and incentives

832
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:56,000
you set up a set of rules and incentives
 

833
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,269
you set up a set of rules and incentives
and then use

834
00:12:57,269 --> 00:12:57,279
and then use
 

835
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,110
and then use
math to predict uh what is the likely

836
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,120
math to predict uh what is the likely
 

837
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,389
math to predict uh what is the likely
outcome

838
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:02,399
outcome
 

839
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,310
outcome
depending over time based on the

840
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:04,320
depending over time based on the
 

841
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,150
depending over time based on the
interaction given those rules

842
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:06,160
interaction given those rules
 

843
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,509
interaction given those rules
mechanism design is the design of games

844
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
mechanism design is the design of games
 

845
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,190
mechanism design is the design of games
so like the design of systems that

846
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:15,200
so like the design of systems that
 

847
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,389
so like the design of systems that
are likely to lead to a certain outcome

848
00:13:18,389 --> 00:13:18,399
are likely to lead to a certain outcome
 

849
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,110
are likely to lead to a certain outcome
and so what you're suggesting is you

850
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:21,120
and so what you're suggesting is you
 

851
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,389
and so what you're suggesting is you
want to

852
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:22,399
want to
 

853
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,990
want to
create you want to discover systems

854
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:26,000
create you want to discover systems
 

855
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,150
create you want to discover systems
whose decision tree all the possible

856
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,160
whose decision tree all the possible
 

857
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,590
whose decision tree all the possible
things that could happen

858
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:29,600
things that could happen
 

859
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,509
things that could happen
feel like there's choice being made but

860
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:33,519
feel like there's choice being made but
 

861
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,389
feel like there's choice being made but
ultimately one of the parties doesn't

862
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:36,399
ultimately one of the parties doesn't
 

863
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:36,710
ultimately one of the parties doesn't
have

864
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:36,720
have
 

865
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,949
have
any choice in what the actual final

866
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
any choice in what the actual final
 

867
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,069
any choice in what the actual final
outcome is

868
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:40,079
outcome is
 

869
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,550
outcome is
uh you're making them feel like they're

870
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:42,560
uh you're making them feel like they're
 

871
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,710
uh you're making them feel like they're
playing a game too so it's not like

872
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:44,720
playing a game too so it's not like
 

873
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,189
playing a game too so it's not like
you don't feel trapped it's kind of like

874
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:47,199
you don't feel trapped it's kind of like
 

875
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:49,030
you don't feel trapped it's kind of like
well the best traps

876
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,040
well the best traps
 

877
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,710
well the best traps
i don't you don't look very threatening

878
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:50,720
i don't you don't look very threatening
 

879
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,710
i don't you don't look very threatening
so i'm like oh i'll walk over there

880
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,720
so i'm like oh i'll walk over there
 

881
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,269
so i'm like oh i'll walk over there
i guess wouldn't that i guess that's

882
00:13:55,269 --> 00:13:55,279
i guess wouldn't that i guess that's
 

883
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:57,189
i guess wouldn't that i guess that's
kind of an interesting thing if a lion

884
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:57,199
kind of an interesting thing if a lion
 

885
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,189
kind of an interesting thing if a lion
when is a lion roar it's an interesting

886
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,199
when is a lion roar it's an interesting
 

887
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,430
when is a lion roar it's an interesting
thing when you watch like lions hunting

888
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
thing when you watch like lions hunting
 

889
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,829
thing when you watch like lions hunting
don't roar when they hunt they want to

890
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:03,839
don't roar when they hunt they want to
 

891
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,110
don't roar when they hunt they want to
when they want to move you back

892
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,120
when they want to move you back
 

893
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,470
when they want to move you back
they do stuff like that when they

894
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:06,480
they do stuff like that when they
 

895
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,150
they do stuff like that when they
actually want to come and get you

896
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:08,160
actually want to come and get you
 

897
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,750
actually want to come and get you
they're pretty slinky it's like

898
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:09,760
they're pretty slinky it's like
 

899
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,150
they're pretty slinky it's like
water covered it's like furry water yeah

900
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,160
water covered it's like furry water yeah
 

901
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,509
water covered it's like furry water yeah
and and i guess like

902
00:14:13,509 --> 00:14:13,519
and and i guess like
 

903
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,110
and and i guess like
when you keep that in mind um it's funny

904
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,120
when you keep that in mind um it's funny
 

905
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,430
when you keep that in mind um it's funny
how

906
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:17,440
how
 

907
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,949
how
like a frosted hobby actually a

908
00:14:18,949 --> 00:14:18,959
like a frosted hobby actually a
 

909
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,870
like a frosted hobby actually a
brilliant guy like one of my mma coaches

910
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:20,880
brilliant guy like one of my mma coaches
 

911
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,389
brilliant guy like one of my mma coaches
and head coach at tristar

912
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:22,399
and head coach at tristar
 

913
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,829
and head coach at tristar
um he brought this up one time i thought

914
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:23,839
um he brought this up one time i thought
 

915
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,110
um he brought this up one time i thought
it was a really salient point he said

916
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:25,120
it was a really salient point he said
 

917
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,310
it was a really salient point he said
let's say we have a million

918
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
let's say we have a million
 

919
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,949
let's say we have a million
person bracket impossibly huge like

920
00:14:28,949 --> 00:14:28,959
person bracket impossibly huge like
 

921
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,550
person bracket impossibly huge like
frank dukes went in the kumite level

922
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:30,560
frank dukes went in the kumite level
 

923
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,829
frank dukes went in the kumite level
huge bracket

924

he claimed to knock out like 250

926
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:34,000
he claimed to knock out like 250
 

927
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,509
he claimed to knock out like 250
consecutive people and you're like that

928
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:35,519
consecutive people and you're like that
 

929
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,470
consecutive people and you're like that
is

930
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:36,480
is
 

931
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,949
is
all of hong kong was in that thing and

932
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:38,959
all of hong kong was in that thing and
 

933
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,310
all of hong kong was in that thing and
everyone kept their mouth shut

934
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,320
everyone kept their mouth shut
 

935
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,150
everyone kept their mouth shut
but anyway that's pretty cool but uh

936
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:42,160
but anyway that's pretty cool but uh
 

937
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,230
but anyway that's pretty cool but uh
it's a comeback a little improbable

938
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:44,240
it's a comeback a little improbable
 

939
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,870
it's a comeback a little improbable
pretty cool

940
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
pretty cool
 

941
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,790
pretty cool
um so let's say for instance like

942
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:46,800
um so let's say for instance like
 

943
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,910
um so let's say for instance like
there's no cheating going on

944
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:47,920
there's no cheating going on
 

945

there's no cheating going on
no cheating going on and we're flipping

00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:49,199
no cheating going on and we're flipping
 

947
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,030
no cheating going on and we're flipping
coins right

948
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,040
coins right
 

949
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,790

975
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,470
it
i'm good at this yeah that would be

976
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
i'm good at this yeah that would be
 

977
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,150
i'm good at this yeah that would be
tempting as a person to to do you're

978
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,160
tempting as a person to to do you're
 

979
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,670
tempting as a person to to do you're
like well i'm a lucky guy

980
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:21,680
like well i'm a lucky guy
 

981
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,910
like well i'm a lucky guy
oh yeah are you sure maybe i mean maybe

982
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:23,920
oh yeah are you sure maybe i mean maybe
 

983
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,189
oh yeah are you sure maybe i mean maybe
effectively you are we could argue they

984
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:25,199
effectively you are we could argue they
 

985
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:26,389
effectively you are we could argue they
effectively are incredibly lucky but

986
00:15:26,389 --> 00:15:26,399
effectively are incredibly lucky but
 

987
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,030
effectively are incredibly lucky but
basically

988
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
basically
 

989
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,550
basically
is that an actual ability it's like a

990
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:28,560
is that an actual ability it's like a
 

991
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,829
is that an actual ability it's like a
perk in a video game or is that just

992
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
perk in a video game or is that just
 

993
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,030
perk in a video game or is that just
this thing that happened

994
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:31,040
this thing that happened
 

995
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,629
this thing that happened
so anyway uh how many times are someone

996
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
so anyway uh how many times are someone
 

997
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,470
so anyway uh how many times are someone
you could go through an entire career

998
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
you could go through an entire career
 

999
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,629
you could go through an entire career
you know particularly in a fights board

1000
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:38,639
you know particularly in a fights board
 

1001
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,389
you know particularly in a fights board
well let's say you get 15 knockouts in

1002
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
well let's say you get 15 knockouts in
 

1003
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,310
well let's say you get 15 knockouts in
15 toss-up scenarios because you see

1004
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:42,320
15 toss-up scenarios because you see
 

1005
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,509
15 toss-up scenarios because you see
that happening all the time in the fight

1006
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:43,519
that happening all the time in the fight
 

1007
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,870
that happening all the time in the fight
game a toss-up scenario it's not like

1008
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:44,880
game a toss-up scenario it's not like
 

1009
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,710
game a toss-up scenario it's not like
you're mounted on me and like and

1010
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:46,720
you're mounted on me and like and
 

1011
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,710
you're mounted on me and like and
that's not a toss-up scenario many many

1012
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:48,720
that's not a toss-up scenario many many
 

1013
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,389
that's not a toss-up scenario many many
many many many striking centers a lot of

1014
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:50,399
many many many striking centers a lot of
 

1015
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,030
many many many striking centers a lot of
grappling with

1016
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,040
grappling with
 

1017
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,870
grappling with
tons of striking scenarios are dead toss

1018
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
tons of striking scenarios are dead toss
 

1019
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,350
tons of striking scenarios are dead toss
toss-ups and uh

1020
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:55,360
toss-ups and uh
 

1021
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,790
toss-ups and uh
somebody wins by knockout they win five

1022
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:56,800
somebody wins by knockout they win five
 

1023
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,069
somebody wins by knockout they win five
times in a row then they lose a couple

1024
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:58,079
times in a row then they lose a couple
 

1025
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,509
times in a row then they lose a couple
times in a row and we go what happened

1026
00:15:59,509 --> 00:15:59,519
times in a row and we go what happened
 

1027
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,230
times in a row and we go what happened
you're like what do you mean what

1028
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:00,240
you're like what do you mean what
 

1029
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,189
you're like what do you mean what
happened they were always flipping the

1030
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
happened they were always flipping the
 

1031
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:01,590
happened they were always flipping the
coin

1032
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
coin
 

1033
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,110
coin
and then they win five more they go ah

1034
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:03,120
and then they win five more they go ah
 

1035
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,949
and then they win five more they go ah
back on track can you imagine that

1036
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:04,959
back on track can you imagine that
 

1037
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:05,990
back on track can you imagine that
you're flipping a coin on like heads

1038
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,000
you're flipping a coin on like heads
 

1039
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,310
you're flipping a coin on like heads
heads heads heads tails what

1040
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:08,320
heads heads heads tails what
 

1041
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,389
heads heads heads tails what
tails those heads again oh man i'm back

1042
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:10,399
tails those heads again oh man i'm back
 

1043
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,670
tails those heads again oh man i'm back
on it i'm flipping good now

1044
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:11,680
on it i'm flipping good now
 

1045
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,749
on it i'm flipping good now
that's basically what's going on i think

1046
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
that's basically what's going on i think
 

1047
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,670
that's basically what's going on i think
the vast majority of the time and then

1048
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:15,680
the vast majority of the time and then
 

1049
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,670
the vast majority of the time and then
humanity's you know tendency to see a

1050
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
humanity's you know tendency to see a
 

1051
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,350
humanity's you know tendency to see a
sign in almost anything

1052
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
sign in almost anything
 

1053
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,590
sign in almost anything
you know it starts to present itself and

1054
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:21,600
you know it starts to present itself and
 

1055
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,509
you know it starts to present itself and
then we build a narrative in our mind to

1056
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:23,519
then we build a narrative in our mind to
 

1057
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,269
then we build a narrative in our mind to
imp to convince ourselves that we're in

1058
00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:25,279
imp to convince ourselves that we're in
 

1059
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,870
imp to convince ourselves that we're in
some sort of control when in reality

1060
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:26,880
some sort of control when in reality
 

1061
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,829
some sort of control when in reality
i was in a marginal situation at best

1062
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:29,839
i was in a marginal situation at best
 

1063
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,509
i was in a marginal situation at best
the whole time yeah without having much

1064
00:16:31,509 --> 00:16:31,519
the whole time yeah without having much
 

1065
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,710
the whole time yeah without having much
control without having a deep

1066
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:32,720
control without having a deep
 

1067
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,150
control without having a deep
understanding of the system the same

1068
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,160
understanding of the system the same
 

1069
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,230
understanding of the system the same
story is told the stock market with many

1070
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
story is told the stock market with many
 

1071
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:36,870
story is told the stock market with many
of the human

1072
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:36,880
of the human
 

1073
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,269
of the human
these distributed human systems we start

1074
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:39,279
these distributed human systems we start
 

1075
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,389
these distributed human systems we start
telling narratives

1076
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:40,399
telling narratives
 

1077
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,829
telling narratives
and start seeing patterns without

1078
00:16:41,829 --> 00:16:41,839
and start seeing patterns without
 

1079
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,430
and start seeing patterns without
understanding actually

1080
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:43,440
understanding actually
 

1081
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,870
understanding actually
the system that's generating these

1082
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:44,880
the system that's generating these
 

1083
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,470
the system that's generating these
patterns so if we can see the system

1084
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
patterns so if we can see the system
 

1085
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,069
patterns so if we can see the system
that's incredibly valuable but then you

1086
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:48,079
that's incredibly valuable but then you
 

1087
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,990
that's incredibly valuable but then you
go well what system is above all of the

1088
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
go well what system is above all of the
 

1089
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,949
go well what system is above all of the
systems i guess

1090
00:16:50,949 --> 00:16:50,959
systems i guess
 

1091
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,550
systems i guess
maybe physics maybe it's not like game

1092
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
maybe physics maybe it's not like game
 

1093
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,990
maybe physics maybe it's not like game
theory explains these things but like

1094
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:54,000
theory explains these things but like
 

1095
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,910
theory explains these things but like
i guess what are the what aspects of the

1096
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:55,920
i guess what are the what aspects of the
 

1097
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,670
i guess what are the what aspects of the
system can i can i put my hands on that

at least many of us would argue that at
 

3173
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,069
at least many of us would argue that at
least whether whether there's some sort

3174
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:04,079
least whether whether there's some sort
 

3175
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,510
least whether whether there's some sort
of internal driver that

3176
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:05,520
of internal driver that
 

3177
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,309
of internal driver that
allows for that yeah like we live in a

3178
00:46:08,309 --> 00:46:08,319
allows for that yeah like we live in a
 

3179
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:10,069
allows for that yeah like we live in a
material world your actions do affect

i can choose to pick that water up or
not and anyway uh

00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:14,960
not and anyway uh
 

3187
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,270
not and anyway uh
i would say i believe strongly in the

i would say i believe strongly in the
 

3189
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,470
i would say i believe strongly in the
idea of

3190
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:18,480
idea of
 

3191
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,510
idea of
picking facilitative beliefs um you know

3192
00:46:21,510 --> 00:46:21,520
picking facilitative beliefs um you know
 

3193
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:21,910
picking facilitative beliefs um you know
and

3194
00:46:21,910 --> 00:46:21,920
and
 

3195
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,470
and
going hey i will adjust whether this

3196
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:24,480
going hey i will adjust whether this
 

3197
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,990
going hey i will adjust whether this
belief system is right or wrong on a

3198
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:26,000
belief system is right or wrong on a
 

3199
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,670
belief system is right or wrong on a
cosmic level i'm nowhere near smart

3200
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:27,680
cosmic level i'm nowhere near smart
 

3201
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:28,870
cosmic level i'm nowhere near smart
enough to understand

3202
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:28,880
enough to understand
 

3203
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,470
enough to understand
but i can say me deciding that

3204
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:32,480
but i can say me deciding that
 

3205
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:33,589
but i can say me deciding that
let's say for instance i'm going to walk

3206
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:33,599
let's say for instance i'm going to walk
 

3207
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:34,950
let's say for instance i'm going to walk
over to have a conversation with someone

3208
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:34,960
over to have a conversation with someone
 

3209
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,470
over to have a conversation with someone
in the hotel lobby and they've

3210
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:36,480
in the hotel lobby and they've
 

3211
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,870
in the hotel lobby and they've
never met them and i go over and i start

3212
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:38,880
never met them and i go over and i start
 

3213
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,470
never met them and i go over and i start
with oh this is going to be interesting

3214
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:40,480
with oh this is going to be interesting
 

3215
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,069
with oh this is going to be interesting
and i just walk over there

3216
00:46:42,069 --> 00:46:42,079
and i just walk over there
 

3217
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,990
and i just walk over there
versus in my head i'm like what's this

3218
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:44,000
versus in my head i'm like what's this
 

3219
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,349
versus in my head i'm like what's this
[\h__\h] want

3220
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:45,359

00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:46,560
we're about to have two very different
 

3223
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,630
we're about to have two very different
conversations i could be right that this

3224
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:48,640
conversations i could be right that this
 

3225
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,710
conversations i could be right that this
person is not very polite or

3226
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:50,720
person is not very polite or
 

3227

thinks negatively of me right from go
 

3229
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,069
thinks negatively of me right from go
but i think that

3230
00:46:54,069 --> 00:46:54,079
but i think that
 

3231
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,750
but i think that
that's probably not a facility to

3232
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:55,760
that's probably not a facility to
 

3233
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,270
that's probably not a facility to
believe people talk about

3234
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:57,280
believe people talk about
 

3235
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,910
believe people talk about
i'm how is that going to help me

3236
00:46:59,910 --> 00:46:59,920
i'm how is that going to help me
 

3237
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,750
i'm how is that going to help me
navigate the conversation to a positive

navigate the conversation to a positive
 

3239
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,510
navigate the conversation to a positive
conclusion and i think about that for

3240
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:03,520
conclusion and i think about that for
 

3241
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:06,470
conclusion and i think about that for
uh um you know let's say fighting it's a

3242
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:06,480
uh um you know let's say fighting it's a
 

3243
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,349
uh um you know let's say fighting it's a
good example like

3244
00:47:07,349 --> 00:47:07,359
good example like
 

3245
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:08,790
good example like
confidence plenty of people believe

guarantee you a positive outcome but i

3258
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:19,119
guarantee you a positive outcome but i
 

3259
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:19,829
guarantee you a positive outcome but i
would say

3260
00:47:19,829 --> 00:47:19,839
would say
 

3261
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,390
would say
it most of us would probably most of us

3262
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:22,400
it most of us would probably most of us
 

3263
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,750
it most of us would probably most of us
would argue that it helps

3264
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:23,760
would argue that it helps
 

3265
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,190
would argue that it helps
and you think about depression what's

3266
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:25,200
and you think about depression what's
 

3267
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,790
and you think about depression what's
depression if not a

3268
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:26,800
depression if not a
 

3269
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,069
depression if not a
a negative unfacilitative belief that is

3270
00:47:30,069 --> 00:47:30,079
a negative unfacilitative belief that is
 

3271
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:30,470
a negative unfacilitative belief that is
not

3272
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:30,480
not
 

3273
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,790
not
always that oftentimes is not reflected

3274
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:32,800
always that oftentimes is not reflected
 

3275
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,829
always that oftentimes is not reflected
by reality

3276
00:47:33,829 --> 00:47:33,839
by reality
 

3277
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,750
by reality
but you project it on to reality and

3278
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:35,760
but you project it on to reality and
 

3279
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,270
but you project it on to reality and
it's understandable if it makes you feel

3280
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:37,280
it's understandable if it makes you feel
 

3281
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,790
it's understandable if it makes you feel
like oh man this isn't going to work out

3282
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:38,800
like oh man this isn't going to work out
 

3283
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,150
like oh man this isn't going to work out
i don't think the prospects are going

3284
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:40,160
i don't think the prospects are going
 

3285
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:40,630
i don't think the prospects are going
well

3286
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:40,640
well
 

3287
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:41,990
well
and then if you feel like you can't get

3288
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:42,000
and then if you feel like you can't get
 

3289
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,670
and then if you feel like you can't get
out of that loop that seems

3290
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:43,680
out of that loop that seems
 

3291
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,349
out of that loop that seems
pretty rough and i see a lot of things

3292
00:47:45,349 --> 00:47:45,359
pretty rough and i see a lot of things
 

3293
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:46,710
pretty rough and i see a lot of things
out in society right now where you go

3294
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:46,720
out in society right now where you go
 

3295
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,390
out in society right now where you go
whether whether you agree or disagree

3296
00:47:48,390 --> 00:47:48,400
whether whether you agree or disagree
 

3297
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,069
whether whether you agree or disagree
with various positions on things you go

3298
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:50,079
with various positions on things you go
 

3299
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,670
with various positions on things you go
is that a facilitated belief even if

3300
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:51,680
is that a facilitated belief even if
 

3301
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,790
is that a facilitated belief even if
that is true

3302
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:52,800
that is true
 

3303
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,069
that is true
which is arguable anything so what next

3304
00:47:56,069 --> 00:47:56,079
which is arguable anything so what next
 

3305
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:57,829
which is arguable anything so what next
man so what where does this end one one

3306
00:47:57,829 --> 00:47:57,839
man so what where does this end one one
 

3307
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:58,950
man so what where does this end one one
is the positive

3308
00:47:58,950 --> 00:47:58,960
is the positive
 

3309
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,470
is the positive
what's the happy ending here and if they

3310
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:00,480
what's the happy ending here and if they
 

3311
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,390
what's the happy ending here and if they
go well there is no happiness like okay

3312
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:02,400
go well there is no happiness like okay
 

3313
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,030
go well there is no happiness like okay
so so now what so what do we do here and

3314
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:05,040
so so now what so what do we do here and
 

3315
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,069
so so now what so what do we do here and
i guess uh

3316
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:06,079
i guess uh
 

3317
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,270
i guess uh
so choose the facilitative belief and uh

3318
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:09,280
so choose the facilitative belief and uh
 

3319
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:11,750
so choose the facilitative belief and uh
in your intuition believing that free

3320
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
in your intuition believing that free
 

3321
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,349
in your intuition believing that free
will is real

3322
00:48:13,349 --> 00:48:13,359
will is real
 

3323
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,470
will is real
is uh is more productive for a

3324
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
is uh is more productive for a
 

3325
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,349
is uh is more productive for a
successful life

3326
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:17,359
successful life
 

3327
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:19,270

well no that's exactly the point you but
 

3343
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:36,549
well no that's exactly the point you but
at the surface level what you're saying

3344
00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:36,559
at the surface level what you're saying
 

3345
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:38,549
at the surface level what you're saying
is true but perhaps if we

3346
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:38,559
is true but perhaps if we
 

3347
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,190
is true but perhaps if we
truly internalize that free will as an

we'll start to figure out something that

3352
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:43,920
we'll start to figure out something that
 

3353
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:45,510
we'll start to figure out something that
uh

3354
00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:45,520
uh
 

3355
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,430
uh
that transforms the way we see society

3356
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:47,440
that transforms the way we see society
 

3357
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,870
that transforms the way we see society
for example

3358
00:48:48,870 --> 00:48:48,880
for example
 

3359
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,069
for example
we are very individual centric so

3360
00:48:52,069 --> 00:48:52,079
we are very individual centric so
 

3361

we are very individual centric so
uh believing that free will is real

3362
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:55,920
uh believing that free will is real
 

3363
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,829
uh believing that free will is real
puts a lot of responsibility and blame

00:48:57,829 --> 00:48:57,839
puts a lot of responsibility and blame
 

3365
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,349
puts a lot of responsibility and blame
on people when they

3366

on people when they
 

3367
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:02,950
on people when they
do something bad maybe if we

3368
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:02,960

00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:06,960
illusion we start to think about the
 

3373
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,910
illusion we start to think about the
system of

3374
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:07,920

i don't know what that looks like but

3398
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:33,359
i don't know what that looks like but
 

3399
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:35,270
i don't know what that looks like but
it's almost like as opposed to focusing

3400
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
it's almost like as opposed to focusing
 

3401
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,510
it's almost like as opposed to focusing
on the individual ants of an ant colony

3402
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:37,520
on the individual ants of an ant colony
 

3403
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,430
on the individual ants of an ant colony
looking at the entirety of the ant

3404
00:49:39,430 --> 00:49:39,440
looking at the entirety of the ant

to that i think it makes perfect sense i

3408
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:42,400
to that i think it makes perfect sense i
 

3409
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,670
to that i think it makes perfect sense i
would just say that that's a reasonable

3410
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:43,680
would just say that that's a reasonable
 

3411
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,630
would just say that that's a reasonable
thing to suggest

3412
00:49:44,630 --> 00:49:44,640
thing to suggest
 

3413
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,710
thing to suggest
it's a seismic shift right and it's hard

3414
00:49:46,710 --> 00:49:46,720
it's a seismic shift right and it's hard
 

3415
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,990
it's a seismic shift right and it's hard
to say whether that would be

3416
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:48,000
to say whether that would be
 

3417
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,510
to say whether that would be
you know better or worse but i guess

3418
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
you know better or worse but i guess
 

3419
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,349
you know better or worse but i guess
i'll use this as a this is a convenient

you know for good and
 

3593
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,230
you know for good and
for other um probably i guess and

3594
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:24,240
for other um probably i guess and
 

3595
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:25,670
for other um probably i guess and
basically uh

3596
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:25,680
basically uh
 

3597
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:28,630
basically uh
but hey it all worked out right so that

3598
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:28,640
but hey it all worked out right so that
 

3599
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,150
but hey it all worked out right so that
that's probably not something that would

3600
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:30,160
that's probably not something that would
 

3601
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,270
that's probably not something that would
fly and and i think

3602
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,280
fly and and i think
 

3603
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,750
fly and and i think
that's a fair thing that's interesting

3604
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:33,760
that's a fair thing that's interesting
 

3605
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,030
that's a fair thing that's interesting
it might not fly from the individual

it might not fly from the individual
 

3607
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,349
it might not fly from the individual
perspective but if you zoom out

beautifully complex system
 

3615
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:47,109
beautifully complex system
like we kind of from from the individual

3624
00:52:54,790 --> 00:52:54,800
but in whole progress of societies
 

3625
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,549
but in whole progress of societies
but if you accept that this is just a

but if you accept that this is just a
 

3627
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:58,069
but if you accept that this is just a
complex system that's not necessarily

3628
00:52:58,069 --> 00:52:58,079
complex system that's not necessarily

river
 

3635
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,030
river
it's just flowing i think that removes

3636
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
it's just flowing i think that removes
 

3637
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:05,910
it's just flowing i think that removes
the burden

3638
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:05,920
the burden
 

3639
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,630
the burden
of always striving of always trying and

3640
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:08,640
of always striving of always trying and
 

3641
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,630
of always striving of always trying and
always like the struggle and so on

3642
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:10,640
always like the struggle and so on
 

3643
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,030
always like the struggle and so on
so it's possible that if we have no

3644
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:13,040
so it's possible that if we have no
 

3645
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,430
so it's possible that if we have no
control you can like arrive at some kind

3646
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:15,440
control you can like arrive at some kind
 

3647
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:15,910
control you can like arrive at some kind
of other

3648
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:15,920
of other
 

3649
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,069
of other
zen state does that sound very human

zen state does that sound very human
 

3651
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,589
zen state does that sound very human
though that's that's

3652
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:19,599
though that's that's
 

3653
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,910
though that's that's
that's that goes against i think

00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,710
to me that if you want to make a change
uh the burden of proof

uh the burden of proof
 

3741
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,390
uh the burden of proof
is is on the person implying that there

3742

is is on the person implying that there
 

3743
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,990
is is on the person implying that there
needs to be a change yeah and

3744
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,000
needs to be a change yeah and
 

3745
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,430
needs to be a change yeah and
it doesn't mean that there's nothing

3746
00:54:49,430 --> 00:54:49,440
it doesn't mean that there's nothing
 

3747

it doesn't mean that there's nothing
there but it's like if you want to

3748
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:50,640
there but it's like if you want to
 

3749

3803
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,150
as and it makes sense to me it's
basically uh

3804

high bar to prove and also like an

incredibly dangerous idea
 

3859
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:29,670
incredibly dangerous idea
because it always comes back to who's

more or less do no harm and i guess

more or less do no harm and i guess
 

3925
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,390
more or less do no harm and i guess
that's one of the ones anytime i'm

that's one of the ones anytime i'm
 

3927
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,630
that's one of the ones anytime i'm
trying to tell other people what to do

i better hope i'm right and it's bizarre

3930
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:28,640
i better hope i'm right and it's bizarre
 

3931
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,470
i better hope i'm right and it's bizarre
to me how many people are so confident

3932
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:30,480
to me how many people are so confident
 

3933
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:30,870
to me how many people are so confident
that

3934
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:30,880
that
 

3935
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,870
that
their side or their position is the one

3936
00:57:32,870 --> 00:57:32,880
their side or their position is the one
 

3937
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:34,549
their side or their position is the one
that's not only right for them but right

3938
00:57:34,549 --> 00:57:34,559
that's not only right for them but right
 

3939
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,990
that's not only right for them but right
enough that they can enforce it on

3940
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:36,000
enough that they can enforce it on
 

3941
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,670
enough that they can enforce it on
others and that just seems incredibly

3942
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:37,680
others and that just seems incredibly
 

3943
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,630
others and that just seems incredibly
dangerous to me

3944
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:38,640
dangerous to me
 

3945
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:40,230
dangerous to me
and i guess that comes back to even

3946
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:40,240
and i guess that comes back to even
 

3947
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,630
and i guess that comes back to even
sam's point about oh we want to

3948
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:42,640
sam's point about oh we want to
 

3949
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,950
sam's point about oh we want to
if under trying to spread the idea that

if under trying to spread the idea that
 

3951
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,549
if under trying to spread the idea that
free will doesn't exist i'm not saying

3952
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:46,559
free will doesn't exist i'm not saying
 

3953
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,309
free will doesn't exist i'm not saying
it's damaging but it very well may be

3954
00:57:48,309 --> 00:57:48,319
it's damaging but it very well may be
 

3955
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,670
it's damaging but it very well may be
and plenty of other things could be as

3956
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
and plenty of other things could be as
 

3957
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,589
and plenty of other things could be as
well i'm not you know it goes way over

3958
00:57:51,589 --> 00:57:51,599
well i'm not you know it goes way over
 

3959
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:53,109
well i'm not you know it goes way over
my head as to you know the implications

3960
00:57:53,109 --> 00:57:53,119
my head as to you know the implications
 

3961
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,390
my head as to you know the implications
of all of these and i guess all of us

3962
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:54,400
of all of these and i guess all of us
 

3963
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,230
of all of these and i guess all of us
are an evangelist for something

3964
00:57:56,230 --> 00:57:56,240
are an evangelist for something
 

3965
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,750
are an evangelist for something
but uh i i guess it's weird that we've

3966
00:57:59,750 --> 00:57:59,760
but uh i i guess it's weird that we've
 

3967
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:00,710
but uh i i guess it's weird that we've
gotten this far

3968
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:00,720
gotten this far
 

3969
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,710
gotten this far

it seems like freedom of the individual
 

4133
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,910
it seems like freedom of the individual
in all its forms

4134
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:45,920
in all its forms
 

4135
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,990
in all its forms
seems to be fundamental to the success

4136
01:00:47,990 --> 01:00:48,000
seems to be fundamental to the success
 

4137
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,190
seems to be fundamental to the success
of the united states

4138
01:00:49,190 --> 01:00:49,200
of the united states
 

4139
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:52,549
of the united states
and so we should it's uh however the

is like doesn't matter whether free will
 

4145
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,990
is like doesn't matter whether free will
is or isn't an illusion

4146
01:00:57,990 --> 01:00:58,000
is or isn't an illusion
 

4147
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,270
is or isn't an illusion
the belief that it's real protects the

4148
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:01,280
the belief that it's real protects the
 

4149
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,710
the belief that it's real protects the
individual from the group which is

4150
01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:02,720
individual from the group which is
 

4151
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:03,990
individual from the group which is
fundamentally correct me if i'm wrong

01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:05,040
that always seems like
 

4155
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:06,710
that always seems like
the big issue of history hey there's

4156

the fundamental power imbalance though
 

4179
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:26,069

well the interesting thing about the
 

4183
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:29,430
well the interesting thing about the
libertarian thinking i guess i

4184
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:29,440
libertarian thinking i guess i
 

4185
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,030
libertarian thinking i guess i
i don't know those words are maybe

4186
01:01:31,030 --> 01:01:31,040
i don't know those words are maybe

what's the big deal yeah so the
 

4211
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,710
what's the big deal yeah so the
libertarian viewpoint

4212
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:50,720
libertarian viewpoint
 

4213
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:53,750
libertarian viewpoint
which i probably espouse like that's i'm

4214
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:53,760
which i probably espouse like that's i'm
 

4215
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:56,710
which i probably espouse like that's i'm
very much like uh freedom of the

4216
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:56,720
very much like uh freedom of the
 

4217
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,309
very much like uh freedom of the
individual is very valuable

4218
01:01:58,309 --> 01:01:58,319
individual is very valuable
 

4219
01:01:58,319 --> 01:02:00,549
individual is very valuable
and like leave others the [\h__\h] alone

4220
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:00,559
and like leave others the [\h__\h] alone
 

4221

put in the
the work of empathy of understanding

4228
01:02:09,670 --> 01:02:09,680
the work of empathy of understanding

01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:16,400
but isn't that an interesting thing if i
 

4235
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,470
but isn't that an interesting thing if i
believe in freedom of the individual

4236
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:18,480
believe in freedom of the individual
 

4237
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:19,910
believe in freedom of the individual
and i take that like all of these like

4238
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:19,920
and i take that like all of these like
 

4239
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,430
and i take that like all of these like
you said you take them past just their

4240
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:21,440
you said you take them past just their
 

4241
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:22,230
you said you take them past just their
first

4242
01:02:22,230 --> 01:02:22,240
first
 

4243
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,150
first
why question you ask why why why why or

4244
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:24,160
why question you ask why why why why or
 

4245
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:26,150
why question you ask why why why why or
how how many times

4246
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:26,160
how how many times
 

4247
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,230
how how many times
should that not extend to respect for

4248
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:28,240
should that not extend to respect for
 

4249
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,150
should that not extend to respect for
you respect for your position respect

4250
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:30,160
you respect for your position respect
 

4251
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,990
you respect for your position respect
for your individual lived experience

4252
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
for your individual lived experience
 

4253
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:32,870
for your individual lived experience
which could be

4254
01:02:32,870 --> 01:02:32,880
which could be
 

4255
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:35,029
which could be
grossly different than mine yeah this is

4256
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:35,039
grossly different than mine yeah this is
 

4257
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:36,390
grossly different than mine yeah this is
the problem with saying

4258
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:36,400
the problem with saying
 

4259
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,150
the problem with saying
i'm an individual i'm not going to

4260
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:38,160
i'm an individual i'm not going to
 

4261
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,309
i'm an individual i'm not going to
bother you you don't bother me

4262
01:02:40,309 --> 01:02:40,319
bother you you don't bother me
 

4263
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,029
bother you you don't bother me
that's just like that's not actionable

4264
01:02:43,029 --> 01:02:43,039
that's just like that's not actionable
 

4265
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:43,750
that's just like that's not actionable
because

4266
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:43,760
because
 

4267
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,910
because
to be to make it actionable you have to

4268
01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:45,920
to be to make it actionable you have to
 

4269
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,029
to be to make it actionable you have to
think the why why

4270
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:47,039
think the why why
 

4271
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,109
think the why why
why why you have to do the steps beyond

4272
01:02:49,109 --> 01:02:49,119
why why you have to do the steps beyond
 

4273
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:50,470
why why you have to do the steps beyond
right you think what does that actually

4274
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,480
right you think what does that actually
 

4275
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,750
right you think what does that actually
mean that means

4276
01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:51,760
mean that means
 

4277
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,270
mean that means
understanding how even my very existence

4278
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:55,280
understanding how even my very existence
 

4279
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,710
understanding how even my very existence
uh like hurts others because

uh like hurts others because
 

4281
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,390
uh like hurts others because
you have to understand that like i'm not

just
 

4783
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,189
just
i apply the exact same principle that

4784
01:10:15,189 --> 01:10:15,199
i apply the exact same principle that
 

4785
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:16,950
i apply the exact same principle that
you just said which is a

4786
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:16,960
you just said which is a
 

4787
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,390
you just said which is a
free will and discussion which is like

4788
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:20,400
free will and discussion which is like
 

4789
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:23,750
free will and discussion which is like
i approach it in a way that

4790
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:23,760
i approach it in a way that
 

4791
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,990
i approach it in a way that
i don't get stuck in this loop that's

4792
01:10:25,990 --> 01:10:26,000
i don't get stuck in this loop that's
 

4793
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,350
i don't get stuck in this loop that's
counterproductive

4794
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:27,360
counterproductive
 

4795
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,470
counterproductive
i try to do things that are productive

4796
01:10:30,470 --> 01:10:30,480
i try to do things that are productive
 

4797
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,630
i try to do things that are productive
and like it's just like you said that's

4798
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:32,640
and like it's just like you said that's
 

4799
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:34,070
and like it's just like you said that's
like uh

4800
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:34,080
like uh
 

4801
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:35,590
like uh
like what kind of things can i do in

4802
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
like what kind of things can i do in
 

4803
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,430
like what kind of things can i do in
this world whether that's tweeting or

this world whether that's tweeting or
building things

4806
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:38,480
building things
 

4807
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,110
building things
those are low effort tweeting or

4808
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:41,120
those are low effort tweeting or
 

4809
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:42,870
those are low effort tweeting or
actually building businesses or building

ideas

4812
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:43,440
ideas
 

4813
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:46,229
ideas
out as high effort what can i do that

4814
01:10:46,229 --> 01:10:46,239
out as high effort what can i do that
 

4815
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,669
out as high effort what can i do that
will actually solve problems

4816
01:10:47,669 --> 01:10:47,679
will actually solve problems
 

4817
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:49,590
will actually solve problems
and that's that's the way i approach it

4818
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:49,600
and that's that's the way i approach it
 

4819
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,070
and that's that's the way i approach it
and i do wonder if it's possible to at

4820
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:52,080
and i do wonder if it's possible to at
 

4821
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:52,950
and i do wonder if it's possible to at
scale

4822
01:10:52,950 --> 01:10:52,960
scale
 

4823
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:55,669
scale
encourage each other to approach like

4824
01:10:55,669 --> 01:10:55,679
encourage each other to approach like
 

4825
01:10:55,679 --> 01:10:57,189
encourage each other to approach like
social media and communication with

4826

think
 

4845
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:15,990
think
most of what's we see happening on

4846
01:11:15,990 --> 01:11:16,000
most of what's we see happening on
 

4847

implementation details it goes down to
 

4855
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:27,990
implementation details it goes down to
like what is the source of the dopamine

4856

just even small tweaks and those can fix
 

4865
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,070
just even small tweaks and those can fix
a lot really

a lot really
 

4867
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,990
a lot really
i i believe so so like a lot a lot of

i i believe so so like a lot a lot of
 

4869
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,189
i i believe so so like a lot a lot of
the stuff we see now

01:11:39,189 --> 01:11:39,199
the stuff we see now
 

4871
01:11:39,199 --> 01:11:41,110
the stuff we see now
is the result of just initial

that we didn't anticipate so the

4876
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:45,840
that we didn't anticipate so the
 

4877
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:46,870
that we didn't anticipate so the

monetization
 

4879
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,070

grew
that there's a big dopamine rush from

4892
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:01,920
that there's a big dopamine rush from
 

4893
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,229
that there's a big dopamine rush from
getting more followers and likes and

4903
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,310
like a clicking like and so on so that's
that dopamine right so we want to say

other thing that was
 

4913
01:12:21,199 --> 01:12:23,350
other thing that was
expected is the controversial the

4919
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,110
will get the most likes so we it had to
do with the initial mechanisms of likes

do with the initial mechanisms of likes
 

4921

4930
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,000
like
 

4931
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,189
like
any of the basics of human connection

4932
01:12:41,189 --> 01:12:41,199
any of the basics of human connection
 

4933
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,550
any of the basics of human connection
that we've actually all come

4934
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:42,560
that we've actually all come
 

4935
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,270
that we've actually all come
to understand society is valuable at the

4936
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:45,280
to understand society is valuable at the
 

4937
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:46,310
to understand society is valuable at the
individual level

4938
01:12:46,310 --> 01:12:46,320
individual level
 

4939
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,270
individual level
like we're saying but on mass what

4940
01:12:49,270 --> 01:12:49,280
like we're saying but on mass what
 

4941
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,350
like we're saying but on mass what
results is like you throw all that out

4942
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:51,360
results is like you throw all that out
 

4943
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:53,510
results is like you throw all that out
and it's all just divisive

4944
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:53,520
and it's all just divisive
 

4945
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,709
and it's all just divisive
at scale uh

4946
01:12:56,709 --> 01:12:56,719
at scale uh
 

4947
01:12:56,719 --> 01:12:59,510
at scale uh
discourse uh i think it could be fixed

4948
01:12:59,510 --> 01:12:59,520
discourse uh i think it could be fixed
 

4949
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:00,470
discourse uh i think it could be fixed
by

4950
01:13:00,470 --> 01:13:00,480

in a way that's long-lasting long-term i
 

4967
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:22,950
in a way that's long-lasting long-term i
think what makes people

4968
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:22,960
think what makes people
 

4969
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,189

long-term in the short term what feels
 

4975
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:31,189
long-term in the short term what feels
good is getting a lot of likes

4976
01:13:31,189 --> 01:13:31,199
good is getting a lot of likes
 

4977
01:13:31,199 --> 01:13:33,270
good is getting a lot of likes
and i think those are just different

4978
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:33,280
and i think those are just different
 

4979
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,550
and i think those are just different
incentives

4980
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:34,560
incentives
 

4981
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:36,630
incentives
that if implemented correctly you could

4982
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:36,640
that if implemented correctly you could
 

4983
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:38,229
that if implemented correctly you could
just build social networks that would do

4984
01:13:38,229 --> 01:13:38,239
just build social networks that would do
 

4985
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:38,790
just build social networks that would do
much better

4986
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:38,800
much better
 

4987
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:39,910
much better
so do you think it comes from a

4988
01:13:39,910 --> 01:13:39,920
so do you think it comes from a
 

4989
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,430
so do you think it comes from a
structural perspective i guess at what

4990
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:41,440
structural perspective i guess at what
 

4991
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:42,709
structural perspective i guess at what
point does you mention like

4992
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
point does you mention like
 

4993
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:43,830
point does you mention like
you mentioned free will and also you

4994
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:43,840
you mentioned free will and also you
 

4995
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:45,669
you mentioned free will and also you
mentioned you know feeling good like and

4996
01:13:45,669 --> 01:13:45,679
mentioned you know feeling good like and
 

4997
01:13:45,679 --> 01:13:45,990
mentioned you know feeling good like and
again

4998
01:13:45,990 --> 01:13:46,000
again
 

4999
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:47,669
again
working hard you know you i know that

5000
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:47,679
working hard you know you i know that
 

5001
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:49,830
working hard you know you i know that
you have the uh i guess the

5002
01:13:49,830 --> 01:13:49,840
you have the uh i guess the
 

5003
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:52,790
you have the uh i guess the
was it a race or um no it's oh the the

5004
01:13:52,790 --> 01:13:52,800
was it a race or um no it's oh the the
 

5005
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:53,910
was it a race or um no it's oh the the
the goggins thing yeah

5006
01:13:53,910 --> 01:13:53,920
the goggins thing yeah
 

5007
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,910
the goggins thing yeah
uh it's 4x40 4x4 by 48 challenge where

5008
01:13:57,910 --> 01:13:57,920
uh it's 4x40 4x4 by 48 challenge where
 

5009
01:13:57,920 --> 01:13:59,910
uh it's 4x40 4x4 by 48 challenge where
you run four miles every four hours for

5010
01:13:59,910 --> 01:13:59,920
you run four miles every four hours for
 

5011
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:01,189
you run four miles every four hours for
two days that's awesome

5012
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:01,199
two days that's awesome
 

5013
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:04,229
two days that's awesome
yeah it's it's a bunch of it's it's uh

5014
01:14:04,229 --> 01:14:04,239
yeah it's it's a bunch of it's it's uh
 

5015
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:05,990
yeah it's it's a bunch of it's it's uh
the the the challenge of it isn't just

5016
01:14:05,990 --> 01:14:06,000
the the the challenge of it isn't just
 

5017
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,669
the the the challenge of it isn't just
the running the running is very tough

5018
01:14:07,669 --> 01:14:07,679
the running the running is very tough
 

5019
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:08,149
the running the running is very tough
but

5020
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:08,159
but
 

5021
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,910
but
it's mostly the sleep deprivation rises

5022
01:14:09,910 --> 01:14:09,920
it's mostly the sleep deprivation rises
 

5023
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:11,669
it's mostly the sleep deprivation rises
you're just training every four hours

5024
01:14:11,669 --> 01:14:11,679
you're just training every four hours
 

5025
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:12,709
you're just training every four hours
but it's a struggle right

5026
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:12,719
but it's a struggle right
 

5027
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,070
but it's a struggle right
and that's but the struggle gives

5028
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:14,080
and that's but the struggle gives
 

5029
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:16,709
and that's but the struggle gives
meaning and ultimately i guess so how

5030
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:16,719
meaning and ultimately i guess so how
 

5031
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:17,350
meaning and ultimately i guess so how
can we

5032
01:14:17,350 --> 01:14:17,360
can we
 

5033
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:18,470
can we
because you mentioned like you said

5034
01:14:18,470 --> 01:14:18,480
because you mentioned like you said
 

5035
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:20,390
because you mentioned like you said
adjusting things on like a uh

5036
01:14:20,390 --> 01:14:20,400
adjusting things on like a uh
 

5037
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,470
adjusting things on like a uh
i guess like a programming level almost

5038
01:14:22,470 --> 01:14:22,480
i guess like a programming level almost
 

5039
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:24,070
i guess like a programming level almost
uh based programming levels so that the

5040
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:24,080
uh based programming levels so that the
 

5041
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:25,510
uh based programming levels so that the
interface is different for the user

5042
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:25,520
interface is different for the user
 

5043
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:27,189
interface is different for the user
but at what point does the user have a

5044
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:27,199
but at what point does the user have a
 

5045
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,950
but at what point does the user have a
responsibility to

5046
01:14:28,950 --> 01:14:28,960
responsibility to
 

5047
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:30,790
responsibility to
you know as a as a man or a woman or a

5048
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:30,800
you know as a as a man or a woman or a
 

5049
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,470
you know as a as a man or a woman or a
person to just

5050
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:32,480
person to just
 

5051
01:14:32,480 --> 01:14:34,950
person to just
behave more decently how can we i guess

5052
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:34,960
behave more decently how can we i guess
 

5053
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,070
behave more decently how can we i guess
utilize

5054
01:14:36,070 --> 01:14:36,080
utilize
 

5055
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:38,630
utilize
what can we do it seems like you know

5056
01:14:38,630 --> 01:14:38,640
what can we do it seems like you know
 

5057
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,790
what can we do it seems like you know
like our society is so grossly missing

5058
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:40,800
like our society is so grossly missing
 

5059
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:41,990
like our society is so grossly missing
like a martin luther king right

5060
01:14:41,990 --> 01:14:42,000
like a martin luther king right

you know that's definitely word the

5072
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:52,080
you know that's definitely word the
 

5073
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:53,590
you know that's definitely word the
great leaders is a very good question

5074
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:53,600
great leaders is a very good question
 

5075
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,510
great leaders is a very good question
that's that's more of a question of

5076
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:55,520
that's that's more of a question of
 

5077
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:57,430
that's that's more of a question of
our political systems why they're not

5078
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:57,440
our political systems why they're not
 

5079
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:59,510
our political systems why they're not
pushing forward the great leaders but

5080
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
pushing forward the great leaders but
 

5081
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:02,870
pushing forward the great leaders but
there's also just uh okay

there's also just uh okay
 

5083
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,030
there's also just uh okay
there's uh some just basic engineering

5084
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:05,040
there's uh some just basic engineering
 

5085
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:06,709
there's uh some just basic engineering
[\h__\h] which is

5086

much drilling
 

5619
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:42,470
much drilling
okay and then the mental stuff like

5620
01:23:42,470 --> 01:23:42,480
okay and then the mental stuff like
 

5621
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:45,750

particularly
for the time um you know in uh in where

drilled and drilled and um
one one thing that's really important to

5646
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:09,360
one one thing that's really important to
 

5647
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:11,189
one one thing that's really important to
understand though is that

5648
01:24:11,189 --> 01:24:11,199
understand though is that
 

5649
01:24:11,199 --> 01:24:14,470
understand though is that
it i was able to in a relatively brief

5650
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:14,480
it i was able to in a relatively brief
 

5651
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,350
it i was able to in a relatively brief
period of years

5652
01:24:15,350 --> 01:24:15,360
period of years
 

5653
01:24:15,360 --> 01:24:18,149
period of years
you'll go from zero to reasonably good

5654
01:24:18,149 --> 01:24:18,159
you'll go from zero to reasonably good
 

5655
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:18,629
you'll go from zero to reasonably good
but

5656
01:24:18,629 --> 01:24:18,639
but
 

5657
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:21,590
but
um i think i probably crammed more hours

5658
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:21,600
um i think i probably crammed more hours
 

5659
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,149
um i think i probably crammed more hours
in those

5660
01:24:22,149 --> 01:24:22,159
in those
 

5661
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:25,510
in those
small years than most people did

5662
01:24:25,510 --> 01:24:25,520
small years than most people did
 

5663
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:27,590
small years than most people did
training let's say in two or three times

5664
01:24:27,590 --> 01:24:27,600
training let's say in two or three times
 

5665
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,590
training let's say in two or three times
the length so it may not

5666
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:29,600
the length so it may not
 

5667
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,590
the length so it may not
it may masquerade as something else

5668
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:31,600
it may masquerade as something else
 

5669
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,189
it may masquerade as something else
other than it is i i could say

5670
01:24:33,189 --> 01:24:33,199
other than it is i i could say
 

5671
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:34,870
other than it is i i could say
you have to put it in the hours yeah

5672
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:34,880
you have to put it in the hours yeah
 

5673
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:36,790
you have to put it in the hours yeah
there's no way around that i i think so

5674
01:24:36,790 --> 01:24:36,800
there's no way around that i i think so
 

5675
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:38,310
there's no way around that i i think so
what did you put in those out so when

5676
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:38,320
what did you put in those out so when
 

5677
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:40,070
what did you put in those out so when
you said drilling can you break that

5678
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:40,080
you said drilling can you break that
 

5679
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:40,790
you said drilling can you break that
apart a little bit

5680
01:24:40,790 --> 01:24:40,800
apart a little bit
 

5681
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,709
apart a little bit
like what what does really look like is

5682
01:24:42,709 --> 01:24:42,719
like what what does really look like is
 

5683
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:43,990
like what what does really look like is
there any recommendations

5684
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:44,000
there any recommendations
 

5685
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:45,189
there any recommendations
absolutely step one i would say your

5686
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:45,199
absolutely step one i would say your
 

5687
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:47,189
absolutely step one i would say your
choices matter like uh there's a

5688
01:24:47,189 --> 01:24:47,199
choices matter like uh there's a
 

5689
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:48,709
choices matter like uh there's a
i think that one of the really important

5690
01:24:48,709 --> 01:24:48,719
i think that one of the really important
 

5691
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:50,149
i think that one of the really important
things that i think we should consider

5692
01:24:50,149 --> 01:24:50,159
things that i think we should consider
 

5693
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:51,430
things that i think we should consider
about jiu jitsu is that there's a lot of

5694
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:51,440
about jiu jitsu is that there's a lot of
 

5695
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:53,030
about jiu jitsu is that there's a lot of
junk in the system right now it's like

5696
01:24:53,030 --> 01:24:53,040
junk in the system right now it's like
 

5697
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,070
junk in the system right now it's like
jujitsu has

5698
01:24:54,070 --> 01:24:54,080
jujitsu has
 

5699
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:56,550
jujitsu has
exploded in terms of uh the number of

5700
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:56,560
exploded in terms of uh the number of
 

5701
01:24:56,560 --> 01:24:58,390
exploded in terms of uh the number of
positions techniques strategies this

5702
01:24:58,390 --> 01:24:58,400
positions techniques strategies this
 

5703
01:24:58,400 --> 01:24:59,910
positions techniques strategies this
that rule sets

5704
01:24:59,910 --> 01:24:59,920
that rule sets
 

5705
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:01,510
that rule sets
that's really cool on the one hand on

5706
01:25:01,510 --> 01:25:01,520
that's really cool on the one hand on
 

5707
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,149
that's really cool on the one hand on
the other hand there's probably a

5708
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:04,159
the other hand there's probably a
 

5709
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:06,950
the other hand there's probably a
just metric [\h__\h] ton of sub-optimal

5710
01:25:06,950 --> 01:25:06,960
just metric [\h__\h] ton of sub-optimal
 

5711
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:07,669
just metric [\h__\h] ton of sub-optimal

i it was it's funny like the operating
 

5823
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:49,430
i it was it's funny like the operating
assumptions that

huge influence you mentioned like

huge influence you mentioned like
growing up in the united states or this

5830
01:26:55,430 --> 01:26:55,440
growing up in the united states or this
 

5831
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,350
growing up in the united states or this
being a capitalist society like whoo

being a capitalist society like whoo
 

5833
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,110
being a capitalist society like whoo
all right now of course i think that i

5834
01:26:59,110 --> 01:26:59,120
all right now of course i think that i
 

5835
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,310
all right now of course i think that i
don't really know any different

5836
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:00,320
don't really know any different
 

5837
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,430
don't really know any different
otherwise and i think that a lot of

5838
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:01,440
otherwise and i think that a lot of
 

5839
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:02,629
otherwise and i think that a lot of
times people go oh

5840
01:27:02,629 --> 01:27:02,639
times people go oh
 

5841
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:03,910
times people go oh
communism is better i'm like i haven't

5842
01:27:03,910 --> 01:27:03,920
communism is better i'm like i haven't
 

5843
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,750
communism is better i'm like i haven't
seen it i haven't read any books about

5844
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:05,760
seen it i haven't read any books about
 

5845
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:06,709
seen it i haven't read any books about
it were being better

5846
01:27:06,709 --> 01:27:06,719
it were being better
 

5847
01:27:06,719 --> 01:27:08,950
it were being better
but uh it's possible i mean i haven't

5848
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:08,960
but uh it's possible i mean i haven't
 

5849
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,550
but uh it's possible i mean i haven't
experienced it much myself either

5850
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:10,560
experienced it much myself either
 

5851
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,790
experienced it much myself either
so i can't dismiss it out right but i

5852
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:12,800
so i can't dismiss it out right but i
 

5853
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:14,229
so i can't dismiss it out right but i
guess i would say it's a fundamentally

5854
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:14,239
guess i would say it's a fundamentally
 

5855
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:14,790
guess i would say it's a fundamentally
different

5856
01:27:14,790 --> 01:27:14,800
different
 

5857
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,030
different
differing operating system underpinning

5858
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:17,040
differing operating system underpinning
 

5859
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,390
differing operating system underpinning
and all of my choices

5860
01:27:18,390 --> 01:27:18,400
and all of my choices
 

5861
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,390
and all of my choices
all of if i honestly believed in that

5862
01:27:20,390 --> 01:27:20,400
all of if i honestly believed in that
 

5863
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,550
all of if i honestly believed in that
thing many of my choices

5864
01:27:22,550 --> 01:27:22,560
thing many of my choices
 

5865
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:24,390
thing many of my choices
on a moment by moment on a day by day

5866
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
on a moment by moment on a day by day
 

5867
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,990
on a moment by moment on a day by day
and certainly on a lifetime basis

5868
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000
and certainly on a lifetime basis
 

5869
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,830
and certainly on a lifetime basis
would be very different so i would say

5870
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:27,840
would be very different so i would say
 

5871
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,070
would be very different so i would say
that uh it's tough when you're

5872
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:30,080
that uh it's tough when you're

that uh it's tough when you're

6265
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:56,709
and my inability to understand what
you're saying though doesn't invalidate

6266
01:32:56,709 --> 01:32:56,719
you're saying though doesn't invalidate
 

6267
01:32:56,719 --> 01:32:57,590

but so in the complicated human space of
 

6541
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:22,070
but so in the complicated human space of
when your intention at least on the in

6542
01:37:22,070 --> 01:37:22,080
when your intention at least on the in

the big picture view
 

6545
01:37:23,119 --> 01:37:26,390
the big picture view
is good there's the question is it's not

6546
01:37:26,390 --> 01:37:26,400
is good there's the question is it's not
 

6547
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,550
is good there's the question is it's not
always when your intention is good

6548
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:28,560
always when your intention is good
 

6549
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,669
always when your intention is good
the actual implementation of it

6550
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
the actual implementation of it
 

6551
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:34,709
the actual implementation of it
is good so you might be just almost

6552
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
is good so you might be just almost
 

6553
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,870
is good so you might be just almost
and that's much it's not the case for

01:37:36,870 --> 01:37:36,880
and that's much it's not the case for
 

6555
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,310
and that's much it's not the case for
you it's much more the case for white

01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:38,320
you it's much more the case for white
 

6557
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:39,109

we talked about how to start in jiu

6976
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:38,239
we talked about how to start in jiu
 

6977
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:39,590
we talked about how to start in jiu
jitsu

6978
01:43:39,590 --> 01:43:39,600
jitsu
 

6979
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:42,709
jitsu
what about if we zoom out even more and

6980
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:42,719
what about if we zoom out even more and
 

6981
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,390
what about if we zoom out even more and
how do you learn how to learn

6982
01:43:46,390 --> 01:43:46,400
how do you learn how to learn
 

6983
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:49,430
how do you learn how to learn
how do you optimize the learning process

6984
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:49,440
how do you optimize the learning process
 

6985
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:51,590
how do you optimize the learning process
i i don't know the answer to that but i

6986
01:43:51,590 --> 01:43:51,600
i i don't know the answer to that but i
 

6987
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:52,870
i i don't know the answer to that but i
can tell you what i like to do and i

6988
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
can tell you what i like to do and i
 

6989
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:53,430
can tell you what i like to do and i
would say

6990
01:43:53,430 --> 01:43:53,440
would say
 

6991
01:43:53,440 --> 01:43:55,669
would say
like i can't step one i don't i'm not

6992
01:43:55,669 --> 01:43:55,679
like i can't step one i don't i'm not
 

6993
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:57,030
like i can't step one i don't i'm not
maybe this is a little bit easier for me

6994
01:43:57,030 --> 01:43:57,040
maybe this is a little bit easier for me
 

6995
01:43:57,040 --> 01:43:57,990
maybe this is a little bit easier for me
because you know i've

6996
01:43:57,990 --> 01:43:58,000
because you know i've
 

6997
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,669
because you know i've
i've never had a ton of friends honestly

6998
01:43:59,669 --> 01:43:59,679
i've never had a ton of friends honestly
 

6999
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:00,950
i've never had a ton of friends honestly
i've you know i've got my close friends

7000
01:44:00,950 --> 01:44:00,960
i've you know i've got my close friends
 

7001
01:44:00,960 --> 01:44:02,550
i've you know i've got my close friends
and people that i know but i

7002
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:02,560
and people that i know but i
 

7003
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,149
and people that i know but i
never had tons and tons of people so i

7004
01:44:04,149 --> 01:44:04,159
never had tons and tons of people so i
 

7005
01:44:04,159 --> 01:44:06,070
never had tons and tons of people so i
spent a lot of time you know thinking

7006
01:44:06,070 --> 01:44:06,080
spent a lot of time you know thinking
 

7007
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:09,430
spent a lot of time you know thinking
and anyway uh yeah i can't

7008
01:44:09,430 --> 01:44:09,440
and anyway uh yeah i can't
 

7009
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:11,109
and anyway uh yeah i can't
i can't control you i can't control

7010
01:44:11,109 --> 01:44:11,119
i can't control you i can't control
 

7011
01:44:11,119 --> 01:44:12,550
i can't control you i can't control
anybody else i

7012
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:12,560
anybody else i
 

7013
01:44:12,560 --> 01:44:16,790
anybody else i
you know i uh um

7014
01:44:16,790 --> 01:44:16,800

 

7015
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,709

all i can i want to take my i'll get

7016
01:44:18,709 --> 01:44:18,719
all i can i want to take my i'll get
 

7017
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,229
all i can i want to take my i'll get
some marcus aurelius thing it's like you

7018
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:20,239
some marcus aurelius thing it's like you
 

7019
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:21,350
some marcus aurelius thing it's like you
know i guess the trick to life is

7020
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
know i guess the trick to life is
 

7021
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,870
know i guess the trick to life is
figuring out what's in our control and

7022
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:22,880
figuring out what's in our control and
 

7023
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,229
figuring out what's in our control and
what's not and focusing on things that

7024
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:24,239
what's not and focusing on things that
 

7025
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,830
what's not and focusing on things that
are in our control i guess

7026
01:44:25,830 --> 01:44:25,840
are in our control i guess
 

7027
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,109
are in our control i guess
and uh so step one is figuring out both

7028
01:44:29,109 --> 01:44:29,119
and uh so step one is figuring out both
 

7029
01:44:29,119 --> 01:44:30,709
and uh so step one is figuring out both
internally and then also

7030
01:44:30,709 --> 01:44:30,719
internally and then also
 

7031
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:32,629
internally and then also
out in in the world as it pertains to

7032
01:44:32,629 --> 01:44:32,639
out in in the world as it pertains to
 

7033
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:35,030
out in in the world as it pertains to
jitsu what is actually in my control and

7034
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:35,040
jitsu what is actually in my control and
 

7035
01:44:35,040 --> 01:44:36,709
jitsu what is actually in my control and
what is not like passing someone's guard

7036
01:44:36,709 --> 01:44:36,719
what is not like passing someone's guard
 

7037
01:44:36,719 --> 01:44:38,149
what is not like passing someone's guard
is not in your control people think it

7038
01:44:38,149 --> 01:44:38,159
is not in your control people think it
 

7039
01:44:38,159 --> 01:44:39,109
is not in your control people think it
is it ain't

7040
01:44:39,109 --> 01:44:39,119
is it ain't
 

7041
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:41,669
is it ain't
if i can't just do an activity and be

7042
01:44:41,669 --> 01:44:41,679
if i can't just do an activity and be
 

7043
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:43,430
if i can't just do an activity and be
unchecked

7044
01:44:43,430 --> 01:44:43,440
unchecked
 

7045
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:46,550
unchecked
then it ain't in my control entirely

7046
01:44:46,550 --> 01:44:46,560
then it ain't in my control entirely
 

7047
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,470
then it ain't in my control entirely
i can always breathe i can always um

7048
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:50,480
i can always breathe i can always um
 

7049
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:53,030
i can always breathe i can always um
you know be calm i can always no matter

7050
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040
you know be calm i can always no matter
 

7051
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,430
you know be calm i can always no matter
whether i'm concerned or not concerned

7052
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:55,440
whether i'm concerned or not concerned
 

7053
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:56,709
whether i'm concerned or not concerned
whatever you want to call it nerves you

7054
01:44:56,709 --> 01:44:56,719
whatever you want to call it nerves you
 

7055
01:44:56,719 --> 01:44:59,109
whatever you want to call it nerves you
know i can step forward across the line

7056
01:44:59,109 --> 01:44:59,119
know i can step forward across the line
 

7057
01:44:59,119 --> 01:44:59,830
know i can step forward across the line
and say i will

7058
01:44:59,830 --> 01:44:59,840
and say i will
 

7059
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,750
and say i will
i will face the challenge ahead that is

7060
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
i will face the challenge ahead that is
 

7061
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,270
i will face the challenge ahead that is
all entirely no one can stop me from

7062
01:45:03,270 --> 01:45:03,280
all entirely no one can stop me from
 

7063
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:04,629
all entirely no one can stop me from
doing that that's entirely my control

7064
01:45:04,629 --> 01:45:04,639
doing that that's entirely my control
 

7065
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:05,510
doing that that's entirely my control
and that's why

7066
01:45:05,510 --> 01:45:05,520
and that's why
 

7067
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:06,870
and that's why
i know that every single time that i

7068
01:45:06,870 --> 01:45:06,880
i know that every single time that i
 

7069
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,470
i know that every single time that i
walk into the ring i'll walk in and out

7070
01:45:08,470 --> 01:45:08,480
walk into the ring i'll walk in and out
 

7071
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:09,990
walk into the ring i'll walk in and out
of there with my head of high because

7072
01:45:09,990 --> 01:45:10,000
of there with my head of high because
 

7073
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:10,790
of there with my head of high because
there's

7074
01:45:10,790 --> 01:45:10,800
there's
 

7075
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,189
there's
i will fight with everything that i have

7076
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199
i will fight with everything that i have
 

7077
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:14,870
i will fight with everything that i have
i can't promise that i'll win

7078
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:14,880
i can't promise that i'll win
 

7079
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:17,030
i can't promise that i'll win
i would say i take that same first

7080
01:45:17,030 --> 01:45:17,040
i would say i take that same first
 

7081
01:45:17,040 --> 01:45:18,550
i would say i take that same first
principles you mentioned

7082
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:18,560
principles you mentioned
 

7083
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:19,990
principles you mentioned
the last time we talked you know with

7084
01:45:19,990 --> 01:45:20,000
the last time we talked you know with
 

7085
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,550
the last time we talked you know with
elon and the importance of that

7086
01:45:22,550 --> 01:45:22,560
elon and the importance of that
 

7087
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:24,470
elon and the importance of that
and going what are the first principles

7088
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:24,480
and going what are the first principles
 

7089
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,910
and going what are the first principles
and i guess to come back a lot of times

7090
01:45:25,910 --> 01:45:25,920
and i guess to come back a lot of times
 

7091
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:27,270
and i guess to come back a lot of times
in my opinion the things that people

7092
01:45:27,270 --> 01:45:27,280
in my opinion the things that people
 

7093
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:30,310
in my opinion the things that people
think are the basics are not the basics

7094
01:45:30,310 --> 01:45:30,320
think are the basics are not the basics
 

7095
01:45:30,320 --> 01:45:31,990
think are the basics are not the basics
you can't learn if you think you're

7096
01:45:31,990 --> 01:45:32,000
you can't learn if you think you're
 

7097
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,270
you can't learn if you think you're
reasoning for first principles but

7098
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:33,280
reasoning for first principles but
 

7099
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:35,030
reasoning for first principles but
you're actually like level six

7100
01:45:35,030 --> 01:45:35,040
you're actually like level six
 

7101
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:37,510
you're actually like level six
you're actually like layers up you're

7102
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:37,520
you're actually like layers up you're
 

7103
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,189
you're actually like layers up you're
making so many there's so many baked in

7104
01:45:39,189 --> 01:45:39,199
making so many there's so many baked in
 

7105
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:40,709
making so many there's so many baked in
assumptions to what's going on that

7106
01:45:40,709 --> 01:45:40,719
assumptions to what's going on that
 

7107
01:45:40,719 --> 01:45:42,229
assumptions to what's going on that
you're going to struggle to understand

7108
01:45:42,229 --> 01:45:42,239
you're going to struggle to understand
 

7109
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,229
you're going to struggle to understand
why anything is actually happening

7110
01:45:44,229 --> 01:45:44,239
why anything is actually happening
 

7111
01:45:44,239 --> 01:45:46,149
why anything is actually happening
internally externally you name it

7112
01:45:46,149 --> 01:45:46,159
internally externally you name it
 

7113
01:45:46,159 --> 01:45:47,750
internally externally you name it
so i guess what i would start when it

7114
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:47,760
so i guess what i would start when it
 

7115
01:45:47,760 --> 01:45:49,590
so i guess what i would start when it
comes to learning is first principles

7116
01:45:49,590 --> 01:45:49,600
comes to learning is first principles
 

7117
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:50,950
comes to learning is first principles
and trying to understand what's going on

7118
01:45:50,950 --> 01:45:50,960
and trying to understand what's going on
 

7119
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:51,990
and trying to understand what's going on
but then also

7120
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:52,000
but then also
 

7121
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,149
but then also
simple things first i can control my

7122
01:45:54,149 --> 01:45:54,159
simple things first i can control my
 

7123
01:45:54,159 --> 01:45:55,990
simple things first i can control my
posture

7124
01:45:55,990 --> 01:45:56,000
posture
 

7125
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,870
posture
i can control my breathing no one can

7126
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
i can control my breathing no one can
 

7127
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,550
i can control my breathing no one can
stop me from doing that i can control

7128
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,560
stop me from doing that i can control
 

7129
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,229
stop me from doing that i can control
where i place my frames i can control

7130
01:46:02,229 --> 01:46:02,239

performance is self-expression
 

7409
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:53,990
performance is self-expression
and i always thought that marcelo was a

7410
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
and i always thought that marcelo was a
 

7411
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:55,350
and i always thought that marcelo was a
brilliant master of letting what's

7412
01:49:55,350 --> 01:49:55,360
brilliant master of letting what's
 

7413
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:56,070
brilliant master of letting what's
inside out

7414
01:49:56,070 --> 01:49:56,080
inside out
 

7415
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,750
inside out
he would he was so consistent in his

7416
01:49:57,750 --> 01:49:57,760
he would he was so consistent in his
 

7417
01:49:57,760 --> 01:49:59,589
he would he was so consistent in his
performances and

7418
01:49:59,589 --> 01:49:59,599
performances and
 

7419
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:00,870
performances and
a lot of times i felt like there was a

7420
01:50:00,870 --> 01:50:00,880
a lot of times i felt like there was a
 

7421
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:02,390
a lot of times i felt like there was a
block there personally particularly at

7422
01:50:02,390 --> 01:50:02,400
block there personally particularly at
 

7423
01:50:02,400 --> 01:50:03,750
block there personally particularly at
the end of jujitsu when i was very very

7424
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:03,760
the end of jujitsu when i was very very
 

7425
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:05,830
the end of jujitsu when i was very very
results oriented and i wasn't

7426
01:50:05,830 --> 01:50:05,840
results oriented and i wasn't
 

7427
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:07,910
results oriented and i wasn't
i think i think my focus was was not a

7428
01:50:07,910 --> 01:50:07,920
i think i think my focus was was not a
 

7429
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:09,030
i think i think my focus was was not a
deal it was definitely not

7430
01:50:09,030 --> 01:50:09,040
deal it was definitely not
 

7431
01:50:09,040 --> 01:50:10,229
deal it was definitely not
not in the place that i would like it to

7432
01:50:10,229 --> 01:50:10,239
not in the place that i would like it to
 

7433
01:50:10,239 --> 01:50:12,390
not in the place that i would like it to
be and whether i would have won more

7434
01:50:12,390 --> 01:50:12,400
be and whether i would have won more
 

7435
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:13,669
be and whether i would have won more
loss more hard to say but i know that i

7436
01:50:13,669 --> 01:50:13,679
loss more hard to say but i know that i
 

7437
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:14,709
loss more hard to say but i know that i
would perform better if i'd have

7438
01:50:14,709 --> 01:50:14,719
would perform better if i'd have
 

7439
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:16,790
would perform better if i'd have
adjusted that and anyway uh

7440
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
adjusted that and anyway uh
 

7441
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,350
adjusted that and anyway uh
that recognizing that again jiu jitsu i

7442
01:50:19,350 --> 01:50:19,360
that recognizing that again jiu jitsu i
 

7443
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,629
that recognizing that again jiu jitsu i
think i've said it before just to study

7444
01:50:20,629 --> 01:50:20,639
think i've said it before just to study
 

7445
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:22,070
think i've said it before just to study
as a science but expressed as an

01:50:22,070 --> 01:50:22,080
as a science but expressed as an

01:50:22,080 --> 01:50:23,910
as a science but expressed as an
art it doesn't matter if you can

7448
01:50:23,910 --> 01:50:23,920
art it doesn't matter if you can
 

7449
01:50:23,920 --> 01:50:25,430
art it doesn't matter if you can
articulate what you know how to do what

7450
01:50:25,430 --> 01:50:25,440
articulate what you know how to do what
 

7451
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:27,030
articulate what you know how to do what
matters is if you can do what you want

7452
01:50:27,030 --> 01:50:27,040
matters is if you can do what you want
 

7453
01:50:27,040 --> 01:50:28,310
matters is if you can do what you want
to do it only matters if you're you know

7454
01:50:28,310 --> 01:50:28,320
to do it only matters if you're you know
 

7455
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,750
to do it only matters if you're you know
i guess if you're teaching in a verbal

7456
01:50:29,750 --> 01:50:29,760
i guess if you're teaching in a verbal
 

7457
01:50:29,760 --> 01:50:30,709
i guess if you're teaching in a verbal
fashions whether or not you can

7458
01:50:30,709 --> 01:50:30,719
fashions whether or not you can
 

7459
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,390
fashions whether or not you can
articulate it but uh

7460
01:50:32,390 --> 01:50:32,400
articulate it but uh
 

7461
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:34,470
articulate it but uh
recognizing the difference between

7462
01:50:34,470 --> 01:50:34,480
recognizing the difference between
 

7463
01:50:34,480 --> 01:50:36,550
recognizing the difference between
learning on an intellectual level or a

7464
01:50:36,550 --> 01:50:36,560
learning on an intellectual level or a
 

7465
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:37,990
learning on an intellectual level or a
conceptual level and being able

7466
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:38,000
conceptual level and being able
 

7467
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,310
conceptual level and being able
to to translate that into the physical

7468
01:50:40,310 --> 01:50:40,320
to to translate that into the physical
 

7469
01:50:40,320 --> 01:50:41,510
to to translate that into the physical
and i guess like that's been the thing

7470
01:50:41,510 --> 01:50:41,520
and i guess like that's been the thing
 

7471
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:43,350
and i guess like that's been the thing
that i feel like fortunate over time in

7472
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:43,360
that i feel like fortunate over time in
 

7473
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:44,709
that i feel like fortunate over time in
my own academy to be able to kind of

7474
01:50:44,709 --> 01:50:44,719
my own academy to be able to kind of
 

7475
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:46,229
my own academy to be able to kind of
fiddle around and learn on my own

7476
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:46,239
fiddle around and learn on my own
 

7477
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:48,310
fiddle around and learn on my own
and practice my students and you know

7478
01:50:48,310 --> 01:50:48,320
and practice my students and you know
 

7479
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,669
and practice my students and you know
sometimes i struggle to have great

7480

thought out of being able to practice
 

7493
01:50:58,239 --> 01:51:00,229
thought out of being able to practice
and learn and fail and try and succeed

7494
01:51:00,229 --> 01:51:00,239
and learn and fail and try and succeed
 

7495
01:51:00,239 --> 01:51:01,189

like my own little sandbox um figuring
 

7499
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:05,350
like my own little sandbox um figuring
out how i can take

7500
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:05,360
out how i can take
 

7501
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:08,149
out how i can take
an idea and then come up with drills and

7502
01:51:08,149 --> 01:51:08,159
an idea and then come up with drills and
 

7503
01:51:08,159 --> 01:51:08,790
an idea and then come up with drills and
and

7504
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800
and
 

7505
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,629
and
drills to practice it so that i can

7506
01:51:10,629 --> 01:51:10,639
drills to practice it so that i can
 

7507
01:51:10,639 --> 01:51:12,229
drills to practice it so that i can
actually practice putting it into play

7508
01:51:12,229 --> 01:51:12,239
actually practice putting it into play
 

7509
01:51:12,239 --> 01:51:12,950
actually practice putting it into play
because again

but it was more about you just
 

7647
01:53:23,440 --> 01:53:26,310
but it was more about you just
describing upper body control and

7648
01:53:26,310 --> 01:53:26,320
describing upper body control and
 

7649
01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:27,990
describing upper body control and
the importance of the upper body control

7650
01:53:27,990 --> 01:53:28,000
the importance of the upper body control
 

7651
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,430
the importance of the upper body control
from the back

7652
01:53:29,430 --> 01:53:29,440
from the back
 

7653
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:31,430
from the back
and just like the there's certain grip

7654
01:53:31,430 --> 01:53:31,440
and just like the there's certain grip
 

7655
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:32,470
and just like the there's certain grip
like

7656
01:53:32,470 --> 01:53:32,480
like
 

7657
01:53:32,480 --> 01:53:34,709
like
the the you describe different details

7658
01:53:34,709 --> 01:53:34,719
the the you describe different details
 

7659
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:35,750
the the you describe different details
on the grips and so on

7660
01:53:35,750 --> 01:53:35,760
on the grips and so on
 

7661
01:53:35,760 --> 01:53:38,470
on the grips and so on
and as i started trying it i realized

7662
01:53:38,470 --> 01:53:38,480
and as i started trying it i realized
 

7663
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:40,149
and as i started trying it i realized
how important

7664
01:53:40,149 --> 01:53:40,159
how important
 

7665
01:53:40,159 --> 01:53:43,990
how important
upper body control is versus like me

7666
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:44,000
upper body control is versus like me
 

7667
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:46,550
upper body control is versus like me
maybe as a blue belt or something it was

7668
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:46,560
maybe as a blue belt or something it was
 

7669
01:53:46,560 --> 01:53:47,750
maybe as a blue belt or something it was
i thought like

7670
01:53:47,750 --> 01:53:47,760
i thought like
 

7671
01:53:47,760 --> 01:53:49,510
i thought like
you have achieved victory when you got

7672
01:53:49,510 --> 01:53:49,520
you have achieved victory when you got
 

7673
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:51,270
you have achieved victory when you got
the two hooks in

7674
01:53:51,270 --> 01:53:51,280
the two hooks in
 

7675
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:53,430
the two hooks in
and then i realized like at least for me

7676
01:53:53,430 --> 01:53:53,440
and then i realized like at least for me
 

7677
01:53:53,440 --> 01:53:55,270
and then i realized like at least for me
that the hooks were not

7678
01:53:55,270 --> 01:53:55,280
that the hooks were not
 

7679
01:53:55,280 --> 01:53:57,510
that the hooks were not
even for my body type for my style for

7680
01:53:57,510 --> 01:53:57,520
even for my body type for my style for
 

7681
01:53:57,520 --> 01:53:59,109
even for my body type for my style for
the way i approached things

7682
01:53:59,109 --> 01:53:59,119
the way i approached things
 

7683
01:53:59,119 --> 01:54:00,790
the way i approached things
they were not even important at all

7684
01:54:00,790 --> 01:54:00,800
they were not even important at all
 

7685
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:02,310
they were not even important at all
they're supplemental for the most part

7686
01:54:02,310 --> 01:54:02,320
they're supplemental for the most part
 

7687
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,229
they're supplemental for the most part
yeah so they were there for the points

7688
01:54:04,229 --> 01:54:04,239
yeah so they were there for the points
 

7689
01:54:04,239 --> 01:54:06,229
yeah so they were there for the points
but i can establish a huge amount of

7690
01:54:06,229 --> 01:54:06,239
but i can establish a huge amount of
 

7691
01:54:06,239 --> 01:54:07,669
but i can establish a huge amount of
control

7692
01:54:07,669 --> 01:54:07,679
control
 

7693
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:10,870
control
uh in fact the hooks were

7694
01:54:10,870 --> 01:54:10,880
uh in fact the hooks were
 

7695
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:12,310
uh in fact the hooks were
you you were talking about like illusion

7696
01:54:12,310 --> 01:54:12,320
you you were talking about like illusion
 

7697
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,790
you you were talking about like illusion
of choice it's it's uh

7698
01:54:14,790 --> 01:54:14,800
of choice it's it's uh
 

7699
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:17,270
of choice it's it's uh
it almost made people panic a lot more

7700
01:54:17,270 --> 01:54:17,280
it almost made people panic a lot more
 

7701
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,550
it almost made people panic a lot more
when you were like fighting for

7702
01:54:18,550 --> 01:54:18,560
when you were like fighting for
 

7703
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:19,990
when you were like fighting for
or establishing that kind of control

7704
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:20,000
or establishing that kind of control
 

7705
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,390
or establishing that kind of control
they were a lot less panicked when the

7706
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:22,400
they were a lot less panicked when the
 

7707
01:54:22,400 --> 01:54:24,709
they were a lot less panicked when the
hooks weren't involved even though they

7708
01:54:24,709 --> 01:54:24,719
hooks weren't involved even though they
 

7709
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:26,070
hooks weren't involved even though they
should be a lot more panicked

7710
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:26,080
should be a lot more panicked
 

7711
01:54:26,080 --> 01:54:27,990
should be a lot more panicked
anyway i realized a lot of those kinds

7712
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:28,000
anyway i realized a lot of those kinds
 

7713
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,669
anyway i realized a lot of those kinds
of things especially that had to do with

7714
01:54:29,669 --> 01:54:29,679
of things especially that had to do with
 

7715
01:54:29,679 --> 01:54:31,189
of things especially that had to do with
judo because

7716
01:54:31,189 --> 01:54:31,199
judo because
 

7717
01:54:31,199 --> 01:54:33,910
judo because
so much of judo on the ground is

7718
01:54:33,910 --> 01:54:33,920
so much of judo on the ground is
 

7719
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:34,870
so much of judo on the ground is
centered around

7720
01:54:34,870 --> 01:54:34,880
centered around
 

7721
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,589
centered around
aggressive efficient very fast choking

7722
01:54:37,589 --> 01:54:37,599
aggressive efficient very fast choking
 

7723
01:54:37,599 --> 01:54:38,550
aggressive efficient very fast choking
like

7724
01:54:38,550 --> 01:54:38,560
like
 

7725
01:54:38,560 --> 01:54:39,750
like
different kinds of clock chokes and all

7726
01:54:39,750 --> 01:54:39,760
different kinds of clock chokes and all
 

7727
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:41,750
different kinds of clock chokes and all
that kind of stuff what a brilliant

7728
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:41,760
that kind of stuff what a brilliant
 

7729
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:43,030
that kind of stuff what a brilliant
thing that is only going to start to

7730
01:54:43,030 --> 01:54:43,040
thing that is only going to start to
 

7731
01:54:43,040 --> 01:54:44,390
thing that is only going to start to
make its way into jiu jitsu coming up

7732
01:54:44,390 --> 01:54:44,400
make its way into jiu jitsu coming up
 

7733
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:46,229
make its way into jiu jitsu coming up
but like the judo style approach to like

7734
01:54:46,229 --> 01:54:46,239
but like the judo style approach to like
 

7735
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,149
but like the judo style approach to like
clock choking triangling from the top of

7736
01:54:48,149 --> 01:54:48,159
clock choking triangling from the top of
 

7737
01:54:48,159 --> 01:54:49,430
clock choking triangling from the top of
the turtle and stuff

7738
01:54:49,430 --> 01:54:49,440
the turtle and stuff
 

7739
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:52,310
the turtle and stuff
it's so powerful yeah and the the

7740
01:54:52,310 --> 01:54:52,320
it's so powerful yeah and the the
 

7741
01:54:52,320 --> 01:54:53,510
it's so powerful yeah and the the
there's something about judo that

7742
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:53,520
there's something about judo that
 

7743
01:54:53,520 --> 01:54:54,229
there's something about judo that
emphasizes

7744
01:54:54,229 --> 01:54:54,239
emphasizes
 

7745
01:54:54,239 --> 01:54:57,270
emphasizes
obviously due to the rules the urgency

7746
01:54:57,270 --> 01:54:57,280
obviously due to the rules the urgency
 

7747
01:54:57,280 --> 01:54:59,270
obviously due to the rules the urgency
so there you only do techniques that go

7748
01:54:59,270 --> 01:54:59,280
so there you only do techniques that go
 

7749
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,070
so there you only do techniques that go
fast and then the other thing is

7750
01:55:02,070 --> 01:55:02,080
fast and then the other thing is
 

7751
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:04,950
fast and then the other thing is
which i guess uh jiu-jitsu emphasizes

7752
01:55:04,950 --> 01:55:04,960
which i guess uh jiu-jitsu emphasizes
 

7753
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:05,910
which i guess uh jiu-jitsu emphasizes
too but judo

7754
01:55:05,910 --> 01:55:05,920
too but judo
 

7755
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:10,070
too but judo
really does which is um the transition

7756
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:10,080
really does which is um the transition
 

7757
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,910
really does which is um the transition
so like while the person's flying in the

7758
01:55:11,910 --> 01:55:11,920
so like while the person's flying in the
 

7759
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:13,910
so like while the person's flying in the
air is the easiest time

7760
01:55:13,910 --> 01:55:13,920
air is the easiest time
 

7761
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:15,589
air is the easiest time
i mean this is like ryan hall type of

7762
01:55:15,589 --> 01:55:15,599
i mean this is like ryan hall type of
 

7763
01:55:15,599 --> 01:55:18,629
i mean this is like ryan hall type of
[\h__\h] which is like

7764
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:18,639
[\h__\h] which is like
 

7765
01:55:18,639 --> 01:55:20,870
[\h__\h] which is like
why not put in your submissions or

7766
01:55:20,870 --> 01:55:20,880
why not put in your submissions or
 

7767
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:22,550
why not put in your submissions or
positional control while they're in the

7768
01:55:22,550 --> 01:55:22,560
positional control while they're in the
 

7769
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:23,589
positional control while they're in the
air and if

7770
01:55:23,589 --> 01:55:23,599
air and if
 

7771
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:25,430
air and if
well if you could why would you not

7772
01:55:25,430 --> 01:55:25,440
well if you could why would you not
 

7773
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:27,270
well if you could why would you not
right and say oh well i don't throw well

7774
01:55:27,270 --> 01:55:27,280
right and say oh well i don't throw well
 

7775
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:28,470
right and say oh well i don't throw well
we'll learn how to throw

7776
01:55:28,470 --> 01:55:28,480
we'll learn how to throw
 

7777
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:30,470
we'll learn how to throw
and then do it and so you should think i

7778
01:55:30,470 --> 01:55:30,480
and then do it and so you should think i
 

7779
01:55:30,480 --> 01:55:32,470
and then do it and so you should think i
mean in a transition

7780
01:55:32,470 --> 01:55:32,480
mean in a transition
 

7781
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,390
mean in a transition
when they're flying is the easiest time

7782
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:34,400
when they're flying is the easiest time
 

7783
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:35,510
when they're flying is the easiest time
to put in stuff and that's

7784
01:55:35,510 --> 01:55:35,520
to put in stuff and that's
 

7785
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:38,310
to put in stuff and that's
when you think about jokes as you're

7786
01:55:38,310 --> 01:55:38,320
when you think about jokes as you're
 

7787
01:55:38,320 --> 01:55:39,510
when you think about jokes as you're
throwing you should be thinking about

7788
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:39,520
throwing you should be thinking about
 

7789
01:55:39,520 --> 01:55:40,629
throwing you should be thinking about
the choke

7790
01:55:40,629 --> 01:55:40,639
the choke
 

7791
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:42,709
the choke
and then everything becomes a lot easier

7792
01:55:42,709 --> 01:55:42,719
and then everything becomes a lot easier
 

7793
01:55:42,719 --> 01:55:44,830
and then everything becomes a lot easier

7799
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,109
so cool like with stuff like that yeah
yeah exactly but

7800
01:55:51,109 --> 01:55:51,119
yeah exactly but
 

7801
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,550
yeah exactly but
but that has to do with the first

7802
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:52,560
but that has to do with the first
 

7803
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:54,790
but that has to do with the first
starting principle of like

7804
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:54,800
starting principle of like
 

7805
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,270
starting principle of like
stop thinking this as a two-phase game

7806
01:55:57,270 --> 01:55:57,280
stop thinking this as a two-phase game
 

7807
01:55:57,280 --> 01:55:57,990
stop thinking this as a two-phase game
of uh

7808
01:55:57,990 --> 01:55:58,000
of uh
 

7809
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,709
of uh
standing and then ground start thinking

7810
01:56:00,709 --> 01:56:00,719
standing and then ground start thinking
 

7811
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:01,589
standing and then ground start thinking
about

7812
01:56:01,589 --> 01:56:01,599
about
 

7813
01:56:01,599 --> 01:56:03,750
about
like the the standing and the the

7814
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:03,760
like the the standing and the the
 

7815
01:56:03,760 --> 01:56:05,270
like the the standing and the the
standing comes before the ground comes

7816
01:56:05,270 --> 01:56:05,280
standing comes before the ground comes
 

7817
01:56:05,280 --> 01:56:06,870
standing comes before the ground comes
after but everything happens in the

7818
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:06,880
after but everything happens in the
 

7819
01:56:06,880 --> 01:56:07,510
after but everything happens in the
transition

7820
01:56:07,510 --> 01:56:07,520
transition
 

7821
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:09,030
transition
well unless you're attacking what is the

7822
01:56:09,030 --> 01:56:09,040

the only thing that you can be sure of
 

7857
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,030
the only thing that you can be sure of
being successful in attacking is

7858
01:56:37,030 --> 01:56:37,040
being successful in attacking is
 

7859
01:56:37,040 --> 01:56:38,229
being successful in attacking is
something that's undefended

7860
01:56:38,229 --> 01:56:38,239
something that's undefended
 

7861
01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:41,270
something that's undefended
yeah well like yeah yeah but you know

7862
01:56:41,270 --> 01:56:41,280
yeah well like yeah yeah but you know
 

7863
01:56:41,280 --> 01:56:43,589
yeah well like yeah yeah but you know
in a fight though they're defended well

7864
01:56:43,589 --> 01:56:43,599
in a fight though they're defended well
 

7865
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:45,430
in a fight though they're defended well
are they there's moments all the time

7866
01:56:45,430 --> 01:56:45,440
are they there's moments all the time
 

7867
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:45,910
are they there's moments all the time
where i'm

7868
01:56:45,910 --> 01:56:45,920
where i'm
 

7869
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,149
where i'm
borderline defenseless and if you were

7870
01:56:48,149 --> 01:56:48,159
borderline defenseless and if you were
 

7871
01:56:48,159 --> 01:56:49,430
borderline defenseless and if you were
to attack at that moment

7872
01:56:49,430 --> 01:56:49,440
to attack at that moment
 

7873
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:51,270
to attack at that moment
if you could see it and then seize the

7874
01:56:51,270 --> 01:56:51,280
if you could see it and then seize the
 

7875
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,189
if you could see it and then seize the
moment if you were capable of both

7876
01:56:53,189 --> 01:56:53,199
moment if you were capable of both
 

7877
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:54,390
moment if you were capable of both
you should not only expect to be

7878
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:54,400
you should not only expect to be
 

7879
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:55,430
you should not only expect to be
successful you should be damn sure

7880
01:56:55,430 --> 01:56:55,440
successful you should be damn sure
 

7881
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,629
successful you should be damn sure
you're gonna be successful and more more

7882
01:56:56,629 --> 01:56:56,639
you're gonna be successful and more more
 

7883
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:57,830
you're gonna be successful and more more
important than that you'll be successful

7884
01:56:57,830 --> 01:56:57,840
important than that you'll be successful
 

7885
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,030
important than that you'll be successful
and even if you're somehow not you won't

7886
01:56:59,030 --> 01:56:59,040
and even if you're somehow not you won't
 

7887
01:56:59,040 --> 01:56:59,990
and even if you're somehow not you won't
be countered

7888
01:56:59,990 --> 01:57:00,000
be countered
 

7889
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,870
be countered
and i guess like uh that's the trick of

7890
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:02,880
and i guess like uh that's the trick of
 

7891
01:57:02,880 --> 01:57:03,350
and i guess like uh that's the trick of
almost

7892
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:03,360
almost
 

7893
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:06,070
almost
all all like conflict right it's like

7894
01:57:06,070 --> 01:57:06,080
all all like conflict right it's like
 

7895
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:07,669
all all like conflict right it's like
showing up when the other person's you

7896
01:57:07,669 --> 01:57:07,679
showing up when the other person's you
 

7897
01:57:07,679 --> 01:57:09,030
showing up when the other person's you
know taking a nap

7898
01:57:09,030 --> 01:57:09,040
know taking a nap
 

7899
01:57:09,040 --> 01:57:10,709
know taking a nap
and then it's so funny like we take like

7900
01:57:10,709 --> 01:57:10,719
and then it's so funny like we take like
 

7901
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,310
and then it's so funny like we take like
a protracted war it's like oh it takes

7902
01:57:12,310 --> 01:57:12,320
a protracted war it's like oh it takes
 

7903
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,030
a protracted war it's like oh it takes
five years

7904
01:57:13,030 --> 01:57:13,040
five years
 

7905
01:57:13,040 --> 01:57:14,629
five years
and there's you know lulls and there's a

7906
01:57:14,629 --> 01:57:14,639
and there's you know lulls and there's a
 

7907
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:15,910
and there's you know lulls and there's a
battle this month but then there's a

7908
01:57:15,910 --> 01:57:15,920
battle this month but then there's a
 

7909
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:17,189
battle this month but then there's a
couple weeks in another battle it's like

7910
01:57:17,189 --> 01:57:17,199
couple weeks in another battle it's like
 

7911
01:57:17,199 --> 01:57:18,550
couple weeks in another battle it's like
well if you just shrink that down it's

7912
01:57:18,550 --> 01:57:18,560
well if you just shrink that down it's
 

7913
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:20,550
well if you just shrink that down it's
the microcosm macrocosm idea

7914
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:20,560
the microcosm macrocosm idea
 

7915
01:57:20,560 --> 01:57:22,310
the microcosm macrocosm idea
that same thing that whole war is taking

7916
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:22,320
that same thing that whole war is taking
 

7917
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:23,910
that same thing that whole war is taking
place in five minutes or 10 minutes or

7918
01:57:23,910 --> 01:57:23,920
place in five minutes or 10 minutes or
 

7919
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:24,709
place in five minutes or 10 minutes or
15 minutes

7920
01:57:24,709 --> 01:57:24,719
15 minutes
 

7921
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:27,030
15 minutes
and there's moments of laws of person

7922
01:57:27,030 --> 01:57:27,040
and there's moments of laws of person
 

7923
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:28,790
and there's moments of laws of person

there could be something that's the
 

8059
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:38,310
there could be something that's the
literal borderline opposite of that

literal borderline opposite of that
 

8061
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:42,470

and you go huh why is that something

8062
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:42,480
and you go huh why is that something
 

8063
01:59:42,480 --> 01:59:44,390
and you go huh why is that something
like imagine like i would say almost all

8064

02:00:38,149 --> 02:00:38,159
that's a great idea
 

8139
02:00:38,159 --> 02:00:40,390
that's a great idea
is it i mean it clearly works at least

8140
02:00:40,390 --> 02:00:40,400
is it i mean it clearly works at least
 

8141
02:00:40,400 --> 02:00:41,430
is it i mean it clearly works at least
to a certain extent

8162
02:00:58,790 --> 02:00:58,800
mean that that's a terrible idea to be
 

8163

02:01:01,840 --> 02:01:03,109
no clearly it works and clearly it limit
face has function

8168
02:01:03,109 --> 02:01:03,119
face has function
 

8169
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:04,390
face has function
but what if the function that we're

8170
02:01:04,390 --> 02:01:04,400
but what if the function that we're
 

8171
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:06,070
but what if the function that we're
giving it and we're and the how much how

8172
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:06,080
giving it and we're and the how much how
 

8173
02:01:06,080 --> 02:01:08,229
giving it and we're and the how much how
much focus we're assigning to it

8174
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:08,239
much focus we're assigning to it
 

8175
02:01:08,239 --> 02:01:10,870
much focus we're assigning to it
is disproportionate to its effectiveness

8176
02:01:10,870 --> 02:01:10,880
is disproportionate to its effectiveness
 

8177
02:01:10,880 --> 02:01:12,950
is disproportionate to its effectiveness
yeah maybe what if it's not a good idea

8178
02:01:12,950 --> 02:01:12,960
yeah maybe what if it's not a good idea
 

8179
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,229
yeah maybe what if it's not a good idea
i'm not saying it's not a good idea but

8180
02:01:14,229 --> 02:01:14,239
i'm not saying it's not a good idea but
 

8181
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:16,070
i'm not saying it's not a good idea but
what if it wasn't that's a foundational

8182
02:01:16,070 --> 02:01:16,080
what if it wasn't that's a foundational
 

8183
02:01:16,080 --> 02:01:17,910
what if it wasn't that's a foundational
idea of jiu-jitsu and then how much

8184
02:01:17,910 --> 02:01:17,920
idea of jiu-jitsu and then how much
 

8185
02:01:17,920 --> 02:01:20,149
idea of jiu-jitsu and then how much
because no one questions that foundation

8186
02:01:20,149 --> 02:01:20,159
because no one questions that foundation
 

8187
02:01:20,159 --> 02:01:21,990
because no one questions that foundation
how much innovation is built on

8188
02:01:21,990 --> 02:01:22,000
how much innovation is built on
 

8189
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:23,910
how much innovation is built on
top of the idea well of course i want to

8190
02:01:23,910 --> 02:01:23,920
top of the idea well of course i want to
 

8191
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,430
top of the idea well of course i want to
be my being on my back is an okay

8192

8193
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:27,109
be my being on my back is an okay
position so now they're innovating

8194
02:01:27,109 --> 02:01:27,119
position so now they're innovating
 

8195
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:28,629
position so now they're innovating
but they're innovating within a closed

8196
02:01:28,629 --> 02:01:28,639
but they're innovating within a closed
 

8197
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:29,830
but they're innovating within a closed
system that they don't they think

8198
02:01:29,830 --> 02:01:29,840
system that they don't they think
 

8199
02:01:29,840 --> 02:01:30,709
system that they don't they think
they're innovating

8200
02:01:30,709 --> 02:01:30,719
they're innovating
 

8201
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:32,790
they're innovating
in like in this open space of oh my god

8202
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:32,800
in like in this open space of oh my god
 

8203
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,229
in like in this open space of oh my god
it could be anything when in reality

8204
02:01:34,229 --> 02:01:34,239
it could be anything when in reality
 

8205
02:01:34,239 --> 02:01:35,510
it could be anything when in reality
it could be anything within this little

8206
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
it could be anything within this little
 

8207
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:37,109
it could be anything within this little
set yeah but you don't realize that

8208
02:01:37,109 --> 02:01:37,119
set yeah but you don't realize that
 

8209
02:01:37,119 --> 02:01:38,229
set yeah but you don't realize that
you're in a set you don't realize that

8210
02:01:38,229 --> 02:01:38,239
you're in a set you don't realize that
 

8211
02:01:38,239 --> 02:01:39,350
you're in a set you don't realize that
you're in a box

02:01:39,350 --> 02:01:39,360
you're in a box
 

8213
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:40,790
you're in a box
there would be answers that would become

8214
02:01:40,790 --> 02:01:40,800
there would be answers that would become

there would be answers that would become
so immediately apparent to you

8216

so immediately apparent to you
 

8217
02:01:42,480 --> 02:01:44,229
so immediately apparent to you
if you were willing to look outside of

different positions
 

8235
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:58,950
different positions
where there's a lot of space like

02:01:58,950 --> 02:01:58,960
where there's a lot of space like
 

8237
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,149
where there's a lot of space like
a lot a lot to be discovered by

8238
02:02:02,149 --> 02:02:02,159
a lot a lot to be discovered by
 

8239
02:02:02,159 --> 02:02:04,070
a lot a lot to be discovered by
questioning the basic assumptions maybe

8240
02:02:04,070 --> 02:02:04,080
questioning the basic assumptions maybe
 

8241
02:02:04,080 --> 02:02:05,669
questioning the basic assumptions maybe
if you can give examples of like back

8242
02:02:05,669 --> 02:02:05,679
if you can give examples of like back
 

8243
02:02:05,679 --> 02:02:06,950
if you can give examples of like back
control like is there something you've

8244
02:02:06,950 --> 02:02:06,960
control like is there something you've
 

8245
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:07,990
control like is there something you've
discovered this like

8246
02:02:07,990 --> 02:02:08,000
discovered this like
 

8247
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,709
discovered this like

over to the left side i'm on the
 

8263
02:02:22,320 --> 02:02:23,350
over to the left side i'm on the
opposite side it's actually a more

8264
02:02:23,350 --> 02:02:23,360
opposite side it's actually a more
 

8265
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,709
opposite side it's actually a more
powerful position yeah for people

8266
02:02:24,709 --> 02:02:24,719
powerful position yeah for people
 

8267
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:26,070
powerful position yeah for people
listening or for people who

8268
02:02:26,070 --> 02:02:26,080
listening or for people who
 

8269
02:02:26,080 --> 02:02:29,350
listening or for people who
might not know jiu jitsu is uh seatbelt

8270
02:02:29,350 --> 02:02:29,360
might not know jiu jitsu is uh seatbelt
 

8271
02:02:29,360 --> 02:02:31,350
might not know jiu jitsu is uh seatbelt
is a control we're talking about when

8272
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
is a control we're talking about when
 

8273
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,350
is a control we're talking about when
one person is on the back of another

8274
02:02:33,350 --> 02:02:33,360
one person is on the back of another
 

8275
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:33,910
one person is on the back of another
person

8276
02:02:33,910 --> 02:02:33,920
person
 

8277
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:35,510
person
which is a really dominant position jiu

8278
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:35,520
which is a really dominant position jiu
 

8279
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:37,589
which is a really dominant position jiu
jitsu sea belt is a

8280
02:02:37,589 --> 02:02:37,599
jitsu sea belt is a
 

8281
02:02:37,599 --> 02:02:40,709
jitsu sea belt is a
i guess widely accepted

8282
02:02:40,709 --> 02:02:40,719
i guess widely accepted
 

8283
02:02:40,719 --> 02:02:42,470
i guess widely accepted
way of holding best practices almost

8284
02:02:42,470 --> 02:02:42,480
way of holding best practices almost
 

8285
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,470
way of holding best practices almost
best practices yeah and it's worked so

8286
02:02:44,470 --> 02:02:44,480
best practices yeah and it's worked so
 

8287
02:02:44,480 --> 02:02:45,109
best practices yeah and it's worked so
well

8288
02:02:45,109 --> 02:02:45,119
well
 

8289
02:02:45,119 --> 02:02:49,030
well
so it's a one arm over one arm under

8290
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:49,040
so it's a one arm over one arm under
 

8291
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:50,629
so it's a one arm over one arm under
and there's a certain side you're

8292
02:02:50,629 --> 02:02:50,639
and there's a certain side you're
 

8293
02:02:50,639 --> 02:02:52,310
and there's a certain side you're
supposed to be on

8294
02:02:52,310 --> 02:02:52,320
supposed to be on
 

8295
02:02:52,320 --> 02:02:53,669
supposed to be on
when you're on the back you know

8296
02:02:53,669 --> 02:02:53,679
when you're on the back you know
 

8297
02:02:53,679 --> 02:02:55,830
when you're on the back you know
everyone teaches there's a choking arm

8298
02:02:55,830 --> 02:02:55,840
everyone teaches there's a choking arm
 

8299
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,350
everyone teaches there's a choking arm
that's the arm that's over

8300
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:57,360
that's the arm that's over
 

8301
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:58,790
that's the arm that's over
and your body is supposed to be in a

8302
02:02:58,790 --> 02:02:58,800
and your body is supposed to be in a
 

8303
02:02:58,800 --> 02:03:00,950
and your body is supposed to be in a
certain side relative to that

8304
02:03:00,950 --> 02:03:00,960
certain side relative to that
 

8305
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:03,910
certain side relative to that
and then ryan is describing questioning

8306
02:03:03,910 --> 02:03:03,920
and then ryan is describing questioning
 

8307
02:03:03,920 --> 02:03:04,870
and then ryan is describing questioning
these like

8308
02:03:04,870 --> 02:03:04,880
these like
 

8309
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,790
these like
basic assumptions about which side

8310
02:03:06,790 --> 02:03:06,800
basic assumptions about which side
 

8311
02:03:06,800 --> 02:03:07,910
basic assumptions about which side
you're supposed to be on and let's say

8312
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:07,920
you're supposed to be on and let's say
 

8313
02:03:07,920 --> 02:03:09,189
you're supposed to be on and let's say
that's even just like a mid-level

8314
02:03:09,189 --> 02:03:09,199
that's even just like a mid-level
 

8315
02:03:09,199 --> 02:03:10,310
that's even just like a mid-level
assumption it's not even a first

8316
02:03:10,310 --> 02:03:10,320
assumption it's not even a first
 

8317
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:11,430
assumption it's not even a first
principles assumption

8318
02:03:11,430 --> 02:03:11,440
principles assumption
 

8319
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,270
principles assumption
but it's pretty supposed to it's getting

8320
02:03:13,270 --> 02:03:13,280
but it's pretty supposed to it's getting
 

8321
02:03:13,280 --> 02:03:14,870
but it's pretty supposed to it's getting
there but but let's just say for

8322
02:03:14,870 --> 02:03:14,880
there but but let's just say for
 

8323
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:16,790
there but but let's just say for
sake of argument it goes a lot deeper

8324
02:03:16,790 --> 02:03:16,800
sake of argument it goes a lot deeper
 

8325
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:18,149
sake of argument it goes a lot deeper
maybe um

8326
02:03:18,149 --> 02:03:18,159
maybe um
 

8327
02:03:18,159 --> 02:03:19,910
maybe um
i think most of the innovation that i

8328
02:03:19,910 --> 02:03:19,920
i think most of the innovation that i
 

8329
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:21,669
i think most of the innovation that i
see is not innovation

8330
02:03:21,669 --> 02:03:21,679
see is not innovation
 

8331
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:23,750
see is not innovation
it's like basically changing the color

8332
02:03:23,750 --> 02:03:23,760
it's like basically changing the color
 

8333
02:03:23,760 --> 02:03:24,790
it's like basically changing the color
of a car

8334
02:03:24,790 --> 02:03:24,800
of a car
 

8335
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:26,870
of a car
or polishing like the window a little

8336
02:03:26,870 --> 02:03:26,880
or polishing like the window a little
 

8337
02:03:26,880 --> 02:03:28,470
or polishing like the window a little
bit we're like hey you made it you made

8338
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:28,480
bit we're like hey you made it you made
 

8339
02:03:28,480 --> 02:03:29,830
bit we're like hey you made it you made
it a little bit different you made it a

8340
02:03:29,830 --> 02:03:29,840
it a little bit different you made it a
 

8341
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:30,709
it a little bit different you made it a
little bit better

8342
02:03:30,709 --> 02:03:30,719
little bit better
 

8343
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:32,310
little bit better
it's like oh man what if i did the same

8344
02:03:32,310 --> 02:03:32,320
it's like oh man what if i did the same
 

8345
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:33,910
it's like oh man what if i did the same
guard and then grab the lapel

8346
02:03:33,910 --> 02:03:33,920
guard and then grab the lapel
 

8347
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:35,669
guard and then grab the lapel
i'm not saying it's bad but you're not

8348
02:03:35,669 --> 02:03:35,679
i'm not saying it's bad but you're not
 

8349
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:37,350
i'm not saying it's bad but you're not
fundamentally changing anything i think

8350
02:03:37,350 --> 02:03:37,360
fundamentally changing anything i think
 

8351
02:03:37,360 --> 02:03:39,189
fundamentally changing anything i think
most of the big seismic shifts that we

8352
02:03:39,189 --> 02:03:39,199
most of the big seismic shifts that we
 

8353
02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:41,270
most of the big seismic shifts that we
see in almost anything come from

8354
02:03:41,270 --> 02:03:41,280
see in almost anything come from
 

8355
02:03:41,280 --> 02:03:44,229
see in almost anything come from
hey that thing we thought was right was

8356
02:03:44,229 --> 02:03:44,239
hey that thing we thought was right was
 

8357
02:03:44,239 --> 02:03:45,430
hey that thing we thought was right was
wrong rather than

8358
02:03:45,430 --> 02:03:45,440
wrong rather than
 

8359
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:47,910
wrong rather than
not only is it right it's even writer

8360
02:03:47,910 --> 02:03:47,920
not only is it right it's even writer
 

8361
02:03:47,920 --> 02:03:49,030
not only is it right it's even writer
and you're like that's not wrong it's

8362
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,040
and you're like that's not wrong it's
 

8363
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:50,149
and you're like that's not wrong it's
not bad but that's

8364
02:03:50,149 --> 02:03:50,159
not bad but that's
 

8365
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:52,069
not bad but that's
you're in it's like oh man let's say for

8366
02:03:52,069 --> 02:03:52,079
you're in it's like oh man let's say for
 

8367
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:53,030
you're in it's like oh man let's say for
instance i didn't make the triangle

8368
02:03:53,030 --> 02:03:53,040
instance i didn't make the triangle
 

8369
02:03:53,040 --> 02:03:54,229
instance i didn't make the triangle
better but let's say i made the triangle

8370
02:03:54,229 --> 02:03:54,239
better but let's say i made the triangle
 

8371
02:03:54,239 --> 02:03:55,750
better but let's say i made the triangle
a little bit better than it was or

8372
02:03:55,750 --> 02:03:55,760
a little bit better than it was or
 

8373
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:59,189
a little bit better than it was or
then it was taught um yeah i mean you

8374
02:03:59,189 --> 02:03:59,199
then it was taught um yeah i mean you
 

8375
02:03:59,199 --> 02:04:00,550
then it was taught um yeah i mean you
call it innovation i don't know man it's

8376
02:04:00,550 --> 02:04:00,560
call it innovation i don't know man it's
 

8377
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:02,069
call it innovation i don't know man it's
not like the person that said hey have

8378
02:04:02,069 --> 02:04:02,079
not like the person that said hey have
 

8379
02:04:02,079 --> 02:04:03,510
not like the person that said hey have
you guys ever heard of a triangle before

8380
02:04:03,510 --> 02:04:03,520
you guys ever heard of a triangle before
 

8381
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:05,030
you guys ever heard of a triangle before
and came up with that we're like that is

8382
02:04:05,030 --> 02:04:05,040
and came up with that we're like that is
 

8383
02:04:05,040 --> 02:04:06,470
and came up with that we're like that is
i feel like that's that's on the list

8384
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:06,480
i feel like that's that's on the list
 

8385
02:04:06,480 --> 02:04:07,750
i feel like that's that's on the list
you can do this thing to people are you

8386
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:07,760
you can do this thing to people are you
 

8387
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,069
you can do this thing to people are you
kidding me can you imagine you invented

8388
02:04:10,069 --> 02:04:10,079
kidding me can you imagine you invented
 

8389
02:04:10,079 --> 02:04:11,830
kidding me can you imagine you invented
the straight right hand you'd be like

8390
02:04:11,830 --> 02:04:11,840
the straight right hand you'd be like
 

8391
02:04:11,840 --> 02:04:13,189
the straight right hand you'd be like
one punch man you can walk around and

that
 

8491
02:05:33,280 --> 02:05:35,189
that
so yeah it's kind of fascinating to i

8492
02:05:35,189 --> 02:05:35,199
so yeah it's kind of fascinating to i
 

8493
02:05:35,199 --> 02:05:37,430
so yeah it's kind of fascinating to i
mean everything you're describing

8494
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,440
mean everything you're describing
 

8495
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,430
mean everything you're describing
is a there's a fascinating tension

8496
02:05:39,430 --> 02:05:39,440
is a there's a fascinating tension
 

8497
02:05:39,440 --> 02:05:41,109
is a there's a fascinating tension
between like whenever i show people for

8498
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:41,119
between like whenever i show people for
 

8499
02:05:41,119 --> 02:05:42,629
between like whenever i show people for
the first time what a triangle is just

8500
02:05:42,629 --> 02:05:42,639
the first time what a triangle is just
 

8501
02:05:42,639 --> 02:05:44,310
the first time what a triangle is just
like regular people

8502
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:44,320
like regular people
 

8503
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,310
like regular people
uh it's like they're discovering he's

8504
02:05:46,310 --> 02:05:46,320
uh it's like they're discovering he's
 

8505
02:05:46,320 --> 02:05:48,069
uh it's like they're discovering he's
like oh okay that's interesting i mean

8506
02:05:48,069 --> 02:05:48,079
like oh okay that's interesting i mean
 

8507
02:05:48,079 --> 02:05:49,750
like oh okay that's interesting i mean
mma has changed that but people have

8508
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:49,760
mma has changed that but people have
 

8509
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:51,430
mma has changed that but people have
haven't watched mma

8510
02:05:51,430 --> 02:05:51,440
haven't watched mma
 

8511
02:05:51,440 --> 02:05:52,870
haven't watched mma
that's an interesting move it doesn't

8512
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:52,880
that's an interesting move it doesn't
 

8513
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,709
that's an interesting move it doesn't
make sense why that would be a choke

8514
02:05:54,709 --> 02:05:54,719
make sense why that would be a choke
 

8515
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:58,149
make sense why that would be a choke
and they kind of quickly accepted that's

8516
02:05:58,149 --> 02:05:58,159
and they kind of quickly accepted that's
 

8517
02:05:58,159 --> 02:06:00,870
and they kind of quickly accepted that's
a thing and they accept the basics

8518
02:06:00,870 --> 02:06:00,880
a thing and they accept the basics
 

8519
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:02,470
a thing and they accept the basics
without questioning

8520
02:06:02,470 --> 02:06:02,480
without questioning
 

8521
02:06:02,480 --> 02:06:04,550
without questioning
wait a minute what's actually being

8522
02:06:04,550 --> 02:06:04,560
wait a minute what's actually being
 

8523
02:06:04,560 --> 02:06:06,709
wait a minute what's actually being
choked

8524
02:06:06,709 --> 02:06:06,719
choked
 

8525
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:10,470
choked
how is it that a shoulder of a person

8526
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:10,480
how is it that a shoulder of a person
 

8527
02:06:10,480 --> 02:06:13,830
how is it that a shoulder of a person
can do the choking like i'm not sure i

8528
02:06:13,830 --> 02:06:13,840
can do the choking like i'm not sure i
 

8529
02:06:13,840 --> 02:06:14,629
can do the choking like i'm not sure i
fully

8530
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:14,639
fully
 

8531
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:16,629
fully
question the fundamentals of all of that

8532
02:06:16,629 --> 02:06:16,639
question the fundamentals of all of that
 

8533
02:06:16,639 --> 02:06:18,550
question the fundamentals of all of that
like i claim i have either what exactly

8534
02:06:18,550 --> 02:06:18,560
like i claim i have either what exactly
 

8535
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:21,189
like i claim i have either what exactly
is the blood supply that's being cut off

8536
02:06:21,189 --> 02:06:21,199
is the blood supply that's being cut off
 

8537
02:06:21,199 --> 02:06:23,189
is the blood supply that's being cut off
like what what is the anatomy and the

8538
02:06:23,189 --> 02:06:23,199
like what what is the anatomy and the
 

8539
02:06:23,199 --> 02:06:24,790
like what what is the anatomy and the
physiology of all of that why does this

8540
02:06:24,790 --> 02:06:24,800
physiology of all of that why does this
 

8541
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,310
physiology of all of that why does this
work and if you understood all that what

8542
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:26,320
work and if you understood all that what
 

8543
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:28,069
work and if you understood all that what
else could we do here yeah what else can

8544
02:06:28,069 --> 02:06:28,079
else could we do here yeah what else can
 

8545
02:06:28,079 --> 02:06:29,430
else could we do here yeah what else can
we do here that's the really important

8546
02:06:29,430 --> 02:06:29,440
we do here that's the really important
 

8547
02:06:29,440 --> 02:06:31,430

and you know if you're an end user what

8582
02:06:56,790 --> 02:06:56,800
and you know if you're an end user what
 

8583
02:06:56,800 --> 02:06:57,750
and you know if you're an end user what
are you capable of

8584

significantly more experienced and more
more adept each time each time that this

02:08:24,790 --> 02:08:24,800
more adept each time each time that this
 

8683
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:25,910
more adept each time each time that this
occurred but it was like

8684
02:08:25,910 --> 02:08:25,920
occurred but it was like
 

8685
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:27,589
occurred but it was like
how many number of times did this person

8686
02:08:27,589 --> 02:08:27,599
how many number of times did this person
 

8687
02:08:27,599 --> 02:08:28,709
how many number of times did this person
submit you were past your guard in the

submit you were past your guard in the
 

8689
02:08:28,719 --> 02:08:29,910
submit you were past your guard in the
round i'm like i don't know probably

8690
02:08:29,910 --> 02:08:29,920
round i'm like i don't know probably
 

8691
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:31,430
round i'm like i don't know probably
like let's say five each one because

8692
02:08:31,430 --> 02:08:31,440
like let's say five each one because
 

8693
02:08:31,440 --> 02:08:31,669
like let's say five each one because
it's

8694
02:08:31,669 --> 02:08:31,679
it's
 

8695
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:33,189
it's
a brief period of time and let's say it

8696
02:08:33,189 --> 02:08:33,199
a brief period of time and let's say it
 

8697
02:08:33,199 --> 02:08:34,629
a brief period of time and let's say it
was three on one six on another or

was three on one six on another or
whatever

02:08:37,589 --> 02:08:37,599
it's comparable it's six one half dozen
 

8703
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:39,189
it's comparable it's six one half dozen
would i be able to easily tell the

8704
02:08:39,189 --> 02:08:39,199
would i be able to easily tell the
 

8705
02:08:39,199 --> 02:08:40,310
would i be able to easily tell the
difference

8706
02:08:40,310 --> 02:08:40,320
difference
 

8707
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:42,149
difference
no i would just say i know in concept

8708
02:08:42,149 --> 02:08:42,159
no i would just say i know in concept
 

8709
02:08:42,159 --> 02:08:43,669
no i would just say i know in concept
that he's way better

8710
02:08:43,669 --> 02:08:43,679
that he's way better
 

8711
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:45,109
that he's way better
so much better but there's plenty of

8712
02:08:45,109 --> 02:08:45,119
so much better but there's plenty of
 

8713
02:08:45,119 --> 02:08:46,390
so much better but there's plenty of
other people that could have beaten me

8714
02:08:46,390 --> 02:08:46,400
other people that could have beaten me
 

8715
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,069
other people that could have beaten me
just as bad as marcelo did when i was a

8716
02:08:48,069 --> 02:08:48,079
just as bad as marcelo did when i was a
 

8717
02:08:48,079 --> 02:08:48,790
just as bad as marcelo did when i was a
purple belt

8718
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:48,800
purple belt
 

8719
02:08:48,800 --> 02:08:50,229
purple belt
or when i was a brown belt then maybe i

8720
02:08:50,229 --> 02:08:50,239
or when i was a brown belt then maybe i
 

8721
02:08:50,239 --> 02:08:51,669
or when i was a brown belt then maybe i
would watch marcelo walk through like

8722
02:08:51,669 --> 02:08:51,679
would watch marcelo walk through like
 

8723
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:53,189
would watch marcelo walk through like
their borderline not there

8724
02:08:53,189 --> 02:08:53,199
their borderline not there
 

8725
02:08:53,199 --> 02:08:55,910
their borderline not there
so it's neat like if you that's back to

8726
02:08:55,910 --> 02:08:55,920
so it's neat like if you that's back to
 

8727
02:08:55,920 --> 02:08:57,189
so it's neat like if you that's back to
kind of what i was talking about about

8728
02:08:57,189 --> 02:08:57,199
kind of what i was talking about about
 

8729
02:08:57,199 --> 02:08:58,950
kind of what i was talking about about
certain people beginning to really

8730
02:08:58,950 --> 02:08:58,960
certain people beginning to really
 

8731
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:01,350
certain people beginning to really
like peel back some of what's really

8732
02:09:01,350 --> 02:09:01,360
like peel back some of what's really
 

8733
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:02,390
like peel back some of what's really
special about

8734
02:09:02,390 --> 02:09:02,400
special about
 

8735
02:09:02,400 --> 02:09:03,750
special about
the martial arts or any activity i

8736
02:09:03,750 --> 02:09:03,760
the martial arts or any activity i
 

8737
02:09:03,760 --> 02:09:06,149
the martial arts or any activity i
presume um is they get to a level of

8738
02:09:06,149 --> 02:09:06,159
presume um is they get to a level of
 

8739
02:09:06,159 --> 02:09:07,750
presume um is they get to a level of
understanding and depth

8740
02:09:07,750 --> 02:09:07,760
understanding and depth
 

8741
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:09,189
understanding and depth
that they're playing with like the

8742
02:09:09,189 --> 02:09:09,199
that they're playing with like the
 

8743
02:09:09,199 --> 02:09:11,430
that they're playing with like the
almost the reality of that thing

8744
02:09:11,430 --> 02:09:11,440
almost the reality of that thing
 

8745
02:09:11,440 --> 02:09:13,510
almost the reality of that thing
and i'm i'm playing by rules that are

8746
02:09:13,510 --> 02:09:13,520
and i'm i'm playing by rules that are
 

8747
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:14,550
and i'm i'm playing by rules that are
not rules i'm not

8748
02:09:14,550 --> 02:09:14,560
not rules i'm not
 

8749
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:16,069
not rules i'm not
i'm not even wanted to use a matrix

8750
02:09:16,069 --> 02:09:16,079
i'm not even wanted to use a matrix
 

8751
02:09:16,079 --> 02:09:17,750
i'm not even wanted to use a matrix
analogy i'm not even an agent which is

8752
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:17,760
analogy i'm not even an agent which is
 

8753
02:09:17,760 --> 02:09:18,069
analogy i'm not even an agent which is

the
 

8755
02:09:18,079 --> 02:09:19,750
the
best version of something playing by the

best version of something playing by the
 

8757
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,109
best version of something playing by the
rules yes

8758
02:09:21,109 --> 02:09:21,119
rules yes
 

8759
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:22,790
rules yes
i'm like one of the regular people or

8760
02:09:22,790 --> 02:09:22,800
i'm like one of the regular people or
 

8761
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,229
i'm like one of the regular people or
one of the regular people in

8762
02:09:24,229 --> 02:09:24,239
one of the regular people in
 

8763
02:09:24,239 --> 02:09:25,589
one of the regular people in
that got out of the matrix so i'm like

8764
02:09:25,589 --> 02:09:25,599
that got out of the matrix so i'm like
 

8765
02:09:25,599 --> 02:09:27,189
that got out of the matrix so i'm like
oh i'm cool but when i fight an agent i

8766
02:09:27,189 --> 02:09:27,199
oh i'm cool but when i fight an agent i
 

8767
02:09:27,199 --> 02:09:28,149
oh i'm cool but when i fight an agent i
lose

8768
02:09:28,149 --> 02:09:28,159
lose
 

8769
02:09:28,159 --> 02:09:29,910
lose
because we're both in the rules but they

8770
02:09:29,910 --> 02:09:29,920
because we're both in the rules but they
 

8771
02:09:29,920 --> 02:09:31,189
because we're both in the rules but they
just play them to the play them to the

8772
02:09:31,189 --> 02:09:31,199
just play them to the play them to the
 

8773
02:09:31,199 --> 02:09:31,990
just play them to the play them to the
bone and i'm just

8774
02:09:31,990 --> 02:09:32,000
bone and i'm just
 

8775
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,149
bone and i'm just
here well and then the agent encounters

8776
02:09:34,149 --> 02:09:34,159
here well and then the agent encounters
 

8777
02:09:34,159 --> 02:09:35,109
here well and then the agent encounters
neo and they

8778
02:09:35,109 --> 02:09:35,119
neo and they
 

8779
02:09:35,119 --> 02:09:36,709
neo and they
can do nothing you're like why because

8780
02:09:36,709 --> 02:09:36,719
can do nothing you're like why because
 

8781
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:38,870
can do nothing you're like why because
operating outside of what the rules are

8782
02:09:38,870 --> 02:09:38,880
operating outside of what the rules are
 

8783
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:40,229
operating outside of what the rules are
but not really what the rules are what

8784
02:09:40,229 --> 02:09:40,239
but not really what the rules are what
 

8785
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:41,589
but not really what the rules are what
they perceive to be the rules are

8786
02:09:41,589 --> 02:09:41,599
they perceive to be the rules are
 

8787
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:43,109
they perceive to be the rules are
clearly so anyway i guess that's kind of

8788
02:09:43,109 --> 02:09:43,119
clearly so anyway i guess that's kind of
 

8789
02:09:43,119 --> 02:09:44,709
clearly so anyway i guess that's kind of
my point about marcelo or certain other

8790
02:09:44,709 --> 02:09:44,719
my point about marcelo or certain other
 

8791
02:09:44,719 --> 02:09:45,750
my point about marcelo or certain other
people that are doing things where you

8792
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:45,760
people that are doing things where you
 

8793
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:45,990
people that are doing things where you
go

8794
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:46,000
go
 

8795
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:48,550
go
that doesn't even seem real it doesn't

8796
02:09:48,550 --> 02:09:48,560
that doesn't even seem real it doesn't
 

8797
02:09:48,560 --> 02:09:49,750
that doesn't even seem real it doesn't
seem real to me because i don't

8798
02:09:49,750 --> 02:09:49,760
seem real to me because i don't
 

8799
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:51,109
seem real to me because i don't
understand what's going on

8800
02:09:51,109 --> 02:09:51,119
understand what's going on
 

8801
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:53,030
understand what's going on
and i guess if we can get down to base

8802
02:09:53,030 --> 02:09:53,040
and i guess if we can get down to base
 

8803
02:09:53,040 --> 02:09:54,310
and i guess if we can get down to base
assumptions but like if we can

8804
02:09:54,310 --> 02:09:54,320
assumptions but like if we can
 

8805
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:55,990
assumptions but like if we can
constantly strip away strip away strip

8806
02:09:55,990 --> 02:09:56,000
constantly strip away strip away strip
 

8807
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:56,709
constantly strip away strip away strip
away

8808
02:09:56,709 --> 02:09:56,719
away
 

8809
02:09:56,719 --> 02:09:58,229
away
let's say we always thought that turning

8810
02:09:58,229 --> 02:09:58,239
let's say we always thought that turning
 

8811
02:09:58,239 --> 02:09:59,669
let's say we always thought that turning
left was right it was correct and it

8812
02:09:59,669 --> 02:09:59,679
left was right it was correct and it
 

8813
02:09:59,679 --> 02:10:01,589
left was right it was correct and it
turns out that turning right was correct

8814
02:10:01,589 --> 02:10:01,599
turns out that turning right was correct
 

8815
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:04,709
turns out that turning right was correct
it changed your life yeah it's uh what

8816
02:10:04,709 --> 02:10:04,719
it changed your life yeah it's uh what
 

8817
02:10:04,719 --> 02:10:06,550
it changed your life yeah it's uh what
is the soccer you said the unexamined

8818
02:10:06,550 --> 02:10:06,560
is the soccer you said the unexamined
 

8819
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:08,069
is the soccer you said the unexamined
life is not worth living

8820
02:10:08,069 --> 02:10:08,079
life is not worth living
 

8821
02:10:08,079 --> 02:10:10,629
life is not worth living
so you just basically have to rigorously

8822
02:10:10,629 --> 02:10:10,639
so you just basically have to rigorously
 

8823
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:12,870
so you just basically have to rigorously
just constantly examine every

8824
02:10:12,870 --> 02:10:12,880
just constantly examine every
 

8825
02:10:12,880 --> 02:10:14,310
just constantly examine every
assumption over and over and over but

8826
02:10:14,310 --> 02:10:14,320
assumption over and over and over but
 

8827
02:10:14,320 --> 02:10:15,910
assumption over and over and over but
doesn't that give your life meaning to

8828
02:10:15,910 --> 02:10:15,920
doesn't that give your life meaning to
 

8829
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:17,350
doesn't that give your life meaning to
come back to the struggle to come back

8830
02:10:17,350 --> 02:10:17,360
come back to the struggle to come back
 

8831
02:10:17,360 --> 02:10:19,030
come back to the struggle to come back
to free will to come back to what if we

8832
02:10:19,030 --> 02:10:19,040
to free will to come back to what if we
 

8833
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:19,990
to free will to come back to what if we
could strip all that away

8834
02:10:19,990 --> 02:10:20,000
could strip all that away
 

8835
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:21,430
could strip all that away
all right cool all right let me just

8836
02:10:21,430 --> 02:10:21,440
all right cool all right let me just
 

8837
02:10:21,440 --> 02:10:22,709
all right cool all right let me just
stick the needle in my in my arm and

8838
02:10:22,709 --> 02:10:22,719
stick the needle in my in my arm and
 

8839
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:23,350
stick the needle in my in my arm and
that's that

8840
02:10:23,350 --> 02:10:23,360
that's that
 

8841
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,830
that's that
yeah no i mean that that constant

8842
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:25,840
yeah no i mean that that constant
 

8843
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:27,430
yeah no i mean that that constant
striving

8844
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:27,440
striving
 

8845
02:10:27,440 --> 02:10:30,550
striving
for understanding

8846
02:10:30,550 --> 02:10:30,560
for understanding
 

8847
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:32,950
for understanding
yet another lower layer of the

8848
02:10:32,950 --> 02:10:32,960
yet another lower layer of the
 

8849
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:34,390
yet another lower layer of the
simulation we're living in

8850
02:10:34,390 --> 02:10:34,400
simulation we're living in
 

8851
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:37,270
simulation we're living in
is is is something that's actually

8852
02:10:37,270 --> 02:10:37,280
is is is something that's actually
 

8853
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:38,629
is is is something that's actually
deeply fulfilling that

8854
02:10:38,629 --> 02:10:38,639
deeply fulfilling that
 

8855
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:39,990
deeply fulfilling that
i don't know if it's genetically built

8856
02:10:39,990 --> 02:10:40,000
i don't know if it's genetically built
 

8857
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,830
i don't know if it's genetically built
in but there's something about that

8858
02:10:41,830 --> 02:10:41,840
in but there's something about that
 

8859
02:10:41,840 --> 02:10:43,990
in but there's something about that
striving to understand that seems to be

8860
02:10:43,990 --> 02:10:44,000
striving to understand that seems to be
 

8861
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,709
striving to understand that seems to be
uh deeply human but it's funny what

02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,589
this giant thing that you don't
understand

9020
02:13:01,589 --> 02:13:01,599
understand
 

9021
02:13:01,599 --> 02:13:03,270
understand
so you can forever be striving to

9022
02:13:03,270 --> 02:13:03,280
so you can forever be striving to
 

9023
02:13:03,280 --> 02:13:04,629
so you can forever be striving to
understand

9024
02:13:04,629 --> 02:13:04,639
understand
 

9025
02:13:04,639 --> 02:13:07,910
understand
because that process gives you meaning

9026
02:13:07,910 --> 02:13:07,920
because that process gives you meaning
 

9027
02:13:07,920 --> 02:13:08,550
because that process gives you meaning
but also

9028
02:13:08,550 --> 02:13:08,560
but also
 

9029
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:10,950
but also
keeps making you better like thinking

9030
02:13:10,950 --> 02:13:10,960
keeps making you better like thinking
 

9031
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:12,790
keeps making you better like thinking
that actually even just thinking that

9032
02:13:12,790 --> 02:13:12,800
that actually even just thinking that
 

9033
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:13,750
that actually even just thinking that
you can't understand

9034
02:13:13,750 --> 02:13:13,760
you can't understand
 

9035
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:16,950
you can't understand
everything will

9036
02:13:16,950 --> 02:13:16,960
everything will
 

9037
02:13:16,960 --> 02:13:20,229
everything will
lead you to stop too early so like

9038
02:13:20,229 --> 02:13:20,239
lead you to stop too early so like
 

9039
02:13:20,239 --> 02:13:23,109
lead you to stop too early so like
uh i i think there's something to

9040
02:13:23,109 --> 02:13:23,119
uh i i think there's something to
 

9041
02:13:23,119 --> 02:13:24,790
uh i i think there's something to
whether it's the soul or whether it's

9042
02:13:24,790 --> 02:13:24,800
whether it's the soul or whether it's
 

9043
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:26,790
whether it's the soul or whether it's
like religious stuff like assuming that

9044
02:13:26,790 --> 02:13:26,800
like religious stuff like assuming that
 

9045
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:28,149
like religious stuff like assuming that
there's this thing

9046
02:13:28,149 --> 02:13:28,159
there's this thing
 

9047
02:13:28,159 --> 02:13:30,550
there's this thing
that you cannot possibly understand is a

9048
02:13:30,550 --> 02:13:30,560
that you cannot possibly understand is a
 

9049
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:32,149
that you cannot possibly understand is a
really good assumption under which to

9050
02:13:32,149 --> 02:13:32,159
really good assumption under which to
 

9051
02:13:32,159 --> 02:13:33,350
really good assumption under which to
operate

9052
02:13:33,350 --> 02:13:33,360
operate
 

9053
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:34,870
operate
and underwish to do this first

9054
02:13:34,870 --> 02:13:34,880
and underwish to do this first
 

9055
02:13:34,880 --> 02:13:36,310
and underwish to do this first
principles kind of thinking because you

9056
02:13:36,310 --> 02:13:36,320
principles kind of thinking because you
 

9057
02:13:36,320 --> 02:13:38,069
principles kind of thinking because you
can just keep digging and keep digging

9058
02:13:38,069 --> 02:13:38,079
can just keep digging and keep digging
 

9059
02:13:38,079 --> 02:13:39,830
can just keep digging and keep digging
keep digging even when it seems like

9060
02:13:39,830 --> 02:13:39,840
keep digging even when it seems like
 

9061
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:41,030
keep digging even when it seems like
you're at the bottom because you don't

9062
02:13:41,030 --> 02:13:41,040
you're at the bottom because you don't
 

9063
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:42,390
you're at the bottom because you don't
[\h__\h] know if you're at the bottom or

our i guess our other kind of tangents

9070
02:13:46,709 --> 02:13:46,719
our i guess our other kind of tangents
 

9071
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:47,350
our i guess our other kind of tangents
was

9072
02:13:47,350 --> 02:13:47,360
was

that comes back to everyone's a human

9074
02:13:48,790 --> 02:13:48,800
that comes back to everyone's a human
 

9075
02:13:48,800 --> 02:13:50,550
that comes back to everyone's a human
being the smartest human being in the

9076
02:13:50,550 --> 02:13:50,560
being the smartest human being in the

history of
 

9079
02:13:51,360 --> 02:13:54,470
history of
humanity is so hilariously

9080
02:13:54,470 --> 02:13:54,480
humanity is so hilariously
 

9081
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:57,189
humanity is so hilariously
weak like short-lived and not

9082
02:13:57,189 --> 02:13:57,199
weak like short-lived and not
 

9083
02:13:57,199 --> 02:13:57,830
weak like short-lived and not
intelligent

9084
02:13:57,830 --> 02:13:57,840
intelligent
 

9085
02:13:57,840 --> 02:13:59,430
intelligent
for yourself bro i understand i didn't

9086
02:13:59,430 --> 02:13:59,440
for yourself bro i understand i didn't
 

9087
02:13:59,440 --> 02:14:00,870
for yourself bro i understand i didn't
say no i'm not saying comparison to me

9088
02:14:00,870 --> 02:14:00,880
say no i'm not saying comparison to me
 

9089
02:14:00,880 --> 02:14:02,870
say no i'm not saying comparison to me
in comparison to me everyone is awesome

9090
02:14:02,870 --> 02:14:02,880
in comparison to me everyone is awesome
 

9091
02:14:02,880 --> 02:14:04,310
in comparison to me everyone is awesome
but that's that's why i don't do the

9092
02:14:04,310 --> 02:14:04,320
but that's that's why i don't do the
 

9093
02:14:04,320 --> 02:14:06,550
but that's that's why i don't do the
goat thing but basically uh

9094
02:14:06,550 --> 02:14:06,560
goat thing but basically uh
 

9095
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:08,950
goat thing but basically uh
you know we're it's just on a cosmic

9096
02:14:08,950 --> 02:14:08,960
you know we're it's just on a cosmic
 

9097
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:10,149
you know we're it's just on a cosmic
level can you imagine if you were

9098
02:14:10,149 --> 02:14:10,159
level can you imagine if you were
 

9099
02:14:10,159 --> 02:14:11,910
level can you imagine if you were
vampire you're like 900 years old like

9100
02:14:11,910 --> 02:14:11,920
vampire you're like 900 years old like
 

9101
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,270
vampire you're like 900 years old like
how much you would seem you would seem

9102
02:14:13,270 --> 02:14:13,280
how much you would seem you would seem
 

9103
02:14:13,280 --> 02:14:14,470
how much you would seem you would seem
like a lowercase g

9104
02:14:14,470 --> 02:14:14,480
like a lowercase g
 

9105
02:14:14,480 --> 02:14:17,030
like a lowercase g
god to people yeah you'd be like how can

9106
02:14:17,030 --> 02:14:17,040
god to people yeah you'd be like how can
 

9107
02:14:17,040 --> 02:14:18,790
god to people yeah you'd be like how can
you how could you know so much how can

9108
02:14:18,790 --> 02:14:18,800
you how could you know so much how can
 

9109
02:14:18,800 --> 02:14:20,550
you how could you know so much how can
you have such a long view perspective it

9110
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:20,560
you have such a long view perspective it
 

9111
02:14:20,560 --> 02:14:21,750
you have such a long view perspective it
would be insane

9112
02:14:21,750 --> 02:14:21,760
would be insane
 

9113
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:23,270
would be insane
so i mean that it seems like we're

9114
02:14:23,270 --> 02:14:23,280
so i mean that it seems like we're
 

9115
02:14:23,280 --> 02:14:24,629
so i mean that it seems like we're
talking about ai now right we're

9116
02:14:24,629 --> 02:14:24,639
talking about ai now right we're
 

9117
02:14:24,639 --> 02:14:25,669
talking about ai now right we're
creating things that are

9118
02:14:25,669 --> 02:14:25,679
creating things that are
 

9119
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:27,270
creating things that are
infinitely smarter than us effectively

9120
02:14:27,270 --> 02:14:27,280
infinitely smarter than us effectively
 

9121
02:14:27,280 --> 02:14:28,950
infinitely smarter than us effectively
and live all this time and it's probably

9122
02:14:28,950 --> 02:14:28,960
and live all this time and it's probably
 

9123
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:31,430
and live all this time and it's probably
going to do what we tell it to do right

9124
02:14:31,430 --> 02:14:31,440
going to do what we tell it to do right
 

9125
02:14:31,440 --> 02:14:33,910
going to do what we tell it to do right
no it's probably well i hope it keeps us

9126
02:14:33,910 --> 02:14:33,920
no it's probably well i hope it keeps us
 

9127
02:14:33,920 --> 02:14:36,629
no it's probably well i hope it keeps us
around do you by the way think about

9128
02:14:36,629 --> 02:14:36,639
around do you by the way think about
 

9129
02:14:36,639 --> 02:14:39,189
around do you by the way think about
ai and the existential threats like

9130
02:14:39,189 --> 02:14:39,199
ai and the existential threats like
 

9131
02:14:39,199 --> 02:14:40,470
ai and the existential threats like
speaking of gods

9132
02:14:40,470 --> 02:14:40,480
speaking of gods
 

9133
02:14:40,480 --> 02:14:44,629
speaking of gods
iu is this whole technological world we

9134
02:14:44,629 --> 02:14:44,639
iu is this whole technological world we
 

9135
02:14:44,639 --> 02:14:46,310
iu is this whole technological world we
talked about social networks and this

9136
02:14:46,310 --> 02:14:46,320
talked about social networks and this
 

9137
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:49,750
talked about social networks and this
increasing power of technology around us

9138
02:14:49,750 --> 02:14:49,760
increasing power of technology around us
 

9139
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:51,669
increasing power of technology around us
we ourselves are becoming less human

9140
02:14:51,669 --> 02:14:51,679
we ourselves are becoming less human
 

9141
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:53,350
we ourselves are becoming less human
because we keep becoming

9142
02:14:53,350 --> 02:14:53,360
because we keep becoming
 

9143
02:14:53,360 --> 02:14:55,830
because we keep becoming
we we keep relying on technology more

9144
02:14:55,830 --> 02:14:55,840
we we keep relying on technology more
 

9145
02:14:55,840 --> 02:14:56,470
we we keep relying on technology more
and more

9146
02:14:56,470 --> 02:14:56,480
and more
 

9147
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:59,109
and more
so we're becoming kinds of cyborgs but

9148
02:14:59,109 --> 02:14:59,119
so we're becoming kinds of cyborgs but
 

9149
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:01,189
so we're becoming kinds of cyborgs but
also there's a future that's

9150
02:15:01,189 --> 02:15:01,199
also there's a future that's
 

9151
02:15:01,199 --> 02:15:04,950
also there's a future that's
quite possible where the technology

9152
02:15:04,950 --> 02:15:04,960
quite possible where the technology
 

9153
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,510
quite possible where the technology
becomes

9154
02:15:05,510 --> 02:15:05,520
becomes
 

9155
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:09,589
becomes
smarter and more powerful than us humans

9156
02:15:09,589 --> 02:15:09,599
smarter and more powerful than us humans
 

9157
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:12,629
smarter and more powerful than us humans
and you know starts

9158
02:15:12,629 --> 02:15:12,639
and you know starts
 

9159
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:14,950
and you know starts
having a life of its own in ways that

9160
02:15:14,950 --> 02:15:14,960
having a life of its own in ways that
 

9161
02:15:14,960 --> 02:15:16,790
having a life of its own in ways that
perhaps we don't imagine as human beings

9162
02:15:16,790 --> 02:15:16,800
perhaps we don't imagine as human beings
 

9163
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:18,229
perhaps we don't imagine as human beings
i don't just mean like

9164
02:15:18,229 --> 02:15:18,239
i don't just mean like
 

9165
02:15:18,239 --> 02:15:20,470
i don't just mean like
two-legged robots walking around and

9166
02:15:20,470 --> 02:15:20,480
two-legged robots walking around and
 

9167
02:15:20,480 --> 02:15:22,149
two-legged robots walking around and
being humans but smarter

9168
02:15:22,149 --> 02:15:22,159
being humans but smarter
 

9169
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:28,069
being humans but smarter
i mean like an intelligent life that's

9170
02:15:28,069 --> 02:15:28,079

 

9171
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:31,910

that's beyond and

9172
02:15:31,910 --> 02:15:31,920
that's beyond and
 

9173
02:15:31,920 --> 02:15:33,990
that's beyond and
fundamentally different than our human

9174
02:15:33,990 --> 02:15:34,000
fundamentally different than our human
 

9175
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,149
fundamentally different than our human
life is it's infinite

9176
02:15:36,149 --> 02:15:36,159
life is it's infinite
 

9177
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:38,790
life is it's infinite
it's uh also creating new species yeah

9178
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:38,800
it's uh also creating new species yeah
 

9179

02:20:09,439 --> 02:20:10,150
that's a great idea because it's such an
it's so

9494
02:20:10,150 --> 02:20:10,160
it's so
 

9495
02:20:10,160 --> 02:20:11,990
it's so
grossly imbalanced you're like this is

9496
02:20:11,990 --> 02:20:12,000
grossly imbalanced you're like this is
 

9497
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:14,150
grossly imbalanced you're like this is
wrong but but it's also on the table

9498
02:20:14,150 --> 02:20:14,160
wrong but but it's also on the table
 

9499
02:20:14,160 --> 02:20:16,630
wrong but but it's also on the table
only because of the gross imbalance so i

9500
02:20:16,630 --> 02:20:16,640
only because of the gross imbalance so i
 

9501
02:20:16,640 --> 02:20:17,990
only because of the gross imbalance so i
guess to come back it's like

9502
02:20:17,990 --> 02:20:18,000
guess to come back it's like
 

9503
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:20,790
guess to come back it's like
whether we create ai and it's on some

9504
02:20:20,790 --> 02:20:20,800
whether we create ai and it's on some
 

9505
02:20:20,800 --> 02:20:22,630
whether we create ai and it's on some
crazy level of its own or it's

9506
02:20:22,630 --> 02:20:22,640
crazy level of its own or it's
 

9507
02:20:22,640 --> 02:20:25,910
crazy level of its own or it's
i'm in charge of it or so i just it

9508
02:20:25,910 --> 02:20:25,920
i'm in charge of it or so i just it
 

9509
02:20:25,920 --> 02:20:26,630
i'm in charge of it or so i just it
seems like we're

9510
02:20:26,630 --> 02:20:26,640
seems like we're
 

9511
02:20:26,640 --> 02:20:28,710
seems like we're
we're creating you mentioned like game

let me kill those guys because i can i

02:20:46,469 --> 02:20:46,479
let me kill those guys because i can i
 

9537
02:20:46,479 --> 02:20:48,150
let me kill those guys because i can i
go this is wrong period

9538
02:20:48,150 --> 02:20:48,160
go this is wrong period
 

9539
02:20:48,160 --> 02:20:50,790
go this is wrong period
and in concept this is not an action i

9540
02:20:50,790 --> 02:20:50,800
and in concept this is not an action i
 

9541
02:20:50,800 --> 02:20:51,590
and in concept this is not an action i
should take

should take
 

9543
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:53,590

but it's also nice and easy to keep me

honest if i know that i can't get you

yeah but what happens when i can get

anything and i'm more or less

anything and i'm more or less
untouchable like that seems to me to be

02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:03,920
untouchable like that seems to me to be
 

9557
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:04,389
untouchable like that seems to me to be
like

9558
02:21:04,389 --> 02:21:04,399
like
 

9559
02:21:04,399 --> 02:21:06,710
like
like various times in colonial history

9560
02:21:06,710 --> 02:21:06,720
like various times in colonial history
 

9561
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:07,990
like various times in colonial history
you know what i mean and

9562
02:21:07,990 --> 02:21:08,000
you know what i mean and
 

9563
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:10,550
you know what i mean and
what happened we know what happened but

what happened we know what happened but
 

9565
02:21:10,560 --> 02:21:12,469
what happened we know what happened but
so the possibility of

so the possibility of
 

9567
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:15,990
so the possibility of
really bad things are plentiful the

really bad things are plentiful the
 

9569

possibilities
 

9571
02:21:17,200 --> 02:21:19,830

but are the possibilities of really

like what though i'm not saying wrong i
 

9577
02:21:23,040 --> 02:21:24,710
like what though i'm not saying wrong i
don't know so i can give a million

examples
 

9581
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:28,150
examples
one is just the examples of the parent

9582
02:21:28,150 --> 02:21:28,160
one is just the examples of the parent
 

9583
02:21:28,160 --> 02:21:29,590
one is just the examples of the parent
and the child

9584
02:21:29,590 --> 02:21:29,600
and the child
 

9585
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:32,790
and the child
uh you said uh there's a power

9586
02:21:32,790 --> 02:21:32,800
uh you said uh there's a power
 

9587
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,469
uh you said uh there's a power
differential there

9588
02:21:34,469 --> 02:21:34,479
differential there
 

9589
02:21:34,479 --> 02:21:37,990
differential there
and we don't like a parent hitting their

9590
02:21:37,990 --> 02:21:38,000
and we don't like a parent hitting their
 

9591
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,270
and we don't like a parent hitting their
child

child
 

9593
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:41,190
child
about not just hitting like beating like

9594
02:21:41,190 --> 02:21:41,200
about not just hitting like beating like
 

9595
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,110
about not just hitting like beating like
really yeah great

9596
02:21:43,110 --> 02:21:43,120
really yeah great
 

9597
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:47,030
really yeah great
beating their child how often

9598
02:21:47,030 --> 02:21:47,040
beating their child how often
 

9599
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:48,550
beating their child how often
percentage-wise do you see that

9600
02:21:48,550 --> 02:21:48,560
percentage-wise do you see that
 

9601
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:50,790
percentage-wise do you see that
happening even though that that that

9602
02:21:50,790 --> 02:21:50,800
happening even though that that that
 

9603
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:53,510
happening even though that that that
uh power differential first of all other

9604
02:21:53,510 --> 02:21:53,520
uh power differential first of all other
 

9605
02:21:53,520 --> 02:21:53,990
uh power differential first of all other
people's

people's
 

9607

people's
kids let's just put this on the table i

9608
02:21:56,550 --> 02:21:56,560
kids let's just put this on the table i
 

9609
02:21:56,560 --> 02:21:57,429
kids let's just put this on the table i
love kids

9610
02:21:57,429 --> 02:21:57,439
love kids
 

9611
02:21:57,439 --> 02:21:59,429
love kids
but other people's kids can be annoying

9612
02:21:59,429 --> 02:21:59,439
but other people's kids can be annoying
 

9613
02:21:59,439 --> 02:22:01,349
but other people's kids can be annoying
sometimes sometimes you got to deal out

9614
02:22:01,349 --> 02:22:01,359
sometimes sometimes you got to deal out
 

9615
02:22:01,359 --> 02:22:03,750
sometimes sometimes you got to deal out
some justice i get it

9616
02:22:03,750 --> 02:22:03,760
some justice i get it
 

9617
02:22:03,760 --> 02:22:05,670
some justice i get it
but we don't practice we don't take

9618
02:22:05,670 --> 02:22:05,680
but we don't practice we don't take
 

9619
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:07,590
but we don't practice we don't take
advantage of that power differential

9620
02:22:07,590 --> 02:22:07,600
advantage of that power differential
 

9621
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:09,750
advantage of that power differential
so like there is ethics there's

9622
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:09,760
so like there is ethics there's
 

9623
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:10,790
so like there is ethics there's
moralities that

9624
02:22:10,790 --> 02:22:10,800
moralities that
 

9625
02:22:10,800 --> 02:22:14,150
moralities that
emerge that allow the power differential

9626
02:22:14,150 --> 02:22:14,160
emerge that allow the power differential
 

9627
02:22:14,160 --> 02:22:15,270
emerge that allow the power differential
to be used for good

9628
02:22:15,270 --> 02:22:15,280
to be used for good
 

9629
02:22:15,280 --> 02:22:18,630
to be used for good
versus for bad so like you're one of the

9630
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:18,640
versus for bad so like you're one of the
 

9631
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:19,510
versus for bad so like you're one of the
assumptions

9632
02:22:19,510 --> 02:22:19,520
assumptions

9657
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:43,270

possible when the power differential

9658
02:22:43,270 --> 02:22:43,280
possible when the power differential
 

9659
02:22:43,280 --> 02:22:44,309
possible when the power differential
grows

9660
02:22:44,309 --> 02:22:44,319
grows
 

9661
02:22:44,319 --> 02:22:46,870
grows
the incentive the joy whatever the

02:22:46,870 --> 02:22:46,880
the incentive the joy whatever the
 

9663
02:22:46,880 --> 02:22:48,309
the incentive the joy whatever the
mechanisms that

9664
02:22:48,309 --> 02:22:48,319
mechanisms that
 

9665
02:22:48,319 --> 02:22:51,030
mechanisms that
uh made sense when it was at the same

9666
02:22:51,030 --> 02:22:51,040
uh made sense when it was at the same
 

9667
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:51,750
uh made sense when it was at the same
level

9668
02:22:51,750 --> 02:22:51,760
level
 

9669
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:53,270
level
that the incentives become very

9670
02:22:53,270 --> 02:22:53,280
that the incentives become very
 

9671
02:22:53,280 --> 02:22:55,750
that the incentives become very
different it's not as fun to destroy the

9672
02:22:55,750 --> 02:22:55,760
different it's not as fun to destroy the
 

9673
02:22:55,760 --> 02:22:56,870

ant colony

9674
02:22:56,870 --> 02:22:56,880
ant colony
 

9675
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:59,510
ant colony
you start becoming more the kind of a

9676
02:22:59,510 --> 02:22:59,520
you start becoming more the kind of a
 

9677
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:00,870
you start becoming more the kind of a
conservationist

9678
02:23:00,870 --> 02:23:00,880
conservationist
 

9679
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:02,870
conservationist
like one hopes it's an evolved

9680
02:23:02,870 --> 02:23:02,880
like one hopes it's an evolved
 

9681
02:23:02,880 --> 02:23:04,070
like one hopes it's an evolved
perspective though yeah

9682
02:23:04,070 --> 02:23:04,080
perspective though yeah
 

9683
02:23:04,080 --> 02:23:05,990
perspective though yeah
well i don't know if it's evolved or not

9684
02:23:05,990 --> 02:23:06,000
well i don't know if it's evolved or not
 

9685
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:07,670
well i don't know if it's evolved or not
but it's definitely a possibility it's

9686
02:23:07,670 --> 02:23:07,680
but it's definitely a possibility it's
 

9687
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:09,910
but it's definitely a possibility it's
unclear to me that something that's many

9688
02:23:09,910 --> 02:23:09,920
unclear to me that something that's many
 

9689
02:23:09,920 --> 02:23:11,670
unclear to me that something that's many
orders of magnitude more powerful than

9690
02:23:11,670 --> 02:23:11,680
orders of magnitude more powerful than
 

9691
02:23:11,680 --> 02:23:14,870
orders of magnitude more powerful than
us will want to destroy us well i mean

9692
02:23:14,870 --> 02:23:14,880
us will want to destroy us well i mean
 

9693
02:23:14,880 --> 02:23:15,510
us will want to destroy us well i mean
what did we

9694
02:23:15,510 --> 02:23:15,520
what did we
 

9695
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:17,510
what did we
what did i mean how did how did mass

9696
02:23:17,510 --> 02:23:17,520
what did i mean how did how did mass
 

9697
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:18,870
what did i mean how did how did mass
slavery occur how did

9698
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:18,880
slavery occur how did
 

9699
02:23:18,880 --> 02:23:21,590
slavery occur how did
you know like just big dogs playing with

9700
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:21,600
you know like just big dogs playing with
 

9701
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:22,309
you know like just big dogs playing with
not

9702
02:23:22,309 --> 02:23:22,319
not
 

9703
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:25,349
not
i think i think slavery and

9704
02:23:25,349 --> 02:23:25,359
i think i think slavery and
 

9705
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:29,670
i think i think slavery and
a lot of the atrocities in history

9706
02:23:29,670 --> 02:23:29,680
a lot of the atrocities in history
 

9707
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:31,910
a lot of the atrocities in history
happened when the power differential was

9708
02:23:31,910 --> 02:23:31,920
happened when the power differential was
 

9709
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:32,710
happened when the power differential was
not as great

9710
02:23:32,710 --> 02:23:32,720
not as great
 

9711
02:23:32,720 --> 02:23:35,030
not as great
as as we're talking about with ai

9712
02:23:35,030 --> 02:23:35,040
as as we're talking about with ai
 

9713
02:23:35,040 --> 02:23:35,750
as as we're talking about with ai
potentially

9714
02:23:35,750 --> 02:23:35,760
potentially
 

9715
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:38,630
potentially
is that not somehow worse than it's not

9716
02:23:38,630 --> 02:23:38,640
is that not somehow worse than it's not
 

9717
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:39,349
is that not somehow worse than it's not
obvious to me

9718
02:23:39,349 --> 02:23:39,359
obvious to me
 

9719
02:23:39,359 --> 02:23:40,790
obvious to me
it's not obvious that things that are

9720
02:23:40,790 --> 02:23:40,800
it's not obvious that things that are
 

9721
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:43,030
it's not obvious that things that are
way more powerful

9722
02:23:43,030 --> 02:23:43,040
way more powerful
 

9723
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:44,950
way more powerful
that's fair okay so i think i i think

9724
02:23:44,950 --> 02:23:44,960
that's fair okay so i think i i think
 

9725
02:23:44,960 --> 02:23:46,150
that's fair okay so i think i i think
you're i guess how do you restrain it

9726
02:23:46,150 --> 02:23:46,160
you're i guess how do you restrain it
 

9727
02:23:46,160 --> 02:23:47,190
you're i guess how do you restrain it
though

9728
02:23:47,190 --> 02:23:47,200
though
 

9729
02:23:47,200 --> 02:23:48,710
though
uh there there's a lot of different

9730
02:23:48,710 --> 02:23:48,720
uh there there's a lot of different
 

9731
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:50,389
uh there there's a lot of different
discussions of how to

9732
02:23:50,389 --> 02:23:50,399
discussions of how to
 

9733
02:23:50,399 --> 02:23:52,150
discussions of how to
uh i just even restrain each other

9734
02:23:52,150 --> 02:23:52,160
uh i just even restrain each other
 

9735
02:23:52,160 --> 02:23:53,190
uh i just even restrain each other
because let's say i go and decide to

9736
02:23:53,190 --> 02:23:53,200
because let's say i go and decide to
 

9737
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:54,550
because let's say i go and decide to
strike someone's child which i'd like to

9738
02:23:54,550 --> 02:23:54,560
strike someone's child which i'd like to
 

9739
02:23:54,560 --> 02:23:55,510
strike someone's child which i'd like to
think i wouldn't do

9740
02:23:55,510 --> 02:23:55,520
think i wouldn't do
 

9741
02:23:55,520 --> 02:23:57,670
think i wouldn't do
yes i will be promptly i will find

9742
02:23:57,670 --> 02:23:57,680
yes i will be promptly i will find
 

9743
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,270
yes i will be promptly i will find
myself in front of a judge

9744
02:23:59,270 --> 02:23:59,280
myself in front of a judge
 

9745
02:23:59,280 --> 02:24:01,270
myself in front of a judge
and so i feel like there's a lot can you

9746
02:24:01,270 --> 02:24:01,280
and so i feel like there's a lot can you
 

9747
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:02,550
and so i feel like there's a lot can you
imagine how many people used to get

9748
02:24:02,550 --> 02:24:02,560
imagine how many people used to get
 

9749
02:24:02,560 --> 02:24:03,270
imagine how many people used to get
murdered

9750
02:24:03,270 --> 02:24:03,280
murdered
 

9751
02:24:03,280 --> 02:24:06,150
murdered
just in the woods yeah i mean i would

9752
02:24:06,150 --> 02:24:06,160
just in the woods yeah i mean i would
 

9753
02:24:06,160 --> 02:24:07,590
just in the woods yeah i mean i would
just presume it's a lot

9754
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:07,600
just presume it's a lot
 

9755
02:24:07,600 --> 02:24:09,750
just presume it's a lot
you know and i don't think most people

9756
02:24:09,750 --> 02:24:09,760
you know and i don't think most people
 

9757
02:24:09,760 --> 02:24:11,270
you know and i don't think most people
are lunatics like that but i would just

9758
02:24:11,270 --> 02:24:11,280
are lunatics like that but i would just
 

9759
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:12,150
are lunatics like that but i would just
say that's the point

9760
02:24:12,150 --> 02:24:12,160
say that's the point
 

9761
02:24:12,160 --> 02:24:13,510
say that's the point
if you're given though if you're given

9762
02:24:13,510 --> 02:24:13,520
if you're given though if you're given
 

9763
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,670
if you're given though if you're given
to that your ability to get away with it

9764
02:24:15,670 --> 02:24:15,680
to that your ability to get away with it
 

9765
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:17,590
to that your ability to get away with it
was was greater in the past because a

9766
02:24:17,590 --> 02:24:17,600
was was greater in the past because a
 

9767
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:19,510
was was greater in the past because a
chance of detection was less

9768
02:24:19,510 --> 02:24:19,520
chance of detection was less
 

9769
02:24:19,520 --> 02:24:22,790
chance of detection was less
so does it i don't know this is what

9770
02:24:22,790 --> 02:24:22,800
so does it i don't know this is what
 

9771
02:24:22,800 --> 02:24:24,309
so does it i don't know this is what
that's called an artificial intelligence

9772
02:24:24,309 --> 02:24:24,319
that's called an artificial intelligence
 

9773
02:24:24,319 --> 02:24:25,990
that's called an artificial intelligence

you have to create mechanisms

9798
02:24:50,389 --> 02:24:50,399
you have to create mechanisms
 

9799
02:24:50,399 --> 02:24:52,710
you have to create mechanisms
where you both value the same things i

9800
02:24:52,710 --> 02:24:52,720
where you both value the same things i
 

9801
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:53,910
where you both value the same things i
guess one thing i wonder

9802
02:24:53,910 --> 02:24:53,920
guess one thing i wonder
 

9803
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:56,710
guess one thing i wonder
so i guess i'm probably not like sharp

9804
02:24:56,710 --> 02:24:56,720
so i guess i'm probably not like sharp
 

9805
02:24:56,720 --> 02:24:58,230
so i guess i'm probably not like sharp
enough to grasp this if i'm honest but i

9806
02:24:58,230 --> 02:24:58,240
enough to grasp this if i'm honest but i
 

9807
02:24:58,240 --> 02:24:59,990
enough to grasp this if i'm honest but i
guess like i wonder like uh

9808
02:24:59,990 --> 02:25:00,000
guess like i wonder like uh

02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:03,030

i used the chess programs um you know

9810
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:03,040
i used the chess programs um you know
 

9811
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:03,990
i used the chess programs um you know
was deep blue

stock fish and then like alpha zero and
alpha zero teaching itself to beat

9816
02:25:08,710 --> 02:25:08,720
alpha zero teaching itself to beat
 

9817
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:11,590
alpha zero teaching itself to beat
stock stockfish without any help in four

9818
02:25:11,590 --> 02:25:11,600
stock stockfish without any help in four
 

9819
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,710
stock stockfish without any help in four
hours yeah yeah like

9820
02:25:12,710 --> 02:25:12,720
hours yeah yeah like
 

9821
02:25:12,720 --> 02:25:15,190
hours yeah yeah like
it becomes orders of magnitude more

9822
02:25:15,190 --> 02:25:15,200
it becomes orders of magnitude more
 

9823
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:17,510
it becomes orders of magnitude more
intelligence than us in effectively

9824
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:17,520
intelligence than us in effectively
 

9825
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:19,750
intelligence than us in effectively
an instantaneous period i guess what i

9826
02:25:19,750 --> 02:25:19,760
an instantaneous period i guess what i
 

9827
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:21,190
an instantaneous period i guess what i
always wondered like uh

9828
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:21,200
always wondered like uh
 

9829
02:25:21,200 --> 02:25:24,389
always wondered like uh
if you were that much smarter than me

9830
02:25:24,389 --> 02:25:24,399
if you were that much smarter than me
 

9831
02:25:24,399 --> 02:25:25,910
if you were that much smarter than me
i feel like your ability to manipulate

9832
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:25,920
i feel like your ability to manipulate
 

9833
02:25:25,920 --> 02:25:27,190
i feel like your ability to manipulate
me would be pretty significant or at

9834
02:25:27,190 --> 02:25:27,200
me would be pretty significant or at
 

9835
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:28,550
me would be pretty significant or at
least potentially you know

9836
02:25:28,550 --> 02:25:28,560
least potentially you know
 

9837
02:25:28,560 --> 02:25:32,070
least potentially you know
but manipulation

9838
02:25:32,070 --> 02:25:32,080
but manipulation
 

9839
02:25:32,080 --> 02:25:34,710
but manipulation
implies that the incentive is to

9840
02:25:34,710 --> 02:25:34,720
implies that the incentive is to
 

9841
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:35,590
implies that the incentive is to
overpower

9842
02:25:35,590 --> 02:25:35,600
overpower
 

9843
02:25:35,600 --> 02:25:38,389
overpower
everything around you like there's

9844
02:25:38,389 --> 02:25:38,399
everything around you like there's
 

9845
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:39,590
everything around you like there's
implied incentives

9846
02:25:39,590 --> 02:25:39,600
implied incentives
 

9847
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:42,630
implied incentives
if your value is to actually

9848
02:25:42,630 --> 02:25:42,640
if your value is to actually
 

9849
02:25:42,640 --> 02:25:47,270
if your value is to actually
like uh it depends what you want in life

9850
02:25:47,270 --> 02:25:47,280
like uh it depends what you want in life
 

9851
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:49,590
like uh it depends what you want in life
okay what you want in your system like

9852
02:25:49,590 --> 02:25:49,600
okay what you want in your system like
 

9853
02:25:49,600 --> 02:25:51,270
okay what you want in your system like
it's it's not clear

9854
02:25:51,270 --> 02:25:51,280
it's it's not clear
 

9855
02:25:51,280 --> 02:25:53,110
it's it's not clear
that the goal of an ai system that's

9856
02:25:53,110 --> 02:25:53,120
that the goal of an ai system that's
 

9857
02:25:53,120 --> 02:25:55,030
that the goal of an ai system that's
all-powerful is to destroy

9858
02:25:55,030 --> 02:25:55,040
all-powerful is to destroy
 

9859
02:25:55,040 --> 02:25:56,710
all-powerful is to destroy
all humans no i don't think that i don't

9860
02:25:56,710 --> 02:25:56,720
all humans no i don't think that i don't
 

9861
02:25:56,720 --> 02:25:57,910
all humans no i don't think that i don't
think that it is either i guess we're

9862
02:25:57,910 --> 02:25:57,920
think that it is either i guess we're
 

9863
02:25:57,920 --> 02:26:00,309
think that it is either i guess we're
going to even enslave all humans

9864
02:26:00,309 --> 02:26:00,319
going to even enslave all humans
 

9865
02:26:00,319 --> 02:26:01,750
going to even enslave all humans
that's fair i guess what i'm trying to

9866
02:26:01,750 --> 02:26:01,760
that's fair i guess what i'm trying to
 

9867
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:03,830
that's fair i guess what i'm trying to
suggest is that something adequately

9868
02:26:03,830 --> 02:26:03,840
suggest is that something adequately
 

9869
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:04,469
suggest is that something adequately
powerful

9870
02:26:04,469 --> 02:26:04,479
powerful
 

9871
02:26:04,479 --> 02:26:06,790

these these actions are on the table yes

9872
02:26:06,790 --> 02:26:06,800
these these actions are on the table yes
 

9873
02:26:06,800 --> 02:26:08,230
these these actions are on the table yes
they're on the table and that's scary

9874
02:26:08,230 --> 02:26:08,240
they're on the table and that's scary
 

9875
02:26:08,240 --> 02:26:09,349
they're on the table and that's scary
and that's why a lot of people are

9876
02:26:09,349 --> 02:26:09,359
and that's why a lot of people are
 

9877
02:26:09,359 --> 02:26:10,950
and that's why a lot of people are
really concerned about it and are

taking actions last minute there's
 

9945
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:30,870
taking actions last minute there's
something about the innovative spirit

uh to experience the stress and anxiety
of the deadline

9992
02:28:17,670 --> 02:28:17,680
of the deadline
 

9993
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:19,990
of the deadline
because you're just you're not going to

9994
02:28:19,990 --> 02:28:20,000
because you're just you're not going to
 

9995

so it doesn't make any it's completely

10000
02:28:25,429 --> 02:28:25,439
so it doesn't make any it's completely
 

10001
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:26,950
so it doesn't make any it's completely
irrational

10002
02:28:26,950 --> 02:28:26,960
irrational
 

10003
02:28:26,960 --> 02:28:28,790
irrational
to uh to a function based on the

10005
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,230
to uh to a function based on the
deadline you should have a system a

10006
02:28:30,230 --> 02:28:30,240
deadline you should have a system a
 

10007
02:28:30,240 --> 02:28:32,230
deadline you should have a system a
process that gets stuff a little bit of

productive and well thought out that
 

10057
02:29:17,840 --> 02:29:19,190
productive and well thought out that
whatever i've decided to think about

10058
02:29:19,190 --> 02:29:19,200
whatever i've decided to think about
 

10059
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:21,110
whatever i've decided to think about
trying to monkey wrench in there is uh

10060
02:29:21,110 --> 02:29:21,120
trying to monkey wrench in there is uh
 

10061
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,389
trying to monkey wrench in there is uh
is definitely going to be able to deal

10062
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:22,399
is definitely going to be able to deal
 

10063
02:29:22,399 --> 02:29:23,990
is definitely going to be able to deal
with but it's funny that again because

10064
02:29:23,990 --> 02:29:24,000
with but it's funny that again because
 

10065
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:24,870
with but it's funny that again because
you're a human being

10066
02:29:24,870 --> 02:29:24,880
you're a human being
 

10067
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:26,630
you're a human being
not a god all of your strengths are you

10068
02:29:26,630 --> 02:29:26,640
not a god all of your strengths are you
 

10069
02:29:26,640 --> 02:29:28,389
not a god all of your strengths are you
have a corresponding weakness

10070
02:29:28,389 --> 02:29:28,399
have a corresponding weakness
 

10071
02:29:28,399 --> 02:29:30,070
have a corresponding weakness
the less you practice working under the

10072
02:29:30,070 --> 02:29:30,080
the less you practice working under the
 

10073
02:29:30,080 --> 02:29:31,750
the less you practice working under the
gun the less comfortable you are working

10074
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:31,760
gun the less comfortable you are working
 

10075
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:33,349
gun the less comfortable you are working
under the gun the more practice you have

10076
02:29:33,349 --> 02:29:33,359
under the gun the more practice you have
 

10077
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:34,550
under the gun the more practice you have
working under the gun the better you get

10078
02:29:34,550 --> 02:29:34,560
working under the gun the better you get
 

10079
02:29:34,560 --> 02:29:36,230
working under the gun the better you get
it the downside is you're always working

10080
02:29:36,230 --> 02:29:36,240
it the downside is you're always working
 

10081
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:38,070
it the downside is you're always working
on the gun so you're less productive or

10082
02:29:38,070 --> 02:29:38,080
on the gun so you're less productive or
 

10083
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:39,910
on the gun so you're less productive or
it's like your work quality maybe drops

10084
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:39,920
it's like your work quality maybe drops
 

10085
02:29:39,920 --> 02:29:41,270
it's like your work quality maybe drops
so it's an interesting thing it's like

10086
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:41,280
so it's an interesting thing it's like
 

10087
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,190
so it's an interesting thing it's like
it's almost like hey i wonder if this i

10088
02:29:43,190 --> 02:29:43,200
it's almost like hey i wonder if this i
 

10089
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:43,830
it's almost like hey i wonder if this i
wonder if

10090
02:29:43,830 --> 02:29:43,840
wonder if
 

10091
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:45,510
wonder if
khabib nurmagomedov has a lot of heart

10092
02:29:45,510 --> 02:29:45,520
khabib nurmagomedov has a lot of heart
 

10093
02:29:45,520 --> 02:29:46,950
khabib nurmagomedov has a lot of heart
and i'd say the answer is almost

10094
02:29:46,950 --> 02:29:46,960
and i'd say the answer is almost
 

10095
02:29:46,960 --> 02:29:47,590
and i'd say the answer is almost
certainly yes

10096
02:29:47,590 --> 02:29:47,600
certainly yes
 

10097
02:29:47,600 --> 02:29:49,429
certainly yes
but you go well he hasn't struggled a

10098
02:29:49,429 --> 02:29:49,439
but you go well he hasn't struggled a
 

10099
02:29:49,439 --> 02:29:51,349
but you go well he hasn't struggled a
bunch maybe he doesn't struggle well and

10100
02:29:51,349 --> 02:29:51,359
bunch maybe he doesn't struggle well and
 

10101
02:29:51,359 --> 02:29:52,710
bunch maybe he doesn't struggle well and
it just so happens that he can also work

10102
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:52,720
it just so happens that he can also work
 

10103
02:29:52,720 --> 02:29:53,750
it just so happens that he can also work
under the gun really well he just

10104
02:29:53,750 --> 02:29:53,760
under the gun really well he just
 

10105
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:54,710
under the gun really well he just
doesn't like to do it

10106
02:29:54,710 --> 02:29:54,720
doesn't like to do it
 

10107
02:29:54,720 --> 02:29:56,309
doesn't like to do it
yeah but uh yeah but it's an interesting

10108
02:29:56,309 --> 02:29:56,319
yeah but uh yeah but it's an interesting
 

10109
02:29:56,319 --> 02:29:57,670
yeah but uh yeah but it's an interesting
thing it's like i guess what is it the

10110
02:29:57,670 --> 02:29:57,680
thing it's like i guess what is it the
 

10111
02:29:57,680 --> 02:29:59,429
thing it's like i guess what is it the
aristotle we are what we repeatedly do

10112
02:29:59,429 --> 02:29:59,439
aristotle we are what we repeatedly do
 

10113
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:00,150
aristotle we are what we repeatedly do
we are all

10114
02:30:00,150 --> 02:30:00,160
we are all

we're all practicing something all the
 

10117
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:03,990
we're all practicing something all the
time so i guess it's it's funny

10118
02:30:03,990 --> 02:30:04,000
time so i guess it's it's funny
 

10119
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:05,030
time so i guess it's it's funny
i guess that's a question that i have

10120
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:05,040
i guess that's a question that i have
 

10121

always always but certain things have
 

10129
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:16,230
always always but certain things have
like a degree of like

10130
02:30:16,230 --> 02:30:16,240
like a degree of like
 

10131
02:30:16,240 --> 02:30:19,510
like a degree of like
entropy in the system and you go i need

10132
02:30:19,510 --> 02:30:19,520
entropy in the system and you go i need
 

10133
02:30:19,520 --> 02:30:21,429
entropy in the system and you go i need
to practice working under the gun

10134
02:30:21,429 --> 02:30:21,439
to practice working under the gun
 

10135
02:30:21,439 --> 02:30:22,710
to practice working under the gun
and i'm not saying that's what i need to

10136
02:30:22,710 --> 02:30:22,720
and i'm not saying that's what i need to
 

10137
02:30:22,720 --> 02:30:24,389
and i'm not saying that's what i need to
do because fighting it should be for the

10138
02:30:24,389 --> 02:30:24,399
do because fighting it should be for the
 

10139
02:30:24,399 --> 02:30:25,590
do because fighting it should be for the
most part it's a really sterile

10140
02:30:25,590 --> 02:30:25,600
most part it's a really sterile
 

10141
02:30:25,600 --> 02:30:26,790
most part it's a really sterile
environment the grand scheme of things

10142
02:30:26,790 --> 02:30:26,800
environment the grand scheme of things
 

10143
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:28,550
environment the grand scheme of things
like fighting in a cage is very sterile

10144
02:30:28,550 --> 02:30:28,560
like fighting in a cage is very sterile
 

10145
02:30:28,560 --> 02:30:29,910
like fighting in a cage is very sterile
compared to most other things in life

10146
02:30:29,910 --> 02:30:29,920
compared to most other things in life
 

10147
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:30,550
compared to most other things in life
right

10148
02:30:30,550 --> 02:30:30,560
right
 

10149
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:33,830
right
but dangerous but sterile and uh unless

10150
02:30:33,830 --> 02:30:33,840
but dangerous but sterile and uh unless
 

10151
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:35,270
but dangerous but sterile and uh unless
of course like you know

10152
02:30:35,270 --> 02:30:35,280
of course like you know
 

10153
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:37,030
of course like you know
like the other guy the ref decides to

10154
02:30:37,030 --> 02:30:37,040
like the other guy the ref decides to
 

10155
02:30:37,040 --> 02:30:38,950
like the other guy the ref decides to
hit you should be hilarious but um

10156
02:30:38,950 --> 02:30:38,960
hit you should be hilarious but um
 

10157
02:30:38,960 --> 02:30:40,630
hit you should be hilarious but um
anyway i guess just going like okay so

10158
02:30:40,630 --> 02:30:40,640
anyway i guess just going like okay so
 

10159
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,389
anyway i guess just going like okay so
at what value do you get

10160
02:30:42,389 --> 02:30:42,399
at what value do you get
 

10161
02:30:42,399 --> 02:30:45,670
at what value do you get
out of adding a degree of let's say you

10162
02:30:45,670 --> 02:30:45,680
out of adding a degree of let's say you
 

10163
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:47,510
out of adding a degree of let's say you
could even be planned by someone else

10164
02:30:47,510 --> 02:30:47,520
could even be planned by someone else
 

10165
02:30:47,520 --> 02:30:50,230
could even be planned by someone else
but junk in the system and you just have

10166
02:30:50,230 --> 02:30:50,240
but junk in the system and you just have
 

10167
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:51,910
but junk in the system and you just have
to work under the gun to make it happen

10168
02:30:51,910 --> 02:30:51,920
to work under the gun to make it happen
 

10169
02:30:51,920 --> 02:30:52,950
to work under the gun to make it happen
let's say for instance for like

10170
02:30:52,950 --> 02:30:52,960
let's say for instance for like
 

10171
02:30:52,960 --> 02:30:54,309
let's say for instance for like
police or something like that the

10172
02:30:54,309 --> 02:30:54,319
police or something like that the
 

10173
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:55,990
police or something like that the
situation turns left hard

10174
02:30:55,990 --> 02:30:56,000
situation turns left hard
 

10175
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,990
situation turns left hard
at some random point in time that could

10176
02:30:57,990 --> 02:30:58,000
at some random point in time that could
 

10177
02:30:58,000 --> 02:30:59,030
at some random point in time that could
happen to

10178
02:30:59,030 --> 02:30:59,040
happen to
 

10179
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:00,309
happen to
any number of people so i guess it's

10180
02:31:00,309 --> 02:31:00,319
any number of people so i guess it's
 

10181
02:31:00,319 --> 02:31:01,990
any number of people so i guess it's
interesting things that allow for

10182
02:31:01,990 --> 02:31:02,000
interesting things that allow for
 

10183
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:03,590
interesting things that allow for
perfect planning or quasi-perfect

10184
02:31:03,590 --> 02:31:03,600
perfect planning or quasi-perfect
 

10185
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:04,710
perfect planning or quasi-perfect
planning versus things that are

10186
02:31:04,710 --> 02:31:04,720
planning versus things that are
 

10187
02:31:04,720 --> 02:31:06,309
planning versus things that are
inherently unstable

10188
02:31:06,309 --> 02:31:06,319
inherently unstable
 

10189
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:07,750
inherently unstable
and then what are the what's the

10190
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:07,760
and then what are the what's the
 

10191
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:10,150
and then what are the what's the
psychological fallout of comfort with

10192
02:31:10,150 --> 02:31:10,160
psychological fallout of comfort with
 

10193
02:31:10,160 --> 02:31:10,550
psychological fallout of comfort with
that

10194
02:31:10,550 --> 02:31:10,560
that
 

10195
02:31:10,560 --> 02:31:11,670
that
because i think a lot of people that are

10196
02:31:11,670 --> 02:31:11,680
because i think a lot of people that are
 

10197
02:31:11,680 --> 02:31:14,230
because i think a lot of people that are
really comfortable under the gun

10198
02:31:14,230 --> 02:31:14,240
really comfortable under the gun
 

10199
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:16,070
really comfortable under the gun
let it happen a lot for all the good and

10200
02:31:16,070 --> 02:31:16,080
let it happen a lot for all the good and
 

10201
02:31:16,080 --> 02:31:17,429
let it happen a lot for all the good and
the bad of that does that make sense no

10202
02:31:17,429 --> 02:31:17,439
the bad of that does that make sense no
 

10203
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:17,750
the bad of that does that make sense no
that

10204
02:31:17,750 --> 02:31:17,760
that
 

10205
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,670
that
totally makes sense it was i mean his

10206
02:31:19,670 --> 02:31:19,680
totally makes sense it was i mean his
 

10207
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:20,870
totally makes sense it was i mean his
answer would be

10208
02:31:20,870 --> 02:31:20,880
answer would be
 

10209
02:31:20,880 --> 02:31:23,590
answer would be
that you have to be honest with yourself

10210
02:31:23,590 --> 02:31:23,600
that you have to be honest with yourself
 

10211
02:31:23,600 --> 02:31:26,550
that you have to be honest with yourself
if it's valuable for the your success

10212
02:31:26,550 --> 02:31:26,560
if it's valuable for the your success
 

10213
02:31:26,560 --> 02:31:29,670
if it's valuable for the your success
to practice being under the gun and then

10214
02:31:29,670 --> 02:31:29,680
to practice being under the gun and then
 

10215
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,270
to practice being under the gun and then
you should schedule that john then he's

10216
02:31:31,270 --> 02:31:31,280
you should schedule that john then he's
 

10217
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:33,030
you should schedule that john then he's
smart you should plan that

10218
02:31:33,030 --> 02:31:33,040
smart you should plan that
 

10219
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,110
smart you should plan that
you should systematically and then as

10220
02:31:35,110 --> 02:31:35,120
you should systematically and then as
 

10221
02:31:35,120 --> 02:31:36,230
you should systematically and then as
opposed to doing it

10222
02:31:36,230 --> 02:31:36,240
opposed to doing it
 

10223
02:31:36,240 --> 02:31:38,469
opposed to doing it
half-assedly because it's as opposed to

10224
02:31:38,469 --> 02:31:38,479
half-assedly because it's as opposed to
 

10225
02:31:38,479 --> 02:31:41,190
half-assedly because it's as opposed to
letting the environment choose

10226
02:31:41,190 --> 02:31:41,200
letting the environment choose
 

10227
02:31:41,200 --> 02:31:42,710
letting the environment choose
the randomness like control the

10228
02:31:42,710 --> 02:31:42,720
the randomness like control the
 

10229
02:31:42,720 --> 02:31:44,230
the randomness like control the
randomness to where

10230
02:31:44,230 --> 02:31:44,240
randomness to where
 

10231
02:31:44,240 --> 02:31:46,950
randomness to where
like you optimize it i was just it's so

10232
02:31:46,950 --> 02:31:46,960
like you optimize it i was just it's so
 

10233
02:31:46,960 --> 02:31:48,469
like you optimize it i was just it's so
efficient it's shocking just to hear

10234
02:31:48,469 --> 02:31:48,479
efficient it's shocking just to hear
 

10235
02:31:48,479 --> 02:31:48,950
efficient it's shocking just to hear
about it

10236
02:31:48,950 --> 02:31:48,960
about it
 

10237
02:31:48,960 --> 02:31:51,990
about it
yeah no he's he's i mean the same way

10238
02:31:51,990 --> 02:31:52,000
yeah no he's he's i mean the same way
 

10239
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:53,510
yeah no he's he's i mean the same way
you are he's annoying in the same way

10240
02:31:53,510 --> 02:31:53,520
you are he's annoying in the same way
 

10241
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:55,590
you are he's annoying in the same way
which is like he he drops

10242
02:31:55,590 --> 02:31:55,600
which is like he he drops
 

10243
02:31:55,600 --> 02:31:58,309
which is like he he drops
truth bombs it's like yeah yeah that's

10244
02:31:58,309 --> 02:31:58,319
truth bombs it's like yeah yeah that's
 

10245
02:31:58,319 --> 02:31:59,429
truth bombs it's like yeah yeah that's
so true

10246
02:31:59,429 --> 02:31:59,439
so true
 

10247
02:31:59,439 --> 02:32:01,590
so true
yeah we're probably comparably you know

10248
02:32:01,590 --> 02:32:01,600
yeah we're probably comparably you know
 

10249
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:04,950
yeah we're probably comparably you know
doing that you know

10250
02:32:04,950 --> 02:32:04,960

 

10251
02:32:04,960 --> 02:32:07,429

but he's so he his profession requires

10252
02:32:07,429 --> 02:32:07,439
but he's so he his profession requires
 

10253
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:08,550
but he's so he his profession requires
that so he's not just like a

10254
02:32:08,550 --> 02:32:08,560
that so he's not just like a
 

10255
02:32:08,560 --> 02:32:09,990
that so he's not just like a
motivational speaker or whatever he

10256
02:32:09,990 --> 02:32:10,000
motivational speaker or whatever he
 

10257
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,349
motivational speaker or whatever he
uh he's a a computer science theoretical

10258
02:32:13,349 --> 02:32:13,359
uh he's a a computer science theoretical
 

10259
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:15,110
uh he's a a computer science theoretical
computer scientist and

10260
02:32:15,110 --> 02:32:15,120
computer scientist and
 

10261
02:32:15,120 --> 02:32:18,070
computer scientist and
he needs the long hours in the day of

10262
02:32:18,070 --> 02:32:18,080
he needs the long hours in the day of
 

10263
02:32:18,080 --> 02:32:18,550
he needs the long hours in the day of
doing

10264
02:32:18,550 --> 02:32:18,560
doing
 

10265
02:32:18,560 --> 02:32:20,550
doing
like serious math so it's mostly math

10266
02:32:20,550 --> 02:32:20,560
like serious math so it's mostly math
 

10267
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,830
like serious math so it's mostly math
proofs and

10268
02:32:21,830 --> 02:32:21,840
proofs and
 

10269
02:32:21,840 --> 02:32:23,590
proofs and
for that you have to sit and think

10270
02:32:23,590 --> 02:32:23,600
for that you have to sit and think
 

10271
02:32:23,600 --> 02:32:26,150
for that you have to sit and think
really deeply it's like really hard work

10272
02:32:26,150 --> 02:32:26,160
really deeply it's like really hard work
 

10273
02:32:26,160 --> 02:32:28,469
really deeply it's like really hard work
compared to like uh what most people do

10274
02:32:28,469 --> 02:32:28,479
compared to like uh what most people do
 

10275
02:32:28,479 --> 02:32:29,190
compared to like uh what most people do
like

10276
02:32:29,190 --> 02:32:29,200
like
 

10277
02:32:29,200 --> 02:32:31,349
like
even when i i mean what i do like

10278
02:32:31,349 --> 02:32:31,359
even when i i mean what i do like
 

10279
02:32:31,359 --> 02:32:33,349
even when i i mean what i do like
programming is way easier than

10280
02:32:33,349 --> 02:32:33,359
programming is way easier than
 

10281
02:32:33,359 --> 02:32:35,670
programming is way easier than
rigorous math proofs because you have to

10282
02:32:35,670 --> 02:32:35,680
rigorous math proofs because you have to
 

10283
02:32:35,680 --> 02:32:37,670
rigorous math proofs because you have to
basically have this machine

10284
02:32:37,670 --> 02:32:37,680
basically have this machine
 

10285
02:32:37,680 --> 02:32:41,270
basically have this machine
and you have to uh your brain to churn

10286

and holding that for 10 minutes 20
 

10297
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:52,550
and holding that for 10 minutes 20
minutes hopefully several hours

so you keep running up against the wall
 

10307
02:33:00,720 --> 02:33:02,630

like that whole frustration
that's serious mental work that's like

10314
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:09,760
that's serious mental work that's like
 

10315
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:11,510
that's serious mental work that's like
incredibly difficult mental work so he

10316
02:33:11,510 --> 02:33:11,520
incredibly difficult mental work so he
 

10317
02:33:11,520 --> 02:33:12,790
incredibly difficult mental work so he
knows what he's talking about that's

10318
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:12,800
knows what he's talking about that's
 

10319
02:33:12,800 --> 02:33:13,190
knows what he's talking about that's
something

10320
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:13,200
something
 

10321
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,030
something
that's amazing but like you said he's

10322
02:33:15,030 --> 02:33:15,040
that's amazing but like you said he's
 

10323
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:16,469
that's amazing but like you said he's
like this seems like the standard for

10324
02:33:16,469 --> 02:33:16,479
like this seems like the standard for
 

10325
02:33:16,479 --> 02:33:18,830
like this seems like the standard for
the quality of work that he needs is so

10326
02:33:18,830 --> 02:33:18,840
the quality of work that he needs is so
 

10327
02:33:18,840 --> 02:33:19,590
the quality of work that he needs is so
high so

10328
02:33:19,590 --> 02:33:19,600
high so
 

10329
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:21,429
high so
almost anything less than this level of

10330
02:33:21,429 --> 02:33:21,439
almost anything less than this level of
 

10331
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:23,510
almost anything less than this level of
systematization and organization would

10332
02:33:23,510 --> 02:33:23,520
systematization and organization would
 

10333
02:33:23,520 --> 02:33:25,030
systematization and organization would
preclude it right so he can't

10334
02:33:25,030 --> 02:33:25,040
preclude it right so he can't
 

10335
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:26,630
preclude it right so he can't
afford the kind of [\h__\h] that i don't

10336
02:33:26,630 --> 02:33:26,640
afford the kind of [\h__\h] that i don't

uh you know there are a lot of
lessons to be learned even from from

lessons to be learned even from from
times in history or bad experience that

times in history or bad experience that
 

11167
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:44,790
times in history or bad experience that
we have and the question is can we take

we have and the question is can we take
 

11169
02:45:44,800 --> 02:45:46,550

those lessons and move forward
and that's again what i think we're

11172
02:45:47,670 --> 02:45:47,680
and that's again what i think we're
 

11173
02:45:47,680 --> 02:45:49,990
and that's again what i think we're
seeing and sometimes socially right now

11174
02:45:49,990 --> 02:45:50,000
seeing and sometimes socially right now
 

11175

we're forgetting important lessons of
the past and that's not good

11178
02:45:53,590 --> 02:45:53,600
the past and that's not good
 

11179
02:45:53,600 --> 02:45:55,910
the past and that's not good
not saying hey i don't get why we why we

11180
02:45:55,910 --> 02:45:55,920
not saying hey i don't get why we why we
 

11181
02:45:55,920 --> 02:45:57,429
not saying hey i don't get why we why we
could be going in this direction or that

11182
02:45:57,429 --> 02:45:57,439
could be going in this direction or that
 

11183
02:45:57,439 --> 02:45:59,030
could be going in this direction or that
i understand entirely but

11184

i understand entirely but
 

11185
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:01,030
i understand entirely but
hey let's not forget the lesson so we

11186
02:46:01,030 --> 02:46:01,040
hey let's not forget the lesson so we
 

11187
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:02,309
hey let's not forget the lesson so we
don't have to learn them again

don't have to learn them again
 

11189

don't have to learn them again
because that doesn't really serve

11190
02:46:04,389 --> 02:46:04,399
because that doesn't really serve
 

11191

11527
02:50:51,200 --> 02:50:52,070
beyond that and a lot further than i've
thought about it but i guess what i

11528
02:50:52,070 --> 02:50:52,080
thought about it but i guess what i
 

11529
02:50:52,080 --> 02:50:53,590
thought about it but i guess what i
would just say is again recognition of

11530
02:50:53,590 --> 02:50:53,600
would just say is again recognition of
 

11531
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,030
would just say is again recognition of
the humanity and others

11532
02:50:55,030 --> 02:50:55,040
the humanity and others
 

11533
02:50:55,040 --> 02:50:56,870
the humanity and others
and that we all have different strengths

11534
02:50:56,870 --> 02:50:56,880
and that we all have different strengths
 

11535
02:50:56,880 --> 02:50:57,910
and that we all have different strengths
we all have different weaknesses and

11536
02:50:57,910 --> 02:50:57,920
we all have different weaknesses and
 

11537
02:50:57,920 --> 02:50:59,190
we all have different weaknesses and
it's you can never really be sure where

11538
02:50:59,190 --> 02:50:59,200
it's you can never really be sure where
 

11539
02:50:59,200 --> 02:51:00,309
it's you can never really be sure where
the other person is coming from but if

11540
02:51:00,309 --> 02:51:00,319
the other person is coming from but if
 

11541
02:51:00,319 --> 02:51:01,190
the other person is coming from but if
we approach things

11542
02:51:01,190 --> 02:51:01,200
we approach things
 

11543
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:03,190
we approach things
charitably as charitably as we would

11544
02:51:03,190 --> 02:51:03,200
charitably as charitably as we would
 

11545
02:51:03,200 --> 02:51:05,510
charitably as charitably as we would
hope others would approach us

11546
02:51:05,510 --> 02:51:05,520
hope others would approach us
 

11547
02:51:05,520 --> 02:51:06,710
hope others would approach us
i think we'll do a lot better and i

11548
02:51:06,710 --> 02:51:06,720
i think we'll do a lot better and i
 

11549
02:51:06,720 --> 02:51:08,230
i think we'll do a lot better and i
guess one thing that i read that i liked

11550
02:51:08,230 --> 02:51:08,240
guess one thing that i read that i liked
 

11551
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:09,349
guess one thing that i read that i liked
that i thought was accurate and

11552
02:51:09,349 --> 02:51:09,359
that i thought was accurate and
 

11553
02:51:09,359 --> 02:51:11,110
that i thought was accurate and
unfortunately disappointing was everyone

11554
02:51:11,110 --> 02:51:11,120
unfortunately disappointing was everyone
 

11555
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:11,830
unfortunately disappointing was everyone
is a great

11556
02:51:11,830 --> 02:51:11,840
is a great
 

11557
02:51:11,840 --> 02:51:14,150
is a great
uh you know jury or their i'm sorry a

11558
02:51:14,150 --> 02:51:14,160
uh you know jury or their i'm sorry a
 

11559
02:51:14,160 --> 02:51:15,670
uh you know jury or their i'm sorry a
great lawyer for themselves and a judge

11560
02:51:15,670 --> 02:51:15,680
great lawyer for themselves and a judge
 

11561
02:51:15,680 --> 02:51:17,190
great lawyer for themselves and a judge
for others

11562
02:51:17,190 --> 02:51:17,200
for others
 

11563
02:51:17,200 --> 02:51:18,309
for others
and i think that's a terrible way to

11564
02:51:18,309 --> 02:51:18,319
and i think that's a terrible way to
 

11565
02:51:18,319 --> 02:51:19,750
and i think that's a terrible way to
live life even if it's an understandable

11566
02:51:19,750 --> 02:51:19,760
live life even if it's an understandable
 

11567
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:20,309
live life even if it's an understandable
one

11568
02:51:20,309 --> 02:51:20,319
one
 

11569
02:51:20,319 --> 02:51:21,510
one
yeah i don't know what's happening and

11570
02:51:21,510 --> 02:51:21,520
yeah i don't know what's happening and
 

11571
02:51:21,520 --> 02:51:23,429
yeah i don't know what's happening and
then probably flipping that is the right

11572
02:51:23,429 --> 02:51:23,439
then probably flipping that is the right
 

11573
02:51:23,439 --> 02:51:24,630
then probably flipping that is the right
way to live

11574
02:51:24,630 --> 02:51:24,640
way to live
 

11575
02:51:24,640 --> 02:51:27,110
way to live
being uh being constantly judgmental of

02:51:27,120 --> 02:51:28,469
being uh being constantly judgmental of
yourself

11578
02:51:28,469 --> 02:51:28,479

and a defender of others and that

11580
02:51:30,469 --> 02:51:30,479
and a defender of others and that
 

11581
02:51:30,479 --> 02:51:31,750
and a defender of others and that
results ultimately in

11582
02:51:31,750 --> 02:51:31,760
results ultimately in
 

11583
02:51:31,760 --> 02:51:34,550
results ultimately in
interaction that de-escalates versus

11584
02:51:34,550 --> 02:51:34,560
interaction that de-escalates versus
 

11585
02:51:34,560 --> 02:51:35,269
interaction that de-escalates versus
escalates

11586
02:51:35,269 --> 02:51:35,279

right yeah and you can you can we can
 

11589
02:51:37,359 --> 02:51:38,630
right yeah and you can you can we can
all live in a world like that and

11590
02:51:38,630 --> 02:51:38,640
all live in a world like that and
 

11591
02:51:38,640 --> 02:51:39,910
all live in a world like that and
sometimes you're like hey man people

11592
02:51:39,910 --> 02:51:39,920
sometimes you're like hey man people
 

11593
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:41,590
sometimes you're like hey man people
that deserve punishment won't get it

11594
02:51:41,590 --> 02:51:41,600
that deserve punishment won't get it
 

11595
02:51:41,600 --> 02:51:43,349

like okay hey what do they say better to

like okay hey what do they say better to
 

11597
02:51:43,359 --> 02:51:45,190
like okay hey what do they say better to
have you know 10 guilty people go free

have you know 10 guilty people go free
 

11599

have you know 10 guilty people go free
then one innocent person you know

11600
02:51:46,870 --> 02:51:46,880
then one innocent person you know
 

11601
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:50,230
then one innocent person you know
burn and ultimately that is i think that

02:51:50,230 --> 02:51:50,240
burn and ultimately that is i think that
 

11603
02:51:50,240 --> 02:51:51,910
burn and ultimately that is i think that
is a better world than the other way
