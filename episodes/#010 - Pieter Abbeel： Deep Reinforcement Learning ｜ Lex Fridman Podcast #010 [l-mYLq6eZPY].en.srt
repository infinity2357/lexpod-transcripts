it's kind of an interesting question
 

55
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,830
it's kind of an interesting question
because for a lot of the challenges we

56
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:12,840
because for a lot of the challenges we
 

57
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,920
because for a lot of the challenges we
think about in AI the software is really

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:15,930
think about in AI the software is really
 

59
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,510
think about in AI the software is really
the missing piece but for something like

60
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:17,520
the missing piece but for something like
 

61
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,499
the missing piece but for something like
this the hardware is nowhere near either

62
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:21,509
this the hardware is nowhere near either

a racket that's a hardware problem I

74
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:38,460
a racket that's a hardware problem I
 

75
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,920
a racket that's a hardware problem I
don't think it's a harder problem only I

76
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:39,930
don't think it's a harder problem only I
 

77
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:40,880
don't think it's a harder problem only I
think it's a hardware and a software

78
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:40,890
think it's a hardware and a software
 

79
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:43,340
think it's a hardware and a software
problem I think it's both and I think

80
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:43,350
problem I think it's both and I think
 

81
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,080
problem I think it's both and I think
they'll they'll have independent

82
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,090
they'll they'll have independent
 

83
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,170
they'll they'll have independent
progress so I'd say the the hardware

84
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:48,180
progress so I'd say the the hardware
 

85
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,370
progress so I'd say the the hardware
maybe in 10-15 years I'm just late not

86
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:52,380
maybe in 10-15 years I'm just late not
 

87
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,649
maybe in 10-15 years I'm just late not
grass I've dressed with a sliding yeah

88
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:54,659
grass I've dressed with a sliding yeah
 

89
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:57,380

oh plague I'm not sure what's Carter

90
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,390
oh plague I'm not sure what's Carter
 

91
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,789

grass or clay the clay involves sliding

92
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:00,799
grass or clay the clay involves sliding
 

93
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,679

which might be harder to master actually

94
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:03,689
which might be harder to master actually
 

95
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:08,570

yeah but you're not limited to bipedal I

96
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:08,580
yeah but you're not limited to bipedal I
 

97
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,699
yeah but you're not limited to bipedal I
mean I'm sure there's I can build a

98
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:10,709
mean I'm sure there's I can build a
 

99
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,350
mean I'm sure there's I can build a
machine it's a whole different question

100
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:12,360
machine it's a whole different question
 

101
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,309
machine it's a whole different question
of course you know

102
00:02:13,309 --> 00:02:13,319
of course you know
 

103
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:14,959
of course you know
you can if you can say okay this robot

104
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:14,969
you can if you can say okay this robot
 

105
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,149
you can if you can say okay this robot
can be on wheels they can move around on

106
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:17,159
can be on wheels they can move around on
 

107
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:19,309
can be on wheels they can move around on
wheels and can be designed differently

108
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:19,319
wheels and can be designed differently
 

109
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,309
wheels and can be designed differently
then I think that that can be done

110
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:22,319
then I think that that can be done
 

111
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,770
then I think that that can be done
sooner probably than a full humanoid

112
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:24,780
sooner probably than a full humanoid
 

113
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,989
sooner probably than a full humanoid
type of setup what do you think is swing

114
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:26,999
type of setup what do you think is swing
 

115
00:02:26,999 --> 00:02:29,750
type of setup what do you think is swing
a racket so you've worked at basic

116
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:29,760
a racket so you've worked at basic
 

117
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,209
a racket so you've worked at basic
manipulation how hard do you think is

118
00:02:32,209 --> 00:02:32,219
manipulation how hard do you think is
 

119
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,940
manipulation how hard do you think is
the task of swinging or racket would be

120
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:34,950
the task of swinging or racket would be
 

121
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,770
the task of swinging or racket would be
able to hit a nice backhand or a

122
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:36,780
able to hit a nice backhand or a
 

123
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,679
able to hit a nice backhand or a
forehand

124
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:38,689
forehand
 

125
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:41,089
forehand
okay let's say let's say we just set up

126
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:41,099
okay let's say let's say we just set up
 

127
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,030
okay let's say let's say we just set up
stationary a nice robot arm let's say

128
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,040
stationary a nice robot arm let's say
 

129
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,309
stationary a nice robot arm let's say
you know a standard industrial arm and

130
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:46,319
you know a standard industrial arm and
 

131
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,009
you know a standard industrial arm and
it can wash the ball come and then swing

132
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:49,019
it can wash the ball come and then swing
 

133
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,800
it can wash the ball come and then swing
the racket it's a good question I'm not

134
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:51,810
the racket it's a good question I'm not
 

135
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,390
the racket it's a good question I'm not
sure it would be super hard to do I mean

136
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:56,400
sure it would be super hard to do I mean
 

137
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,520
sure it would be super hard to do I mean
I'm sure it would require a lot if we do

138
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,530
I'm sure it would require a lot if we do
 

139
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:00,080
I'm sure it would require a lot if we do
it breed with reinforced Maleny would

140
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,090
it breed with reinforced Maleny would
 

141
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,610
it breed with reinforced Maleny would
require a lot of trial and error it's

142
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:01,620
require a lot of trial and error it's
 

143
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:02,929
require a lot of trial and error it's
not gonna swing it right the first time

144
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:02,939
not gonna swing it right the first time
 

145
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:06,259
not gonna swing it right the first time
around but yeah I don't I don't see why

146
00:03:06,259 --> 00:03:06,269
around but yeah I don't I don't see why
 

147
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,740
around but yeah I don't I don't see why
I couldn't see the right way I think

148
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:09,750
I couldn't see the right way I think
 

149
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,300
I couldn't see the right way I think
it's learn about I think if you set up a

150
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:11,310
it's learn about I think if you set up a
 

151
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,369
it's learn about I think if you set up a
ball machine let's say on one side and

152
00:03:13,369 --> 00:03:13,379
ball machine let's say on one side and
 

153
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:16,129
ball machine let's say on one side and
then a robot with a tennis racket on the

154
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:16,139
then a robot with a tennis racket on the
 

155
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:16,789
then a robot with a tennis racket on the
other side

156
00:03:16,789 --> 00:03:16,799
other side
 

157
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:20,929
other side
I think it's learn about and maybe a

158
00:03:20,929 --> 00:03:20,939
I think it's learn about and maybe a
 

159
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:21,979
I think it's learn about and maybe a
little bit of pre training and

160
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:21,989
little bit of pre training and
 

161
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:24,439
little bit of pre training and
simulation yeah I think that's I think

162
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:24,449
simulation yeah I think that's I think
 

163
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:26,089
simulation yeah I think that's I think
that's feasible I think I think the

164
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:26,099
that's feasible I think I think the
 

165
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,439
that's feasible I think I think the
swinging the racket is feasible I'd be

166
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:27,449
swinging the racket is feasible I'd be
 

167
00:03:27,449 --> 00:03:28,429
swinging the racket is feasible I'd be
very interesting to see how much

168
00:03:28,429 --> 00:03:28,439
very interesting to see how much

00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:31,160
very interesting to see how much
precision it can get

170

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,939
having one-on-one interaction so I got
to spend some time alone and there's a

to spend some time alone and there's a

the fundamentals how it works there's
 

261
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:25,439
the fundamentals how it works there's
something magical so do you think about

262
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:25,449
something magical so do you think about
 

263
00:05:25,449 --> 00:05:27,689
something magical so do you think about
the psychology of interacting with

the psychology of interacting with

just showed me the pr2 the the robot and

268
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:33,460
just showed me the pr2 the the robot and
 

269
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,430
just showed me the pr2 the the robot and
and there was a little bit something

270
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:35,440
and there was a little bit something
 

271
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,980
and there was a little bit something
like a face head a little bit something

like a face head a little bit something
 

273
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,000
like a face head a little bit something
like a face there's something that

00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,050
immediately draws you to it do you think
 

277
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,680
immediately draws you to it do you think
about that aspect of

about that aspect of
 

279
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,690
about that aspect of
of the robotics problem well it's very

280
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:45,700
of the robotics problem well it's very
 

281
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,900
of the robotics problem well it's very
hard with bread here we'll give him a

287
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,000

think of the robot as a person and it

288
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,010
think of the robot as a person and it
 

289
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,010
think of the robot as a person and it
seems like everybody calls him a he for

290
00:05:59,010 --> 00:05:59,020
seems like everybody calls him a he for
 

291
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,450
seems like everybody calls him a he for
whatever reason but that also makes it

292
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:00,460
whatever reason but that also makes it
 

293
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,740
whatever reason but that also makes it
more a person than if it was a it and

294
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:03,750
more a person than if it was a it and
 

295
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,690
more a person than if it was a it and
it's it seems pretty natural to think of

00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:06,700
it's it seems pretty natural to think of

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,250
it's it seems pretty natural to think of
it that way this past weekend really

struck me I've seen pepper many times on
 

301
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,340
struck me I've seen pepper many times on
on videos but then I was at an event

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:14,350
on videos but then I was at an event

pepper to have the personality of a
child a little bit and it was very hard

312
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:27,460
child a little bit and it was very hard
 

313
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:31,020
child a little bit and it was very hard
to not think of it as its own person in

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,030
to not think of it as its own person in
 

315
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,640
to not think of it as its own person in
some sense because it was just kind of

I would say a lot a lot of people ask

I would say a lot a lot of people ask
 

351
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,400
I would say a lot a lot of people ask
and I think part of why they ask it is

352
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:11,410
and I think part of why they ask it is
 

353
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,210
and I think part of why they ask it is
they're thinking about how unique are we

emotion can it really interact with us

emotion can it really interact with us
 

365
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,440
emotion can it really interact with us
in that way and then once you're around

366
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:28,450
in that way and then once you're around
 

367
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,210
in that way and then once you're around

very hard to do for a person but much
 

435
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,320
very hard to do for a person but much
easier is for a person to say okay what

nicer than we did the previous five
 

441
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,770
nicer than we did the previous five
minutes and that now gives a comparison

yeah purely from feedback I like this
better than that that's kind of equally

it figured out what it was the person

00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,130
it figured out what it was the person
was asking for it namely a back flip and

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,820
mind what I wanted to do a back flip but
the robot didn't know what it was

476
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:29,830
the robot didn't know what it was
 

477
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:31,320
the robot didn't know what it was
supposed to be doing it just knew that

478
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:31,330
supposed to be doing it just knew that
 

479
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,300
supposed to be doing it just knew that
sometimes the person said this is better

this is worse and then the robot figure

00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:35,620
this is worse and then the robot figure
 

483
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,960
this is worse and then the robot figure
it out what the person was actually

484
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:36,970
it out what the person was actually
 

485
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,300
it out what the person was actually
after was a back flip and I'd imagine

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,310
after was a back flip and I'd imagine
 

487
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,160
after was a back flip and I'd imagine
the same would be true for things like

the same would be true for things like

00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:53,360
when you have a sparse reward you do

when you have a sparse reward you do

you take a hundred actions and then you

00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:56,510
you take a hundred actions and then you
 

545
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,690
you take a hundred actions and then you
get a reward and maybe get like a score

546
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:58,700
get a reward and maybe get like a score
 

547
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,750
get a reward and maybe get like a score
of three and I'm like okay three not

sure what that means you go again and

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:03,650

551
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:06,010
sure what that means you go again and
now I get to and now you know that that

552
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,020
now I get to and now you know that that
 

553
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,390
now I get to and now you know that that
sequence of hundred actions that you did

554
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:07,400
sequence of hundred actions that you did
 

555
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,070

the second time around somehow was worse

the second time around somehow was worse
 

557
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,660
the second time around somehow was worse
than the sequence of hundred actions you

558
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:10,670
than the sequence of hundred actions you
 

559
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,760
than the sequence of hundred actions you
did the first time around but that's

560
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:12,770
did the first time around but that's
 

561
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,320
did the first time around but that's
tough to now know which one of those

562
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:14,330
tough to now know which one of those
 

563
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:15,580
tough to now know which one of those
were better or worse some might have

564
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:15,590
were better or worse some might have
 

565
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:17,920
were better or worse some might have
been good and bad in either one and so

566
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:17,930
been good and bad in either one and so
 

567
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,930
been good and bad in either one and so
that's why I need so many experience but

568
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:19,940
that's why I need so many experience but
 

569
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,130
that's why I need so many experience but
once you have enough experiences

570
00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:21,140
once you have enough experiences

now let's update the neural network to

586
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:37,130
now let's update the neural network to
 

587
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,770
now let's update the neural network to
make the actions that were kind of

588
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:38,780
make the actions that were kind of
 

589
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:41,020
make the actions that were kind of
present when things are good more likely

590
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,030
present when things are good more likely
 

591
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,090
present when things are good more likely
and make the actions that are present

592
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:43,100
and make the actions that are present
 

593
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,800
and make the actions that are present
when things are not as good less likely

594
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:44,810
when things are not as good less likely
 

595
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,200
when things are not as good less likely
so that's that is the counterpoint but

596
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,210
so that's that is the counterpoint but
 

597
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,510
so that's that is the counterpoint but
it seems like you would need to run it a

00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:49,520
it seems like you would need to run it a
 

599
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,520
it seems like you would need to run it a
lot more than you do even though right

600
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:51,530
lot more than you do even though right
 

601
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:53,440

now people could say that RL is very

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,450
now people could say that RL is very
 

603
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:55,450
now people could say that RL is very
inefficient but it seems to be way more

00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:55,460
inefficient but it seems to be way more
 

605
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,460
inefficient but it seems to be way more

complex dynamical system but the

00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:15,829
complex dynamical system but the
 

675
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,699
complex dynamical system but the
controller is relatively simple and so I

676
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:18,709
controller is relatively simple and so I
 

677
00:13:18,709 --> 00:13:20,350
controller is relatively simple and so I
think that's a big part of is that if

678
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:20,360
think that's a big part of is that if
 

679
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,840
think that's a big part of is that if
you do feedback control even though the

680
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:22,850
you do feedback control even though the
 

681
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,400
you do feedback control even though the
system you control can be very very

architectures can already do a lot but

686
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:30,649
architectures can already do a lot but
 

687
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:32,050

then also just linear is not good enough

688
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,060
then also just linear is not good enough
 

689
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,000
then also just linear is not good enough
and so one way you can think of these

690
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,010
and so one way you can think of these
 

691
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:35,680
and so one way you can think of these
neural networks is that in sometimes

692
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:35,690
neural networks is that in sometimes
 

693
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,600
neural networks is that in sometimes
they tile the space which people were

they tile the space which people were
already trying to do more by hand or

with finite state machines say this

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:41,600
with finite state machines say this

linear controller here this leaner

700
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:42,800
linear controller here this leaner
 

701
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,860
linear controller here this leaner
controller here you'll network learns

702
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:44,870
controller here you'll network learns
 

703
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:46,569
controller here you'll network learns
that alva spins a linear controller here

704
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:46,579
that alva spins a linear controller here
 

705
00:13:46,579 --> 00:13:48,579
that alva spins a linear controller here
another linear controller here but it's

706
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:48,589
another linear controller here but it's
 

707
00:13:48,589 --> 00:13:50,440
another linear controller here but it's
more subtle than that yeah and so it's

708
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:50,450
more subtle than that yeah and so it's
 

709
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,639
more subtle than that yeah and so it's
benefiting from this linear control

710
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:51,649
benefiting from this linear control
 

711
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,740
benefiting from this linear control
aspect is benefiting from the tiling but

712
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:53,750
aspect is benefiting from the tiling but
 

713
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,319
aspect is benefiting from the tiling but
it's somehow tiling it one dimension at

714
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:56,329
it's somehow tiling it one dimension at
 

715
00:13:56,329 --> 00:13:58,389
it's somehow tiling it one dimension at
a time because if let's say you have a

716
00:13:58,389 --> 00:13:58,399
a time because if let's say you have a
 

717
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,480
a time because if let's say you have a
two layer network even the hidden layer

718
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,490
two layer network even the hidden layer
 

719
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,300
two layer network even the hidden layer
you make a transition from active to

720
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,310
you make a transition from active to
 

721
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,819
you make a transition from active to
inactive or the other way around that is

722
00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:06,829
inactive or the other way around that is
 

723
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:09,160
inactive or the other way around that is
essentially one axis but not acts as a

724
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:09,170
essentially one axis but not acts as a
 

725
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:11,769
essentially one axis but not acts as a
line but one direction that you change

726
00:14:11,769 --> 00:14:11,779
line but one direction that you change
 

727
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,569
line but one direction that you change
and so you have this kind of very

728
00:14:13,569 --> 00:14:13,579
and so you have this kind of very
 

729
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:15,579
and so you have this kind of very
gradual tiling of the space we have a

730
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:15,589
gradual tiling of the space we have a
 

731
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:17,410
gradual tiling of the space we have a
lot of sharing between the linear

732
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:17,420
lot of sharing between the linear
 

733
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,870
lot of sharing between the linear
controllers that tile the space and that

734
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:19,880
controllers that tile the space and that
 

735
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,790
controllers that tile the space and that
was always my intuition s of why to

736
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:21,800
was always my intuition s of why to
 

737
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,280
was always my intuition s of why to
expect that this might work pretty well

738
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:24,290
expect that this might work pretty well
 

739
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,900
expect that this might work pretty well
it's essentially leveraging the fact

740
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:25,910
it's essentially leveraging the fact
 

741
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,759
it's essentially leveraging the fact
that linear feedback control is so good

742
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:27,769
that linear feedback control is so good
 

743
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,310
that linear feedback control is so good
but of course not enough and this is a

744
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:30,320
but of course not enough and this is a
 

745
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,889
but of course not enough and this is a
gradual tiling of the space with linear

746
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:32,899
gradual tiling of the space with linear
 

747
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:34,530
gradual tiling of the space with linear
feedback controls that share a lot of

748
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:34,540
feedback controls that share a lot of
 

749
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,210
feedback controls that share a lot of
expertise across them so that that's

750
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:37,220
expertise across them so that that's
 

751
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,340
expertise across them so that that's
that's really nice intuition do you

752
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,350
that's really nice intuition do you
 

753
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,620
that's really nice intuition do you
think that scales to the more and more

754
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:41,630
think that scales to the more and more
 

755
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,660

up the number of controllers dimensions
when you start going down in terms of

when you start going down in terms of
 

761
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,790
when you start going down in terms of
how often you get a clean reward signal

762
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:54,800
how often you get a clean reward signal
 

763
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,550
how often you get a clean reward signal
does that intuition carry forward to

764
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:57,560
does that intuition carry forward to
 

765
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,069
does that intuition carry forward to
those crazy or weird or worlds that we

those crazy or weird or worlds that we
 

767
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:05,920
those crazy or weird or worlds that we
think of as the real world so I think

768
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:05,930
think of as the real world so I think
 

769
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,290
think of as the real world so I think
where things get really tricky in the

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,300
where things get really tricky in the
 

771

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:38,490
fiber contractions and relaxations and
 

795
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,530
fiber contractions and relaxations and
that's how you interact with the world

796
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:39,540
that's how you interact with the world
 

797
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,020
that's how you interact with the world
and that's a very high frequency control

798
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,030
and that's a very high frequency control
 

799
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,210
and that's a very high frequency control
thing but it's ultimately what you do

800
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:44,220
thing but it's ultimately what you do
 

801
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,880
thing but it's ultimately what you do
and how you affect the world until I

802
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:46,890
and how you affect the world until I
 

803
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:48,590
and how you affect the world until I
guess we have brain readings and you can

804
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:48,600
guess we have brain readings and you can
 

805
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,960
guess we have brain readings and you can
maybe do it slightly differently but

806
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:49,970
maybe do it slightly differently but
 

807
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,770
maybe do it slightly differently but
typically that's how you affect the

808
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:51,780
typically that's how you affect the
 

809
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,040
typically that's how you affect the
world and the decision of doing a PhD is

810
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,050
world and the decision of doing a PhD is
 

811
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,170
world and the decision of doing a PhD is
like so abstract relative to what you're

812
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:57,180
like so abstract relative to what you're
 

813
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:59,690
like so abstract relative to what you're
actually doing in the world and I think

814
00:15:59,690 --> 00:15:59,700
actually doing in the world and I think
 

815
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,570
actually doing in the world and I think
that's where credit assignment becomes

816
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:01,580
that's where credit assignment becomes
 

817
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,540
that's where credit assignment becomes
just completely beyond what any current

818
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:05,550
just completely beyond what any current
 

819
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,220
just completely beyond what any current
RL algorithm can do and we need

820
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:07,230
RL algorithm can do and we need
 

821
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:09,590
RL algorithm can do and we need
hierarchical reasoning at a level that

822
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:09,600
hierarchical reasoning at a level that
 

823
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,860
hierarchical reasoning at a level that
is just not available at all yet where

824
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:12,870
is just not available at all yet where
 

825
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,450
is just not available at all yet where
do you think we can pick up hierarchical

826
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:14,460
do you think we can pick up hierarchical
 

827
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:17,420
do you think we can pick up hierarchical
reasoning by which mechanisms yeah so

828
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:17,430
reasoning by which mechanisms yeah so
 

829
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,460
reasoning by which mechanisms yeah so
maybe let me highlight what I think the

830
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:19,470
maybe let me highlight what I think the
 

831
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:23,320
maybe let me highlight what I think the
limitations are of what already was done

832
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,330
limitations are of what already was done
 

833
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,660
limitations are of what already was done
20-30 years ago in fact you'll find

834
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:26,670
20-30 years ago in fact you'll find
 

835
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,640
20-30 years ago in fact you'll find
reasoning systems that reason over

836
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:28,650
reasoning systems that reason over
 

837
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,160
reasoning systems that reason over
relatively long horizons but the

838
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:31,170
relatively long horizons but the
 

839
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:32,750
relatively long horizons but the
problems that they were not grounded in

840
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:32,760
problems that they were not grounded in
 

841
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,780
problems that they were not grounded in
the real world so people would have to

842
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:35,790
the real world so people would have to
 

843
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:41,200
the real world so people would have to
hand design some kind of logical

844
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,210
hand design some kind of logical
 

845
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:43,670
hand design some kind of logical
dynamical descriptions of the world and

846
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:43,680
dynamical descriptions of the world and
 

847
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,820
dynamical descriptions of the world and
that didn't tie into perception and so

848
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:46,830
that didn't tie into perception and so
 

849
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:49,190
that didn't tie into perception and so
then time to real objects and so forth

850
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:49,200
then time to real objects and so forth
 

851
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,440
then time to real objects and so forth
and so that that was a big gap now with

852
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:51,450
and so that that was a big gap now with
 

853
00:16:51,450 --> 00:16:53,420
and so that that was a big gap now with
deep learning we start having the

854
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:53,430
deep learning we start having the
 

855
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,460
deep learning we start having the
ability to really see with sensors

856
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:58,470
ability to really see with sensors
 

857
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,680
ability to really see with sensors
process that and understand what's in

858
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:00,690
process that and understand what's in
 

859
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,750
process that and understand what's in
the world and so it's a good time to try

860
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:02,760
the world and so it's a good time to try
 

861
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,420
the world and so it's a good time to try
to bring these things together one I see

862
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:05,430
to bring these things together one I see
 

863
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,740
to bring these things together one I see
a few ways of getting there one way to

864
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:06,750
a few ways of getting there one way to
 

865
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,689
a few ways of getting there one way to
get there would be to say deep learning

866
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:08,699
get there would be to say deep learning
 

867
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,610
get there would be to say deep learning
can get bolted on somehow to some of

868
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:10,620
can get bolted on somehow to some of
 

869
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,439
can get bolted on somehow to some of
these more traditional approaches now

870
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:12,449
these more traditional approaches now
 

871
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,360
these more traditional approaches now
bolted on would probably mean you need

872
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:14,370
bolted on would probably mean you need
 

873
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,860
bolted on would probably mean you need
to do some kind of end-to-end training

874
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:15,870
to do some kind of end-to-end training
 

875
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,870
to do some kind of end-to-end training
where you say my deep learning

876
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:17,880
where you say my deep learning
 

877
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,520
where you say my deep learning
processing somehow leads to a

878
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:19,530
processing somehow leads to a
 

879
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,449
processing somehow leads to a

that's that's one way can we somehow

another direction we've been thinking

900
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:46,290
another direction we've been thinking
 

901
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,100
another direction we've been thinking
about for a long time and they didn't

00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,110
about for a long time and they didn't
 

903
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:51,200
about for a long time and they didn't

information theoretic approaches so the

906
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:54,000
information theoretic approaches so the
 

907
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,630
information theoretic approaches so the
idea there was that what it means to

908
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:56,640
idea there was that what it means to
 

909
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,050
idea there was that what it means to
take high-level action is to take and

910
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:00,060
take high-level action is to take and

00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,990
take high-level action is to take and

choose a latent variable now that tells
you a lot about what's gonna be the case

00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:04,560
you a lot about what's gonna be the case
 

915
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,990
you a lot about what's gonna be the case
in the future because that's what it

00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,000
in the future because that's what it
 

917
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,020
in the future because that's what it

925
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,590
for my car well that'll now take five
minutes to get there but the fact that I

926
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:18,600
minutes to get there but the fact that I
 

927
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,450
minutes to get there but the fact that I
get there I could already tell that from

928
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:20,460
get there I could already tell that from
 

929
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:22,820

the high-level action it took much

00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:25,940
the high-level action it took much
earlier that we had a very hard time

932
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:25,950
earlier that we had a very hard time
 

933
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,180
earlier that we had a very hard time
getting success with not saying it's a

00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:29,190
getting success with not saying it's a
 

935
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,340
getting success with not saying it's a
dead-end necessarily but we had a lot of

936
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,350
dead-end necessarily but we had a lot of
 

937
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:33,470
dead-end necessarily but we had a lot of
trouble getting that to work and then we

938
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:33,480
trouble getting that to work and then we
 

939
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,000
trouble getting that to work and then we
start revisiting the notion of what are

940
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,010
start revisiting the notion of what are
 

941
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,060
start revisiting the notion of what are
we really trying to achieve what we're

942
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:38,070
we really trying to achieve what we're
 

943
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,640
we really trying to achieve what we're
trying to achieve is non ously hierarchy

944
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:40,650
trying to achieve is non ously hierarchy
 

945
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,900
trying to achieve is non ously hierarchy
per se but you could think about what

946
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:41,910
per se but you could think about what
 

947
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,260
per se but you could think about what
does hierarchy give us what it's we hope

948
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:45,270
does hierarchy give us what it's we hope
 

949
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,340
does hierarchy give us what it's we hope
it would give us is better credit

950
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:46,350
it would give us is better credit
 

951
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:49,790

things up it seems like this has been
 

1087
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,909
things up it seems like this has been
expanded upon like people training even

of the opening eye results on language
models and some of the recent Google

1096

1097
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,740

results on language models they are

1098
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:49,750
results on language models they are
 

1099
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:53,159
results on language models they are
learned for just prediction and then

1100
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:53,169
learned for just prediction and then
 

1101
00:21:53,169 --> 00:21:57,180
learned for just prediction and then
they get reused for other tasks and so I

1102
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:57,190
they get reused for other tasks and so I
 

1103
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,710
they get reused for other tasks and so I
think there is something there where

the relative motion of our planets it
 

1171
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,730
the relative motion of our planets it

00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:30,560

it would prompt predict what will happen

1176
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:30,570
it would prompt predict what will happen
 

1177
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,999
it would prompt predict what will happen
right and that's a different kind of

00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:33,009
right and that's a different kind of

00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:48,669
problem and so I think that's an example
 

1195
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:51,840
problem and so I think that's an example

00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:21,669
would say not sure if it should be
 

1225
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,340

so far so I just talked to vladimir

00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:28,810
so far so I just talked to vladimir

learning right the general theory of
 

1243
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,770
learning right the general theory of
learning do you think that's a fruitless

1244
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:43,780
learning do you think that's a fruitless
 

1245
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,320

pursuit in the near term in within the

1246
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:49,330
pursuit in the near term in within the
 

1247
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:52,470
pursuit in the near term in within the
next several decades I think that's a

1248
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
next several decades I think that's a
 

1249
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,870
next several decades I think that's a
really interesting pursuit and in the

1250
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:54,880
really interesting pursuit and in the
 

1251
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
really interesting pursuit and in the
following sense and that there is a lot

1252
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:57,130
following sense and that there is a lot
 

1253
00:24:57,130 --> 00:25:02,130
following sense and that there is a lot
of evidence that the brain is pretty

1254
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,140
of evidence that the brain is pretty
 

1255
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,710
of evidence that the brain is pretty
modular and so I wouldn't maybe think of

1256
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:04,720
modular and so I wouldn't maybe think of
 

1257
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,360
modular and so I wouldn't maybe think of
it as the theory maybe the the

1258
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,370
it as the theory maybe the the
 

1259
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,120
it as the theory maybe the the
underlying theory but more kind of the

1260
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,130
underlying theory but more kind of the
 

1261
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,180
underlying theory but more kind of the
principle where there have been findings

1262
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,190
principle where there have been findings
 

1263
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:15,990
principle where there have been findings
where people who are blind will use the

1264
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,360
where people who are blind will use the
part of the brain usually used for

1266
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:17,370
part of the brain usually used for
 

1267
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:22,560
part of the brain usually used for
vision for other functions and even

1268
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:22,570
vision for other functions and even
 

1269
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:25,260
vision for other functions and even
after some kind of if people will get

1270
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,270
after some kind of if people will get
 

1271
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:27,240
after some kind of if people will get
rewired in some way they might I'm able

1272
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:27,250
rewired in some way they might I'm able
 

1273
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,920
rewired in some way they might I'm able
to reuse parts of their brain for other

1274
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:28,930
to reuse parts of their brain for other
 

1275
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:31,890
to reuse parts of their brain for other
functions and so what that suggests is

1276
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:31,900
functions and so what that suggests is
 

1277
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:36,720
functions and so what that suggests is
some kind of modularity and I think it

1278
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:36,730
some kind of modularity and I think it
 

1279
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,940
some kind of modularity and I think it
is a pretty natural thing to strive

1280
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:38,950
is a pretty natural thing to strive
 

1281
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,500
is a pretty natural thing to strive
forward to see can we find that

forward to see can we find that
 

1283
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:43,170
forward to see can we find that
modularity can we find this thing of

1284
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,180
modularity can we find this thing of

can be rewired arbitrarily but if you

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:48,850
can be rewired arbitrarily but if you
 

1291
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:50,310
can be rewired arbitrarily but if you
think of things like the neocortex which

00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:50,320
think of things like the neocortex which
 

1293
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,380
think of things like the neocortex which
is pretty big part of the brain that

00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:52,390
is pretty big part of the brain that
 

1295
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,930
is pretty big part of the brain that
seems fairly modular from what the

1299
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,300

equally modular and if you can just grow

think that would be the kind of

1333
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:43,200

maybe I would prefer we could make the

maybe I would prefer we could make the

because often if you have something you

1340
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:49,240
because often if you have something you
 

1341
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:53,070
because often if you have something you
can mathematically formalise you can

1342
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:53,080
can mathematically formalise you can
 

1343
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,370
can mathematically formalise you can
leapfrog a lot of experimentation and

1344
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:55,380
leapfrog a lot of experimentation and
 

1345
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,899
leapfrog a lot of experimentation and
experimentation takes a long time to get

1346
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:57,909
experimentation takes a long time to get
 

1347
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,380
experimentation takes a long time to get
through and a lot of trial and error

1348
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:00,390
through and a lot of trial and error
 

1349
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,310

kind of reinforcement learning your

1350
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,320
kind of reinforcement learning your
 

1351
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,620
kind of reinforcement learning your
research process but you need to do a

1352
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:04,630
research process but you need to do a
 

1353
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,240
research process but you need to do a
lot of trial and error before you get to

1354
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:06,250
lot of trial and error before you get to
 

1355
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,130
lot of trial and error before you get to
a success so if we can leapfrog doubt in

1356
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,140
a success so if we can leapfrog doubt in
 

1357
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,690
a success so if we can leapfrog doubt in
my mind that's what the math is about

1358
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:09,700
my mind that's what the math is about
 

1359
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,120
my mind that's what the math is about
and hopefully once you do a bunch of

1360
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:12,130
and hopefully once you do a bunch of
 

1361
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,340
and hopefully once you do a bunch of
experiments you start seeing a pattern

1362
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,350
experiments you start seeing a pattern
 

1363
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,080
experiments you start seeing a pattern
you can do some derivations that

1364
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,090
you can do some derivations that
 

1365
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,750
you can do some derivations that
leapfrog some experiments but I agree

1366
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:18,760
leapfrog some experiments but I agree
 

1367
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,070
leapfrog some experiments but I agree
with you I mean in practice a lot of the

1368
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:20,080
with you I mean in practice a lot of the
 

1369
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,990
with you I mean in practice a lot of the
progress has been such that we have not

1370
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:22,000
progress has been such that we have not
 

1371
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,970
progress has been such that we have not
been able to find the math that allows

1372
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:23,980
been able to find the math that allows
 

1373
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,909
been able to find the math that allows
it to leapfrog ahead and we are kind of

1374
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:26,919
it to leapfrog ahead and we are kind of
 

1375
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:28,590
it to leapfrog ahead and we are kind of
making gradual progress one step at a

1383
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:36,389

not getting to something yet where we're

explains how you know that would be have
 

1389
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,269

been two years of experimentation to get

been two years of experimentation to get
 

1391
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,279
been two years of experimentation to get
there but this tells us what the results

1392
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:44,289
there but this tells us what the results
 

1393
00:27:44,289 --> 00:27:46,769
there but this tells us what the results
going to be unfortunately not so much

1394
00:27:46,769 --> 00:27:46,779
going to be unfortunately not so much
 

1395
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:49,049
going to be unfortunately not so much
yes not so much yeah but your hope is

1396
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:49,059
yes not so much yeah but your hope is
 

1397
00:27:49,059 --> 00:27:52,980
yes not so much yeah but your hope is
there in trying to teach robots or

1398
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:52,990
there in trying to teach robots or
 

1399
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:57,389
there in trying to teach robots or
systems to do everyday tasks or even in

00:27:57,389 --> 00:27:57,399
systems to do everyday tasks or even in
 

1401
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:00,539
systems to do everyday tasks or even in
simulation what what do you think you're

1402
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:00,549
simulation what what do you think you're
 

1403
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,019
simulation what what do you think you're
more excited about imitation learning or

1404
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:04,029
more excited about imitation learning or
 

1405
00:28:04,029 --> 00:28:04,860
more excited about imitation learning or
self play

1406
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:04,870
self play
 

1407
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,510
self play
so letting robots learn from humans or

1408
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:08,520
so letting robots learn from humans or
 

1409
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,669
so letting robots learn from humans or
letting robots plan their own to try to

1410
00:28:11,669 --> 00:28:11,679
letting robots plan their own to try to
 

1411
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,639
letting robots plan their own to try to
figure out in their own way and

1412
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:13,649
figure out in their own way and
 

1413
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,610
figure out in their own way and
eventually play eventually interact with

1414
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:17,620
eventually play eventually interact with
 

1415
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,740
eventually play eventually interact with
humans or to solve whatever problem is

what's the more exciting to you what's

1418
00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:22,149
what's the more exciting to you what's
 

1419
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:23,880
what's the more exciting to you what's
more promising you think as a research

1420
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:23,890
more promising you think as a research
 

1421
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:31,519
more promising you think as a research
direction so when we look at self play

1422
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:31,529
direction so when we look at self play
 

1423
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:34,529
direction so when we look at self play
what's so beautiful about it is goes

1424
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:34,539
what's so beautiful about it is goes
 

1425
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:36,510
what's so beautiful about it is goes
back to kind of the challenges in

1426
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:36,520
back to kind of the challenges in
 

1427
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,769
back to kind of the challenges in
reinforcement learning so the challenge

1428
00:28:37,769 --> 00:28:37,779
reinforcement learning so the challenge
 

1429
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,210
reinforcement learning so the challenge
of reinforced learning is getting signal

1430
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:39,220
of reinforced learning is getting signal
 

1431
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,299
of reinforced learning is getting signal
and if you don't never succeed you don't

1432
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:42,309
and if you don't never succeed you don't
 

1433
00:28:42,309 --> 00:28:45,659
and if you don't never succeed you don't
get any signal in self play you're on

1434
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:45,669
get any signal in self play you're on
 

1435
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:48,000
get any signal in self play you're on
both sides so one of you succeeds and

1436
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,010
both sides so one of you succeeds and
 

1437
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:49,680
both sides so one of you succeeds and
the beauty is also one of you fails and

1438
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:49,690
the beauty is also one of you fails and
 

1439
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:52,230
the beauty is also one of you fails and
so you see the contrast you see the one

1440
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
so you see the contrast you see the one
 

1441
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,280
so you see the contrast you see the one
version of me that it better

1442
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:53,290
version of me that it better
 

1443
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:54,990
version of me that it better
the other version and so every time you

1444
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:55,000
the other version and so every time you
 

1445
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,540
the other version and so every time you
play yourself you get signal and so

1446
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:57,550
play yourself you get signal and so
 

1447
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,950
play yourself you get signal and so
whenever you can turn something into

1448
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
whenever you can turn something into
 

1449
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,690
whenever you can turn something into
self play you're in a beautiful

1450
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:00,700
self play you're in a beautiful
 

1451
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,600
self play you're in a beautiful
situation where you can naturally learn

1452
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:03,610
situation where you can naturally learn
 

1453
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,870
situation where you can naturally learn
much more quickly than in most other

1454
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:05,880
much more quickly than in most other
 

1455
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,130
much more quickly than in most other
reinforced learning environments so I

1456
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,140
reinforced learning environments so I
 

1457
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:11,340
reinforced learning environments so I
think I think if somehow we can turn

1458
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:11,350
think I think if somehow we can turn
 

1459
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,650
think I think if somehow we can turn
more reinforcement learning problems

1460
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:13,660
more reinforcement learning problems
 

1461
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:15,870
more reinforcement learning problems
into self play formulations that would

1462
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:15,880
into self play formulations that would
 

1463
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,090
into self play formulations that would
go real really far so far south play has

1464
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:18,100
go real really far so far south play has
 

1465
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,090
go real really far so far south play has
been largely around games where there is

1466
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:21,100
been largely around games where there is
 

1467
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:23,280
been largely around games where there is
natural opponents but if we could do

1468
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:23,290
natural opponents but if we could do
 

1469
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,960
natural opponents but if we could do
self play if for other things and let's

1470
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:24,970
self play if for other things and let's
 

1471
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,430
self play if for other things and let's
say I don't know a robot learns to build

1472
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:26,440
say I don't know a robot learns to build
 

1473
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,260
say I don't know a robot learns to build
a house I mean that's a pretty advanced

1474
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,270
a house I mean that's a pretty advanced
 

1475
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,060
a house I mean that's a pretty advanced
thing to try to do for a robot but maybe

1476
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,070
thing to try to do for a robot but maybe
 

1477
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,920
thing to try to do for a robot but maybe
it tries to build a hut or something if

1478
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:31,930
it tries to build a hut or something if
 

1479
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:34,230
it tries to build a hut or something if
that can be done through self play it

1480
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:34,240
that can be done through self play it
 

1481
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,490
that can be done through self play it
would learn a lot more quickly if

1482
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:35,500
would learn a lot more quickly if
 

1483
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,750
would learn a lot more quickly if
somebody can figure that out and I think

1484
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:36,760
somebody can figure that out and I think
 

1485
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,940
somebody can figure that out and I think
that would be something where it goes

1486
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:38,950
that would be something where it goes
 

1487
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,860
that would be something where it goes
closer to kind of the mathematical leap

1488
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:40,870
closer to kind of the mathematical leap
 

1489
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,570
closer to kind of the mathematical leap
frogging where somebody figures out a

1490
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:42,580
frogging where somebody figures out a
 

1491
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,100
frogging where somebody figures out a

any RL problem by playing this and this
 

1495

any RL problem by playing this and this
idea you can turn it into a self play

1496
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:48,400
idea you can turn it into a self play
 

1497
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,190

reality is many problems we don't know

1502
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:54,700
reality is many problems we don't know
 

1503

reality is many problems we don't know
how to turn the self lay and so either

1504
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:56,680
how to turn the self lay and so either

00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,100
how to turn the self lay and so either
we need to provide detailed reward that

1506
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,110
we need to provide detailed reward that
 

1507
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,750
we need to provide detailed reward that
doesn't just reward for achieving a goal

1508
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:00,760
doesn't just reward for achieving a goal
 

1509
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,060
doesn't just reward for achieving a goal
but rewards for making progress and that

1510
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:03,070
but rewards for making progress and that
 

1511
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,070
but rewards for making progress and that
becomes time-consuming and once you're

1512
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:05,080
becomes time-consuming and once you're
 

1513
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,390
becomes time-consuming and once you're
starting to do that let's say you want a

1514
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:06,400
starting to do that let's say you want a
 

1515
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,500
starting to do that let's say you want a
robot to do something you need to give

1516
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:07,510
robot to do something you need to give
 

1517
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,510
robot to do something you need to give
all this detailed reward well why not

1518
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:09,520
all this detailed reward well why not
 

1519
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,520
all this detailed reward well why not
just give a demonstration right because

1520
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:11,530
just give a demonstration right because
 

1521
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,210
just give a demonstration right because
why not just show the robot and now the

1522
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:15,220
why not just show the robot and now the
 

1523
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,440
why not just show the robot and now the
question is how do you show the robot

1524
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:16,450
question is how do you show the robot
 

1525
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:18,150
question is how do you show the robot
one way to show is to tally operate the

1526
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:18,160
one way to show is to tally operate the
 

1527
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,380
one way to show is to tally operate the
robot and then the robot really

1528
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:19,390
robot and then the robot really
 

1529
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,510
robot and then the robot really
experiences things and that's nice

1530
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:21,520
experiences things and that's nice
 

1531
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,620
experiences things and that's nice
because that's really high

1532
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:22,630
because that's really high
 

1533
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:24,150
because that's really high
signal-to-noise ratio data and we've

1534
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:24,160
signal-to-noise ratio data and we've
 

1535
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,590
signal-to-noise ratio data and we've
done a lot of that and you teach your

1536
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:25,600
done a lot of that and you teach your
 

1537
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,110
done a lot of that and you teach your
robot skills in just 10 minutes you can

1538
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:28,120
robot skills in just 10 minutes you can
 

1539
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,880
robot skills in just 10 minutes you can
teach your robot a new basic skill like

1540
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:29,890
teach your robot a new basic skill like
 

1541
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,230
teach your robot a new basic skill like
okay pick up the bottle place it

1542
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:31,240
okay pick up the bottle place it
 

1543
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,270
okay pick up the bottle place it
somewhere else that's a skill no matter

1544
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:33,280
somewhere else that's a skill no matter
 

1545
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,650
somewhere else that's a skill no matter
where the bottle starts maybe it always

1546
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:34,660
where the bottle starts maybe it always
 

1547
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,270
where the bottle starts maybe it always
goes on to a target or something

1548
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:36,280
goes on to a target or something
 

1549
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,580
goes on to a target or something
that's fairly is a teacher about with

1550
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:38,590
that's fairly is a teacher about with
 

1551
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:41,700
that's fairly is a teacher about with
tally up now what's even more

1552
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:41,710
tally up now what's even more
 

1553
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,200
tally up now what's even more
interesting if you can now teach robot

1554
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,210
interesting if you can now teach robot
 

1555
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,450
interesting if you can now teach robot
through third person learning where the

1556
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:45,460
through third person learning where the
 

1557
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,180
through third person learning where the
robot watches you do something and

1558
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:47,190
robot watches you do something and
 

1559
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:49,530
robot watches you do something and
doesn't experience it but just watches

1560
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:49,540
doesn't experience it but just watches
 

1561
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,120
doesn't experience it but just watches
it and says okay well if you're showing

1562
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,130
it and says okay well if you're showing
 

1563
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:53,340
it and says okay well if you're showing
me that that means I should be doing

1564
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:53,350
me that that means I should be doing
 

1565
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,960
me that that means I should be doing
this and I'm not gonna be using your

1566
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:54,970
this and I'm not gonna be using your
 

1567
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,760
this and I'm not gonna be using your
hand because I don't get to control your

1568
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:56,770
hand because I don't get to control your
 

1569
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:58,260
hand because I don't get to control your
hand but I'm gonna use my hand I'd do

1570
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:58,270
hand but I'm gonna use my hand I'd do
 

1571
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,360
hand but I'm gonna use my hand I'd do
that mapping and so that's where I think

1572
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,370
that mapping and so that's where I think
 

1573
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,160
that mapping and so that's where I think
one of the big breakthroughs has

1574
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:02,170
one of the big breakthroughs has
 

1575
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,230
one of the big breakthroughs has

machine translation for demonstrations

1580
00:31:09,029 --> 00:31:09,039
machine translation for demonstrations
 

1581
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,339
machine translation for demonstrations
were you have a human demonstration and

1582
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:11,349
were you have a human demonstration and
 

1583
00:31:11,349 --> 00:31:14,190
were you have a human demonstration and
the robot learns to translated into what

1584
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:14,200
the robot learns to translated into what
 

1585
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,109
the robot learns to translated into what
it means for the robot to do it and that

1586
00:31:16,109 --> 00:31:16,119
it means for the robot to do it and that
 

1587
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,459
it means for the robot to do it and that
was a meta learning for a Malaysian

1588
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:17,469
was a meta learning for a Malaysian

learn from one to get the other and that

1590
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:21,190
learn from one to get the other and that
 

1591
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:22,979
learn from one to get the other and that
I think opens up a lot of opportunities

1592
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:22,989
I think opens up a lot of opportunities
 

1593
00:31:22,989 --> 00:31:25,259
I think opens up a lot of opportunities
to learn a lot more quickly so my focus

1594
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:25,269
to learn a lot more quickly so my focus
 

1595
00:31:25,269 --> 00:31:26,879
to learn a lot more quickly so my focus
is on autonomous vehicles do you think

1596
00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:26,889
is on autonomous vehicles do you think
 

1597
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:29,039
is on autonomous vehicles do you think
this approach of third-person watching

1598
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:29,049
this approach of third-person watching
 

1599
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,409
this approach of third-person watching
is about the autonomous driving is

1600
00:31:31,409 --> 00:31:31,419
is about the autonomous driving is
 

1601
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:34,019
is about the autonomous driving is
amenable to this a kind of approach so

1602
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:34,029
amenable to this a kind of approach so
 

1603
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:39,019
amenable to this a kind of approach so
for autonomous driving I would say it's

1604
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:39,029
for autonomous driving I would say it's
 

1605
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,789
for autonomous driving I would say it's
third-person is slightly easier and the

1606
00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:41,799
third-person is slightly easier and the
 

1607
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:43,529
third-person is slightly easier and the
reason I'm gonna say slightly easier to

1608
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:43,539
reason I'm gonna say slightly easier to
 

1609
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:47,369
reason I'm gonna say slightly easier to
do a third-person is because the hard

1610
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:47,379
do a third-person is because the hard
 

1611
00:31:47,379 --> 00:31:50,579
do a third-person is because the hard
dynamics are very well understood so the

1612
00:31:50,579 --> 00:31:50,589
dynamics are very well understood so the
 

1613
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:54,409
dynamics are very well understood so the
easier than of first-person you mean or

1614
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:54,419
easier than of first-person you mean or
 

1615
00:31:54,419 --> 00:31:56,489
easier than of first-person you mean or
easier so I think the distinction

1616
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:56,499
easier so I think the distinction
 

1617
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:58,469
easier so I think the distinction
between third-person and first-person is

1618
00:31:58,469 --> 00:31:58,479
between third-person and first-person is
 

1619
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,180
between third-person and first-person is
not a very important distinction for

1620
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:00,190
not a very important distinction for
 

1621
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,779
not a very important distinction for
autonomous driving they're very similar

1622
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:02,789
autonomous driving they're very similar
 

1623
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:05,519
autonomous driving they're very similar
because the distinction is really about

1624
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:05,529
because the distinction is really about
 

1625
00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:08,909
because the distinction is really about
who turns the steering wheel and or

1626
00:32:08,909 --> 00:32:08,919
who turns the steering wheel and or
 

1627
00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:12,509
who turns the steering wheel and or
maybe I'll let me put it differently how

1628
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:12,519
maybe I'll let me put it differently how
 

1629
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:14,969
maybe I'll let me put it differently how
to get from a point where you are now to

1630
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:14,979
to get from a point where you are now to
 

1631
00:32:14,979 --> 00:32:16,680
to get from a point where you are now to
a point let's say a couple meters in

1632
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:16,690
a point let's say a couple meters in
 

1633
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,359
a point let's say a couple meters in
front of you and that's a problem that's

1634
00:32:18,359 --> 00:32:18,369
front of you and that's a problem that's
 

1635
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,829
front of you and that's a problem that's
very well understood and that's the only

1636
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:19,839
very well understood and that's the only
 

1637
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,060
very well understood and that's the only
distinction being third and first-person

1638
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:21,070
distinction being third and first-person
 

1639
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,560
distinction being third and first-person
there whereas with the robot

1640
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:22,570
there whereas with the robot
 

1641
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:24,389
there whereas with the robot
manipulation interaction forces are very

1642
00:32:24,389 --> 00:32:24,399
manipulation interaction forces are very
 

1643
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,549
manipulation interaction forces are very
complex and it's still a very different

1644
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:26,559
complex and it's still a very different
 

1645
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,239
complex and it's still a very different
thing for autonomous driving I think

1646
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:30,249
thing for autonomous driving I think
 

1647
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:32,389
thing for autonomous driving I think
there is still the question imitation

1648
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
there is still the question imitation
 

1649
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,669
there is still the question imitation
versus RL so imitation gives you a lot

1650
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:35,679
versus RL so imitation gives you a lot
 

1651
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,859
versus RL so imitation gives you a lot
more signal I think where imitation is

1652
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:37,869
more signal I think where imitation is
 

1653
00:32:37,869 --> 00:32:41,249
more signal I think where imitation is
lacking and needs some extra machinery

1654
00:32:41,249 --> 00:32:41,259
lacking and needs some extra machinery
 

1655
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:45,329
lacking and needs some extra machinery
is it doesn't in its normal format

1656
00:32:45,329 --> 00:32:45,339
is it doesn't in its normal format
 

1657
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,950
is it doesn't in its normal format
doesn't think about goals or objectives

1658
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:46,960
doesn't think about goals or objectives
 

1659
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,159
doesn't think about goals or objectives
and of course there are versions of

1660
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:50,169
and of course there are versions of
 

1661
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,839
and of course there are versions of
imitation learning inverse reinforce

1662
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:51,849
imitation learning inverse reinforce
 

1663
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,369
imitation learning inverse reinforce
learning type imitation which also

1664
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:53,379
learning type imitation which also
 

1665
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:55,349
learning type imitation which also
thinks about goals I think then we're

1666
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:55,359
thinks about goals I think then we're
 

1667
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,539
thinks about goals I think then we're
getting much closer but I think it's

1668
00:32:57,539 --> 00:32:57,549
getting much closer but I think it's
 

1669
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:00,839
getting much closer but I think it's
very hard to think of a fully reactive

1670
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:00,849
very hard to think of a fully reactive
 

1671
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,469
very hard to think of a fully reactive
car generalizing well if it really

in simulation do you have hope for
 

1697
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:34,649
in simulation do you have hope for

of course become stronger and we can

learn more in simulation but there's
 

1721
00:34:11,589 --> 00:34:12,960

also another version which is where you

also another version which is where you
 

1723
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:14,520
also another version which is where you
said the simulator doesn't even have to

said the simulator doesn't even have to
 

1725
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,220

be that precise as long as is somewhat

1734
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:24,940
well to the real world

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:27,659
well to the real world
I'm gonna build many simulators ensemble

1736
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:27,669
I'm gonna build many simulators ensemble
 

1737
00:34:27,669 --> 00:34:30,359
I'm gonna build many simulators ensemble
of simulators ensemble of simulators not

that it would work if you train in there

1744
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:37,510
that it would work if you train in there
 

1745
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,950
that it would work if you train in there
but if you train in all of them then

1746
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:40,960
but if you train in all of them then
 

1747
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,960
but if you train in all of them then
there is something that's good in all of

1748
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:42,970
there is something that's good in all of
 

1749
00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:45,570
there is something that's good in all of
them the real world will just be you

1750
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:45,580
them the real world will just be you
 

1751
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,599

00:34:53,609 --> 00:34:53,619
the distribution of simulators exact we
 

1759
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:55,889
the distribution of simulators exact we
do live in a simulation so this is just

1760
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:55,899
do live in a simulation so this is just
 

1761
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:58,560
do live in a simulation so this is just
like oh one other one I'm not sure about

1762
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,570
like oh one other one I'm not sure about
 

1763
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,099
like oh one other one I'm not sure about
that video it's definitely a very

1764
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:02,109
that video it's definitely a very
 

1765
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:04,260
that video it's definitely a very
advanced simulator if it is yeah it's

1766
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,270
advanced simulator if it is yeah it's
 

1767
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:06,540
advanced simulator if it is yeah it's
pretty good one I've talked to this to

1768
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:06,550
pretty good one I've talked to this to
 

1769
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:08,579
pretty good one I've talked to this to
Russell is something you think about a

1770
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:08,589
Russell is something you think about a
 

1771
00:35:08,589 --> 00:35:10,290
Russell is something you think about a
little bit too of course you're like

1772
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:10,300
little bit too of course you're like
 

1773
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,180
little bit too of course you're like
really trying to build these systems but

1774
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:12,190
really trying to build these systems but
 

1775
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,620
really trying to build these systems but
do you think about the future of AI a

1776
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:13,630
do you think about the future of AI a
 

1777
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,089
do you think about the future of AI a
lot of people have concerned about

1778
00:35:15,089 --> 00:35:15,099
lot of people have concerned about
 

1779
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,150
lot of people have concerned about
safety how do you think about AI safety

1780
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
safety how do you think about AI safety
 

1781
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,070
safety how do you think about AI safety
as you build robots that are operating

1782
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:20,080
as you build robots that are operating
 

1783
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,070
as you build robots that are operating
in the physical world what what is uh

1784
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,080
in the physical world what what is uh
 

1785
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,170
in the physical world what what is uh
yeah how do you approach this problem in

1786
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:25,180
yeah how do you approach this problem in
 

1787
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,730
yeah how do you approach this problem in
an engineering kind of way in a

1788
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:26,740
an engineering kind of way in a
 

1789
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:32,010
an engineering kind of way in a
systematic way so what a robot is doing

1790
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:32,020
systematic way so what a robot is doing
 

1791
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,740
systematic way so what a robot is doing
things you

1792
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:32,750
things you
 

1793
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:35,859
things you
kind of have a few notions of safety to

1794
00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:35,869
kind of have a few notions of safety to
 

1795
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,440
kind of have a few notions of safety to
worry about one is that Throwbot is

1796
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,450
worry about one is that Throwbot is
 

1797
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:40,870
worry about one is that Throwbot is
physically strong and of course could do

1798
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:40,880
physically strong and of course could do
 

1799
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,690
physically strong and of course could do
a lot of damage same for cars which we

1800
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:43,700
a lot of damage same for cars which we
 

1801
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,280
a lot of damage same for cars which we
can think of as robots do in some way

1802
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,290
can think of as robots do in some way
 

1803
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,710
can think of as robots do in some way
and this could be completely

1804
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:47,720
and this could be completely
 

1805
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,540
and this could be completely
unintentional so it could be not the

1806
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:49,550
unintentional so it could be not the
 

1807
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,550
unintentional so it could be not the
kind of long-term AI safety concerns

1808
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:51,560
kind of long-term AI safety concerns
 

1809
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,770
kind of long-term AI safety concerns
that okay a is smarter than us and now

1810
00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:53,780
that okay a is smarter than us and now
 

1811
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,240
that okay a is smarter than us and now
what do we do but it could be just very

1812
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:55,250
what do we do but it could be just very
 

1813
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,400
what do we do but it could be just very
practical okay this robot if it makes a

1814
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,410
practical okay this robot if it makes a
 

1815
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,109
practical okay this robot if it makes a
mistake

1816
00:35:58,109 --> 00:35:58,119
mistake
 

1817
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:00,730
mistake
whether the results going to be of

1818
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:00,740
whether the results going to be of
 

1819
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,200
whether the results going to be of
course simulation comes in a lot there

1820
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:02,210
course simulation comes in a lot there
 

1821
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,760
course simulation comes in a lot there
too to test in simulation it's a

1822
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:06,770
too to test in simulation it's a
 

1823
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,290
too to test in simulation it's a
difficult question and I'm always

1824
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:08,300
difficult question and I'm always
 

1825
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,320
difficult question and I'm always
wondering like I was wondering at let's

1826
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:11,330
wondering like I was wondering at let's
 

1827
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,640
wondering like I was wondering at let's
go back to drivings a lot of people know

1828
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:12,650
go back to drivings a lot of people know
 

1829
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,120
go back to drivings a lot of people know
driving well of course what do we do to

1830
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:16,130
driving well of course what do we do to
 

1831
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:19,120
driving well of course what do we do to
test somebody for driving right to get a

1832
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,130
test somebody for driving right to get a
 

1833
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,310
test somebody for driving right to get a
driver's license what do they really do

1834
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:21,320
driver's license what do they really do
 

1835
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:25,480
driver's license what do they really do
I mean you fill out some test and then

1836
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:25,490
I mean you fill out some test and then
 

1837
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,359
I mean you fill out some test and then
you drive and I mean perfume in suburban

1838
00:36:28,359 --> 00:36:28,369
you drive and I mean perfume in suburban
 

1839
00:36:28,369 --> 00:36:31,180
you drive and I mean perfume in suburban
California the driving test is just you

1840
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:31,190
California the driving test is just you
 

1841
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:34,960
California the driving test is just you
drive around the block pull over you do

1842
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:34,970
drive around the block pull over you do
 

1843
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:37,030
drive around the block pull over you do
a stop sign successfully and then you

1844
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
a stop sign successfully and then you
 

1845
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,890
a stop sign successfully and then you
know you pull over again and you pretty

1846
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:38,900
know you pull over again and you pretty
 

1847
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,650
know you pull over again and you pretty
much done and you're like okay if a

1848
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:41,660
much done and you're like okay if a
 

1849
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:45,220
much done and you're like okay if a
self-driving car did dad would you trust

1850
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:45,230
self-driving car did dad would you trust
 

1851
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,470
self-driving car did dad would you trust
it that it can drive and be like no

1852
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:47,480
it that it can drive and be like no
 

1853
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,000
it that it can drive and be like no
that's not enough for me to trust but

1854
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,010
that's not enough for me to trust but
 

1855
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:51,339
that's not enough for me to trust but
somehow for humans we've figured out

1856
00:36:51,339 --> 00:36:51,349
somehow for humans we've figured out
 

1857
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,710
somehow for humans we've figured out
that somebody being able to do that it's

1858
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:53,720
that somebody being able to do that it's
 

1859
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,500
that somebody being able to do that it's
representative of them being able to do

1860
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:56,510
representative of them being able to do
 

1861
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,839
representative of them being able to do
a lot of other things and so I think

1862
00:36:58,839 --> 00:36:58,849
a lot of other things and so I think
 

1863
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,550
a lot of other things and so I think
somehow for you must we figured out

1864
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:00,560
somehow for you must we figured out
 

1865
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,820
somehow for you must we figured out
representative tests of what it means if

1866
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:03,830
representative tests of what it means if
 

1867
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:05,320
representative tests of what it means if
you can do this what you can really do

1868
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:05,330
you can do this what you can really do
 

1869
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,839
you can do this what you can really do
of course testing you must you must all

1870
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:07,849
of course testing you must you must all
 

1871
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:08,890
of course testing you must you must all
want to be tested at all times

1872
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:08,900
want to be tested at all times
 

1873
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,450
want to be tested at all times
self-driving cars the robots can be

1874
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:10,460
self-driving cars the robots can be
 

1875
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,370
self-driving cars the robots can be
tested more often probably you can have

1876
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:12,380
tested more often probably you can have
 

1877
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,960
tested more often probably you can have
replicas that get testament are known to

1878
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:13,970
replicas that get testament are known to
 

1879
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:15,370
replicas that get testament are known to
be identical because they use the same

1880
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:15,380
be identical because they use the same
 

1881
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,880
be identical because they use the same
neural net and so forth but still I feel

1882
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:18,890
neural net and so forth but still I feel
 

1883
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:20,829
neural net and so forth but still I feel
like we don't have this kind of unit

1884
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:20,839
like we don't have this kind of unit
 

1885
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,460
like we don't have this kind of unit
tests or proper tests for for robots and

1886
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:24,470
tests or proper tests for for robots and
 

1887
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,089
tests or proper tests for for robots and
I think there's something very

1888
00:37:25,089 --> 00:37:25,099
I think there's something very
 

1889
00:37:25,099 --> 00:37:26,380
I think there's something very
interesting to be thought about there

1890
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,390
interesting to be thought about there
 

1891
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:28,630
interesting to be thought about there
especially as you update things your

1892
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
especially as you update things your
 

1893
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,250
especially as you update things your
software improves you have a better self

1894
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:30,260
software improves you have a better self
 

1895
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,740
software improves you have a better self
driving car suite you updated how do you

1896
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:32,750
driving car suite you updated how do you
 

1897
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,320
driving car suite you updated how do you
know it's indeed more capable on

1898
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,330
know it's indeed more capable on
 

1899
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:37,150
know it's indeed more capable on
everything than what you had before that

1900
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:37,160
everything than what you had before that
 

1901
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,540
everything than what you had before that
you didn't have any bad things creep

1902
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:40,550
you didn't have any bad things creep
 

1903
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,430
you didn't have any bad things creep
into it so I think that's a very

1904
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:42,440
into it so I think that's a very
 

1905
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,480
into it so I think that's a very
interesting direction of research that

1906
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:43,490
interesting direction of research that
 

1907
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,850
interesting direction of research that
there is no real solution yet

1908
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:45,860
there is no real solution yet
 

1909
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,860
there is no real solution yet
except that's somehow for you must we do

1910
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:47,870
except that's somehow for you must we do
 

1911
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,420
except that's somehow for you must we do
because we say okay you have a driving

1912
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:49,430
because we say okay you have a driving
 

1913
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:51,520
because we say okay you have a driving
test you passed you can go on the road

1914
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:51,530
test you passed you can go on the road
 

1915
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:54,340
test you passed you can go on the road
now and you must have accents every like

1916
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:54,350
now and you must have accents every like
 

1917
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,930
now and you must have accents every like
a million or ten million miles something

1918
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:55,940
a million or ten million miles something
 

1919
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,330
a million or ten million miles something
something pretty phenomenal compared to

1920
00:37:58,330 --> 00:37:58,340
something pretty phenomenal compared to
 

1921
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,360
something pretty phenomenal compared to
that short test yeah that is being done

1922
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:01,370
that short test yeah that is being done
 

1923
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:03,970
that short test yeah that is being done
so let me ask you've mentioned

1924
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:03,980
so let me ask you've mentioned
 

1925
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,500
so let me ask you've mentioned
you mentioned that Andrew Aang by

1926
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:05,510
you mentioned that Andrew Aang by
 

1927
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:08,190
you mentioned that Andrew Aang by
example showed you the value of kindness

1928
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:08,200
example showed you the value of kindness
 

1929
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,410
example showed you the value of kindness
and to do you think the space of

1930
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:13,420
and to do you think the space of
 

1931
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,150
and to do you think the space of
policies good policies for humans and

1932
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,160
policies good policies for humans and
 

1933
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,700
policies good policies for humans and
for AI is populated by policies that

1934
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:20,710
for AI is populated by policies that
 

1935
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,090
for AI is populated by policies that
with kindness or ones that are the

1936
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:25,100
with kindness or ones that are the
 

1937
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,420
with kindness or ones that are the
opposite exploitation even evil so if

1938
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:28,430
opposite exploitation even evil so if
 

1939
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,370
opposite exploitation even evil so if
you just look at the sea of policies we

1940
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:30,380
you just look at the sea of policies we
 

1941
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,100
you just look at the sea of policies we
operate under as human beings or if AI

1942
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,110
operate under as human beings or if AI
 

1943
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,810
operate under as human beings or if AI
system had to operate in this real world

1944
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:34,820
system had to operate in this real world
 

1945
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,960
system had to operate in this real world
do you think it's really easy to find

1946
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:36,970
do you think it's really easy to find
 

1947
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:39,550
do you think it's really easy to find
policies that are full of kindness like

1948
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:39,560
policies that are full of kindness like
 

1949
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,770
policies that are full of kindness like
we naturally fall into them or is it

1950
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:41,780
we naturally fall into them or is it
 

1951
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:47,280
we naturally fall into them or is it
like a very hard optimization problem I

1952
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:47,290

 

1953
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,050

mean there is kind of two optimizations

1954
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:50,060
mean there is kind of two optimizations
 

1955
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,660
mean there is kind of two optimizations
happening for humans right so for you

1956
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:52,670
happening for humans right so for you
 

1957
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,770
happening for humans right so for you
most was kinda the very long-term

1958
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:53,780
most was kinda the very long-term
 

1959
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:56,200
most was kinda the very long-term
optimization which evolution has done

1960
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:56,210
optimization which evolution has done
 

1961
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,480
optimization which evolution has done
for us and we're kind of predisposed to

1962
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:58,490
for us and we're kind of predisposed to
 

1963
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:01,090
for us and we're kind of predisposed to
like certain things and that's in

1964
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,100
like certain things and that's in
 

1965
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,710
like certain things and that's in
sometimes what makes our learning easier

1966
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:02,720
sometimes what makes our learning easier
 

1967
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,630
sometimes what makes our learning easier
because I mean we know things like pain

1968
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:04,640
because I mean we know things like pain
 

1969
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,920
because I mean we know things like pain
and hunger and thirst and the fact that

1970
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:08,930
and hunger and thirst and the fact that
 

1971
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,960
and hunger and thirst and the fact that
we know about those is not something

1972
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:10,970
we know about those is not something
 

1973
00:39:10,970 --> 00:39:12,310
we know about those is not something
that we were taught that's kind of

1974
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,320
that we were taught that's kind of
 

1975
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,810
that we were taught that's kind of
innate when we're hungry were unhappy

1976
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:13,820
innate when we're hungry were unhappy
 

1977
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,390
innate when we're hungry were unhappy
when we're thirsty were unhappy when we

1978
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,400
when we're thirsty were unhappy when we
 

1979
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,690
when we're thirsty were unhappy when we
have pain we're unhappy and ultimately

1980
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:19,700
have pain we're unhappy and ultimately
 

1981
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,030
have pain we're unhappy and ultimately
evolution built that into us to think

1982
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:22,040
evolution built that into us to think
 

1983
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,290
evolution built that into us to think
about this thing so so I think there is

1984
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:23,300
about this thing so so I think there is
 

1985
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,870
about this thing so so I think there is
a notion that it seems somehow humans

1986
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:25,880
a notion that it seems somehow humans
 

1987
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,520
a notion that it seems somehow humans
evolved in general to prefer to get

1988
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:30,530
evolved in general to prefer to get
 

1989
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:33,640
evolved in general to prefer to get
along in some ways but at the same time

1990
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:33,650
along in some ways but at the same time
 

1991
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,990
along in some ways but at the same time
also to be very territorial and kind of

1992
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,000
also to be very territorial and kind of
 

1993
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,010
also to be very territorial and kind of
centric to their own tribe is it like it

1994
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:42,020
centric to their own tribe is it like it
 

1995
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,690
centric to their own tribe is it like it
seems like that's the kind of space we

1996
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:43,700
seems like that's the kind of space we
 

1997
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:45,610
seems like that's the kind of space we
converge down to it I mean I'm not an

1998
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:45,620
converge down to it I mean I'm not an
 

1999
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,200
converge down to it I mean I'm not an
expert in anthropology but it seems like

2000
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,210
expert in anthropology but it seems like
 

2001
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,690
expert in anthropology but it seems like
we're very kind of good within our own

2002
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:49,700
we're very kind of good within our own
 

2003
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,080
we're very kind of good within our own
tribe but need to be taught but to be

2004
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,090
tribe but need to be taught but to be
 

2005
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,300
tribe but need to be taught but to be
nice to other tribes well if you look at

2006
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,310
nice to other tribes well if you look at
 

2007
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,430
nice to other tribes well if you look at
Steven Pinker he highlights is pretty

2008
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:57,440
Steven Pinker he highlights is pretty
 

2009
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,650
Steven Pinker he highlights is pretty
nicely in

2010
00:39:59,650 --> 00:39:59,660
nicely in
 

2011
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:02,470
nicely in
better better angels of our nature where

2012
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:02,480
better better angels of our nature where
 

2013
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,270
better better angels of our nature where
he talks about violence decreasing over

2014
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,280
he talks about violence decreasing over
 

2015
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,730
he talks about violence decreasing over
time consistently so whatever attention

2016
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:06,740
time consistently so whatever attention
 

2017
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,520
time consistently so whatever attention
whatever teams we pick it seems that the

2018
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:09,530
whatever teams we pick it seems that the
 

2019
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,920
whatever teams we pick it seems that the
long arc of history goes towards us

2020
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:11,930
long arc of history goes towards us
 

2021
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,930
long arc of history goes towards us
getting along more and more so I hope so

2022
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:15,940
getting along more and more so I hope so
 

2023
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:20,230
getting along more and more so I hope so
so do you think that do you think it's

2024
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:20,240
so do you think that do you think it's
 

2025
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,920
so do you think that do you think it's
possible to cheat teach RL bass robots

2026
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:23,930
possible to cheat teach RL bass robots
 

2027
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:26,740
possible to cheat teach RL bass robots
the this kind of kindness this kind of

2028
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:26,750
the this kind of kindness this kind of
 

2029
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,480
the this kind of kindness this kind of
ability to interact with humans this

2030
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:28,490
ability to interact with humans this
 

2031
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,420
ability to interact with humans this
kind of policy even - let me ask let me

2032
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:31,430
kind of policy even - let me ask let me
 

2033
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,310
kind of policy even - let me ask let me
ask a fun one do you think it's possible

2034
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:33,320
ask a fun one do you think it's possible
 

2035
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,950
ask a fun one do you think it's possible
to teach RL based robot to love a human

2036
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:35,960
to teach RL based robot to love a human
 

2037
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,890
to teach RL based robot to love a human
being and to inspire that human to love

2038
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:38,900
being and to inspire that human to love
 

2039
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,750
being and to inspire that human to love
the robot back so - like RL based

2040
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:42,760
the robot back so - like RL based
 

2041
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:46,680
the robot back so - like RL based
algorithm that leads to a happy marriage

algorithm that leads to a happy marriage
that's interesting question maybe I'll

2044
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:49,370
that's interesting question maybe I'll
 

2045
00:40:49,370 --> 00:40:51,760
that's interesting question maybe I'll
oh I'll answer it with with another

2046
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:51,770
oh I'll answer it with with another
 

2047
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:56,020
oh I'll answer it with with another
question right I mean it's it but I'll

2048
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:56,030
question right I mean it's it but I'll
 

2049
00:40:56,030 --> 00:40:57,610
question right I mean it's it but I'll
come back to it so another question you

2050
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:57,620
come back to it so another question you
 

2051
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,600
come back to it so another question you
can have is okay

2052
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:58,610

I mean how close does some people's
 

2055
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:05,020
I mean how close does some people's
happiness get from interacting with just

00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,030
happiness get from interacting with just
 

2057
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:08,920
happiness get from interacting with just

a really nice dog like I mean dogs you
come home that's what dogs did they

2060
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:10,760
come home that's what dogs did they
 

2061
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,000
come home that's what dogs did they
greet you they're excited it makes you

2062

happy when you're coming home to your
dog just like okay this is exciting

2066
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:16,100
dog just like okay this is exciting
 

2067
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,010
dog just like okay this is exciting
they're always happy when I'm here and

2068
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:18,020
they're always happy when I'm here and
 

2069
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:20,050
they're always happy when I'm here and
if they don't greet you because maybe

2070
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:20,060
if they don't greet you because maybe
 

2071
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,270
if they don't greet you because maybe
whatever your partner took them on a

2072
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:22,280
whatever your partner took them on a
 

2073
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,400
whatever your partner took them on a
trip or something you might not be

2074
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:24,410
trip or something you might not be
 

2075
00:41:24,410 --> 00:41:25,930
trip or something you might not be
nearly as happy when you get home right

2076
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:25,940
nearly as happy when you get home right
 

2077
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,560
nearly as happy when you get home right
and so the kind of it seems like the

2078
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:29,570
and so the kind of it seems like the
 

2079
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,180
and so the kind of it seems like the
level of reasoning a dog houses is

2080
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:31,190
level of reasoning a dog houses is
 

2081
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,890
level of reasoning a dog houses is
pretty sophisticated but then it's still

2082
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:32,900
pretty sophisticated but then it's still
 

2083
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,260
pretty sophisticated but then it's still
not yet at the level of human reasoning

2084
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:35,270
not yet at the level of human reasoning
 

2085
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:37,030
not yet at the level of human reasoning
and so it seems like we don't even need

2086
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,040
and so it seems like we don't even need
 

2087
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,100
and so it seems like we don't even need
to achieve human love reason to get like

2088
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,110
to achieve human love reason to get like
 

2089
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:42,070
to achieve human love reason to get like
very strong affection with humans and so

2090
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:42,080
very strong affection with humans and so
 

2091
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,560
very strong affection with humans and so
my thinking is why not right why

2092
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:44,570
my thinking is why not right why
 

2093
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,420
my thinking is why not right why
couldn't with an AI couldn't we achieve

2094
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:46,430
couldn't with an AI couldn't we achieve
 

2095
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:49,860
couldn't with an AI couldn't we achieve
the kind of level of affection that

2096
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:49,870
the kind of level of affection that
 

2097
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,640
the kind of level of affection that
humans feel among each other or with

2098
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:53,650
humans feel among each other or with
 

2099
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:57,610
humans feel among each other or with
friendly animals and so forth it's a

2100
00:41:57,610 --> 00:41:57,620
friendly animals and so forth it's a
 

2101
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:59,440
friendly animals and so forth it's a
question is it a good thing for us or

2102
00:41:59,440 --> 00:41:59,450
question is it a good thing for us or
 

2103
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,240
question is it a good thing for us or
not that misses another going right

2104
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,250
not that misses another going right
 

2105
00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:03,660
not that misses another going right
because I mean

2106
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:03,670
because I mean
 

2107
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:07,349
because I mean
but I don't see why not why not yeah so

2108
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:07,359
but I don't see why not why not yeah so
 

2109
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,180
but I don't see why not why not yeah so
he almost says love was the answer maybe

2110
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:09,190
he almost says love was the answer maybe
 

2111
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,849
he almost says love was the answer maybe
he should say love is the objective

2112
00:42:11,849 --> 00:42:11,859
he should say love is the objective
 

2113
00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:16,700
he should say love is the objective
function and then RL is the answer maybe

2114
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:16,710
function and then RL is the answer maybe
 

2115
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,990
function and then RL is the answer maybe
I'll Peter thank you so much I don't
