english because there's such different

1152
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:52,640
english because there's such different
 

1153
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,669

many more than russian actually i think
so it's often difficult to find the

1162
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:00,400

points

1198
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:38,160
points
 

1199
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,870
points
plenty of plenty of pain points i mean

1200
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:40,880
plenty of plenty of pain points i mean
 

1201
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,110
plenty of plenty of pain points i mean
as as often the case it's with scaling

1202
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:43,120
as as often the case it's with scaling
 

1203
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,710
as as often the case it's with scaling
it up right um

1204
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:44,720
it up right um
 

1205
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,230
it up right um
and in this case you know the scaling is

1206
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:46,240
and in this case you know the scaling is
 

1207
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,909
and in this case you know the scaling is
kind of scaling the

1208
00:19:47,909 --> 00:19:47,919
kind of scaling the
 

1209
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,510

the marketplace so to speak right rev is

1210
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,520
the marketplace so to speak right rev is
 

1211
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,270
the marketplace so to speak right rev is
essentially a two-sided marketplace

1212
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:51,280
essentially a two-sided marketplace
 

1213
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,310
essentially a two-sided marketplace
right because

1214
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:52,320
right because
 

1215
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,990
right because
you know there's the customers and then

1216
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:54,000
you know there's the customers and then
 

1217
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,590
you know there's the customers and then
there's the rivers um

1218
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:55,600
there's the rivers um
 

1219
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,669
there's the rivers um
if there's not enough reverse rivers

1220
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:57,679
if there's not enough reverse rivers
 

1221
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,110
if there's not enough reverse rivers
there will call our freelancers

1222
00:19:59,110 --> 00:19:59,120
there will call our freelancers
 

1223
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,909
there will call our freelancers
so if there's not enough reverse then

1224
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:01,919
so if there's not enough reverse then
 

1225
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,510
so if there's not enough reverse then

the gig economy quote unquote
 

1469
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,870
the gig economy quote unquote
right so it really is a pretty wide

1470
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:04,880
right so it really is a pretty wide
 

1471
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,230
right so it really is a pretty wide
variety of folks

1472
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:06,240
variety of folks
 

1473
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,549
variety of folks
yeah it's kind of interesting through

1474
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:08,559
yeah it's kind of interesting through
 

1475
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,310
yeah it's kind of interesting through
the captioning process

1476
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,320
the captioning process
 

1477
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,390
the captioning process
for me to learn about the the the

1478
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:12,400
for me to learn about the the the
 

1479
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,110
for me to learn about the the the
reverse because um

1480
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:15,120
reverse because um
 

1481
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,789
reverse because um
like some are clearly like weirdly

1482
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:18,799
like some are clearly like weirdly
 

1483
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,789
like some are clearly like weirdly
knowledgeable about technical concepts

1484
00:24:22,789 --> 00:24:22,799
knowledgeable about technical concepts
 

1485
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,190
knowledgeable about technical concepts
like you can tell by how good they are

1486
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:25,200
like you can tell by how good they are
 

1487
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,070
like you can tell by how good they are
at

1488
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,080
at
 

1489
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,310
at
like capitalizing stuff like like

1490
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:28,320
like capitalizing stuff like like
 

1491
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,190
like capitalizing stuff like like
technical terms like

1492
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:29,200
technical terms like
 

1493
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,830
technical terms like
machine learning and deep learning right

1494
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:30,840
machine learning and deep learning right
 

1495
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,990
machine learning and deep learning right
like i've used rev to annotate

1496
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:34,000
like i've used rev to annotate
 

1497
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,789
like i've used rev to annotate
to caption um the deep learning lectures

1498
00:24:36,789 --> 00:24:36,799
to caption um the deep learning lectures
 

1499
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,789
to caption um the deep learning lectures
or machine learning lectures i did

1500
00:24:38,789 --> 00:24:38,799
or machine learning lectures i did
 

1501
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,909
or machine learning lectures i did
at mit and it's funny like a large

1502
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:41,919
at mit and it's funny like a large
 

1503
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,789
at mit and it's funny like a large
number of them were like i don't know if

1504
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
number of them were like i don't know if
 

1505
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,149
number of them were like i don't know if
they looked it up or

1506
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:46,159
they looked it up or
 

1507
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,750
they looked it up or
already knowledgeable but they do a

1508
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
already knowledgeable but they do a
 

1509
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,310
already knowledgeable but they do a
really good job but like

1510
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:50,320
really good job but like
 

1511
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,470
really good job but like
they invest time into these things they

1512
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:52,480
they invest time into these things they
 

1513
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,549
they invest time into these things they
will like do research they will google

1514
00:24:54,549 --> 00:24:54,559
will like do research they will google
 

1515
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,149
will like do research they will google
things you know so kind of make sure to

1516
00:24:56,149 --> 00:24:56,159
things you know so kind of make sure to
 

1517
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,190
things you know so kind of make sure to
they get it right

1518
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
they get it right
 

1519
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,190
they get it right
but to some of them it's like it's

1520
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,200
but to some of them it's like it's
 

1521
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,390
but to some of them it's like it's
actually part of the

1522
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:00,400
actually part of the
 

1523
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,630
actually part of the
enjoyment of the work like they'll tell

1524
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:02,640
enjoyment of the work like they'll tell
 

1525
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,110
enjoyment of the work like they'll tell
us you know i love doing this because

1526
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:05,120
us you know i love doing this because
 

1527
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,789
us you know i love doing this because
i get paid to watch a documentary on

1528
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:06,799
i get paid to watch a documentary on
 

1529
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,070
i get paid to watch a documentary on
something right and i learn something

1530
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,080
something right and i learn something
 

1531
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,990
something right and i learn something
while i'm transcribing right

1532
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:10,000
while i'm transcribing right
 

1533
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,549
while i'm transcribing right
pretty cool yeah so what's that uh

1534
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:12,559
pretty cool yeah so what's that uh
 

1535
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:13,430
pretty cool yeah so what's that uh
captioning

1536
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:13,440
captioning
 

1537
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,269
captioning
transcription process look like for the

1538
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:15,279
transcription process look like for the
 

1539
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,190
transcription process look like for the
rever can you maybe speak to that to

1540
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:17,200
rever can you maybe speak to that to
 

1541
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,870
rever can you maybe speak to that to
give people a sense

1542
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:18,880
give people a sense
 

1543
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,110
give people a sense
like how much is automated how much is

1544
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,120
like how much is automated how much is
 

1545
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,950
like how much is automated how much is
manual

1546
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
manual
 

1547
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,029
manual
what's the actual interface look like

1548
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:25,039
what's the actual interface look like
 

1549
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,149
what's the actual interface look like
all that kind of stuff

1550
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,159
all that kind of stuff
 

1551
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,470
all that kind of stuff
yeah so you know we've invested a pretty

1552
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
yeah so you know we've invested a pretty
 

1553
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,350
yeah so you know we've invested a pretty
good amount of time

1554
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:29,360
good amount of time
 

1555
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,149
good amount of time
to give like our reverse um the best

1556
00:25:32,149 --> 00:25:32,159
to give like our reverse um the best
 

1557
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,830
to give like our reverse um the best
tools possible you know so typical day

1558
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:33,840
tools possible you know so typical day
 

1559
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,549
tools possible you know so typical day
forever

1560
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
forever
 

1561
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,950
forever
they might log into their workspace

1562
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:36,960
they might log into their workspace
 

1563
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,990
they might log into their workspace
they'll see

1564
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,000
they'll see
 

1565
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,710
they'll see
a list of audios that need to be

1566
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:40,720
a list of audios that need to be
 

1567
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,510
a list of audios that need to be
transcribed and

1568
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:41,520
transcribed and
 

1569
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,710
transcribed and
we try to give them tools to pick

1570
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:42,720
we try to give them tools to pick
 

1571
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,149
we try to give them tools to pick
specifically the ones they want to do

1572
00:25:44,149 --> 00:25:44,159
specifically the ones they want to do
 

1573
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:44,950
specifically the ones they want to do
you know so

1574
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:44,960
you know so
 

1575
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,110
you know so
maybe some people like to do longer

1576
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:47,120
maybe some people like to do longer
 

1577
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,470
maybe some people like to do longer
audios or shorter audios

1578
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
audios or shorter audios
 

1579
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,390
audios or shorter audios
people have their preferences some

1580
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:52,400
people have their preferences some
 

1581
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,470
people have their preferences some
people like to do audios in a particular

1582
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:54,480
people like to do audios in a particular
 

1583
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,390
people like to do audios in a particular
subject or from a particular country so

1584
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:56,400
subject or from a particular country so
 

1585
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,750
subject or from a particular country so
we try to give people

1586
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:57,760
we try to give people
 

1587
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,830
we try to give people
you know the tools to control things

1588
00:25:59,830 --> 00:25:59,840
you know the tools to control things
 

1589
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,029
you know the tools to control things
like that

1590
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:01,039
like that
 

1591
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,430
like that
and then when they pick what they want

1592
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:03,440
and then when they pick what they want
 

1593
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,470
and then when they pick what they want
to do

1594
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:04,480
to do
 

1595
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,310
to do
we'll launch a specialized editor that

1596
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:06,320
we'll launch a specialized editor that
 

1597
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,789
we'll launch a specialized editor that
we build to make transcription

1598
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
we build to make transcription
 

1599
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,870
we build to make transcription
as efficient as possible they'll start

1600
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:10,880
as efficient as possible they'll start
 

1601
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,710
as efficient as possible they'll start
with a speech rag draft so you know we

1602
00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:12,720
with a speech rag draft so you know we
 

1603
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,510
with a speech rag draft so you know we
have our

1604
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:13,520
have our
 

1605
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,310
have our
machine learning model for automated

1606
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:16,320
machine learning model for automated
 

1607
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,750
machine learning model for automated
speech recognition they'll start with

1608
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:17,760
speech recognition they'll start with
 

1609
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,390
speech recognition they'll start with
that

1610
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:18,400
that
 

1611
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,430
that
and then our tools are optimized to help

1612
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:21,440
and then our tools are optimized to help
 

1613
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,549
and then our tools are optimized to help
them correct that

1614
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
them correct that
 

1615
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:23,909
them correct that
so it's basically a process of

1616
00:26:23,909 --> 00:26:23,919
so it's basically a process of
 

1617
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,830
so it's basically a process of
correction um

1618
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:25,840
correction um
 

1619
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,750
correction um
yeah it depends on you know i would say

1620
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:27,760
yeah it depends on you know i would say
 

1621
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,350
yeah it depends on you know i would say
the audio

1622
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:29,360
the audio
 

1623
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,350
the audio
if audio itself is pretty good like

1624
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:31,360
if audio itself is pretty good like
 

1625
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,029
if audio itself is pretty good like
probably like our podcast right now

1626
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:33,039
probably like our podcast right now
 

1627
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,070
probably like our podcast right now
would be quite good

1628
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:34,080
would be quite good
 

1629
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,669
would be quite good
so dsr would do a fairly good job

1630
00:26:37,669 --> 00:26:37,679
so dsr would do a fairly good job
 

1631
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,070
so dsr would do a fairly good job
but if you imagine someone recorded a

1632
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
but if you imagine someone recorded a
 

1633
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,029
but if you imagine someone recorded a
lecture

1634
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
lecture
 

1635
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,710
lecture
you know in the back of a auditorium

1636
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:44,720
you know in the back of a auditorium
 

1637
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,789
you know in the back of a auditorium
right where like the speaker is really

1638
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:46,799
right where like the speaker is really
 

1639
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:47,990
right where like the speaker is really
far away and there's maybe a lot of

1640
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,000
far away and there's maybe a lot of
 

1641
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,909
far away and there's maybe a lot of
crosstalk and things like that

1642
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:49,919
crosstalk and things like that
 

1643
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,230
crosstalk and things like that
then maybe the sr wouldn't do a good job

1644
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,240
then maybe the sr wouldn't do a good job
 

1645
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,510
then maybe the sr wouldn't do a good job
so the person might say like you know

1646
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:53,520
so the person might say like you know
 

1647
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,549
so the person might say like you know
what i'm just going to do it from

1648
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
what i'm just going to do it from
 

1649
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:55,750
what i'm just going to do it from
scratch

1650
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:55,760
scratch
 

1651
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,990
scratch
yeah so it kind of really depends what

1652
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
yeah so it kind of really depends what
 

1653
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,430
yeah so it kind of really depends what
would you say is the speed that you

1654
00:26:59,430 --> 00:26:59,440
would you say is the speed that you
 

1655
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,470
would you say is the speed that you
could possibly get

1656
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:00,480
could possibly get
 

1657
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,870
could possibly get
like what's the fastest can you get is

1658
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
like what's the fastest can you get is
 

1659
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,110
like what's the fastest can you get is
it possible to get real time or no

1660
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:05,120
it possible to get real time or no
 

1661
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,510
it possible to get real time or no
as you're like listening can you write

1662
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:07,520
as you're like listening can you write
 

1663
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,470
as you're like listening can you write
as fast as

1664
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:08,480
as fast as
 

1665
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,390
as fast as
uh real time would be pretty difficult

1666
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:10,400
uh real time would be pretty difficult
 

1667
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,669
uh real time would be pretty difficult
it's actually a pretty

1668
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:11,679
it's actually a pretty
 

1669
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,590
it's actually a pretty
it's not an easy job you know we

1670
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:13,600
it's not an easy job you know we
 

1671
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,950
it's not an easy job you know we
actually encourage

1672
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:14,960
actually encourage
 

1673
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,710
actually encourage
everyone at the company to try to be a

1674
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:16,720
everyone at the company to try to be a
 

1675
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,310
everyone at the company to try to be a
transcriber for their descriptions where

1676
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:18,320
transcriber for their descriptions where
 

1677
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,269
transcriber for their descriptions where
they

1678
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
they
 

1679
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,549
they
um and it's way harder than you might

1680
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:22,559
um and it's way harder than you might
 

1681
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:23,190
um and it's way harder than you might
think it

1682
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:23,200
think it
 

1683
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,470
think it
it is right because people talk fast and

1684
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:26,480
it is right because people talk fast and
 

1685
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,149
it is right because people talk fast and
people have accents

1686
00:27:28,149 --> 00:27:28,159
people have accents
 

1687
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:29,830
people have accents
and all this kind of stuff so real time

1688
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:29,840
and all this kind of stuff so real time
 

1689
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,470
and all this kind of stuff so real time
is pretty difficult is it possible

1690
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
is pretty difficult is it possible
 

1691
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,830
is pretty difficult is it possible
like there's somebody we're probably

1692
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:33,840
like there's somebody we're probably
 

1693
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,070
like there's somebody we're probably
going to use rev

1694
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:36,080
going to use rev
 

1695
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,510
going to use rev
to caption this they're they're

1696
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:37,520
to caption this they're they're
 

1697
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,269
to caption this they're they're
listening to this right now

1698
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:39,279
listening to this right now
 

1699
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,669
listening to this right now
what's what's uh what do you think is

1700
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:41,679
what's what's uh what do you think is
 

1701
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,350
what's what's uh what do you think is
the fastest you could possibly get on

1702
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:43,360
the fastest you could possibly get on
 

1703
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,789
the fastest you could possibly get on
this right now

1704
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:44,799
this right now
 

1705
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,870
this right now
i think on a good audio maybe two to

1706
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:46,880
i think on a good audio maybe two to
 

1707
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,310
i think on a good audio maybe two to
three x i would say

1708
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:48,320
three x i would say
 

1709
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,710
three x i would say
uh real time meaning it takes two to

1710
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:50,720
uh real time meaning it takes two to
 

1711
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,549
uh real time meaning it takes two to
three times longer than the actual audio

1712
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
three times longer than the actual audio
 

1713
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,070
three times longer than the actual audio
of the

1714
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
of the
 

1715
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,789
of the
of the podcast this is this is so meta i

1716
00:27:56,789 --> 00:27:56,799
of the podcast this is this is so meta i
 

1717
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:57,830
of the podcast this is this is so meta i
can just imagine

1718
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:57,840
can just imagine
 

1719
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,590
can just imagine
the whoever's working on this right now

1720
00:27:59,590 --> 00:27:59,600
the whoever's working on this right now
 

1721
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,950
the whoever's working on this right now
like you're way wrong

1722
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:00,960
like you're way wrong
 

1723
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,430
like you're way wrong
you're way wrong this takes way longer

1724
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:03,440
you're way wrong this takes way longer
 

1725
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,230
you're way wrong this takes way longer
but yeah

1726
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:04,240
but yeah
 

1727
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,350
but yeah
you doubted me i could do real time

1728
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:07,360
you doubted me i could do real time
 

1729
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,110
you doubted me i could do real time
yeah okay so you mentioned asr

1730
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:11,120
yeah okay so you mentioned asr
 

1731
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,070
yeah okay so you mentioned asr
can you speak to what is asr automatic

1732
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,080
can you speak to what is asr automatic
 

1733
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,430
can you speak to what is asr automatic
speech recognition

1734
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:15,440
speech recognition
 

1735
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,269
speech recognition
how much like what is the gap

1736
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:19,279
how much like what is the gap
 

1737
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,269
how much like what is the gap
between perfect human performance and uh

1738
00:28:23,269 --> 00:28:23,279
between perfect human performance and uh
 

1739
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,470
between perfect human performance and uh
perfect or pretty damn good asr

1740
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:26,480
perfect or pretty damn good asr
 

1741
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,070
perfect or pretty damn good asr
yeah so is our automatic speech

1742
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,080
yeah so is our automatic speech
 

1743
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,230
yeah so is our automatic speech
recognition it's a

1744
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:30,240
recognition it's a
 

1745
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,750
recognition it's a
class of machine learning problem right

1746
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:31,760
class of machine learning problem right
 

1747
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,510
class of machine learning problem right
to take you know speech like

1748
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:33,520
to take you know speech like
 

1749
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,590
to take you know speech like
we were talking and transform it into a

1750
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:35,600
we were talking and transform it into a
 

1751
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,029
we were talking and transform it into a
sequence of words essentially

1752
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
sequence of words essentially
 

1753
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:39,909
sequence of words essentially
audio of people talking audio audio to

1754
00:28:39,909 --> 00:28:39,919
audio of people talking audio audio to
 

1755
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,510
audio of people talking audio audio to
words

1756
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:41,520
words
 

1757
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,710
words
and you know there's a variety of

1758
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:42,720
and you know there's a variety of
 

1759
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,789
and you know there's a variety of
different approaches and techniques

1760
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:44,799
different approaches and techniques
 

1761
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,470
different approaches and techniques
which we could talk about later if you

1762
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:46,480
which we could talk about later if you
 

1763
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,389
which we could talk about later if you
want

1764
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:48,399
want
 

1765
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,630
want
so you know we think we have pretty much

1766
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:50,640
so you know we think we have pretty much
 

1767
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,950
so you know we think we have pretty much
the world's best asr for this kind of

1768
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:52,960
the world's best asr for this kind of
 

1769
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,029
the world's best asr for this kind of
um speech right so there's there's

1770
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
um speech right so there's there's
 

1771
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,870
um speech right so there's there's
different kinds of domains right for asr

1772
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:56,880
different kinds of domains right for asr
 

1773
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,950
different kinds of domains right for asr
like one domain might be

1774
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:58,960
like one domain might be
 

1775
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,470
like one domain might be
voice assistance right so siri um

1776
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:02,480
voice assistance right so siri um
 

1777
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,909
voice assistance right so siri um
very different than what we're doing

1778
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:03,919
very different than what we're doing
 

1779
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,430
very different than what we're doing
right because siri there's fairly

1780
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:05,440
right because siri there's fairly
 

1781
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,870
right because siri there's fairly
limited vocabulary

1782
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:06,880
limited vocabulary
 

1783
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,789
limited vocabulary
you know you know you might ask siri to

1784
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:08,799
you know you know you might ask siri to
 

1785
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,029
you know you know you might ask siri to
play a song or you know order pizza or

1786
00:29:11,029 --> 00:29:11,039
play a song or you know order pizza or
 

1787
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,870
play a song or you know order pizza or
whatever and it's very good at doing

1788
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:12,880
whatever and it's very good at doing
 

1789
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,549
whatever and it's very good at doing
that

1790
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
that
 

1791
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,830
that
very different from when we're start

1792
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
very different from when we're start
 

1793
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,070
very different from when we're start
talking in a very unstructured way

1794
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,080
talking in a very unstructured way
 

1795
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,590
talking in a very unstructured way
and siri will also generally like adapt

1796
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:19,600
and siri will also generally like adapt
 

1797
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,350
and siri will also generally like adapt
to your voice and stuff like this

1798
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:21,360
to your voice and stuff like this
 

1799
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,190
to your voice and stuff like this
so for this kind of audio we think we

1800
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:23,200
so for this kind of audio we think we
 

1801
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,830
so for this kind of audio we think we
have the best and

1802
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:25,840
have the best and
 

1803
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,590
have the best and
our accuracy right now it's i think it's

1804
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:29,600
our accuracy right now it's i think it's
 

1805
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,430
our accuracy right now it's i think it's
maybe 14 word error rate on on um

1806
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:33,440
maybe 14 word error rate on on um
 

1807
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,710
maybe 14 word error rate on on um
our test test suite that we generally

1808
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:34,720
our test test suite that we generally
 

1809
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,230
our test test suite that we generally
use to measure so word error rate is

1810
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:36,240
use to measure so word error rate is
 

1811
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,510
use to measure so word error rate is
like one way to measure

1812
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:37,520
like one way to measure
 

1813
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,830
like one way to measure
uh accuracy for asr right so what's

1814
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:39,840
uh accuracy for asr right so what's
 

1815
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,870
uh accuracy for asr right so what's
fourteen percent

1816
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:40,880
fourteen percent
 

1817
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,590
fourteen percent
what fourteen percent means across this

1818
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:43,600
what fourteen percent means across this
 

1819
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,710
what fourteen percent means across this
test suite

1820
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:44,720
test suite
 

1821
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,830
test suite
of a variety of different audios um

1822
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:47,840
of a variety of different audios um
 

1823
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,590
of a variety of different audios um
it would be um it would get

1824
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:51,600
it would be um it would get
 

1825
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,590
it would be um it would get
in some way fourteen percent of the

1826
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:53,600
in some way fourteen percent of the
 

1827
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,789
in some way fourteen percent of the
words wrong

1828
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:54,799
words wrong
 

1829
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,110
words wrong
uh 14 of the words wrong yeah so

1830
00:29:59,110 --> 00:29:59,120
uh 14 of the words wrong yeah so
 

1831
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,269
uh 14 of the words wrong yeah so
the way you kind of calculate it is you

1832
00:30:01,269 --> 00:30:01,279
the way you kind of calculate it is you
 

1833
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,149
the way you kind of calculate it is you
might add up

1834
00:30:02,149 --> 00:30:02,159
might add up
 

1835
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,389
might add up
insertions deletions and substitutions

1836
00:30:04,389 --> 00:30:04,399
insertions deletions and substitutions
 

1837
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,350
insertions deletions and substitutions
right so

1838
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:05,360
right so
 

1839
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,669
right so
insertions is like extra words deletions

1840
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
insertions is like extra words deletions
 

1841
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,470
insertions is like extra words deletions
are words that

1842
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:08,480
are words that
 

1843
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,909
are words that
we said but um weren't in the transcript

1844
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:11,919
we said but um weren't in the transcript
 

1845
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,909
we said but um weren't in the transcript
right substitutions just

1846
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
right substitutions just
 

1847
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,389
right substitutions just
use that apple but i said but the sr

1848
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:16,399
use that apple but i said but the sr
 

1849
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,350
use that apple but i said but the sr
thought was able something like this

1850
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:19,360
thought was able something like this
 

1851
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,070
thought was able something like this
human accuracy most people think

1852
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:22,080
human accuracy most people think
 

1853
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,389
human accuracy most people think
realistically it's like

1854
00:30:24,389 --> 00:30:24,399
realistically it's like
 

1855
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,310
realistically it's like
three percent two percent word error

1856
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,320
three percent two percent word error
 

1857
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,590
three percent two percent word error
rate would be like the max achievable

1858
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:29,600
rate would be like the max achievable
 

1859
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,669
rate would be like the max achievable
so there's still quite a gap right would

1860
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:31,679
so there's still quite a gap right would
 

1861
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:32,630
so there's still quite a gap right would
you say that

1862
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:32,640
you say that
 

1863
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,789
you say that
so youtube when i upload videos often

1864
00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:34,799
so youtube when i upload videos often
 

1865
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,870
so youtube when i upload videos often
generates automatic captions

1866
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:36,880
generates automatic captions
 

1867
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,029
generates automatic captions
are you sort of from a company

1868
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:39,039
are you sort of from a company
 

1869
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,710
are you sort of from a company
perspective from a

1870
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:40,720
perspective from a
 

1871
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,870
perspective from a
tech perspective are you trying to beat

1872
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:42,880
tech perspective are you trying to beat
 

1873
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,149

google it's a hell of a so google i mean

1876
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:47,279
google it's a hell of a so google i mean
 

1877
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,950
google it's a hell of a so google i mean
i don't know how seriously they take

1878
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:48,960
i don't know how seriously they take
 

1879
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,710
i don't know how seriously they take
this task but i imagine it's quite

1880
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:50,720
this task but i imagine it's quite
 

1881
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,750
this task but i imagine it's quite
serious

1882
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:51,760
serious
 

1883
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,830
serious
and they you know google is probably

1884
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:55,840
and they you know google is probably
 

1885
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,990
and they you know google is probably
up there in terms of their teams on

1886
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:00,000

 

1887
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,630

on asr just nlp natural language

1888
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:02,640
on asr just nlp natural language
 

1889
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,310
on asr just nlp natural language
processing different technologies

1890
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:04,320
processing different technologies
 

1891
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,789
processing different technologies
so do you think you can be google on

1892
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:06,799
so do you think you can be google on
 

1893
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:08,549
so do you think you can be google on
this kind of stuff yeah we think so

1894
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:08,559
this kind of stuff yeah we think so
 

1895
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:11,669
this kind of stuff yeah we think so
um google just woke up on my phone this

1896
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:11,679
um google just woke up on my phone this
 

1897
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,590
um google just woke up on my phone this
is hilarious okay now google is

1898
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:13,600
is hilarious okay now google is
 

1899
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,710
is hilarious okay now google is
listening

1900
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:14,720
listening
 

1901
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,509
listening
sending it back to headquarters for

1902
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:17,519
sending it back to headquarters for
 

1903
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,430
sending it back to headquarters for
these rough people

1904
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:19,440
these rough people
 

1905
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,269
these rough people
but that's the goal yeah i mean we

1906
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:21,279
but that's the goal yeah i mean we
 

1907
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,029
but that's the goal yeah i mean we
measure ourselves against like google

1908
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:23,039
measure ourselves against like google
 

1909
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,029
measure ourselves against like google
amazon microsoft you know

1910
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:25,039
amazon microsoft you know
 

1911
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,149
amazon microsoft you know
some of the some smaller competitors um

1912
00:31:28,149 --> 00:31:28,159
some of the some smaller competitors um
 

1913
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,310
some of the some smaller competitors um
and we use like our internal tests we

1914
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,320
and we use like our internal tests we
 

1915
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,509
and we use like our internal tests we
try to compose it of

1916
00:31:31,509 --> 00:31:31,519
try to compose it of
 

1917
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,350
try to compose it of
a pretty representative set of ideas

1918
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:33,360
a pretty representative set of ideas
 

1919
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,110
a pretty representative set of ideas
maybe it's some podcasts

1920
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:35,120
maybe it's some podcasts
 

1921
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,909
maybe it's some podcasts
some videos some intro some interviews

1922
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:37,919
some videos some intro some interviews
 

1923
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,590
some videos some intro some interviews
some lectures things like that right

1924
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:39,600
some lectures things like that right
 

1925
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,710
some lectures things like that right
and we beat them in our own testing

1926
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:42,720
and we beat them in our own testing
 

1927
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,830
and we beat them in our own testing
and uh actually rev offers automated

1928
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:45,840
and uh actually rev offers automated
 

1929
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,110
and uh actually rev offers automated
like you can actually just do the

1930
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:47,120
like you can actually just do the
 

1931
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,830
like you can actually just do the
automated

1932
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:47,840
automated
 

1933
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,549
automated
uh captioning so like i guess it's like

1934
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:50,559
uh captioning so like i guess it's like
 

1935
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,350
uh captioning so like i guess it's like
way cheaper

1936
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
way cheaper
 

1937
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,149
way cheaper
whatever it is whatever the rates are

1938
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:54,159
whatever it is whatever the rates are
 

1939
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:54,630
whatever it is whatever the rates are
yeah

1940
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:54,640
yeah
 

1941
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,470
yeah
yeah so by the way it used to be a

1942
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:56,480
yeah so by the way it used to be a
 

1943
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,909
yeah so by the way it used to be a
dollar per minute

1944
00:31:57,909 --> 00:31:57,919
dollar per minute
 

1945
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,149
dollar per minute
for captioning and transcription i think

1946
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:00,159
for captioning and transcription i think
 

1947
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,750
for captioning and transcription i think
it's like a dollar fifteen or something

1948
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:01,760
it's like a dollar fifteen or something
 

1949
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,549
it's like a dollar fifteen or something
like that

1950
00:32:02,549 --> 00:32:02,559
like that
 

1951
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,830
like that
twenty-five dollar twenty-five uh

1952
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:05,840
twenty-five dollar twenty-five uh
 

1953
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,710
twenty-five dollar twenty-five uh

kind of
 

1981
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,750
kind of
um feel to it but it wasn't as automated

1982
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:35,760
um feel to it but it wasn't as automated
 

1983

like the drag and drop the entirety of
the interface it's like the thing we're

1986
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:38,640
the interface it's like the thing we're
 

1987
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,509
the interface it's like the thing we're
talking about

1988
00:32:39,509 --> 00:32:39,519
talking about
 

1989

the one click that's genius right there

1998
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:52,320
the one click that's genius right there
 

1999
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,269
the one click that's genius right there
like that is so

2000

like that is so
 

2001
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,509

and i mean rev is uh almost there

2006
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:00,320
and i mean rev is uh almost there
 

2007
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,590
and i mean rev is uh almost there
i mean there's like some i'm trying to

2008

so i i think i've uh
 

2013
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,029
so i i think i've uh
i stopped using um this pipeline but rev

2014
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:11,039
i stopped using um this pipeline but rev
 

2015
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,509
i stopped using um this pipeline but rev
offers it and that i like it but it was

2016
00:33:13,509 --> 00:33:13,519
offers it and that i like it but it was
 

2017
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,389
offers it and that i like it but it was
causing me some

2018
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:14,399
causing me some
 

2019
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:17,909
causing me some
issues uh on my side which is um

2020
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:17,919
issues uh on my side which is um
 

2021
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,389
issues uh on my side which is um
you can connect it to like dropbox and

2022
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:20,399
you can connect it to like dropbox and
 

2023
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,710
you can connect it to like dropbox and
it generates the files and dropbox

2024
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:22,720
it generates the files and dropbox
 

2025
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,509
it generates the files and dropbox
so like it it it closes the loop to

2026
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:25,519
so like it it it closes the loop to
 

2027
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,509
so like it it it closes the loop to
where i don't have to go to rev at all

2028
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:27,519
where i don't have to go to rev at all
 

2029
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,630
where i don't have to go to rev at all
and i can download it uh um sorry i

2030
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:30,640
and i can download it uh um sorry i
 

2031
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,750
and i can download it uh um sorry i
don't have to go

2032
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:31,760
don't have to go
 

2033
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,070
don't have to go
to rev at all and to download the files

2034
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,080
to rev at all and to download the files
 

2035
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:34,870
to rev at all and to download the files
it could just like

2036
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:34,880
it could just like
 

2037
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,549
it could just like
automatically copy them all right you

2038
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:36,559
automatically copy them all right you
 

2039
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,549
automatically copy them all right you
put in your dropbox and you know

2040
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:38,559
put in your dropbox and you know
 

2041
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:40,950
put in your dropbox and you know
a day later or maybe a few hours later

2042
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:40,960
a day later or maybe a few hours later
 

2043
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,310
a day later or maybe a few hours later
yeah eventually

2044
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:42,320
yeah eventually
 

2045
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,710

00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,240
what does it take like approach wise
 

2115
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,069
what does it take like approach wise
machine learning wise how hard is this

2116
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:54,079
machine learning wise how hard is this
 

2117
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:54,869
machine learning wise how hard is this
problem

2118
00:34:54,869 --> 00:34:54,879
problem
 

2119
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:56,310
problem
how do you get to the three percent

2120
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:56,320
how do you get to the three percent
 

2121
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,550
how do you get to the three percent
error rate like what's your vision of

2122
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:58,560
error rate like what's your vision of
 

2123
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,270
error rate like what's your vision of
all of this

2124
00:34:59,270 --> 00:34:59,280
all of this
 

2125
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,910
all of this
yeah well the three percent ratio error

2126
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:01,920
yeah well the three percent ratio error
 

2127
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,030
yeah well the three percent ratio error
rate is definitely

2128
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,040
rate is definitely
 

2129
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,069
rate is definitely
that's that's the grand vision um

2130
00:35:06,069 --> 00:35:06,079
that's that's the grand vision um
 

2131
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,750
that's that's the grand vision um
we'll see what it takes to get there um

2132
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:09,760
we'll see what it takes to get there um
 

2133
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,870
we'll see what it takes to get there um
but we believe you know in in asr

2134
00:35:12,870 --> 00:35:12,880
but we believe you know in in asr
 

2135
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,430
but we believe you know in in asr
the biggest thing is the data right like

2136
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:15,440
the biggest thing is the data right like
 

2137
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,710
the biggest thing is the data right like
that's true of like a lot of machine

2138
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:16,720
that's true of like a lot of machine
 

2139
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,150
that's true of like a lot of machine
learning problems today right

2140
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:18,160
learning problems today right
 

2141
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,069
learning problems today right
the more data you have and the higher

2142
00:35:20,069 --> 00:35:20,079
the more data you have and the higher
 

2143
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,430
the more data you have and the higher
quality the data the

2144
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:21,440
quality the data the
 

2145
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,710
quality the data the
better label the data um

2146
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:24,720
better label the data um
 

2147
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,950
better label the data um
yeah that doesn't get good results and

2148
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:26,960
yeah that doesn't get good results and
 

2149
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,310
yeah that doesn't get good results and
we at rev have kind of like the best

2150
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
we at rev have kind of like the best
 

2151
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,670
we at rev have kind of like the best
data like we have

2152
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:29,680
data like we have
 

2153
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,910
data like we have
i think you're literally your literal

2154
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:31,920
i think you're literally your literal
 

2155
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,910
i think you're literally your literal
model is annotating the data

2156
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:33,920
model is annotating the data
 

2157
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,750
model is annotating the data
our business model is being paid to

2158
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:35,760
our business model is being paid to
 

2159
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,589
our business model is being paid to
annotate

2160
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:37,599
annotate
 

2161
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,390
annotate
the data so it's kind of like a pretty

2162
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:40,400
the data so it's kind of like a pretty
 

2163
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,990
the data so it's kind of like a pretty
magical flywheel

2164
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:42,000
magical flywheel
 

2165
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,829
magical flywheel
yeah and so we've kind of like ridden

2166
00:35:43,829 --> 00:35:43,839
yeah and so we've kind of like ridden
 

2167
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:45,190
yeah and so we've kind of like ridden
this flywheel to

2168
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,200
this flywheel to
 

2169
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,790
this flywheel to
to this point um and we think we're

2170
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:48,800
to this point um and we think we're
 

2171
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,270
to this point um and we think we're
still

2172
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
still
 

2173
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,270
still
kind of in the early stages of figuring

2174
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:51,280
kind of in the early stages of figuring
 

2175
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,950
kind of in the early stages of figuring
out all the parts of the flywheel to use

2176
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:52,960
out all the parts of the flywheel to use
 

2177
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,550
out all the parts of the flywheel to use
you know because

2178
00:35:54,550 --> 00:35:54,560
you know because
 

2179
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,750
you know because
we have the final transcripts and we

2180
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:57,760
we have the final transcripts and we
 

2181
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,069
we have the final transcripts and we
have

2182
00:35:58,069 --> 00:35:58,079
have
 

2183
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,510
have
the um the audios and we train on that

2184
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:01,520
the um the audios and we train on that
 

2185
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,550
the um the audios and we train on that
but we in principle also have all the

2186
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
but we in principle also have all the
 

2187
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:07,589
but we in principle also have all the
edits that the reverse make right um

2188
00:36:07,589 --> 00:36:07,599
edits that the reverse make right um
 

2189
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,109
edits that the reverse make right um
oh that's interesting how can you use

2190
00:36:09,109 --> 00:36:09,119
oh that's interesting how can you use
 

2191
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,950
oh that's interesting how can you use
that as they'd done

2192
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:10,960
that as they'd done
 

2193
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,310
that as they'd done
that's that's something for us to figure

2194
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
that's that's something for us to figure
 

2195
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,150
that's that's something for us to figure
out in the future but you know

2196
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:14,160
out in the future but you know
 

2197
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,510
out in the future but you know
we feel like we're only in the early

2198
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:15,520
we feel like we're only in the early
 

2199
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,430
we feel like we're only in the early
stages right so the data but the data is

2200
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:17,440
stages right so the data but the data is
 

2201
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:17,750
stages right so the data but the data is
there

2202
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
there
 

2203
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,270
there
that'd be interesting like uh almost

2204
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:19,280
that'd be interesting like uh almost
 

2205
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,990
that'd be interesting like uh almost
like a recurrent neural net for fixing

2206
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,000
like a recurrent neural net for fixing
 

2207
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,230
like a recurrent neural net for fixing
for fixing transcripts i i always

2208
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,240
for fixing transcripts i i always
 

2209
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,589
for fixing transcripts i i always
remember

2210
00:36:25,589 --> 00:36:25,599
remember
 

2211
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,270
remember
we did uh segmentation annotation for uh

2212
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:29,280
we did uh segmentation annotation for uh
 

2213
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,630
we did uh segmentation annotation for uh
for driving data so

2214
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:30,640
for driving data so
 

2215
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,109
for driving data so
segmenting the scene like visual data

2216
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:33,119
segmenting the scene like visual data
 

2217
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,230
segmenting the scene like visual data
and you could

2218
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:34,240
and you could
 

2219
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,230
and you could
you can get all so it was drawing people

2220
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,240
you can get all so it was drawing people
 

2221
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,270
you can get all so it was drawing people
drawing polygons

2222
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:37,280
drawing polygons
 

2223
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,069
drawing polygons
around different objects and so on and

2224
00:36:40,069 --> 00:36:40,079
around different objects and so on and
 

2225
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:40,790
around different objects and so on and
it feels like

2226
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:40,800
it feels like
 

2227
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,870
it feels like
it always felt like there was a lot of

2228
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:42,880
it always felt like there was a lot of
 

2229
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,829
it always felt like there was a lot of
information

2230
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:43,839
information
 

2231
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,069
information
in the clicking the sequence of clicking

2232
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:46,079
in the clicking the sequence of clicking
 

2233
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,069
in the clicking the sequence of clicking
that people do the kind of fixing of the

2234
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:48,079
that people do the kind of fixing of the
 

2235
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,230
that people do the kind of fixing of the
pod guns that they do

2236
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,240
pod guns that they do
 

2237
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,870
pod guns that they do
now there's a few papers written about

2238
00:36:52,870 --> 00:36:52,880
now there's a few papers written about
 

2239
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,670
now there's a few papers written about
how to

2240
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:53,680
how to
 

2241
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,990
how to
draw polygons like with uh recurrent

2242
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:56,000
draw polygons like with uh recurrent
 

2243
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,670
draw polygons like with uh recurrent
neural nets

2244
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:57,680
neural nets
 

2245
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,870
neural nets
to try to learn from the human clicking

2246
00:37:00,870 --> 00:37:00,880
to try to learn from the human clicking
 

2247
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,230
to try to learn from the human clicking
but it was just like experimental

2248
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240
but it was just like experimental
 

2249
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,910
but it was just like experimental
you know it was one of those like cvpr

2250
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:05,920
you know it was one of those like cvpr
 

2251
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,990
you know it was one of those like cvpr
type papers that people do like a really

2252
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:08,000
type papers that people do like a really
 

2253
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,550
type papers that people do like a really
tiny data set it didn't feel like people

2254
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:10,560
tiny data set it didn't feel like people
 

2255
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,870
tiny data set it didn't feel like people
really tried to do it seriously

2256
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:12,880
really tried to do it seriously
 

2257
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,390
really tried to do it seriously
yeah i wonder i wonder if there's

2258
00:37:14,390 --> 00:37:14,400
yeah i wonder i wonder if there's
 

2259
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,390
yeah i wonder i wonder if there's
information in the fixing

2260
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:16,400
information in the fixing
 

2261
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,750
information in the fixing
that's hot that that provides

2262
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:19,760
that's hot that that provides
 

2263
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,550
that's hot that that provides
deeper set of signal than just like the

2264
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
deeper set of signal than just like the
 

2265
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,510
deeper set of signal than just like the
raw

2266
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:23,520
raw
 

2267
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,589
raw
uh data the intuition is for sure there

2268
00:37:25,589 --> 00:37:25,599
uh data the intuition is for sure there
 

2269
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:26,790
uh data the intuition is for sure there
must be right it must be

2270
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:26,800
must be right it must be
 

2271
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,950
must be right it must be
in in in all kinds of signals and how

2272
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:28,960
in in in all kinds of signals and how
 

2273
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,790
in in in all kinds of signals and how
long it took to you know make that edit

2274
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:30,800

like the focus is now
 

2287
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,069
like the focus is now
is you mentioned rev.a.i that's where

2288
00:37:42,069 --> 00:37:42,079
is you mentioned rev.a.i that's where
 

2289

you want to
 

2291
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,470
you want to
yeah so wrap the ai is kind of um

2292
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:46,480
yeah so wrap the ai is kind of um
 

2293
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,310
yeah so wrap the ai is kind of um
our way of bringing this asr to

2294
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:50,320
our way of bringing this asr to
 

2295
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,670
our way of bringing this asr to
you know the rest of the world right so

2296
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:51,680
you know the rest of the world right so
 

2297
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,750
you know the rest of the world right so
when we started um

2298
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:53,760
when we started um
 

2299
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,990
when we started um
we were human only and you know then we

2300
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,000
we were human only and you know then we
 

2301
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,750
we were human only and you know then we
kind of created this

2302
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:57,760
kind of created this
 

2303
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,750
kind of created this
uh temi service i think you might have

2304
00:37:59,750 --> 00:37:59,760
uh temi service i think you might have
 

2305
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,589
uh temi service i think you might have
used it which was kind of asr for the

2306
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:01,599
used it which was kind of asr for the
 

2307
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:02,230
used it which was kind of asr for the
consumer

2308
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:02,240
consumer
 

2309
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,190
consumer
right so if you don't want to pay a

2310
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:03,200
right so if you don't want to pay a
 

2311
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,390
right so if you don't want to pay a
dollar 25 but you want to paid

2312
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:06,400
dollar 25 but you want to paid
 

2313
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,470
dollar 25 but you want to paid
now it's 25 cents a minute i think and

2314
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:08,480
now it's 25 cents a minute i think and
 

2315
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,829
now it's 25 cents a minute i think and
you gather um

2316
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:09,839
you gather um
 

2317
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,990
you gather um
the transcript the machine generated

2318
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:12,000
the transcript the machine generated
 

2319
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,670
the transcript the machine generated
transcript you get an editor

2320
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680
transcript you get an editor
 

2321
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,470
transcript you get an editor
and you can kind of fix it up yourself

2322
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:16,480
and you can kind of fix it up yourself
 

2323
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,270
and you can kind of fix it up yourself
right

2324
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
right
 

2325
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,069
right
then we started using tsr for our own

2326
00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:20,079
then we started using tsr for our own
 

2327
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,750
then we started using tsr for our own
human transcriptionists

2328
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:21,760
human transcriptionists
 

2329
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,109
human transcriptionists
and then the kind of ai is the final

2330
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:23,119
and then the kind of ai is the final
 

2331
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,109
and then the kind of ai is the final
step of the journey which is you know we

2332
00:38:25,109 --> 00:38:25,119
step of the journey which is you know we
 

2333
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:25,990
step of the journey which is you know we
have this amazing

2334
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:26,000
have this amazing
 

2335
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,470
have this amazing
engine what can people build with it

2336
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,480
engine what can people build with it
 

2337
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,670
engine what can people build with it
right what kind of

2338
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:29,680
right what kind of
 

2339
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:33,510
right what kind of
new applications could be enabled

2340
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:33,520
new applications could be enabled
 

2341
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,510
new applications could be enabled
if you have speed track that's that

2342
00:38:35,510 --> 00:38:35,520
if you have speed track that's that
 

2343
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,510
if you have speed track that's that
accurate do you have ideas for this or

2344
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,520
accurate do you have ideas for this or
 

2345
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,270
accurate do you have ideas for this or
is it just providing it as a service and

2346
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,280
is it just providing it as a service and
 

2347
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,630

of learning from what people do with it

2354
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:45,359
of learning from what people do with it
 

2355
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,790
of learning from what people do with it
and we have ideas of our own as well of

2356
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:46,800
and we have ideas of our own as well of
 

2357
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,790
and we have ideas of our own as well of
course but it's a little bit like

2358
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
course but it's a little bit like
 

2359
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,630
course but it's a little bit like
you know when aws provided the building

2360
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:50,640
you know when aws provided the building
 

2361
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,310
you know when aws provided the building
blocks right um

2362
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:52,320
blocks right um
 

2363
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,750
blocks right um
and they saw what people built with it

2364
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
and they saw what people built with it
 

2365
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,510
and they saw what people built with it
and they try to make it easier to build

2366
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:55,520
and they try to make it easier to build
 

2367
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,230
and they try to make it easier to build
those things

2368
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:56,240
those things
 

2369
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,990
those things
right and we kind of hope to do the same

00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:46,800
would use a technology like rev or
 

2921

would use a technology like rev or
something like that to

00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:48,319
something like that to
 

2923
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,589
something like that to
to start converting everything

2924
00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:51,599
to start converting everything
 

2925
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,109
to start converting everything
into uh into text and make it indexable

2926
00:47:55,109 --> 00:47:55,119
into uh into text and make it indexable
 

2927
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,710
into uh into text and make it indexable
like one of the things that that sucks

2928

simply because you know that video is
not available

01:00:04,069 --> 01:00:04,079
tend to believe in the intelligence of
 

3655
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,829
tend to believe in the intelligence of
people and we should we should trust

3656
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:05,839
people and we should we should trust

01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:06,870
people and we should we should trust
them

3658
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:06,880
them
 

3659
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,150
them
but i also do think it's the

3660
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:08,160
but i also do think it's the
 

3661
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,870
but i also do think it's the
responsibility of platforms

3662
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
responsibility of platforms
 

3663
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,710
responsibility of platforms
to encourage more love in the world more

3664
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:12,720
to encourage more love in the world more
 

3665
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:14,069
to encourage more love in the world more
kindness to each other

3666
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:14,079
kindness to each other
 

3667
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,390
kindness to each other
and i don't always think that they're

3668
01:00:16,390 --> 01:00:16,400
and i don't always think that they're
 

3669
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:19,190
and i don't always think that they're
great at doing that particular thing

3670
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:19,200
great at doing that particular thing
 

3671
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,109
great at doing that particular thing
so that that um

3672
01:00:23,109 --> 01:00:23,119

 

3673
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,910

there's a nice balance there and i think

3674
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:25,920
there's a nice balance there and i think
 

3675
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,150
there's a nice balance there and i think
philosophically i think about that a lot

3676
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:28,160
philosophically i think about that a lot
 

3677
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,990
philosophically i think about that a lot
where's the balance between free speech

3678
01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:32,000
where's the balance between free speech
 

3679
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,270
where's the balance between free speech
and like encouraging people even though

3680

yeah like we can get to the moon in 10
years and like we did it right yeah

3880
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
years and like we did it right yeah
 

3881
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,990
years and like we did it right yeah
especially in this time of uh so much

3882
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:50,000
especially in this time of uh so much
 

3883
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,190
especially in this time of uh so much
kind of existential dread that people

3884
01:03:53,190 --> 01:03:53,200
kind of existential dread that people
 

3885
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:54,390
kind of existential dread that people
are going through because of

3886
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:54,400
are going through because of
 

3887
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,430
are going through because of
covid like having rockets that just keep

3888
01:03:57,430 --> 01:03:57,440
covid like having rockets that just keep
 

3889
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,630
covid like having rockets that just keep
going out there now with humans i don't

3890
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:00,640
going out there now with humans i don't
 

3891
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:00,950
going out there now with humans i don't
know

3892
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:00,960
know
 

3893
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:03,670
know
that uh it just like you said i mean it

3894
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:03,680
that uh it just like you said i mean it
 

3895
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:05,109
that uh it just like you said i mean it
gives you a reason to wake up in the

3896
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:05,119
gives you a reason to wake up in the
 

3897
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,789
gives you a reason to wake up in the
morning and and dream

3898
01:04:06,789 --> 01:04:06,799
morning and and dream
 

3899
01:04:06,799 --> 01:04:09,910
morning and and dream
the forest engineers too uh

3900
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:09,920
the forest engineers too uh
 

3901
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,349
the forest engineers too uh
it uh this is inspiring as hell man

3902
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:13,359
it uh this is inspiring as hell man
 

3903
01:04:13,359 --> 01:04:15,750
it uh this is inspiring as hell man
i wha well let me ask you this the the

3904
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:15,760
i wha well let me ask you this the the
 

3905
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,910
i wha well let me ask you this the the
worst possible question which is uh

3906
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:17,920
worst possible question which is uh
 

3907
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:20,470
worst possible question which is uh
so you're like at the core you're a

3908
01:04:20,470 --> 01:04:20,480
so you're like at the core you're a
 

3909
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,270
so you're like at the core you're a
programmer

3910
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:21,280
programmer
 

3911
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,789
programmer
you're um an engineer

3912
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:24,799
you're um an engineer
 

3913
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:27,990
you're um an engineer
but now he made the unfortunate choice

3914
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:28,000
but now he made the unfortunate choice
 

3915
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,589
but now he made the unfortunate choice
uh or maybe that's the way life goes of

3916
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:31,599
uh or maybe that's the way life goes of
 

3917
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:34,630
uh or maybe that's the way life goes of
basically moving away from the low level

3918
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:34,640
basically moving away from the low level
 

3919
01:04:34,640 --> 01:04:36,630
basically moving away from the low level
work and becoming a manager becoming an

3920
01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:36,640
work and becoming a manager becoming an
 

3921
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:37,990
work and becoming a manager becoming an
executive

3922
01:04:37,990 --> 01:04:38,000
executive
 

3923
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,750
executive
having meetings is what's what's that

3924
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:41,760
having meetings is what's what's that
 

3925
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:43,029
having meetings is what's what's that
transition been like

3926
01:04:43,029 --> 01:04:43,039
transition been like
 

3927
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,230
transition been like
it's been interesting it's been a

3928
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:44,240
it's been interesting it's been a
 

3929
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:45,829
it's been interesting it's been a
journey maybe a couple of things to say

3930
01:04:45,829 --> 01:04:45,839
journey maybe a couple of things to say
 

3931
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:46,630
journey maybe a couple of things to say
about that

3932
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:46,640
about that
 

3933
01:04:46,640 --> 01:04:51,109
about that
i mean i got into this right because

3934
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:51,119
i mean i got into this right because
 

3935
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,589
i mean i got into this right because
as a kid i just remember this like

3936
01:04:53,589 --> 01:04:53,599
as a kid i just remember this like
 

3937
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:54,390
as a kid i just remember this like
incredible

3938
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:54,400
incredible
 

3939
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,470
incredible
amazement at being able to write a

3940
01:04:56,470 --> 01:04:56,480
amazement at being able to write a
 

3941
01:04:56,480 --> 01:04:58,230
amazement at being able to write a
program right and

3942
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:58,240
program right and
 

3943
01:04:58,240 --> 01:04:59,670
program right and
something comes to life that kind of

3944
01:04:59,670 --> 01:04:59,680
something comes to life that kind of
 

3945
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,270
something comes to life that kind of
didn't exist before yeah

3946
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:01,280
didn't exist before yeah
 

3947
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,349
didn't exist before yeah
i don't think you have that in like many

3948
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:03,359
i don't think you have that in like many
 

3949
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:05,910
i don't think you have that in like many
other fields like

3950
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
other fields like
 

3951
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,270
other fields like
you have that with some other kinds of

3952
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:07,280
you have that with some other kinds of
 

3953
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:08,950
you have that with some other kinds of
engineering but you may be a little bit

3954
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:08,960
engineering but you may be a little bit
 

3955
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,390
engineering but you may be a little bit
more limited with what you can do like

3956
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:10,400
more limited with what you can do like
 

3957
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:10,950
more limited with what you can do like
right but

3958
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:10,960
right but
 

3959
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,150
right but
with a computer you can literally

3960
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:12,160
with a computer you can literally
 

3961
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:14,630
with a computer you can literally
imagine any kind of program right

3962
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:14,640
imagine any kind of program right
 

3963
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,630
imagine any kind of program right
so it's a little bit god-like uh what

3964
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:16,640
so it's a little bit god-like uh what
 

3965
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:19,109
so it's a little bit god-like uh what
you do like when you create it

3966
01:05:19,109 --> 01:05:19,119
you do like when you create it
 

3967
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,190
you do like when you create it
and so i mean that's why i got into it

3968
01:05:21,190 --> 01:05:21,200
and so i mean that's why i got into it
 

3969
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,789
and so i mean that's why i got into it
do you remember like first program you

3970
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
do you remember like first program you
 

3971
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,549
do you remember like first program you
wrote or maybe the first program that

3972
01:05:24,549 --> 01:05:24,559
wrote or maybe the first program that
 

3973
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,230
wrote or maybe the first program that
like made you fall in love with com

3974
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:26,240
like made you fall in love with com
 

3975
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:28,470
like made you fall in love with com
with computer science uh i don't know

3976
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:28,480
with computer science uh i don't know
 

3977
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,670
with computer science uh i don't know
what was the first program it's probably

3978
01:05:29,670 --> 01:05:29,680
what was the first program it's probably
 

3979
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:30,950
what was the first program it's probably
like trying to write one of those

3980
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:30,960
like trying to write one of those
 

3981
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,270
like trying to write one of those
uh games in basic you know like emulate

3982
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:33,280
uh games in basic you know like emulate
 

3983
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:34,710
uh games in basic you know like emulate
the snake game or whatever

3984
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:34,720
the snake game or whatever
 

3985
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:37,270
the snake game or whatever
um i don't remember to be honest but i

3986
01:05:37,270 --> 01:05:37,280
um i don't remember to be honest but i
 

3987
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,549
um i don't remember to be honest but i
enjoyed like that's why i always loved

3988
01:05:38,549 --> 01:05:38,559
enjoyed like that's why i always loved
 

3989
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,589
enjoyed like that's why i always loved
about

3990
01:05:39,589 --> 01:05:39,599
about
 

3991
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:40,870
about
you know being a program is just the

3992
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:40,880
you know being a program is just the
 

3993
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,789
you know being a program is just the
creation process and um

3994
01:05:42,789 --> 01:05:42,799
creation process and um
 

3995
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:44,549
creation process and um
it's a little bit different when you're

3996
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:44,559
it's a little bit different when you're
 

3997
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:45,990
it's a little bit different when you're
not the one doing the creating

3998
01:05:45,990 --> 01:05:46,000
not the one doing the creating
 

3999
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,789
not the one doing the creating
uh and you know another aspect to it i

4000
01:05:48,789 --> 01:05:48,799
uh and you know another aspect to it i
 

4001
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,270
uh and you know another aspect to it i
would say

4002
01:05:49,270 --> 01:05:49,280
would say
 

4003
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:51,910
would say
is you know when you're a programmer

4004
01:05:51,910 --> 01:05:51,920
is you know when you're a programmer
 

4005
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,870
is you know when you're a programmer
when you're a

4006
01:05:52,870 --> 01:05:52,880
when you're a
 

4007
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:54,630
when you're a
individual contributor it's kind of very

4008
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:54,640
individual contributor it's kind of very
 

4009
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:55,910
individual contributor it's kind of very
easy to

4010
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:55,920
easy to
 

4011
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,829
easy to
know when you're doing a good job when

4012
01:05:57,829 --> 01:05:57,839
know when you're doing a good job when
 

4013
01:05:57,839 --> 01:05:58,789
know when you're doing a good job when
you're not doing a good job when you're

4014
01:05:58,789 --> 01:05:58,799
you're not doing a good job when you're
 

4015
01:05:58,799 --> 01:05:59,750
you're not doing a good job when you're
being productive when you're not being

4016
01:05:59,750 --> 01:05:59,760
being productive when you're not being
 

4017
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:00,950
being productive when you're not being
productive right you can kind of see

4018
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:00,960
productive right you can kind of see
 

4019
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:01,910
productive right you can kind of see
like you

4020
01:06:01,910 --> 01:06:01,920
like you
 

4021
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,270
like you
trying to make something and it's like

4022
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:03,280
trying to make something and it's like
 

4023
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,430
trying to make something and it's like
slowly coming together right

4024
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:05,440
slowly coming together right
 

4025
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,990
slowly coming together right
and when you're a manager you know it's

4026
01:06:07,990 --> 01:06:08,000
and when you're a manager you know it's
 

4027
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:08,789
and when you're a manager you know it's
more diffuse

4028
01:06:08,789 --> 01:06:08,799
more diffuse
 

4029
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:11,510
more diffuse
right like well you hope you know you're

4030
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:11,520
right like well you hope you know you're
 

4031
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:12,710
right like well you hope you know you're
motivating your team

4032
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:12,720
motivating your team
 

4033
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,710
motivating your team
and making them more productive and

4034
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:14,720
and making them more productive and
 

4035
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,789
and making them more productive and
inspiring them right but it's not like

4036
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:16,799
inspiring them right but it's not like
 

4037
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:18,470
inspiring them right but it's not like

all of the dunes all of the dune

4200
01:09:05,189 --> 01:09:05,199
all of the dunes all of the dune
 

4201
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:06,630
all of the dunes all of the dune
the second one was probably the weakest

4202
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:06,640
the second one was probably the weakest
 

4203
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,550
the second one was probably the weakest
but anyway so yeah all of the doing is

4204
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:08,560
but anyway so yeah all of the doing is
 

4205
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:08,950
but anyway so yeah all of the doing is
good

4206
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:08,960
good
 

4207
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:12,070
good
um i mean yeah can you just slow little

4208
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:12,080
um i mean yeah can you just slow little
 

4209
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:13,349
um i mean yeah can you just slow little
tangent on that

4210
01:09:13,349 --> 01:09:13,359
tangent on that
 

4211
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:16,309
tangent on that
is uh how many dune books are there like

4212
01:09:16,309 --> 01:09:16,319
is uh how many dune books are there like
 

4213
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:17,829
is uh how many dune books are there like
do you recommend people start with the

4214
01:09:17,829 --> 01:09:17,839
do you recommend people start with the
 

4215
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:18,870
do you recommend people start with the
first one if you

4216
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:18,880
first one if you
 

4217
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,470
first one if you
if that was yeah you kind of have to

4218
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:20,480
if that was yeah you kind of have to
 

4219
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:21,910
if that was yeah you kind of have to
read them all i mean it is

4220
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:21,920
read them all i mean it is
 

4221
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,789
read them all i mean it is
a complete story right so um you start

4222
01:09:24,789 --> 01:09:24,799
a complete story right so um you start
 

4223
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:25,910
a complete story right so um you start
with the first one you got to read all

4224
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:25,920
with the first one you got to read all
 

4225
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:26,309
with the first one you got to read all
of them

4226
01:09:26,309 --> 01:09:26,319
of them
 

4227
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,749
of them
um so it's not like a tree like that

4228
01:09:29,749 --> 01:09:29,759
um so it's not like a tree like that
 

4229
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,470
um so it's not like a tree like that
like a creation of like the universe you

4230
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:32,480
like a creation of like the universe you
 

4231
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,070
like a creation of like the universe you
just should go in sequence you should go

4232
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:34,080
just should go in sequence you should go
 

4233
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:35,110
just should go in sequence you should go
on sequence yeah

4234
01:09:35,110 --> 01:09:35,120
on sequence yeah
 

4235
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:36,870
on sequence yeah
it's a it's kind of a chronological

4236
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:36,880
it's a it's kind of a chronological
 

4237
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,030
it's a it's kind of a chronological
storyline um there are six books in all

4238
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
storyline um there are six books in all
 

4239
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:42,470
storyline um there are six books in all
uh then there was like many um

4240
01:09:42,470 --> 01:09:42,480
uh then there was like many um
 

4241
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,149
uh then there was like many um
kind of option books that were written

4242
01:09:44,149 --> 01:09:44,159
kind of option books that were written
 

4243
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:46,229
kind of option books that were written
by um

4244
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:46,239
by um
 

4245
01:09:46,239 --> 01:09:48,390
by um
frank herbert's son uh but those are not

4246
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:48,400
frank herbert's son uh but those are not
 

4247
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,829
frank herbert's son uh but those are not
as good so you don't have to bother with

4248
01:09:49,829 --> 01:09:49,839
as good so you don't have to bother with
 

4249
01:09:49,839 --> 01:09:50,789
as good so you don't have to bother with
those

4250
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:50,799
those
 

4251
01:09:50,799 --> 01:09:53,590
those
shots fired up she got fired uh okay but

4252
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:53,600
shots fired up she got fired uh okay but
 

4253
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:54,070
shots fired up she got fired uh okay but
the main

4254
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
the main
 

4255
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,709
the main
uh sequences is good so what are some

4256
01:09:56,709 --> 01:09:56,719
uh sequences is good so what are some
 

4257
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,630
uh sequences is good so what are some
other books

4258
01:09:58,630 --> 01:09:58,640
other books
 

4259
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:00,390
other books
uh maybe there's a few so i don't know

4260
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:00,400
uh maybe there's a few so i don't know
 

4261
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:01,910
uh maybe there's a few so i don't know
that like i would say there's a book

here's a couple that i really love so
one is brave new world

4272
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:11,440
one is brave new world
 

4273
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:16,630
one is brave new world
by aldous huxley um and it's

4274
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:16,640
by aldous huxley um and it's
 

4275
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:20,070
by aldous huxley um and it's
kind of incredible how prescient he was

4276
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:20,080
kind of incredible how prescient he was
 

4277
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:22,149
kind of incredible how prescient he was
about like

4278
01:10:22,149 --> 01:10:22,159
about like
 

4279
01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:24,390
about like
what this what what a brave new world

4280
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:24,400
what this what what a brave new world
 

4281
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:25,910
what this what what a brave new world
might be like right you know you kind of

4282
01:10:25,910 --> 01:10:25,920
might be like right you know you kind of
 

4283
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:26,470
might be like right you know you kind of
see a

4284
01:10:26,470 --> 01:10:26,480
see a
 

4285
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:28,470
see a
genetic sorting in this book right where

4286
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:28,480
genetic sorting in this book right where
 

4287
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:30,630
genetic sorting in this book right where
there's like this alphas and epsilons

4288
01:10:30,630 --> 01:10:30,640
there's like this alphas and epsilons
 

4289
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:31,270
there's like this alphas and epsilons
and

4290
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:31,280
and
 

4291
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,229
and
uh from like the earliest time of

4292
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:34,239
uh from like the earliest time of
 

4293
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,590
uh from like the earliest time of
society like they're starting like you

4294
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:35,600
society like they're starting like you
 

4295
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:36,630
society like they're starting like you
can kind of see it

4296
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
can kind of see it
 

4297
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,470
can kind of see it
in a slightly similar way today where

4298
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:40,480
in a slightly similar way today where
 

4299
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:42,310
in a slightly similar way today where
well one of the problems with society is

4300
01:10:42,310 --> 01:10:42,320
well one of the problems with society is
 

4301
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,070
well one of the problems with society is
people are kind of

4302
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:44,080
people are kind of
 

4303
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,830
people are kind of
genetically sorting a little bit right

4304
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:45,840
genetically sorting a little bit right
 

4305
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,510
genetically sorting a little bit right
like there's much less

4306
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:47,520
like there's much less
 

4307
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,270
like there's much less
like most marriages right are between

4308
01:10:49,270 --> 01:10:49,280
like most marriages right are between
 

4309
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,950
like most marriages right are between
people of similar kind of

4310
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:50,960
people of similar kind of
 

4311
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:54,149
people of similar kind of
um intellectual level or socioeconomic

4312
01:10:54,149 --> 01:10:54,159
um intellectual level or socioeconomic
 

4313
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:54,870
um intellectual level or socioeconomic
status

4314
01:10:54,870 --> 01:10:54,880
status
 

4315
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,590
status
more so these days than in the past and

4316
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:57,600
more so these days than in the past and
 

4317
01:10:57,600 --> 01:10:59,270
more so these days than in the past and
you kind of see some effects of it and

4318
01:10:59,270 --> 01:10:59,280
you kind of see some effects of it and
 

4319
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:02,709
you kind of see some effects of it and
stratifying society and kind of

4320
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:02,719
stratifying society and kind of
 

4321
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:04,630
stratifying society and kind of
he illustrated what that could be like

4322
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:04,640
he illustrated what that could be like
 

4323
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:05,830
he illustrated what that could be like
in the extreme

4324
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:05,840
in the extreme
 

4325
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:07,430
in the extreme
different versions of it on social media

4326
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:07,440
different versions of it on social media
 

4327
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,350
different versions of it on social media
as well it's not just like marriages and

4328
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
as well it's not just like marriages and
 

4329
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,310
as well it's not just like marriages and
so on like

4330
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:10,320
so on like
 

4331
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:12,709
so on like
it's genetic sorting in terms of what

4332
01:11:12,709 --> 01:11:12,719
it's genetic sorting in terms of what
 

4333
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:14,950
it's genetic sorting in terms of what
dawkins called memes as ideas

4334
01:11:14,950 --> 01:11:14,960
dawkins called memes as ideas
 

4335
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:17,590
dawkins called memes as ideas
right being put into these bins of these

4336
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:17,600
right being put into these bins of these
 

4337
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:19,830
right being put into these bins of these
little echo chambers and so on

4338
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:19,840
little echo chambers and so on
 

4339
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:21,750
little echo chambers and so on
yeah i know so that's the book that's i

4340
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:21,760
yeah i know so that's the book that's i
 

4341
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,350
yeah i know so that's the book that's i
think a worthwhile read for everyone i

4342
01:11:23,350 --> 01:11:23,360
think a worthwhile read for everyone i
 

4343
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,350
think a worthwhile read for everyone i
mean 1984 is good of course as well like

4344
01:11:25,350 --> 01:11:25,360
mean 1984 is good of course as well like
 

4345
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:26,390
mean 1984 is good of course as well like
if you're talking about you know

4346
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:26,400
if you're talking about you know
 

4347
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,310
if you're talking about you know
dystopian novels of the future yeah it's

4348
01:11:28,310 --> 01:11:28,320
dystopian novels of the future yeah it's
 

4349
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:29,990
dystopian novels of the future yeah it's
a slightly different view of the future

4350
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:30,000
a slightly different view of the future
 

4351
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:30,390
a slightly different view of the future
right

4352

but i kind of like identify with the
world but more

4356
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:33,760
world but more
 

4357
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:37,430

but like the thing is it was so
 

4579
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:29,830
but like the thing is it was so
close to

4580
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:29,840
close to
 

4581
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,030
close to
like what probably was reality it was

4582
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:33,040
like what probably was reality it was
 

4583
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,430
like what probably was reality it was
caricaturing reality

4584
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:35,440
caricaturing reality
 

4585
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,590
caricaturing reality
to where i think an observer might think

4586
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:37,600
to where i think an observer might think
 

4587
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,270
to where i think an observer might think
that this is not

4588
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:39,280
that this is not
 

4589
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,750
that this is not
like they might think it's a comedy in

4590
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:41,760
like they might think it's a comedy in
 

4591
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:43,350
like they might think it's a comedy in
when in reality

4592
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:43,360
when in reality
 

4593
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:46,950
when in reality
this is that's the absurdity of uh

4594
01:15:46,950 --> 01:15:46,960
this is that's the absurdity of uh
 

4595
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,350

4599
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,950
that's
i guess it was too close to reality for

4600
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:52,960

with chris is that
you go to the extremes you just like

4952
01:21:44,390 --> 01:21:44,400
you go to the extremes you just like
 

4953
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:46,390
you go to the extremes you just like
cover every extreme base and then it

4954
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:46,400

4955
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,830

01:21:50,229 --> 01:21:50,239
go to the more nuanced conversations
 

4959
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:51,669
go to the more nuanced conversations
it's kind of

4960
01:21:51,669 --> 01:21:51,679
it's kind of
 

4961
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,830
it's kind of
i think there's a safe place for that

4962
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:53,840
i think there's a safe place for that
 

4963
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:55,350
i think there's a safe place for that
there's certainly a hunger for that

4964
01:21:55,350 --> 01:21:55,360
there's certainly a hunger for that
 

4965
01:21:55,360 --> 01:21:57,110
there's certainly a hunger for that
nuanced conversation i think

4966
01:21:57,110 --> 01:21:57,120
nuanced conversation i think
 

4967
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,830
nuanced conversation i think
amongst people where like on social

4968
01:21:59,830 --> 01:21:59,840
amongst people where like on social
 

4969
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,270
amongst people where like on social
media you get canceled

4970
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:01,280
media you get canceled
 

4971
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,310
media you get canceled
for anything slightly tense that there's

4972
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:04,320
for anything slightly tense that there's
 

4973
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:05,350
for anything slightly tense that there's
a hunger to go

4974
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:05,360
a hunger to go
 

4975
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,750
a hunger to go
full right you go so far to the opposite

4976
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
full right you go so far to the opposite
 

4977
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:08,550
full right you go so far to the opposite
side

4978
01:22:08,550 --> 01:22:08,560
side
 

4979
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,830
side
and it's like there is

4980
01:22:11,830 --> 01:22:11,840
and it's like there is
 

4981
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,030
and it's like there is
a person behind all of these things yeah

4982
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:15,040
a person behind all of these things yeah
 

4983
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,310
a person behind all of these things yeah
and that's the cool thing about

4984
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:16,320
and that's the cool thing about
 

4985
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:18,390
and that's the cool thing about
podcasting like three four hour

4986
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:18,400
podcasting like three four hour
 

4987
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,950
podcasting like three four hour
conversations that

4988
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:20,960
conversations that
 

4989
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:23,030
conversations that
that it's very different than the

01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:23,040
that it's very different than the
 

4991
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:23,990

01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:24,000
clickbait journalism
 

4993
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,350
clickbait journalism
it's like the opposite that there's a

4994
01:22:25,350 --> 01:22:25,360
it's like the opposite that there's a
 

4995
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:27,350
it's like the opposite that there's a
hunger for that there's a willingness

4996
01:22:27,350 --> 01:22:27,360
hunger for that there's a willingness
 

4997
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:27,830

01:26:25,830 --> 01:26:25,840
said programming
 

5245
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:28,310
said programming
i would say i mean it's even just

5246
01:26:28,310 --> 01:26:28,320
i would say i mean it's even just

programs i don't care if it's like some
javascript thing on

5252
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:32,960
javascript thing on
 

5253
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,390
javascript thing on
a button on the website it's like

5254
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:36,400
a button on the website it's like
 

5255
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:38,870
a button on the website it's like
magical that you brought that to life

5256
01:26:38,870 --> 01:26:38,880
magical that you brought that to life
 

5257
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,310

i don't know what that is in there but
that seems that's probably

5260
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:42,400
that seems that's probably
 

5261
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,070
that seems that's probably
some version of recreation of uh

5262
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:46,080
some version of recreation of uh
 

5263
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:47,990
some version of recreation of uh
like reproduction and sex whatever

like reproduction and sex whatever
 

5265
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,590
like reproduction and sex whatever
that's in evolution

5266
01:26:49,590 --> 01:26:49,600
that's in evolution
 

5267
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,910
that's in evolution
but like creating that html button

5268
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:53,920
but like creating that html button
 

5269
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,390
but like creating that html button
has already has echoes of that feeling

5270
01:26:56,390 --> 01:26:56,400
has already has echoes of that feeling
 

5271
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,590
has already has echoes of that feeling
and it's magical

5272
01:26:57,590 --> 01:26:57,600
and it's magical
 

5273
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:00,310
and it's magical
uh right there if you're a religious

5274
01:27:00,310 --> 01:27:00,320
uh right there if you're a religious
 

5275
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:01,669
uh right there if you're a religious
person maybe you could even say right

5276
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:01,679
person maybe you could even say right
 

5277
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:02,790
person maybe you could even say right
like we were

5278
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:02,800
like we were
 

5279
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,709
like we were
created in god's image right well i mean

5280
01:27:04,709 --> 01:27:04,719
created in god's image right well i mean
 

5281
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:05,910
created in god's image right well i mean
i guess part of that

5282
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
i guess part of that
 

5283
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,990
i guess part of that
is the drive to create something

5284
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:08,000
is the drive to create something
 

5285
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,110
is the drive to create something
ourselves right

5286
01:27:09,110 --> 01:27:09,120
ourselves right
 

5287
01:27:09,120 --> 01:27:11,430
ourselves right
i mean that's that's that's part of it

5288
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:11,440
i mean that's that's that's part of it
 

5289
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:13,590
i mean that's that's that's part of it
uh yeah that html button is the creation

5290
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:13,600
uh yeah that html button is the creation
 

5291
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:14,310
uh yeah that html button is the creation
in god's

5292
01:27:14,310 --> 01:27:14,320
in god's
 

5293
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,629
in god's
yeah so maybe hopefully it'll be

5294
01:27:16,629 --> 01:27:16,639
yeah so maybe hopefully it'll be
 

5295
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:18,229
yeah so maybe hopefully it'll be
something a little more

5296
01:27:18,229 --> 01:27:18,239
something a little more
 

5297
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:21,030
something a little more
uh dynamic maybe bigger sometimes yeah

5298
01:27:21,030 --> 01:27:21,040
uh dynamic maybe bigger sometimes yeah
 

5299
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:23,830
uh dynamic maybe bigger sometimes yeah
maybe some uh some javascript some react

5300
01:27:23,830 --> 01:27:23,840
maybe some uh some javascript some react
 

5301
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:27,910
maybe some uh some javascript some react
uh and so on but no i mean i think

5302
01:27:27,910 --> 01:27:27,920
uh and so on but no i mean i think
 

5303
