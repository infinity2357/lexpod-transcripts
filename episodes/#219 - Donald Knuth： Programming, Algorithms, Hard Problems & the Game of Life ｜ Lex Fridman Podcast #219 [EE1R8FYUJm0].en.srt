your first large-scale program you wrote
 

45
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,670
your first large-scale program you wrote
it in ibm 650 assembler in the summer of

it in ibm 650 assembler in the summer of
 

47
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,709
it in ibm 650 assembler in the summer of
1957. i wrote it in decimal machine

48
00:00:56,709 --> 00:00:56,719
1957. i wrote it in decimal machine
 

49
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,790
1957. i wrote it in decimal machine
language i didn't know about assembler

50
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:58,800
language i didn't know about assembler
 

51
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,310

until a year later but the year 1957 the

52
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,320
until a year later but the year 1957 the
 

53
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,710
until a year later but the year 1957 the
year and the program

54
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:04,720
year and the program
 

55
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,149
year and the program
yeah i might have learned about it

56
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:06,159
yeah i might have learned about it
 

57
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,750
yeah i might have learned about it
assembler later that summary i probably

58
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:07,760
assembler later that summary i probably
 

59
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,550
assembler later that summary i probably
did in 1957 hardly anybody had heard of

it would say um
 

71
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,190
it would say um
you know you would say 69 which meant

load the distributor and and then you
 

75
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,030
load the distributor and and then you
would give the address of the number you

76
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,040
would give the address of the number you
 

77
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,270
would give the address of the number you
wanted to load into the distributor

so so the instructions were tended ten
 

163
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,910
so so the instructions were tended ten
decimal digits you had two digits that

said what
 

167
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,309
said what
what to do for they just say uh

168
00:03:02,309 --> 00:03:02,319
what to do for they just say uh
 

169
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,390
what to do for they just say uh
uh what to do it too

170
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:04,400
uh what to do it too
 

171
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,390
uh what to do it too
and four more digits to say where to get

172
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:06,400
and four more digits to say where to get
 

173
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,910
and four more digits to say where to get
your next instruction

174
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:07,920
your next instruction
 

175
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,830
your next instruction
and there's a manual that describes what

176
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:09,840
and there's a manual that describes what
 

177
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,910
and there's a manual that describes what
each of the numbers mean and the manual

178
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:11,920
each of the numbers mean and the manual
 

179
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,670
each of the numbers mean and the manual
was actually one

180
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:13,680
was actually one
 

181
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,509
was actually one
if the manual had been well written i

182
00:03:15,509 --> 00:03:15,519
if the manual had been well written i
 

183
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,550
if the manual had been well written i
probably never would have gone into

184
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:16,560
probably never would have gone into
 

185
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,149
probably never would have gone into
computer science but it was so badly

186
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:18,159
computer science but it was so badly
 

187
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,070
computer science but it was so badly
written i figured

188
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,080
written i figured
 

189
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,390
written i figured
that i must have a talent for it because

190
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:22,400
that i must have a talent for it because
 

191
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,470
that i must have a talent for it because
i'm only a freshman and i and i could

192
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:24,480
i'm only a freshman and i and i could
 

193
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,229
i'm only a freshman and i and i could
write a better manual

194
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:26,239
write a better manual
 

195
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:26,949
write a better manual
uh

196
00:03:26,949 --> 00:03:26,959
uh
 

197
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,710
uh
and that he did

198
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:28,720
and that he did
 

199
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,270
and that he did
and so i i started working at the

200
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:31,280
and so i i started working at the
 

201
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,990
and so i i started working at the
computer center um

202
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,000
computer center um
 

203
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,110
computer center um
and

204
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,120
and
 

205
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,309
and
and uh

206
00:03:36,309 --> 00:03:36,319
and uh
 

207
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,190
and uh
wrote some manuals then but but yeah but

208
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:39,200
wrote some manuals then but but yeah but
 

209
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,030
wrote some manuals then but but yeah but
but this was uh

210
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:41,040
but this was uh
 

211
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,710
but this was uh
but this was the way we did it and and

212
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
but this was the way we did it and and
 

213
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,630
but this was the way we did it and and
my first program then was june of 1957

214
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:46,640
my first program then was june of 1957
 

215
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,309
my first program then was june of 1957
the tic-tac-toe

216
00:03:48,309 --> 00:03:48,319
the tic-tac-toe
 

217
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,789
the tic-tac-toe
no that was the second program the first

218
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:50,799
no that was the second program the first
 

219
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,670
no that was the second program the first
the third program the first program was

220
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:53,680
the third program the first program was
 

221
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,710
the third program the first program was
factoring

222
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:54,720
factoring
 

223
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,350
factoring
a number okay so you dial a number on

224
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,360
a number okay so you dial a number on
 

225
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,070
a number okay so you dial a number on
the

226
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,080
the
 

227
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,350
the
on the um

228
00:03:59,350 --> 00:03:59,360
on the um
 

229
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,070
on the um
uh their switches that means you sat at

230
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:02,080
uh their switches that means you sat at
 

231
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,990
uh their switches that means you sat at
this big mainframe

232
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:04,000
this big mainframe
 

233
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,110
this big mainframe
and

234
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,120
and
 

235
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,229
and
and you turn the dials and set a number

236
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:08,239
and you turn the dials and set a number
 

237
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,710
and you turn the dials and set a number
and and then it would punch out uh the

238
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:10,720
and and then it would punch out uh the
 

239
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,509
and and then it would punch out uh the
factors of that number on on cars so

240
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:13,519
factors of that number on on cars so
 

241
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,069
factors of that number on on cars so
that's the input is the number the input

242
00:04:16,069 --> 00:04:16,079
that's the input is the number the input
 

243
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,349
that's the input is the number the input
was

244
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:17,359
was
 

245
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:19,909
was
yeah the input what was the number yeah

246
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:19,919
yeah the input what was the number yeah
 

247
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,150
yeah the input what was the number yeah
attended a number and

248
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,160
attended a number and
 

249
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,350
attended a number and
and uh and the output was uh its factors

250
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:25,360
and uh and the output was uh its factors
 

251
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,110
and uh and the output was uh its factors
and and and i wrote that program

252
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:29,120
and and and i wrote that program
 

253
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,390
and and and i wrote that program
uh

254
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,400
uh
 

255
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,030
uh
i still have a copy of it somewhere

256
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:33,040
i still have a copy of it somewhere
 

257
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,670
i still have a copy of it somewhere
and um how many lines of code do you

258
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:35,680
and um how many lines of code do you
 

259
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,430
and um how many lines of code do you
remember well yeah it started out as

260
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:37,440
remember well yeah it started out as
 

261
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,790
remember well yeah it started out as
about

262
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:38,800
about
 

263
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,950
about
20 but then i kept having to debug it

264
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:40,960
20 but then i kept having to debug it
 

265
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,590
20 but then i kept having to debug it
and i i discovered debugging of course

266
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:43,600
and i i discovered debugging of course
 

267
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,430
and i i discovered debugging of course
when i wrote my first program and what

268
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:45,440
when i wrote my first program and what
 

269
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,909
when i wrote my first program and what
does uh debugging look like

270
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:47,919
does uh debugging look like
 

271
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,790
does uh debugging look like
on a program with just all numbers

272
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:50,800
on a program with just all numbers
 

273
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,270
on a program with just all numbers
well you sit there and you uh i don't

274
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,280
well you sit there and you uh i don't
 

275
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,629
well you sit there and you uh i don't
remember how i got it into the machine

276
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:54,639
remember how i got it into the machine
 

277
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,150
remember how i got it into the machine
but i but i think there was a way to

278
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,160
but i but i think there was a way to
 

279
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,230
but i but i think there was a way to
punch punch it on cards so each each

280
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:58,240
punch punch it on cards so each each
 

281
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,150
punch punch it on cards so each each
instruction would would be one

282
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:00,160
instruction would would be one
 

283
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,550
instruction would would be one
one card or maybe i could get seven

284
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:02,560
one card or maybe i could get seven
 

285
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,590
one card or maybe i could get seven
instructions on the card eight

286
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:03,600
instructions on the card eight
 

287
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,510
instructions on the card eight
instructions i don't know but anyway

288
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:05,520
instructions i don't know but anyway
 

289
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,430
instructions i don't know but anyway
so i'm sitting there at the console of

290
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:07,440
so i'm sitting there at the console of
 

291
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,629
so i'm sitting there at the console of
the machine i mean i'm doing this at

292
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:08,639
the machine i mean i'm doing this at
 

293
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,469
the machine i mean i'm doing this at
night when nobody else is around of

294
00:05:10,469 --> 00:05:10,479
night when nobody else is around of
 

295
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,550
night when nobody else is around of
course um and

296
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:12,560
course um and
 

297
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,790
course um and
and so you have one set of switches

298
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:14,800
and so you have one set of switches
 

299
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,469
and so you have one set of switches
where you can dial the number i'm

300
00:05:16,469 --> 00:05:16,479
where you can dial the number i'm
 

301
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,830
where you can dial the number i'm
inputting but there's another switch

302
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:17,840
inputting but there's another switch
 

303
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,670
inputting but there's another switch
that's it that you know that says okay

304
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:19,680
that's it that you know that says okay
 

305
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,510
that's it that you know that says okay
now execute one instruction and show me

306
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
now execute one instruction and show me
 

307
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,510
now execute one instruction and show me
what you thought what you did

308
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:23,520
what you thought what you did
 

309
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,749
what you thought what you did
or or you or you

310
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:25,759
or or you or you
 

311
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,909
or or you or you
there was another four switches and say

312
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:27,919
there was another four switches and say
 

313
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,990
there was another four switches and say
stop if you get to those if if you get

314
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:30,000
stop if you get to those if if you get
 

315
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,510
stop if you get to those if if you get
to that instruction

316
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:31,520
to that instruction
 

317
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,350
to that instruction
so so i can say now go until you get

318
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:33,360
so so i can say now go until you get
 

319
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,270
so so i can say now go until you get
there again and watch okay so i could

320
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,280
there again and watch okay so i could
 

321
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,950
there again and watch okay so i could
watch

322
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:36,960
watch
 

323
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,870
watch
you know it he would take that number

324
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:38,880
you know it he would take that number
 

325
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,390
you know it he would take that number
and it would divide it by two and if

326
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:40,400
and it would divide it by two and if
 

327
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,350
and it would divide it by two and if
it's

328
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:41,360
it's
 

329
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,189
it's
you know there's no remainder then okay

330
00:05:43,189 --> 00:05:43,199
you know there's no remainder then okay
 

331
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,430
you know there's no remainder then okay
two is a factor so

332
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,440
two is a factor so
 

333
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,150
two is a factor so
so then i work on the but if if not

334
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,160
so then i work on the but if if not
 

335
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,550
so then i work on the but if if not
divisible by two divide by three okay

336
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
divisible by two divide by three okay
 

337
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,270
divisible by two divide by three okay
keep trying and you know

338
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:53,280
keep trying and you know
 

339
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,670
keep trying and you know
until you know you're you're at the end

340
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:55,680
until you know you're you're at the end
 

341
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,230
until you know you're you're at the end
and uh you would find a bug

342
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:58,240
and uh you would find a bug
 

343
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,629
and uh you would find a bug
if uh if you were just surprised that

344

first of all i might have it
 

351
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,870
first of all i might have it
you know try to divide by one instead of

352
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:08,880
you know try to divide by one instead of
 

353
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,870
you know try to divide by one instead of
two you off by one errors that people

354
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:10,880
two you off by one errors that people
 

355
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,550
two you off by one errors that people
make all the time you know but but maybe

356
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:12,560
make all the time you know but but maybe
 

357
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,870
make all the time you know but but maybe
i go to the wrong instruction maybe i

358
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:14,880
i go to the wrong instruction maybe i
 

359
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,790

able to get the factors of 30 you know

370
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,080
able to get the factors of 30 you know
 

371
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,870
able to get the factors of 30 you know
as equal to two three and five okay

better every day but
 

477
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,749
better every day but
it was also crashing so so so i i wrote

it was also crashing so so so i i wrote
 

479
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,550
it was also crashing so so so i i wrote

to fix it and they reinserted something
and smoke was everywhere because he was

494
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:33,519
and smoke was everywhere because he was
 

495
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,269
and smoke was everywhere because he was
hurt well that didn't happen as often as

496
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:35,279
hurt well that didn't happen as often as
 

497
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,990
hurt well that didn't happen as often as
the operation coming from but yeah

498
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
the operation coming from but yeah
 

499
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,509
the operation coming from but yeah
and it was it's a funny story because

500
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:39,519
and it was it's a funny story because
 

501
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,029
and it was it's a funny story because
you're saying there's this

502
00:08:41,029 --> 00:08:41,039
you're saying there's this
 

503
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,070
you're saying there's this
tall

504
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:42,080
tall
 

505
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,670
tall
uh don knuth that i look up to and

506
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:45,680
uh don knuth that i look up to and
 

507
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,910
uh don knuth that i look up to and
there was pressure to i think it's the

508
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:47,920
there was pressure to i think it's the
 

509
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,990
there was pressure to i think it's the
computer well

510
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:50,000
computer well
 

511
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,190
computer well
it's funny

512
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,200
it's funny
 

513
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,269
it's funny
okay the kind of things we remember that

514
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:53,279
okay the kind of things we remember that
 

515
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,350
okay the kind of things we remember that
stick in our memory well okay yeah well

516
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:55,360
stick in our memory well okay yeah well
 

517
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,509
stick in our memory well okay yeah well
i i i could tell you a bunch of rod

518
00:08:57,509 --> 00:08:57,519
i i i could tell you a bunch of rod
 

519
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,430
i i i could tell you a bunch of rod
brooks stories too but let's

520
00:08:59,430 --> 00:08:59,440
brooks stories too but let's
 

521
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,150
brooks stories too but let's
let's let let's go back to the 650. so

522
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
let's let let's go back to the 650. so
 

523
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,990
let's let let's go back to the 650. so
so um

524
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,000

 

525
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,150

so i'm debugging this my first program

526
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,160
so i'm debugging this my first program
 

527
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,990
so i'm debugging this my first program
and and i i

528
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:10,000
and and i i
 

529
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,630
and and i i
i had more bugs in it than a number of

530
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:12,640
i had more bugs in it than a number of
 

531
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,470
i had more bugs in it than a number of
lines of code i i mean the number of

532
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:14,480
lines of code i i mean the number of
 

533
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,150
lines of code i i mean the number of
lines of code kept growing

534
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:16,160
lines of code kept growing
 

535
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,310
lines of code kept growing
and let me explain so so i had to punch

536
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:18,320
and let me explain so so i had to punch
 

537
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,310
and let me explain so so i had to punch
the answers on cards all right

538
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,320
the answers on cards all right
 

539
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,790
the answers on cards all right
so so suppose i suppose i'm factoring

540
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
so so suppose i suppose i'm factoring
 

541
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,070
so so suppose i suppose i'm factoring
the number 30 then i got then it i got a

542
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,080
the number 30 then i got then it i got a
 

543
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,630
the number 30 then i got then it i got a
i got to put two

544
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:28,640
i got to put two
 

545
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,990
i got to put two
somewhere on the card i got to put a

546
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:30,000
somewhere on the card i got to put a
 

547
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,430
somewhere on the card i got to put a
three somewhere on the card i got to put

548
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
three somewhere on the card i got to put
 

549
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,590
three somewhere on the card i got to put
a five somewhere on the card right and

550
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:33,600
a five somewhere on the card right and
 

551
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,670
a five somewhere on the card right and
and you know what my i was my first

552
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:35,680
and you know what my i was my first
 

553
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,310
and you know what my i was my first
program i i probably screwed up and you

554
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:38,320
program i i probably screwed up and you
 

555
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,590
program i i probably screwed up and you
know it

556
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:39,600
know it
 

557
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,110
know it
it fell off the edge of the card or

558
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,120
it fell off the edge of the card or
 

559
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,350
it fell off the edge of the card or
something like that but but i didn't

560
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,360
something like that but but i didn't
 

561
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,430
something like that but but i didn't
realize that there are some tentative

562
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:45,440
realize that there are some tentative
 

563
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,350
realize that there are some tentative
numbers that have

564
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:47,360
numbers that have
 

565
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,190
numbers that have
that have more than eight um factors

566
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:51,200
that have more than eight um factors
 

567
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,190
that have more than eight um factors
and the card has only 80 columns and so

568
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:53,200
and the card has only 80 columns and so
 

569
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,910
and the card has only 80 columns and so
i need 10 columns for every factor

570
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:55,920
i need 10 columns for every factor
 

571
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,829
i need 10 columns for every factor
so my first program didn't take account

572
00:09:57,829 --> 00:09:57,839
so my first program didn't take account
 

573
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,350
so my first program didn't take account
for the fact that i would have to punch

574
00:09:59,350 --> 00:09:59,360
for the fact that i would have to punch
 

575
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,030
for the fact that i would have to punch
more than one card

576
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,040
more than one card
 

577
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,710
more than one card
my first program you know just line the

578
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:02,720
my first program you know just line the
 

579
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,230
my first program you know just line the
stuff up in memory and then it punched

580
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
stuff up in memory and then it punched
 

581
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
stuff up in memory and then it punched
the card but but after you know so by

582
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
the card but but after you know so by
 

583
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,710
the card but but after you know so by
the time i finished i had to i had to

584
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:08,720
the time i finished i had to i had to
 

585
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,310
the time i finished i had to i had to
deal with lots of lots of things also i

586
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:12,320
deal with lots of lots of things also i
 

587
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,550
deal with lots of lots of things also i
uh uh

588
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:14,560
uh uh
 

589
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,470
uh uh
if you if you put a large prime number

590
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:16,480
if you if you put a large prime number
 

591
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,110
if you if you put a large prime number
in there my program might have sat there

592
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:19,120
in there my program might have sat there
 

593
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,350
in there my program might have sat there
for for 10 minutes the 650 was pretty

594
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,360
for for 10 minutes the 650 was pretty
 

595
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,030
for for 10 minutes the 650 was pretty
slow and so it would sit there spinning

596
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,040
slow and so it would sit there spinning
 

597
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,230
slow and so it would sit there spinning
its wheels and you wouldn't know if it

598
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
its wheels and you wouldn't know if it
 

599
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,470
its wheels and you wouldn't know if it
was in a loop or whatever you said ten

600
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:26,480
was in a loop or whatever you said ten
 

601
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,509
was in a loop or whatever you said ten
digit

602
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:27,519
digit
 

603
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,230
digit
ten digits yeah so i think the largest

604
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,240
ten digits yeah so i think the largest
 

605
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,310
ten digits yeah so i think the largest
is sort of nine nine nine nine nine nine

606
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:32,320
is sort of nine nine nine nine nine nine
 

607
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,150
is sort of nine nine nine nine nine nine
nine nine nine seven or something like

608
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,160
nine nine nine seven or something like
 

609
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,110
nine nine nine seven or something like
that and

610
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:35,120
that and
 

611
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,790
that and
that would you know that that would take

612
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:36,800
that would you know that that would take
 

613
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,829
that would you know that that would take
me a while

614
00:10:37,829 --> 00:10:37,839
me a while
 

615
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,030
me a while
uh

616
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,040
uh
 

617
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,389
uh
for that first one anyway that was my

618
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:40,399
for that first one anyway that was my
 

619
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,230
for that first one anyway that was my
first program well what was your goal

620
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:42,240
first program well what was your goal
 

621
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,910
first program well what was your goal
with that program well there's something

622
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:43,920
with that program well there's something
 

623
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,710
with that program well there's something
you were

624
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:44,720
you were
 

625
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,829
you were
hoping to

626
00:10:45,829 --> 00:10:45,839
hoping to
 

627
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,389
hoping to
find a large prime maybe or no

628
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:48,399
find a large prime maybe or no
 

629
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,550
find a large prime maybe or no
the opposite you know my goal was to see

630
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:50,560
the opposite you know my goal was to see
 

631
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,470
the opposite you know my goal was to see
the lights flashing and

632
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:52,480
the lights flashing and
 

633
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,030
the lights flashing and
understand how how this magical machine

634
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
understand how how this magical machine
 

635
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,030
understand how how this magical machine
would be able to do something that took

636
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,040
would be able to do something that took
 

637
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,430
would be able to do something that took
so long by hand so what was your second

638
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
so long by hand so what was your second
 

639
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,069
so long by hand so what was your second
program my second program was

640
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
program my second program was
 

641
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,829
program my second program was
uh was

642
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
uh was
 

643
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,750
uh was
a converted number

644
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:05,760
a converted number
 

645
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,710
a converted number
from

646
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:06,720
from
 

647
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,550
from
from binary to decimal or something like

648
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:08,560
from binary to decimal or something like
 

649
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,470
from binary to decimal or something like
that it was much much simpler it didn't

650
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:10,480
that it was much much simpler it didn't
 

651
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,069
that it was much much simpler it didn't
have that many bugs in it

652
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
have that many bugs in it
 

653
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,949
have that many bugs in it
my third program was tic-tac-toe yeah

654
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:14,959
my third program was tic-tac-toe yeah
 

655
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,870
my third program was tic-tac-toe yeah
and he had some machi so the the the

656
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:16,880
and he had some machi so the the the
 

657
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,110
and he had some machi so the the the
tic-tac-toe program

658
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,120
tic-tac-toe program
 

659
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,110
tic-tac-toe program
is interesting on many levels but one of

660
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
is interesting on many levels but one of
 

661
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,870
is interesting on many levels but one of
them is that it has some

662
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:22,880
them is that it has some
 

663
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,509
them is that it has some
you can call machine learning in it

664
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
you can call machine learning in it
 

665
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,790
you can call machine learning in it
that's

666
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:26,800
that's
 

667
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,870
that's
yeah that's right uh

668
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:28,880
yeah that's right uh
 

669
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,829
yeah that's right uh
uh

670
00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:29,839
uh
 

671
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,110
uh
i don't know how long it's going to be

672
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:31,120
i don't know how long it's going to be
 

673
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,230
i don't know how long it's going to be
before

674
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:32,240
before
 

675
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,430
before
the name of

676
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:33,440
the name of
 

677
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,269
the name of
our field has changed from computer

678
00:11:35,269 --> 00:11:35,279
our field has changed from computer
 

679
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,110
our field has changed from computer
science to machine learning

680
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:37,120
science to machine learning
 

681
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,630
science to machine learning
but

682
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:38,640
but
 

683
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,910
but
but anyway uh uh it it was my first

684
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:41,920
but anyway uh uh it it was my first
 

685
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,670
but anyway uh uh it it was my first
experience with machine learning because

686
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:43,680
experience with machine learning because
 

687
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,829
experience with machine learning because
okay so here we had yeah how does the

688
00:11:45,829 --> 00:11:45,839
okay so here we had yeah how does the
 

689
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,430
okay so here we had yeah how does the
program well first of all

690
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
program well first of all
 

691
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,230
program well first of all
what is the problem you were solving

692
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:50,240
what is the problem you were solving
 

693
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,069
what is the problem you were solving
what is tic tac toe what are we talking

694
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:52,079
what is tic tac toe what are we talking
 

695
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,110
what is tic tac toe what are we talking
about and then um right

696
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:55,120
about and then um right
 

697
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,629
about and then um right
how was it designed

698
00:11:56,629 --> 00:11:56,639
how was it designed
 

699
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,310
how was it designed
right so so

700
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:58,320
right so so
 

701
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,870
right so so
you got a three by three grid and each

702
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:00,880
you got a three by three grid and each
 

703
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,470
you got a three by three grid and each
each each

704
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:02,480
each each
 

705
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,870
each each
each could be in three states it can be

706
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:04,880
each could be in three states it can be
 

707
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,269
each could be in three states it can be
empty or it can have an x or an o yeah

708
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:07,279
empty or it can have an x or an o yeah
 

709
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,269
empty or it can have an x or an o yeah
right so three to the ninth is a

710
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:11,279
right so three to the ninth is a
 

711
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,030
right so three to the ninth is a
uh well what is

712
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,040
uh well what is
 

713
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,430
uh well what is
how big is it i should know

714
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
how big is it i should know
 

715
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,230
how big is it i should know
um but it's 80

716
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:18,240
um but it's 80
 

717
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,629
um but it's 80
81 times 81 times three so

718
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:22,639
81 times 81 times three so
 

719
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,949
81 times 81 times three so
um

720
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:24,959
um
 

721
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,150
um
anyway

722
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:26,160
anyway
 

723
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,750
anyway
eight is like two to the third and so

724
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:27,760
eight is like two to the third and so
 

725
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,870
eight is like two to the third and so
that would be

726
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:28,880
that would be
 

727
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,829
that would be
uh that would be like two to the sixth

728
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:31,839
uh that would be like two to the sixth
 

729
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:32,949
uh that would be like two to the sixth
um

730
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:32,959
um
 

731
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,829
um
uh and then uh but that would be 64 then

732
00:12:35,829 --> 00:12:35,839
uh and then uh but that would be 64 then
 

733
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,590
uh and then uh but that would be 64 then
you have to anyway i love how you're

734
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
you have to anyway i love how you're
 

735
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,710
you have to anyway i love how you're
doing the calculation

736
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:40,720

 

737
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,710

anyway the three comes from the fact

738
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:42,720
anyway the three comes from the fact
 

739
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,509
anyway the three comes from the fact
that it's either empty an x or an o

740
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:45,519
that it's either empty an x or an o
 

741
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,790
that it's either empty an x or an o
right

742
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:46,800
right
 

743
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,910
right
and

744
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:47,920
and
 

745
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,150
and
the 650 what was it was a machine that

746
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:50,160
the 650 what was it was a machine that
 

747
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,710
the 650 what was it was a machine that
had only uh

748
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:52,720
had only uh
 

749
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,870
had only uh
two thousand

750
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:56,880

 

751
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,470

ten digit words

752
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:58,480
ten digit words
 

753
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,790
ten digit words
you go from zero zero zero zero to one

754
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:00,800
you go from zero zero zero zero to one
 

755
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,110
you go from zero zero zero zero to one
nine nine nine and that's it

756
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:03,120
nine nine nine and that's it
 

757
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,430
nine nine nine and that's it
and and in each word you have a ten

758
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:05,440
and and in each word you have a ten
 

759
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,269
and and in each word you have a ten
digit number

760
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:07,279
digit number
 

761
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,150
digit number
so that's not many bits i mean i gotta

762
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:10,160
so that's not many bits i mean i gotta
 

763
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,310
so that's not many bits i mean i gotta
have three in order to have a memory of

764
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:12,320
have three in order to have a memory of
 

765
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,470
have three in order to have a memory of
every position i've seen

766
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:14,480
every position i've seen
 

767
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,550
every position i've seen
i need three to the ninth bits

768
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:18,560
i need three to the ninth bits
 

769
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,629
i need three to the ninth bits
okay but it was a decimal machine too it

770
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:20,639
okay but it was a decimal machine too it
 

771
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,030
okay but it was a decimal machine too it
didn't have bits but but but it did have

772
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,040
didn't have bits but but but it did have
 

773
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,710
didn't have bits but but but it did have
it it did have

774
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:24,720
it it did have
 

775
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,629
it it did have
strange instruction

776
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:26,639
strange instruction
 

777
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,230
strange instruction
where if if you had a tentative number

778
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,240
where if if you had a tentative number
 

779
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,829
where if if you had a tentative number
that but all the digits were either

780
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:29,839
that but all the digits were either
 

781
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,590
that but all the digits were either
eight or nine

782
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:31,600
eight or nine
 

783
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,629
eight or nine
uh

784
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:32,639
uh
 

785
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,870
uh
you you'd be eight nine nine eight or

786
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:34,880
you you'd be eight nine nine eight or
 

787
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,870
you you'd be eight nine nine eight or
something like that that would

788
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:36,880
something like that that would
 

789
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,949
something like that that would
uh you you could make a test whether it

790
00:13:38,949 --> 00:13:38,959
uh you you could make a test whether it
 

791
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,629
uh you you could make a test whether it
was eight or nine that was one of the

792
00:13:40,629 --> 00:13:40,639
was eight or nine that was one of the
 

793
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,670
was eight or nine that was one of the
strange things ibm engineers put into to

794
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:43,680
strange things ibm engineers put into to
 

795
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,110
strange things ibm engineers put into to
the machine i have no idea what well um

796
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:47,120
the machine i have no idea what well um
 

797
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,990
the machine i have no idea what well um
hardly ever used but anyway i i needed

798
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,000
hardly ever used but anyway i i needed
 

799
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,590
hardly ever used but anyway i i needed
one digit for every

800
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:51,600
one digit for every
 

801
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,590
one digit for every
every position i'd seen

802
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,600
every position i'd seen
 

803
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,230
every position i'd seen
uh zero meant it was a bad position i

804
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
uh zero meant it was a bad position i
 

805
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,230
uh zero meant it was a bad position i
meant it was good position

806
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:58,240
meant it was good position
 

807
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,949
meant it was good position
i i think i started out at five or six

808
00:14:00,949 --> 00:14:00,959
i i think i started out at five or six
 

809
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,430
i i think i started out at five or six
you know but if you if you win a game

810
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:03,440
you know but if you if you win a game
 

811
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,189
you know but if you if you win a game
then you uh

812
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:05,199
then you uh
 

813
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,550
then you uh
then you increase the value of that

814
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:06,560
then you increase the value of that
 

815
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,790
then you increase the value of that
position for you but you decrease it

816
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:10,800

 

817
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,949

for your opponent uh uh so but but i i i

818
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:14,959
for your opponent uh uh so but but i i i
 

819
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,550
for your opponent uh uh so but but i i i
could

820
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:16,560
could
 

821
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,030
could
i had that much total memory for every

822
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
i had that much total memory for every
 

823
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,430
i had that much total memory for every
every possible position was one digit

824
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:21,440
every possible position was one digit
 

825
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,310
every possible position was one digit
and i had a total of 20 000 digits

826
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
and i had a total of 20 000 digits
 

827
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,310
and i had a total of 20 000 digits
which had which had to also include my

828
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:26,320
which had which had to also include my
 

829
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,350
which had which had to also include my
program

830
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:27,360
program
 

831
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,430
program
yes and all the logic and everything

832
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:29,440
yes and all the logic and everything
 

833
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,430
yes and all the logic and everything
including how to

834
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:31,440
including how to
 

835
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,629
including how to
how to ask

836
00:14:32,629 --> 00:14:32,639
how to ask
 

837
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,710
how to ask
the user what the moves are and things

838
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:34,720
the user what the moves are and things
 

839
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,710
the user what the moves are and things
like this okay so so i think i had to

840
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:36,720
like this okay so so i think i had to
 

841
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,470
like this okay so so i think i had to
work it out because get every every

842
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
work it out because get every every
 

843
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,790
work it out because get every every
position in tic-tac-toe

844
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:40,800
position in tic-tac-toe
 

845
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,629
position in tic-tac-toe
it is equivalent to

846
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:42,639
it is equivalent to
 

847
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,870
it is equivalent to
roughly eight others because you you you

848
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:44,880
roughly eight others because you you you
 

849
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,870
roughly eight others because you you you
can rotate the board

850
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:46,880
can rotate the board
 

851
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,750
can rotate the board
um

852
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:47,760
um
 

853
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,509
um
which gives you factor four and you can

854
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:49,519
which gives you factor four and you can
 

855
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,430
which gives you factor four and you can
also flip it over

856
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:51,440
also flip it over
 

857
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,509
also flip it over
and that's another factor two so so i

858
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:53,519
and that's another factor two so so i
 

859
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,030
and that's another factor two so so i
might you know so i might have needed

860
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:55,040
might you know so i might have needed
 

861
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,949
might you know so i might have needed
only three to the ninth over eight

862
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:56,959
only three to the ninth over eight
 

863
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,949
only three to the ninth over eight
positions about you know plus

864
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:58,959
positions about you know plus
 

865
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,310
positions about you know plus
plus a little bit

866
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:00,320
plus a little bit
 

867
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,949
plus a little bit
uh so i had but anyway that was

868
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:02,959
uh so i had but anyway that was
 

869
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,509
uh so i had but anyway that was
that was a a part of the program to to

870
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:05,519
that was a a part of the program to to
 

871
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,350
that was a a part of the program to to
squeeze it into this tiny

872
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:07,360
squeeze it into this tiny
 

873
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,590
squeeze it into this tiny
so you tried to find an efficient

874
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:09,600
so you tried to find an efficient
 

875
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,750
so you tried to find an efficient
representation that took account for

876
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:11,760
representation that took account for
 

877
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,509
representation that took account for
that kind of rotation i had to otherwise

878
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:13,519
that kind of rotation i had to otherwise
 

879
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,910
that kind of rotation i had to otherwise
i couldn't do the learning

880
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
i couldn't do the learning
 

881
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,350
i couldn't do the learning
uh wow so so but but i had three

882
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:19,360
uh wow so so but but i had three
 

883
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,750
uh wow so so but but i had three
parts to my tic-tac-toe program

884
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:21,760
parts to my tic-tac-toe program
 

885
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,389
parts to my tic-tac-toe program
uh and i called it brain one brain two

886
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
uh and i called it brain one brain two
 

887
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,990
uh and i called it brain one brain two
and brain three so brain one

888
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,000
and brain three so brain one
 

889
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,829
and brain three so brain one
just played

890
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:29,839
just played
 

891
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,470
just played
a um

892
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:32,480

 

893
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,629

let's see

894
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:34,639
let's see
 

895
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,550
let's see
at random

896
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,560
at random
 

897
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,430
at random
okay

898
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:37,440
okay
 

899
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,949
okay
it's your turn okay you gotta put an x

900
00:15:38,949 --> 00:15:38,959
it's your turn okay you gotta put an x
 

901
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,030
it's your turn okay you gotta put an x
somewhere he has to go in an empty space

902
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
somewhere he has to go in an empty space
 

903
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,030
somewhere he has to go in an empty space
but that's that's it okay

904
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:43,040
but that's that's it okay
 

905
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,629
but that's that's it okay
choose

906
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:44,639
choose
 

907
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,990
choose
to choose one and and play it uh

908
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
to choose one and and play it uh
 

909
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,670
to choose one and and play it uh
brain two

910
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:49,680
brain two
 

911
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,670
brain two
uh

912
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
uh
 

913
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,670
uh
had a canned routine

914
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:53,680
had a canned routine
 

915
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,829
had a canned routine
and i think it was it also

916
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:55,839
and i think it was it also
 

917
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,670
and i think it was it also
maybe it had

918
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:57,680
maybe it had
 

919
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,949
maybe it had
maybe it assumed you were the first

920
00:15:58,949 --> 00:15:58,959
maybe it assumed you were the first
 

921
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,189
maybe it assumed you were the first
player or maybe it allowed you to be

922
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:01,199
player or maybe it allowed you to be
 

923
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:02,870
player or maybe it allowed you to be
first i think you were odd to be either

00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:02,880
first i think you were odd to be either
 

925
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,629
first i think you were odd to be either
first of a second but had a canned

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,189
charles babbage
had had planned to

940
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:17,199
had had planned to
 

941
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,470
had had planned to
had thought about programming

942
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:18,480
had thought about programming
 

943
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,550
had thought about programming
tic-tac-toe for his

944
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:20,560
tic-tac-toe for his
 

945
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,389
tic-tac-toe for his
for his dream machine that he that he

946
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:22,399
for his dream machine that he that he
 

947
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,629
for his dream machine that he that he
was never able to finish wow so that was

948
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:24,639
was never able to finish wow so that was
 

949
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,790
was never able to finish wow so that was
the program he thought about more than a

950
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:26,800
the program he thought about more than a
 

951
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,550
the program he thought about more than a
hundred years ago yeah yeah he had he

952
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:30,560
hundred years ago yeah yeah he had he
 

953
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,990
hundred years ago yeah yeah he had he
he did that okay

954
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,000
he did that okay
 

955
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,110
he did that okay
and i had but and and i had however been

956
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
and i had but and and i had however been
 

957
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,030
and i had but and and i had however been
influenced by a

963
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,910
science and industry in chicago it's
like it's like boston's science museum i

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:43,920
like it's like boston's science museum i
 

965
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,470
like it's like boston's science museum i
think bell labs had had prepared a

966
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:46,480
think bell labs had had prepared a
 

967
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,189
think bell labs had had prepared a
special exhibit about

968
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:49,199
special exhibit about
 

969
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,030
special exhibit about
telephones and relay technology and they

970
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,040
telephones and relay technology and they
 

971
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,430
telephones and relay technology and they
had a tic-tac-toe playing

972
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:53,440
had a tic-tac-toe playing
 

973
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,189
had a tic-tac-toe playing
uh

974
00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:55,199
uh
 

975
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,189
uh
machine as part of that exhibit so that

976
00:16:57,189 --> 00:16:57,199
machine as part of that exhibit so that
 

977
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,189
machine as part of that exhibit so that
had been one of my

978
00:16:59,189 --> 00:16:59,199
had been one of my
 

979
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,509
had been one of my
uh you know something i'd seen

980
00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:01,519
uh you know something i'd seen
 

981
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,030
uh you know something i'd seen
before i was a freshman in college and

982
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,040
before i was a freshman in college and
 

983
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,350
before i was a freshman in college and
and inspired me to see if i could write

984
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,360
and inspired me to see if i could write
 

985
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,630
and inspired me to see if i could write
a program for

986
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:06,640
a program for
 

987
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,750
a program for
okay so so anyway i had brain one

988
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:09,760
okay so so anyway i had brain one
 

989
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,710
okay so so anyway i had brain one
random

990
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:10,720
random
 

991
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,710
random
you know uh

992
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:12,720
you know uh
 

993
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,230
you know uh
knowing nothing brain two knowing

994
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,240
knowing nothing brain two knowing
 

995
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,189
knowing nothing brain two knowing
everything

996
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:15,199
everything
 

997
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,590
everything
then brain three was the learning one

998
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:17,600
then brain three was the learning one
 

999
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,110
then brain three was the learning one
and and i could

1000
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:19,120
and and i could
 

1001
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,270
and and i could
i i could play

1002
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:21,280
i i could play
 

1003
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,949
i i could play
brain one against brain one brain one

1004
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
brain one against brain one brain one
 

1005
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,110
brain one against brain one brain one
against brain two and so on and so uh

1006
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:27,120
against brain two and so on and so uh
 

1007
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,789
against brain two and so on and so uh
you could also play against the user

1008
00:17:28,789 --> 00:17:28,799
you could also play against the user
 

1009
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,950
you could also play against the user
against the live members but

1010
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:30,960
against the live members but
 

1011
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,510
against the live members but
but uh so so i started going the the

1012
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:33,520
but uh so so i started going the the
 

1013
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,190
but uh so so i started going the the
learning thing and i said okay you know

1014
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:35,200
learning thing and i said okay you know
 

1015
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,110
learning thing and i said okay you know
take two random

1016
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,120
take two random
 

1017
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,870
take two random
random people uh just playing uh uh

1018
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:40,880
random people uh just playing uh uh
 

1019
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,230
random people uh just playing uh uh
tic-tac-toe uh uh knowing nothing

1020
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:44,240
tic-tac-toe uh uh knowing nothing
 

1021
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,669
tic-tac-toe uh uh knowing nothing
um and

1022
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:45,679
um and
 

1023
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,230
um and
after about i i forget the number now

1024
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:48,240
after about i i forget the number now
 

1025
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,029
after about i i forget the number now
but but it converged after about 600

1026
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:51,039
but but it converged after about 600
 

1027
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:51,909
but but it converged after about 600
games

1028
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:51,919
games
 

1029
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,549
games
uh uh to a safe draw

1030
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:54,559
uh uh to a safe draw
 

1031
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:55,590
uh uh to a safe draw
the way

1032
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:55,600
the way
 

1033
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,590
the way
my program learned was actually it

1034
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:57,600
my program learned was actually it
 

1035
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,830
my program learned was actually it
learned how not to make mistakes because

1036
00:17:59,830 --> 00:17:59,840
learned how not to make mistakes because
 

1037
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:02,230
learned how not to make mistakes because
you know how to

1038
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
you know how to
 

1039
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,230
you know how to
it didn't try to do anything

1040
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,240
it didn't try to do anything
 

1041
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,549
it didn't try to do anything
for winning it just tried to yeah drop

1042
00:18:06,549 --> 00:18:06,559
for winning it just tried to yeah drop
 

1043
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,630
for winning it just tried to yeah drop
losing and not lose so that was probably

1044
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:08,640
losing and not lose so that was probably
 

1045
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,310
losing and not lose so that was probably
because of the way i did i designed the

1046
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:10,320
because of the way i did i designed the
 

1047
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,390
because of the way i did i designed the
learning thing i could have you know

1048
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:12,400
learning thing i could have you know
 

1049
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,549
learning thing i could have you know
had a different

1050
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:14,559
had a different
 

1051
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,150
had a different
uh reinforcement function that that

1052
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:16,160
uh reinforcement function that that
 

1053
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,950
uh reinforcement function that that
would

1054
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:16,960
would
 

1055
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,470
would
that would reward brilliant play but

1056
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:18,480
that would reward brilliant play but
 

1057
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,750
that would reward brilliant play but
anyway it didn't

1058
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:19,760
anyway it didn't
 

1059
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,029
anyway it didn't
and uh and and if if i took a novice

1060
00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:23,039
and uh and and if if i took a novice
 

1061
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,950
and uh and and if if i took a novice
against the uh

1062
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:24,960
against the uh
 

1063
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,190
against the uh
you know the skilled player uh it it was

1064
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:27,200
you know the skilled player uh it it was
 

1065
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,870
you know the skilled player uh it it was
able to learn uh how to play a good game

1066
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:30,880
able to learn uh how to play a good game
 

1067
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,029
able to learn uh how to play a good game
so that was that and that was really

1068
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:33,039
so that was that and that was really
 

1069
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,230
so that was that and that was really
mike

1070
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,240
mike
 

1071
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,270
mike
but after i finished that i i felt i i

1072
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:37,280
but after i finished that i i felt i i
 

1073
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,669
but after i finished that i i felt i i
understood programming

1074
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:39,679
understood programming
 

1075
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,669
understood programming
was there um

1076
00:18:41,669 --> 00:18:41,679
was there um
 

1077
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,669
was there um
did you

1078
00:18:43,669 --> 00:18:43,679
did you
 

1079
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,710
did you
did a curiosity and interest in learning

1080
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:46,720
did a curiosity and interest in learning
 

1081
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,870
did a curiosity and interest in learning
systems persist for you

1082
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:48,880
systems persist for you
 

1083
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,310
systems persist for you
so

1084
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
so
 

1085
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,950
so
why why did you want brain three to

1086
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:52,960
why why did you want brain three to
 

1087
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,470
why why did you want brain three to
learn

1088
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:54,480
learn
 

1089
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,669
learn
yeah i i think naturally it's

1090
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:57,679
yeah i i think naturally it's
 

1091
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,310
yeah i i think naturally it's
we're talking about rod brooks like

1092
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:00,320
we're talking about rod brooks like
 

1093
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,630
we're talking about rod brooks like
he he was teaching all kinds of

1094
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:02,640
he he was teaching all kinds of
 

1095
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,470
he he was teaching all kinds of
very small devices

1096
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:04,480
very small devices
 

1097
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,310
very small devices
to to learn stuff

1098
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,320
to to learn stuff
 

1099
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,590
to to learn stuff
um if a leaf drops off of a tree uh uh

1100
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:11,600
um if a leaf drops off of a tree uh uh
 

1101
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,190
um if a leaf drops off of a tree uh uh
you know it

1102
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,200
you know it
 

1103
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,789
you know it
he was saying something well it learns

1104
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:14,799
he was saying something well it learns
 

1105
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,549
he was saying something well it learns
if there's wind or not

1106
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:16,559
if there's wind or not
 

1107
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,870
if there's wind or not
but but i i mean he pushed that a little

1108
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:18,880
but but i i mean he pushed that a little
 

1109
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,230
but but i i mean he pushed that a little
bit too far but

1110
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:20,240
bit too far but
 

1111
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,750
bit too far but
he said he could probably train some

1112
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:21,760
he said he could probably train some
 

1113
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,870
he said he could probably train some
little mini bugs to to scour out dishes

1114
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:24,880
little mini bugs to to scour out dishes
 

1115
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,549
little mini bugs to to scour out dishes
if he had enough

1116
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:26,559
if he had enough
 

1117
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,870
if he had enough
financial support i don't know

1118
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:28,880
financial support i don't know
 

1119
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,789
financial support i don't know
can i can i ask you about that because

1120
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:32,799

 

1121
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,230

he he also mentioned that during

1122
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,240
he he also mentioned that during
 

1123
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,590
he he also mentioned that during
those years

1124
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:37,600
those years
 

1125
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,510
those years
there was discussion about

1126
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:39,520
there was discussion about
 

1127
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,750
there was discussion about
inspired by touring about computation

1128
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:43,760
inspired by touring about computation
 

1129
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,549
inspired by touring about computation
you know of what is computation

1130
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:46,559
you know of what is computation
 

1131
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,590
you know of what is computation
yeah

1132
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:47,600
yeah
 

1133
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,950
yeah
and

1134
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:48,960
and
 

1135
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,630
and
yeah i never thought about any stuff

1136
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:50,640
yeah i never thought about any stuff
 

1137
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,870
yeah i never thought about any stuff
like that that was

1138
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:52,880
like that that was
 

1139
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,029
like that that was
that that was way

1140
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:55,039
that that was way
 

1141
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,630
that that was way
too philosophical i mean

1142
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:56,640
too philosophical i mean
 

1143
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,710
too philosophical i mean
i i was a

1144
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:58,720
i i was a
 

1145
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,549
i i was a
i was a freshman

1146
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:00,559
i was a freshman
 

1147
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:01,990
i was a freshman
after all i mean

1148
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,000
after all i mean
 

1149
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,909
after all i mean

but not
but not to say hmm am i solving a big

1166
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
but not to say hmm am i solving a big
 

1167
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,390
but not to say hmm am i solving a big
problem or something like that or is is

1168

problem or something like that or is is
 

1169
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,470
problem or something like that or is is
this a step for humankind right no no

when did you first start thinking about
computation in the big sense

1176
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:33,600
computation in the big sense
 

1177
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,270
computation in the big sense
you know like the universal turing

1178

you mentioned in in an interview that
when reading a program you can tell when

1220
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:21,600
when reading a program you can tell when
 

1221
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,909
when reading a program you can tell when
the author of the program changed

1222

the author of the program changed
 

1223
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,789
the author of the program changed
oh okay uh

1224

it was so brilliant because but
but it was so easy but also to

1284

but it was so easy but also to
 

1285
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,390
but it was so easy but also to
appreciate how

author mario somebody or other had
 

1291
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,630
author mario somebody or other had
had been able to uh reverse engineer

1292
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:36,640
had been able to uh reverse engineer
 

1293
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,190
had been able to uh reverse engineer
the styles of of those components so but

1294
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:39,200
the styles of of those components so but
 

1295
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,549
the styles of of those components so but
now specifically uh to your question i

1296
00:22:42,549 --> 00:22:42,559
now specifically uh to your question i
 

1297
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,630
now specifically uh to your question i
mean there would be

1298
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:44,640
mean there would be
 

1299
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,110
mean there would be
there it was

1300
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:47,120
there it was
 

1301
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,270
there it was
it was pretty obvious in this program i

1302
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:49,280
it was pretty obvious in this program i
 

1303
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,390
it was pretty obvious in this program i
was reading it was it was a compiler

1304
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:52,400
was reading it was it was a compiler
 

1305
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,190
was reading it was it was a compiler
uh and it had been written by a team

1306
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:55,200
uh and it had been written by a team
 

1307
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,510
uh and it had been written by a team
at at carnegie mellon

1308
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:57,520
at at carnegie mellon
 

1309
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,149
at at carnegie mellon
and uh i have no idea

1310
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:00,159
and uh i have no idea
 

1311
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,350
and uh i have no idea
which program

1312
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:01,360
which program
 

1313
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,750
which program
was responsible for but but it you would

1314
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:03,760
was responsible for but but it you would
 

1315
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,830
was responsible for but but it you would
get to a part where the guy would just

1316
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
get to a part where the guy would just
 

1317
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,789
get to a part where the guy would just
not know how he how to move things

1318
00:23:08,789 --> 00:23:08,799
not know how he how to move things
 

1319
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,549
not know how he how to move things
between registers very efficiently and

1320
00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:10,559
between registers very efficiently and
 

1321
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,350
between registers very efficiently and
so

1322
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:11,360
so
 

1323
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,789
so
and so everything that

1324
00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:12,799
and so everything that
 

1325
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,789
and so everything that
that could be done in one instruction

1326
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:14,799
that could be done in one instruction
 

1327
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,470
that could be done in one instruction
would take three or something like that

1328
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:16,480
would take three or something like that
 

1329
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,549
would take three or something like that
that would be a pretty obvious uh

1330
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:18,559
that would be a pretty obvious uh
 

1331
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:21,029
that would be a pretty obvious uh
change in style but there were but then

1332
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:21,039
change in style but there were but then
 

1333
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,029
change in style but there were but then
there were also you know flashes of

1334
00:23:23,029 --> 00:23:23,039
there were also you know flashes of
 

1335
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,870
there were also you know flashes of
brilliance where you could do in one

1336
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:24,880
brilliance where you could do in one
 

1337
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,830
brilliance where you could do in one
instruction normally i used two because

1338
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:27,840
instruction normally i used two because
 

1339
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,270
instruction normally i used two because
because you knew enough about the way

1340
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,280
because you knew enough about the way
 

1341
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,110
because you knew enough about the way
the machine worked that you could

1342
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:31,120
the machine worked that you could
 

1343
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,590
the machine worked that you could
that that you could accomplish two goals

1344
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:33,600
that that you could accomplish two goals
 

1345
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,669
that that you could accomplish two goals
in one step

1346
00:23:35,669 --> 00:23:35,679
in one step
 

1347
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,830
in one step
so it was mostly the the brilliance of

1348
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:37,840
so it was mostly the the brilliance of
 

1349
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,830
so it was mostly the the brilliance of
the concept more than the

1350
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:39,840
the concept more than the
 

1351
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,710
the concept more than the
uh semicolons and uh or the

1352
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:42,720
uh semicolons and uh or the
 

1353
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,470
uh semicolons and uh or the
the you know the use of short sentences

1354
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:44,480
the you know the use of short sentences
 

1355
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,990
the you know the use of short sentences
versus long sentences something like

1356
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,000
versus long sentences something like
 

1357
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,149
versus long sentences something like
that so you would see the idea in the

1358
00:23:48,149 --> 00:23:48,159
that so you would see the idea in the
 

1359
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,630
that so you would see the idea in the
code and you can see the the different

1360
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:50,640
code and you can see the the different
 

1361
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,470
code and you can see the the different
style of thinking experience right it

1362
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:52,480
style of thinking experience right it
 

1363
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,909
style of thinking experience right it
was yeah so it was stylistic

1364
00:23:55,909 --> 00:23:55,919
was yeah so it was stylistic
 

1365
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,830
was yeah so it was stylistic
i mean like i could identify authors by

1366
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:57,840
i mean like i could identify authors by
 

1367
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,430
i mean like i could identify authors by
their

1368
00:23:59,430 --> 00:23:59,440
their
 

1369
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,750
their
by the amount of technical aptitude they

1370
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:01,760
by the amount of technical aptitude they
 

1371
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,830
by the amount of technical aptitude they
had but not by

1372
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:03,840
had but not by
 

1373
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,110
had but not by
styling the sense of

1374
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:07,120

 

1375
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,110

rhythm or something like that so if you

1376
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,120
rhythm or something like that so if you
 

1377
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,990
rhythm or something like that so if you
think about mozart beethoven bach if

1378
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,000
think about mozart beethoven bach if
 

1379
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,990
think about mozart beethoven bach if
somebody looked at don knuth code would

1380
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:16,000
somebody looked at don knuth code would
 

1381
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,750
somebody looked at don knuth code would
they be able to tell

1382
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:17,760
they be able to tell
 

1383
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,590
they be able to tell
that this

1384
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:19,600
that this
 

1385
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,070
that this
is a distinct style of thinking going on

1386
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:22,080
is a distinct style of thinking going on
 

1387
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,310
is a distinct style of thinking going on
here what do you think

1388
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:26,320

 

1389
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,870

and what what would be the defining uh

1390
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:28,880
and what what would be the defining uh
 

1391
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,430
and what what would be the defining uh
characteristic of the style

1392
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:31,440
characteristic of the style
 

1393
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,549
characteristic of the style
well

1394
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,559
well
 

1395
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,269
well
my code now is it

1396
00:24:35,269 --> 00:24:35,279
my code now is it
 

1397
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:37,110
my code now is it
is literate programming so i'm it's a

1398
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,120
is literate programming so i'm it's a
 

1399
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,310
is literate programming so i'm it's a
combination of english and c mostly but

1400
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:40,320
combination of english and c mostly but
 

1401
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,549
combination of english and c mostly but
but but if you just looked at the c part

1402
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:42,559
but but if you just looked at the c part
 

1403
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,630
but but if you just looked at the c part
of it you would also probably notice

1404
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:44,640
of it you would also probably notice
 

1405
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,549
of it you would also probably notice
that i don't

1406
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:46,559
that i don't
 

1407
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,750
that i don't
got it

1408
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:47,760
got it
 

1409
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,190
got it
you know that i use a lot of global

1410
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:49,200
you know that i use a lot of global
 

1411
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,430
you know that i use a lot of global
variables that other people don't and

1412
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:51,440
variables that other people don't and
 

1413
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,310
variables that other people don't and
and and i expand things inline more than

1414
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
and and i expand things inline more than
 

1415
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,230
and and i expand things inline more than
instead of calling

1416
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:56,240
instead of calling
 

1417
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,230
instead of calling
anyway i have different

1418
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:58,240
anyway i have different
 

1419
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,950
anyway i have different
subset of c that i use okay but this

1420
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:00,960
subset of c that i use okay but this
 

1421
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,110
subset of c that i use okay but this
that's a little bit stylistic yeah

1422
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:03,120
that's a little bit stylistic yeah
 

1423
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,950
that's a little bit stylistic yeah
but but with literate programming you

1424
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:04,960
but but with literate programming you
 

1425
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,190
but but with literate programming you
alternate between english and

1426
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:07,200
alternate between english and
 

1427
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,430
alternate between english and
and c or whatever

1428
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:09,440
and c or whatever
 

1429
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,149
and c or whatever
and

1430
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
and
 

1431
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,230
and
um and by the way people listening to

1432
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:12,240
um and by the way people listening to
 

1433
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,070
um and by the way people listening to
this should look up literate programming

1434
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,080
this should look up literate programming
 

1435
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,470
this should look up literate programming
it's very interesting uh concept that

1436
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:16,480
it's very interesting uh concept that
 

1437
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,070
it's very interesting uh concept that
you

1438
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:18,080
you
 

1439
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,990
you
uh you proposed and developed over the

1440
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:20,000
uh you proposed and developed over the
 

1441
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,029
uh you proposed and developed over the
years

1442
00:25:21,029 --> 00:25:21,039
years
 

1443
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,470
years
yeah yeah

1444
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:22,480
yeah yeah
 

1445
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,590
yeah yeah
i'm

1446
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:23,600
i'm
 

1447
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,350
i'm
that's the most

1448
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:27,360

 

1449
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,110

significant thing

1450
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:29,120
significant thing
 

1451
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,110
significant thing
i think to come out of the tech project

1452
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:31,120
i think to come out of the tech project
 

1453
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:31,909
i think to come out of the tech project
is

1454
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:31,919
is
 

1455
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,549
is
it is that i uh

1456
00:25:34,549 --> 00:25:34,559
it is that i uh
 

1457
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,029
it is that i uh
i i realized that

1458
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:37,039
i i realized that
 

1459
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:37,830
i i realized that
uh

1460
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:37,840
uh
 

1461
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,590
uh
my programs

1462
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
my programs
 

1463
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,310
my programs
were to be read by people and not not

1464
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:42,320
were to be read by people and not not
 

1465
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,990
were to be read by people and not not
just by computers and

1466
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:44,000
just by computers and
 

1467
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,909
just by computers and
and that typography could

1468
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
and that typography could
 

1469
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,710
and that typography could
massively enhance that and

1470
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
massively enhance that and
 

1471
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,470
massively enhance that and
and and so uh

1472
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:50,480
and and so uh
 

1473
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,990
and and so uh
i mean it

1474
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
i mean it
 

1475
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,510
i mean it
they're just wonderful if they're gonna

1476
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:53,520
they're just wonderful if they're gonna
 

1477
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,190
they're just wonderful if they're gonna
look it up that they should also look up

1478
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:55,200
look it up that they should also look up
 

1479
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,110
look it up that they should also look up
this book by

1480
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:57,120
this book by
 

1481
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,230
this book by
called physically based rendering

1482
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
called physically based rendering
 

1483
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,029
called physically based rendering
by matt farr and

1484
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:03,039
by matt farr and
 

1485
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,230
by matt farr and
anyway it

1486
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:04,240
anyway it
 

1487
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,909
anyway it
got an academy award

1488
00:26:05,909 --> 00:26:05,919
got an academy award
 

1489
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,630

like
 

1497
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,870
like
you know are accomplished by algorithms

1498
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:14,880
you know are accomplished by algorithms
 

1499
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,350
you know are accomplished by algorithms
and this book it is the whole book is a

1500
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:17,360
and this book it is the whole book is a
 

1501
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,669
and this book it is the whole book is a
literate program it tells you not only

1502
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:19,679
literate program it tells you not only
 

1503
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,310
literate program it tells you not only
how you do all the shading and

1504
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:22,320
how you do all the shading and
 

1505
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,310
how you do all the shading and
and uh

1506
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,320
and uh
 

1507
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,149
and uh
bringing images in that you need for

1508
00:26:26,149 --> 00:26:26,159
bringing images in that you need for
 

1509
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,110
bringing images in that you need for
animation and textures and so on but it

1510
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:29,120
animation and textures and so on but it
 

1511
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,149
animation and textures and so on but it
also uh you can run the code

1512
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
also uh you can run the code
 

1513
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:32,950
also uh you can run the code
uh

1514
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:32,960
uh
 

1515
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,789
uh
so uh and

1516
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
so uh and

and so uh
 

1519
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,070
and so uh
i find it uh an extension of the way i

1520
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:40,080
i find it uh an extension of the way i
 

1521
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,110
i find it uh an extension of the way i
uh of of how to teach programming is it

1522
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,120
uh of of how to teach programming is it
 

1523
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,630
uh of of how to teach programming is it
is but by

1524
00:26:44,630 --> 00:26:44,640
is but by
 

1525
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,230
is but by
by telling a story

1526
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
by telling a story
 

1527
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,430
by telling a story
as part of the program so it's uh it

1528
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
as part of the program so it's uh it
 

1529
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,350
as part of the program so it's uh it
works as a program but it's also

1530
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:51,360
works as a program but it's also
 

1531
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,990
works as a program but it's also
readable by humans

1532
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:54,000
readable by humans
 

1533
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,630
readable by humans
yes and especially by me

1534
00:26:56,630 --> 00:26:56,640
yes and especially by me
 

1535
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,950
yes and especially by me
yeah a week later or a year later that's

1536
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:58,960
yeah a week later or a year later that's
 

1537
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,190
yeah a week later or a year later that's
a good test if you yourself understand

1538
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
a good test if you yourself understand
 

1539
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,870
a good test if you yourself understand
the code yeah

1540
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:02,880
the code yeah
 

1541
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,310
the code yeah
easily a week or more or a year later

1542
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:06,320
easily a week or more or a year later
 

1543
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,190
easily a week or more or a year later
yeah

1544
00:27:07,190 --> 00:27:07,200
yeah
 

1545
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,669
yeah
so it it it's uh

1546
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
so it it it's uh
 

1547
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,110
so it it it's uh
what's this piece it's the greatest

1548
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:11,120
what's this piece it's the greatest
 

1549
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,789
what's this piece it's the greatest
thing since sliced bread

1550
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:12,799
thing since sliced bread
 

1551
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,990
thing since sliced bread
programming

1552
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:14,000
programming
 

1553
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,750
programming
or literate literate program okay

1554
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:17,760
or literate literate program okay
 

1555
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,789
or literate literate program okay
uh

1556
00:27:18,789 --> 00:27:18,799
uh
 

1557
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,269
uh
you heard it here first okay you uh

1558
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:21,279
you heard it here first okay you uh
 

1559
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,590
you heard it here first okay you uh
dodged this question in an interview i

1560
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:23,600
dodged this question in an interview i
 

1561
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,710
dodged this question in an interview i
listened to

1562
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:24,720
listened to
 

1563
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,669
listened to
uh so let me ask you again here

1564
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:27,679
uh so let me ask you again here
 

1565
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,230
uh so let me ask you again here
uh what makes for a beautiful program

1566
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,240
uh what makes for a beautiful program
 

1567
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,470
uh what makes for a beautiful program
what makes for a beautiful program yeah

1568
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
what makes for a beautiful program yeah
 

1569
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,389
what makes for a beautiful program yeah
what are the characteristics you see

1570
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:34,399
what are the characteristics you see
 

1571
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,630
what are the characteristics you see
like you just said literate programming

1572
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:36,640
like you just said literate programming
 

1573
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,230
like you just said literate programming
what are the characteristics you see in

1574
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,240
what are the characteristics you see in
 

1575
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,110
what are the characteristics you see in
a program that make you sit back and say

1576
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,120
a program that make you sit back and say
 

1577
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,269
a program that make you sit back and say
that's pretty good

1578
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:43,279
that's pretty good
 

1579
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,190
that's pretty good
well the reason i didn't answer is

1580
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,200
well the reason i didn't answer is
 

1581
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,950
well the reason i didn't answer is
because there are there are dozens and

1582
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:46,960
because there are there are dozens and
 

1583
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,789
because there are there are dozens and
dozens of answers to that because

1584
00:27:48,789 --> 00:27:48,799
dozens of answers to that because
 

1585
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,070
dozens of answers to that because
because

1586
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:50,080
because
 

1587
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,549
because
each you can define beauty

1588
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:52,559
each you can define beauty
 

1589
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,950
each you can define beauty
the same personal defined beauty a

1590
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:54,960
the same personal defined beauty a
 

1591
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,630
the same personal defined beauty a
different way from hour to hour i mean

1592
00:27:56,630 --> 00:27:56,640
different way from hour to hour i mean
 

1593
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,149
different way from hour to hour i mean
it depends on what

1594
00:27:58,149 --> 00:27:58,159
it depends on what
 

1595
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,909
it depends on what
and what you're looking for

1596
00:27:59,909 --> 00:27:59,919
and what you're looking for
 

1597
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,070
and what you're looking for
at one level you it's it's beautiful

1598
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,080
at one level you it's it's beautiful
 

1599
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,149
at one level you it's it's beautiful
just if it works at all

1600
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:04,159
just if it works at all
 

1601
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,870
just if it works at all
another level it's beautiful if it's

1602
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:06,880
another level it's beautiful if it's
 

1603
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,149
another level it's beautiful if it's
if it uh

1604
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:08,159
if it uh
 

1605
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,350
if it uh
uh

1606
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:09,360
uh
 

1607

uh
 

1609
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,950
uh
it can be understood easily

1610
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:12,960
it can be understood easily
 

1611
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,669
it can be understood easily
it's beautiful if it

1612
00:28:17,669 --> 00:28:17,679

 

1613
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,110

if it's illiterate programming it's

1614
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:19,120
if it's illiterate programming it's
 

1615
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,350
if it's illiterate programming it's
beautiful it makes you laugh i mean

1616
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:21,360
beautiful it makes you laugh i mean
 

1617
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,590
beautiful it makes you laugh i mean
yeah i'm actually so i'm with you i

1618
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
yeah i'm actually so i'm with you i
 

1619
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,510
yeah i'm actually so i'm with you i
think beauty

1620
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
think beauty
 

1621
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,190
think beauty
if it's readable

1622
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:27,200
if it's readable
 

1623
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,510
if it's readable
readable yeah if you understand what's

1624
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
readable yeah if you understand what's
 

1625
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,630
readable yeah if you understand what's
going on and also understand

1626
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:32,640
going on and also understand
 

1627
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,149
going on and also understand
the elegance of thought behind it

1628
00:28:36,149 --> 00:28:36,159
the elegance of thought behind it
 

1629
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,029
the elegance of thought behind it
and then

1630
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
and then
 

1631
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,310
and then
also as you said wit and humor i was

1632
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,320
also as you said wit and humor i was
 

1633
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,310
also as you said wit and humor i was
always uh i remember having this

1634
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:42,320
always uh i remember having this
 

1635
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,909
always uh i remember having this
conversation i had this conversation on

1636
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:43,919
conversation i had this conversation on
 

1637
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,549
conversation i had this conversation on
stack overflow

1638

stack overflow
whether humor is good in comments

1640
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:50,000
whether humor is good in comments
 

1641
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,230
whether humor is good in comments
and i think it is whether huma is good

1642
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:52,240
and i think it is whether huma is good
 

1643
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,230
and i think it is whether huma is good

steve allen wrote this book about

1812
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:43,919
steve allen wrote this book about
 

1813
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,990
steve allen wrote this book about
humor and it was the most boring book

1814
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,000
humor and it was the most boring book
 

1815
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,269
humor and it was the most boring book
but he was one of my idols but

1816
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:49,279
but he was one of my idols but
 

1817
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:50,389
but he was one of my idols but
but uh

1818
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:50,399
but uh
 

1819
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,350
but uh
yeah

1820
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:51,360
yeah
 

1821
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,950
yeah
it's called the funny men or something

1822
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
it's called the funny men or something
 

1823
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,269
it's called the funny men or something
like that but yeah okay so anyway i i

1824
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:55,279
like that but yeah okay so anyway i i
 

1825
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,350
like that but yeah okay so anyway i i
think it's important to know that

1826
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:57,360
think it's important to know that
 

1827
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,070
think it's important to know that
that this is part of life and and it

1828
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:00,080
that this is part of life and and it
 

1829
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,470
that this is part of life and and it
should be fun and not yeah and and so

1830
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:02,480
should be fun and not yeah and and so
 

1831
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,149
should be fun and not yeah and and so
you know i wrote this

1832
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:04,159
you know i wrote this
 

1833
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,110
you know i wrote this
this organ composition which uh uh is

1834
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:07,120
this organ composition which uh uh is
 

1835
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,990
this organ composition which uh uh is
based on the bible but i didn't refrain

1836
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:10,000
based on the bible but i didn't refrain
 

1837
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,310
based on the bible but i didn't refrain
from putting little jokes in it

1838
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:12,320
from putting little jokes in it
 

1839
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,110
from putting little jokes in it
also in the music it's hidden in the

1840
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:15,120
also in the music it's hidden in the
 

1841
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,149
also in the music it's hidden in the
music it's it's it's there yeah

1842
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:18,159
music it's it's it's there yeah
 

1843
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,710
music it's it's it's there yeah
a little humor is okay yeah i mean

1844
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:20,720
a little humor is okay yeah i mean
 

1845
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,630
a little humor is okay yeah i mean
not egregious humor

1846
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:22,640
not egregious humor
 

1847
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,630
not egregious humor
so in in this correspondence you know

1848
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:24,640
so in in this correspondence you know
 

1849
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,310
so in in this correspondence you know
there were

1850
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:26,320
there were
 

1851
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,950
there were
there were things i said yeah i really

1852
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:28,960
there were things i said yeah i really
 

1853
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,549
there were things i said yeah i really
shouldn't have i i really shouldn't have

1854
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:30,559
shouldn't have i i really shouldn't have
 

1855
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:31,990
shouldn't have i i really shouldn't have
done that

1856
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,000
done that
 

1857
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,389
done that
but uh but other ones i could you know i

1858
00:32:34,389 --> 00:32:34,399
but uh but other ones i could you know i
 

1859
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,549
but uh but other ones i could you know i
insisted on and i've got

1860
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:36,559
insisted on and i've got
 

1861
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,830
insisted on and i've got
jokes in there

1862
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:37,840
jokes in there
 

1863
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,190
jokes in there
that no that

1864
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:39,200
that no that
 

1865
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,590
that no that
nobody has figured out you in fact

1866
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:41,600
nobody has figured out you in fact
 

1867
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,190
nobody has figured out you in fact
in volume 2

1868
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:43,200
in volume 2
 

1869
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,630
in volume 2
i've got a

1870
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
i've got a
 

1871
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,310
i've got a
cryptogram a message

1872
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:46,320
cryptogram a message
 

1873
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,590
cryptogram a message
in cypher

1874
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:47,600
in cypher
 

1875
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,830
in cypher
and in order to decipher it you're going

1876
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:49,840
and in order to decipher it you're going
 

1877
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,509
and in order to decipher it you're going
to have to

1878
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:51,519
to have to
 

1879
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,389
to have to
have to break an rsa key which is

1880
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:54,399
have to break an rsa key which is
 

1881
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,190
have to break an rsa key which is
larger than people know how to break

1882
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:57,200
larger than people know how to break
 

1883
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,389
larger than people know how to break
uh and so

1884
00:32:58,389 --> 00:32:58,399
uh and so
 

1885
00:32:58,399 --> 00:32:59,830
uh and so
you know if computers keep getting

1886
00:32:59,830 --> 00:32:59,840
you know if computers keep getting
 

1887
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,230
you know if computers keep getting
faster and faster then you know might be

1888
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,240
faster and faster then you know might be
 

1889
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,990
faster and faster then you know might be
100 years but somebody will figure out

1890
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:04,000
100 years but somebody will figure out
 

1891
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,149
100 years but somebody will figure out
what this message is and they will laugh

1892
00:33:06,149 --> 00:33:06,159
what this message is and they will laugh
 

1893
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,509
what this message is and they will laugh
i mean i've got a joke in there

1894
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
i mean i've got a joke in there
 

1895
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,909
i mean i've got a joke in there
so that one you really have to work for

1896
00:33:11,909 --> 00:33:11,919
so that one you really have to work for
 

1897
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,990
so that one you really have to work for
uh i i don't know if you've heard about

1898
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:14,000
uh i i don't know if you've heard about
 

1899
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,830
uh i i don't know if you've heard about
this

1900
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:15,840
this
 

1901
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,070
this
let me explain it maybe you'll find it

1902
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,080
let me explain it maybe you'll find it
 

1903
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,269
let me explain it maybe you'll find it
interesting

1904
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:19,279
interesting
 

1905
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,389
interesting
so open ai is a company that

1906
00:33:22,389 --> 00:33:22,399
so open ai is a company that
 

1907
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,029
so open ai is a company that
does uh ai work and they have this

1908
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:25,039
does uh ai work and they have this
 

1909
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:27,350
does uh ai work and they have this
language model it's a neural network

1910
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:27,360
language model it's a neural network
 

1911
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,190
language model it's a neural network
that can generate

1912
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,200
that can generate
 

1913
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,590
that can generate
language pretty well

1914
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:31,600
language pretty well
 

1915
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,190
language pretty well
but they also

1916
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:33,200
but they also
 

1917
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,269
but they also
of on top of that develop something

1918
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:35,279
of on top of that develop something
 

1919
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,310
of on top of that develop something
called

1920
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:36,320
called
 

1921
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,630
called
openai codex

1922
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:38,640
openai codex
 

1923
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,549
openai codex
and together with github they developed

1924
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:40,559
and together with github they developed
 

1925
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:43,669
and together with github they developed
a system called openai copilot

1926
00:33:43,669 --> 00:33:43,679
a system called openai copilot
 

1927
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,470
a system called openai copilot
let me explain what it does

1928
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:46,480
let me explain what it does
 

1929
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,549
let me explain what it does
there's echoes of literate programming

1930
00:33:48,549 --> 00:33:48,559
there's echoes of literate programming
 

1931
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:49,590
there's echoes of literate programming
in it

1932
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:49,600
in it
 

1933
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,029
in it
so what you do is you start writing code

1934
00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:53,039
so what you do is you start writing code
 

1935
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,590
so what you do is you start writing code
and it completes the code for you

1936
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:55,600
and it completes the code for you
 

1937
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,070
and it completes the code for you
so for example you start let's go to

1938
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,080
so for example you start let's go to
 

1939
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,389
so for example you start let's go to
your factoring program you start you

1940
00:34:00,389 --> 00:34:00,399
your factoring program you start you
 

1941
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,029
your factoring program you start you
write in javascript and python in any

1942
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:03,039
write in javascript and python in any
 

1943
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,470
write in javascript and python in any
language

1944
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:04,480
language
 

1945
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,830
language
that it trained on uh you start

1946
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:07,840
that it trained on uh you start
 

1947
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,750
that it trained on uh you start
you write the first line and some

1948
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:09,760
you write the first line and some
 

1949
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,389
you write the first line and some
comments like what this code does and it

1950
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:12,399
comments like what this code does and it
 

1951
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,710
comments like what this code does and it
generates the function for you

1952
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:14,720
generates the function for you
 

1953
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,750
generates the function for you
and it does an incredibly good job like

1954
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:17,760
and it does an incredibly good job like
 

1955
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,310
and it does an incredibly good job like
it's not provably right but it often

1956
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:20,320
it's not provably right but it often
 

1957
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,470
it's not provably right but it often
does a really good job of completing the

1958
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:22,480
does a really good job of completing the
 

1959
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,470
does a really good job of completing the
code for you i see whether

1960
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:24,480
code for you i see whether
 

1961
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,069
code for you i see whether
but how do you know whether it did a

1962
00:34:26,069 --> 00:34:26,079
but how do you know whether it did a
 

1963
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,430
but how do you know whether it did a
good job or not

1964
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:27,440
good job or not
 

1965
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,109
good job or not
you could see a lot of examples where he

1966
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:29,119
you could see a lot of examples where he
 

1967
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,030
you could see a lot of examples where he
did a good job

1968
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:31,040
did a good job
 

1969
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,990
did a good job
and so you it it's not a thing that

1970
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:34,000
and so you it it's not a thing that
 

1971
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,470
and so you it it's not a thing that
generates the code for you it starts

1972
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:36,480
generates the code for you it starts
 

1973
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,710
generates the code for you it starts
it gives you uh

1974
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:38,720
it gives you uh
 

1975
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,190
it gives you uh
so it puts the human in the seat of

1976
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,200
so it puts the human in the seat of
 

1977
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,710
so it puts the human in the seat of
fixing

1978
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:42,720
fixing
 

1979
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:45,669

issues versus writing from scratch do
 

1981
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,430
issues versus writing from scratch do
you find that kind of idea at all

1982
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:47,440
you find that kind of idea at all
 

1983
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,550
you find that kind of idea at all
interesting

1984
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:48,560
interesting
 

1985
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,149
interesting
every year we're going to be losing more

1986
00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:50,159
every year we're going to be losing more
 

1987
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,430
every year we're going to be losing more
and more

1988
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:51,440
and more
 

1989
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,470
and more

1990
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:54,480
control over what machines are doing and
 

1991
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,869

people are saying well it seemed to like

00:34:56,869 --> 00:34:56,879
people are saying well it seemed to like
 

1993
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,910
people are saying well it seemed to like

00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,440
uh in this in the 60s we had this
 

1997

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:10,000
he could give inspiring lectures and
 

2003
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,510
he could give inspiring lectures and
you'd think well

2004
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:13,520

 

2005
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,950

2008
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:17,520
hour later you said well what did he say
 

2009
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,550

whether computers got the right answer
 

2017
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,550

if if your boss paid for it uh he
you know then you had a job you could

2026
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:32,400
you know then you had a job you could

happiness is more important than truth

2032
00:35:37,990 --> 00:35:38,000
happiness is more important than truth

exactly he didn't believe in truth but

2034
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:39,839
exactly he didn't believe in truth but
 

2035
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:41,829
exactly he didn't believe in truth but
he was a philosopher

2036
00:35:41,829 --> 00:35:41,839
he was a philosopher
 

2037
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:42,829
he was a philosopher
i like

2038
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:42,839
i like
 

2039
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:47,109
i like
it and somehow you you see uh

2040
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:47,119
it and somehow you you see uh
 

2041
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:49,430
it and somehow you you see uh
we're going that way i mean

2042
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:49,440
we're going that way i mean
 

2043
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,589
we're going that way i mean
so many more things are are taken over

2044
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:51,599
so many more things are are taken over
 

2045
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,430
so many more things are are taken over
by saying well this seems to work

2046
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:53,440
by saying well this seems to work
 

2047
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,430
by saying well this seems to work
and so and when there's

2048
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:55,440
and so and when there's
 

2049
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,270
and so and when there's
when there is uh competing interests

2050
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:57,280
when there is uh competing interests
 

2051
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,870
when there is uh competing interests
involved neither side understands

2052
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:00,880
involved neither side understands
 

2053
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,190
involved neither side understands
why the decision is being made

2054
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:05,200

 

2055
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,190

you know we realize now that it's that

2056
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:07,200
you know we realize now that it's that
 

2057
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,990
you know we realize now that it's that
is bad but but consider what happens

2058
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:10,000
is bad but but consider what happens
 

2059
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,349
is bad but but consider what happens
five private ten year year down the line

2060
00:36:13,349 --> 00:36:13,359
five private ten year year down the line
 

2061
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,270
five private ten year year down the line
when things get even more

2062
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:15,280
when things get even more
 

2063
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,270
when things get even more
further detached and each thing is based

2064
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:17,280
further detached and each thing is based
 

2065
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:17,910
further detached and each thing is based
on

2066
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:17,920
on
 

2067
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,790
on
something

2068
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:18,800
something
 

2069
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,190
something
from the previous year yeah so you start

2070
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,200
from the previous year yeah so you start
 

2071
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,910
from the previous year yeah so you start
to lose the more you automate the more

2072
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:23,920
to lose the more you automate the more
 

2073
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,470
to lose the more you automate the more
you start to lose track of uh some deep

2074
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:26,480
you start to lose track of uh some deep
 

2075
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,150
you start to lose track of uh some deep
experimentally

2076
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
experimentally
 

2077
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,030
experimentally
exponentially but so that's the dark

2078
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:31,040
exponentially but so that's the dark
 

2079
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,710
exponentially but so that's the dark
side the positive side is

2080
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:34,720
side the positive side is
 

2081
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,030
side the positive side is
the more you automate the more you let

2082
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:37,040
the more you automate the more you let
 

2083
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,670
the more you automate the more you let
humans do what humans do best

2084
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:39,680
humans do what humans do best
 

2085
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,390
humans do what humans do best
so

2086
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:40,400
so
 

2087
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,230
so
maybe programming

2088
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
maybe programming
 

2089
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,230
maybe programming
this you know maybe

2090
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:44,240
this you know maybe
 

2091
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,150
this you know maybe
humans should focus on a small part of

2092
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:46,160
humans should focus on a small part of
 

2093
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,630
humans should focus on a small part of
programming that requires that genius

2094
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:48,640
programming that requires that genius
 

2095
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,190
programming that requires that genius
the magic of the human mind

2096
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:51,200
the magic of the human mind
 

2097
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,109
the magic of the human mind
and the mess you let the machine

2098
00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:53,119
and the mess you let the machine
 

2099
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:56,150
and the mess you let the machine
generate yeah i mean they're that's the

2100
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
generate yeah i mean they're that's the
 

2101
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,430
generate yeah i mean they're that's the
that's the positive but of course it

2102
00:36:57,430 --> 00:36:57,440
that's the positive but of course it
 

2103
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,910
that's the positive but of course it
does come with the darkness like

2104
00:36:59,910 --> 00:36:59,920
does come with the darkness like
 

2105
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,349
does come with the darkness like
automation

2106
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:01,359
automation
 

2107
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:03,270
automation
what what's better correct i'm never

2108
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:03,280
what what's better correct i'm never
 

2109
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,069
what what's better correct i'm never
going to try to write a book about that

2110
00:37:06,069 --> 00:37:06,079
going to try to write a book about that
 

2111
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,069
going to try to write a book about that
uh i'm never going to recommend to any

2112
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:08,079
uh i'm never going to recommend to any
 

2113
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,670
uh i'm never going to recommend to any
of my students to work for them

2114
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:11,680

 

2115
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,430

so you you're on the side of i'm on the

2116
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:13,440
so you you're on the side of i'm on the
 

2117
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,750
so you you're on the side of i'm on the
side i'm on the side of honor happiness

2118
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:15,760
side i'm on the side of honor happiness
 

2119
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,230
side i'm on the side of honor happiness
understanding i understand

2120
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:18,240
understanding i understand
 

2121
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,310
understanding i understand
and i i think these things are really

2122
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:20,320
and i i think these things are really
 

2123
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,630
and i i think these things are really
marvelous if they if

2124
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:22,640
marvelous if they if
 

2125
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,870
marvelous if they if
if what they do is you know

2126
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:24,880
if what they do is you know
 

2127
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,310
if what they do is you know
all of a sudden we have a better medical

2128
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
all of a sudden we have a better medical
 

2129
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,270
all of a sudden we have a better medical
diagnosis or or or you know it will help

2130
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:29,280
diagnosis or or or you know it will help
 

2131
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,109
diagnosis or or or you know it will help
guide some scientific experiment or

2132
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:31,119
guide some scientific experiment or
 

2133
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,270
guide some scientific experiment or
something like this uh

2134
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:33,280
something like this uh
 

2135
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,270
something like this uh
you know you know curing diseases or

2136
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:35,280
you know you know curing diseases or
 

2137
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,829
you know you know curing diseases or
what whatever but

2138
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:37,839
what whatever but
 

2139
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,190
what whatever but
but when it

2140
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:39,200
but when it
 

2141
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,710
but when it
when it affects people's lives in a

2142
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:40,720
when it affects people's lives in a
 

2143
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,510
when it affects people's lives in a
serious way uh uh

2144
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:43,520
serious way uh uh
 

2145
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,870
serious way uh uh
so if you're writing if you're writing

2146
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:44,880
so if you're writing if you're writing
 

2147
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,349
so if you're writing if you're writing
code for geeky oh yeah here this is

2148
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
code for geeky oh yeah here this is
 

2149
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,790
code for geeky oh yeah here this is
great

2150
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:48,800
great
 

2151
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,069
great
this will make a slaughter bot okay

2152
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:52,079
this will make a slaughter bot okay
 

2153
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:54,550
this will make a slaughter bot okay
so i see so

2154
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:54,560
so i see so
 

2155
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,109
so i see so
you have to be very careful

2156
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:57,119
you have to be very careful
 

2157
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,870
you have to be very careful
like right now it seems like fun and

2158
00:37:58,870 --> 00:37:58,880
like right now it seems like fun and
 

2159
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,950
like right now it seems like fun and
games it's useful to write a little

2160
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:00,960
games it's useful to write a little
 

2161
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,430
games it's useful to write a little
javascript program that helps you with

2162
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:03,440
javascript program that helps you with
 

2163
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,790
javascript program that helps you with
the website

2164
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
the website
 

2165
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,430
the website
but like you said one year passes two

2166
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:07,440
but like you said one year passes two
 

2167
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,990
but like you said one year passes two
years passes five years and you forget

2168
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:10,000
years passes five years and you forget
 

2169
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,310
years passes five years and you forget
you start building on top of it and then

2170
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:12,320
you start building on top of it and then
 

2171
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,670
you start building on top of it and then
all of a sudden you have autonomous

2172
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:13,680
all of a sudden you have autonomous
 

2173
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,430
all of a sudden you have autonomous
weapon systems

2174
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:15,440
weapon systems
 

2175
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,630
weapon systems
based

2176
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
based
 

2177
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,109
based
well we're all dead it doesn't matter in

2178
00:38:19,109 --> 00:38:19,119
well we're all dead it doesn't matter in
 

2179
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,349
well we're all dead it doesn't matter in
that sense

2180
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:21,359
that sense
 

2181
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,430
that sense
well in the end

2182
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:23,440
well in the end
 

2183
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:26,870
well in the end
the this whole thing ends anyway so

2184
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:26,880
the this whole thing ends anyway so
 

2185
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,950
the this whole thing ends anyway so
um but it it

2186
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:28,960
um but it it
 

2187
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,390
um but it it
there is a heat death of the universe

2188
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:32,400
there is a heat death of the universe
 

2189
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,790
there is a heat death of the universe
predicted but i i'm trying to postpone

2190
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:34,800
predicted but i i'm trying to postpone
 

2191
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,829
predicted but i i'm trying to postpone
that for

2192
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:35,839
that for
 

2193
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:38,150
that for
for a little bit

2194
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:38,160
for a little bit
 

2195
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,710
for a little bit
well it'd be nice that at the end

2196
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:40,720
well it'd be nice that at the end
 

2197
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,390
well it'd be nice that at the end
as we approach the heat death of the

2198
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:42,400
as we approach the heat death of the
 

2199
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,910
as we approach the heat death of the
universe there's

2200
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
universe there's
 

2201
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,150
universe there's
still some kind of consciousness there

2202
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:46,160
still some kind of consciousness there
 

2203
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:46,870
still some kind of consciousness there
to

2204
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:46,880
to
 

2205
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,670
to
to to to appreciate it

2206
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:49,680
to to to appreciate it
 

2207
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,990
to to to appreciate it
hopefully human consciousness i'll

2208
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:52,000
hopefully human consciousness i'll
 

2209
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,750
hopefully human consciousness i'll
settle for 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the

2210
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:53,760
settle for 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the
 

2211
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,390
settle for 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the
10th year some finite number but

2212
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:56,400
10th year some finite number but
 

2213
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,589
10th year some finite number but
but

2214
00:38:57,589 --> 00:38:57,599
but
 

2215
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,270
but
things like this might be the reason we

2216
00:38:59,270 --> 00:38:59,280
things like this might be the reason we
 

2217
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,109
things like this might be the reason we
don't pick up any

2218
00:39:01,109 --> 00:39:01,119
don't pick up any
 

2219
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,190
don't pick up any
signals from

2220
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,200
signals from
 

2221
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,790
signals from
extraterrestrial

2222
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:04,800
extraterrestrial
 

2223
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,790
extraterrestrial
they don't want anything to do with us

2224
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:06,800
they don't want anything to do with us
 

2225
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,109
they don't want anything to do with us
oh because they because they

2226
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:09,119
oh because they because they
 

2227
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,390
oh because they because they
they invented it too and

2228
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:14,400

 

2229
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,270

so you you do have a little bit of worry

2230
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:17,280
so you you do have a little bit of worry
 

2231
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,550
so you you do have a little bit of worry
on the

2232
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:18,560
on the
 

2233
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,950
on the
existential threats of

2234
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:20,960
existential threats of
 

2235
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,109
existential threats of
ai and automation

2236
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:23,119
ai and automation
 

2237
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:25,510
ai and automation
so like like removing the human from the

2238
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,520
so like like removing the human from the
 

2239
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,950
so like like removing the human from the
picture et cetera yeah people have more

2240
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:28,960
picture et cetera yeah people have more
 

2241
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,470
picture et cetera yeah people have more
more potential to

2242
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
more potential to
 

2243
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,069
more potential to
to do harm now than

2244
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
to do harm now than
 

2245
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,150
to do harm now than
by far than they did a 100 years ago

2246
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,160
by far than they did a 100 years ago
 

2247
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,430
by far than they did a 100 years ago
but are you optimistic about so the

2248
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:39,440
but are you optimistic about so the
 

2249
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,750
but are you optimistic about so the
humans are good at creating destructive

2250
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:41,760
humans are good at creating destructive
 

2251
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,510
humans are good at creating destructive
things but also humans are good at

2252
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:43,520
things but also humans are good at
 

2253
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,190
things but also humans are good at
solving problems yeah i mean there's

2254
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:45,200
solving problems yeah i mean there's
 

2255
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,109
solving problems yeah i mean there's
half empty and have full you know that

2256
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
half empty and have full you know that
 

2257
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:48,550
half empty and have full you know that
so

2258
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:48,560
so
 

2259
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,349
so
how yeah we have full or what i can go

2260
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:51,359
how yeah we have full or what i can go
 

2261
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,829
how yeah we have full or what i can go
yeah so so let me let me put it this way

2262
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:53,839
yeah so so let me let me put it this way
 

2263
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:55,190
yeah so so let me let me put it this way
because

2264
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:55,200
because
 

2265
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,710
because
because it's the only way i can be

2266
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:56,720
because it's the only way i can be
 

2267
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,550
because it's the only way i can be
optimistic but but

2268
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:58,560
optimistic but but
 

2269
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,069
optimistic but but
but

2270
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:00,079
but
 

2271
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,710
but
think of um

2272
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:02,720
think of um
 

2273
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,190
think of um
of

2274
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:05,200

 

2275
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,950

things that have changed because of

2276
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:06,960
things that have changed because of
 

2277
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,190
things that have changed because of
civilization

2278
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:09,200
civilization
 

2279
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,829
civilization
you know they don't occur just in nature

2280
00:40:11,829 --> 00:40:11,839
you know they don't occur just in nature
 

2281
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,190
you know they don't occur just in nature
so just

2282
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:13,200
so just
 

2283
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,510
so just
uh just imagine that the room we're in

2284
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:15,520
uh just imagine that the room we're in
 

2285
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,109
uh just imagine that the room we're in
for example

2286
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:17,119
for example
 

2287
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,309
for example
okay some

2288
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:18,319
okay some
 

2289
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:19,510
okay some
you know we've got

2290
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:19,520
you know we've got
 

2291
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,510
you know we've got
pencils we've got books we've got tables

2292
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:21,520
pencils we've got books we've got tables
 

2293
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,510
pencils we've got books we've got tables
we've got microphones

2294
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:23,520
we've got microphones
 

2295
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,430
we've got microphones
clothing food

2296
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:25,440
clothing food
 

2297
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,829
clothing food
all these things were added

2298
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:27,839
all these things were added
 

2299
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,670
all these things were added
somebody invented them one by one and

2300
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:31,680
somebody invented them one by one and
 

2301
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,510
somebody invented them one by one and
millions of things

2302
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:33,520
millions of things
 

2303
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,230
millions of things
uh that we inherit okay

2304
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:36,240
uh that we inherit okay
 

2305
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,589
uh that we inherit okay
and

2306
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:37,599
and
 

2307
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:40,069
and
it's inconceivable that that so many

2308
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:40,079
it's inconceivable that that so many
 

2309
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,829
it's inconceivable that that so many
millions of billions of things uh

2310
00:40:41,829 --> 00:40:41,839
millions of billions of things uh
 

2311
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,270
millions of billions of things uh
wouldn't have problems and

2312
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:45,280

 

2313
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,270

we we get it all right

2314
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:47,280
we we get it all right
 

2315
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,750
we we get it all right
um and and each one

2316
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:49,760
um and and each one
 

2317
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,829
um and and each one
would have no

2318
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:50,839
would have no
 

2319
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:52,710
would have no
negative

2320
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:52,720
negative
 

2321
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,990
negative
effects and so on so it it's very

2322
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,000
effects and so on so it it's very
 

2323
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,270
effects and so on so it it's very
amazing that it much works as does work

2324
00:40:59,270 --> 00:40:59,280
amazing that it much works as does work
 

2325
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,470
amazing that it much works as does work
it's

2326
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:00,480
it's
 

2327
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,950
it's
it's incredibly amazing

2328
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:02,960
it's incredibly amazing
 

2329
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,870
it's incredibly amazing
and actually that's the source of my

2330
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:04,880
and actually that's the source of my
 

2331
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,870
and actually that's the source of my
optimism as well

2332
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:06,880
optimism as well
 

2333
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,510
optimism as well
including for artificial intelligence

2334
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:09,520
including for artificial intelligence
 

2335
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,870
including for artificial intelligence
so

2336
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:10,880
so
 

2337
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,349
so
we we drive over bridges

2338
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:13,359
we we drive over bridges
 

2339
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:16,150
we we drive over bridges
we we use all kinds of technology we

2340
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:16,160
we we use all kinds of technology we
 

2341
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,230
we we use all kinds of technology we
don't know how it works and there's

2342
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:18,240
don't know how it works and there's
 

2343
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,069
don't know how it works and there's
millions of brilliant people involved in

2344
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:20,079
millions of brilliant people involved in
 

2345
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:22,390
millions of brilliant people involved in
building a small part of that and it

2346
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:22,400
building a small part of that and it
 

2347
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,150
building a small part of that and it
doesn't go wrong and it works and i mean

2348
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:24,160
doesn't go wrong and it works and i mean
 

2349
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,270
doesn't go wrong and it works and i mean
that

2350
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:25,280
that
 

2351
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,030
that
it it works

2352
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:27,040
it it works
 

2353
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,670
it it works
and it doesn't go go wrong

2354
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:29,680
and it doesn't go go wrong
 

2355
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,829
and it doesn't go go wrong
often enough to suffer and we can

2356
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:32,839
often enough to suffer and we can
 

2357
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,349
often enough to suffer and we can
identify things that aren't working and

2358
00:41:35,349 --> 00:41:35,359
identify things that aren't working and
 

2359
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:37,109
identify things that aren't working and
and try to

2360
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:37,119
and try to
 

2361
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,470
and try to
improve on them

2362
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:38,480
improve on them
 

2363
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,349
improve on them
in a sub often suboptimal way oh

2364
00:41:41,349 --> 00:41:41,359
in a sub often suboptimal way oh
 

2365
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,349

i tend to think that most people

2396
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:14,839
i tend to think that most people
 

2397
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,150
i tend to think that most people
um have the desire and the capacity to

2398
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:18,160
um have the desire and the capacity to
 

2399
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,829
um have the desire and the capacity to
be good to each other

2400
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:19,839
be good to each other

wrote the real problem is that
 

2411
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,270
wrote the real problem is that

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,270
programmers have spent far too much time

00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,390
premature optimization is the root of
all evil

2420
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:42,400

2424
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480
programming
 

2425
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,589
programming
can you uh explain this idea

2426
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:49,599
can you uh explain this idea
 

2427
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,150
can you uh explain this idea
uh what's the wrong time what is the

2428
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:52,160
uh what's the wrong time what is the
 

2429
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,670
uh what's the wrong time what is the
wrong place for our optimization so

2430
00:42:55,670 --> 00:42:55,680
wrong place for our optimization so
 

2431
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,710
wrong place for our optimization so
first of all the word optimization i i

2432
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:58,720
first of all the word optimization i i
 

2433
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,630
first of all the word optimization i i
started out writing software uh and

2434
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
started out writing software uh and
 

2435
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,109
started out writing software uh and
optimization was i was a compiler writer

2436
00:43:05,109 --> 00:43:05,119
optimization was i was a compiler writer
 

2437
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,030
optimization was i was a compiler writer
so optimization meant uh making the

2438
00:43:09,030 --> 00:43:09,040
so optimization meant uh making the
 

2439
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,230
so optimization meant uh making the
uh

2440
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:10,240
uh
 

2441
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,550
uh
making a better translation it it so

2442
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:12,560
making a better translation it it so
 

2443
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,950
making a better translation it it so
that it would run faster on it on a

2444
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:14,960
that it would run faster on it on a
 

2445
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,030
that it would run faster on it on a
machine instead of an optimized program

2446
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:17,040
machine instead of an optimized program
 

2447
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:18,950
machine instead of an optimized program
it's just like you know you you you run

2448
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:18,960
it's just like you know you you you run
 

2449
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,349
it's just like you know you you you run
a program and you set the optimization

2450
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:21,359
a program and you set the optimization
 

2451
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,670
a program and you set the optimization
level uh for

2452
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,680
level uh for
 

2453
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,430
level uh for
the compiler so that's one

2454
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
the compiler so that's one
 

2455
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,190
the compiler so that's one
word for optimization

2456
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:27,200
word for optimization
 

2457
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,670
word for optimization
um and at that time i

2458
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:29,680
um and at that time i
 

2459
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,109
um and at that time i
i happened to be looking in an

2460
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:31,119
i happened to be looking in an
 

2461
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,589
i happened to be looking in an

2462
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:33,599

uh for some reason or other and i came

2464
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:35,839
uh for some reason or other and i came
 

2465
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,589
uh for some reason or other and i came
to work optimizing

2466
00:43:37,589 --> 00:43:37,599
to work optimizing
 

2467
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,750
to work optimizing
what's the meaning of the word optimized

2468
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:39,760
what's the meaning of the word optimized
 

2469
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,790
what's the meaning of the word optimized
and it says to view with optimism

2470
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:44,800

 

2471
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,589

and you look in webster's dictionary of

2472
00:43:47,589 --> 00:43:47,599
and you look in webster's dictionary of
 

2473
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,309
and you look in webster's dictionary of
english language in 1960 early 1960s

2474
00:43:50,309 --> 00:43:50,319
english language in 1960 early 1960s
 

2475
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,510
english language in 1960 early 1960s
that's what optimized me meant okay

2476
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:55,520

 

2477
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,630

so people

2478
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:56,640
so people
 

2479
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,790
so people
started doing cost optimization other

2480
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:58,800
started doing cost optimization other
 

2481
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,950
started doing cost optimization other
kinds of things uh

2482
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:00,960
kinds of things uh
 

2483
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,349
kinds of things uh
you know whole subfields of

2484
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:03,359
you know whole subfields of
 

2485
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:05,030
you know whole subfields of
of

2486
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:05,040
of
 

2487
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:07,670
of
algorithms and economics and whatever

2488
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:07,680
algorithms and economics and whatever
 

2489
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,030
algorithms and economics and whatever
are are based on what they call

2490
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:09,040
are are based on what they call
 

2491
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,109
are are based on what they call
optimization now but

2492
00:44:11,109 --> 00:44:11,119
optimization now but
 

2493
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,150
optimization now but
but

2494
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:12,160
but
 

2495
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,710
but
to me optimization when i was saying

2496
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:14,720
to me optimization when i was saying
 

2497
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:15,589
to me optimization when i was saying
that

2498
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:15,599
that
 

2499
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,790
that
was saying uh uh changing a program to

2500
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:18,800
was saying uh uh changing a program to
 

2501
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,150
was saying uh uh changing a program to
make it more

2502
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:20,160
make it more
 

2503
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,670
make it more
tuned to the machine

2504
00:44:21,670 --> 00:44:21,680
tuned to the machine
 

2505
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,190
tuned to the machine
and i found out that uh

2506
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:25,200
and i found out that uh
 

2507
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,470
and i found out that uh
when a person writes a program

2508
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:28,480
when a person writes a program
 

2509
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,750
when a person writes a program
uh

2510
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:29,760
uh
 

2511
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:30,550
uh
he

2512
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:30,560
he
 

2513
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:31,670
he
he or she

2514
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:31,680
he or she
 

2515
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,109
he or she
tends to think that

2516
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:33,119
tends to think that
 

2517
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,030
tends to think that
the parts that were hardest to write are

2518
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
the parts that were hardest to write are
 

2519
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,710
the parts that were hardest to write are
going to be hardest for the computer to

2520
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:36,720
going to be hardest for the computer to
 

2521
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,950
going to be hardest for the computer to
execute

2522
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:38,960
execute
 

2523
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,630
execute
so

2524
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:40,640
so
 

2525
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,710
so
maybe i have 10 pages of code but

2526
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:42,720
maybe i have 10 pages of code but
 

2527
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,990
maybe i have 10 pages of code but
i i had to work a week writing this page

2528
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:46,000
i i had to work a week writing this page
 

2529
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,710
i i had to work a week writing this page
i i mentally think that when the

2530
00:44:48,710 --> 00:44:48,720
i i mentally think that when the
 

2531
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,230
i i mentally think that when the
computer gets to that page it's going to

2532
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:50,240
computer gets to that page it's going to
 

2533
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,510
computer gets to that page it's going to
slow down

2534
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:51,520
slow down
 

2535
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,510
slow down
right uh it's chris oh i don't

2536
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:53,520
right uh it's chris oh i don't
 

2537
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,349
right uh it's chris oh i don't
understand what i'm doing i better

2538
00:44:55,349 --> 00:44:55,359
understand what i'm doing i better
 

2539
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:58,550
understand what i'm doing i better
be more anyway this is of course

2540
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:58,560
be more anyway this is of course
 

2541
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,710
be more anyway this is of course
silly but it's it's something that we

2542
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:00,720
silly but it's it's something that we
 

2543
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:01,670
silly but it's it's something that we
that we

2544
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:01,680
that we
 

2545
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,750
that we
that we don't know when we write a piece

2546
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:03,760
that we don't know when we write a piece
 

2547
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,510
that we don't know when we write a piece
of code we don't know what

2548
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:05,520
of code we don't know what
 

2549
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,910
of code we don't know what
what whether the computer is actually

2550
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:07,920
what whether the computer is actually
 

2551
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,430
what whether the computer is actually
going to be executing that code very

2552
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:09,440
going to be executing that code very
 

2553
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,550
going to be executing that code very
much

2554
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:10,560
much
 

2555
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,109
much
so so people had had a very

2556
00:45:13,109 --> 00:45:13,119
so so people had had a very
 

2557
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,349
so so people had had a very
poor understanding of

2558
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:15,359
poor understanding of
 

2559
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:16,230
poor understanding of
of

2560
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:16,240
of
 

2561
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,710
of
what the computer was actually doing

2562
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:18,720
what the computer was actually doing
 

2563
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,030
what the computer was actually doing
i i made one test where

2564
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:21,040
i i made one test where
 

2565
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,390
i i made one test where
where we studied a fortran compiler

2566
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:24,400
where we studied a fortran compiler
 

2567
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,550
where we studied a fortran compiler
and it was spending more than 80 of its

2568
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:26,560
and it was spending more than 80 of its
 

2569
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,080
and it was spending more than 80 of its
time reading the comments card

2570
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:29,090

[Music]
but as a programmer we were really

2574
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:32,240
but as a programmer we were really
 

2575
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,390
but as a programmer we were really
concerned about how fast it could take a

2576
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:34,400
concerned about how fast it could take a
 

2577
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,390
concerned about how fast it could take a
complicated expression that had lots of

2578
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:36,400
complicated expression that had lots of
 

2579
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,710
complicated expression that had lots of
levels of parenthesis and

2580
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:38,720
levels of parenthesis and
 

2581
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,270
levels of parenthesis and
and and and convert that in

2582
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:41,280
and and and convert that in
 

2583
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,589
and and and convert that in
into something but that was just you

2584
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:43,599
into something but that was just you
 

2585
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,790
into something but that was just you
know less than one percent of the uh

2586
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:46,800
know less than one percent of the uh
 

2587
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:49,030
know less than one percent of the uh
so if we optimized that

2588
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:49,040
so if we optimized that
 

2589
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,470
so if we optimized that
uh

2590
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:50,480
uh
 

2591
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,829
uh
we didn't know what we were doing but

00:45:51,829 --> 00:45:51,839
we didn't know what we were doing but
 

2593
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:53,349
we didn't know what we were doing but
but but if if we knew that it was

00:45:53,349 --> 00:45:53,359
but but if if we knew that it was

the comments

2598
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:55,760
the comments
 

2599
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,750
the comments
card you know in ten minutes we could we

2600
00:45:57,750 --> 00:45:57,760
card you know in ten minutes we could we
 

2601
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,750
card you know in ten minutes we could we
could make the the compiler run more

2602
00:45:59,750 --> 00:45:59,760
could make the the compiler run more
 

2603
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,829
could make the the compiler run more
than twice as fast and you can only do

2604
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:01,839
than twice as fast and you can only do
 

2605
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:03,910
than twice as fast and you can only do
that once you've completed the program

2606
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:03,920
that once you've completed the program
 

2607
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,910
that once you've completed the program
and then you empirically study where i

2608
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:05,920
and then you empirically study where i
 

2609
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,390
and then you empirically study where i
had some kind of profiling that i knew

2610
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:08,400
had some kind of profiling that i knew
 

2611
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,109
had some kind of profiling that i knew
what was important yeah so

2612
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:11,119
what was important yeah so
 

2613
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:12,950
what was important yeah so
you don't think the supplies generally i

2614
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:12,960
you don't think the supplies generally i
 

2615
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,470
you don't think the supplies generally i
mean there's something that rings true

2616
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:14,480
mean there's something that rings true
 

2617
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,309
mean there's something that rings true
to this across the board i'm glad that

2618
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:16,319
to this across the board i'm glad that
 

2619
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,150
to this across the board i'm glad that
it applied generally but but it was it

2620
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:18,160
it applied generally but but it was it
 

2621
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,150
it applied generally but but it was it
was only my good luck

2622
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
was only my good luck
 

2623
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,870
was only my good luck
i said it but you know but but i did but

2624
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:22,880
i said it but you know but but i did but
 

2625
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,270
i said it but you know but but i did but
i said it in limited context and not and

2626
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:25,280
i said it in limited context and not and
 

2627
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,109
i said it in limited context and not and
and i'm glad if it

2628
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
and i'm glad if it
 

2629
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,190
and i'm glad if it
makes people think about stuff because i

2630
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:29,200
makes people think about stuff because i
 

2631

but

2634
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:31,200
but
 

2635
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,790
but
it applies

2636
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:32,800
it applies
 

2637
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,069
it applies
in another sense too that is

2638
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:36,079
in another sense too that is
 

2639
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,349
in another sense too that is
sometimes i will

quantitatively how valuable that is
 

2679
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,589
quantitatively how valuable that is
what do you mean we understand so you

2680
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:21,599
what do you mean we understand so you
 

2681
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,670
what do you mean we understand so you
mean people

2682
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:23,680
mean people
 

2683
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,430
mean people
people have written thesis about how you

2684
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:25,440
people have written thesis about how you
 

2685
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,150
people have written thesis about how you
can how late binding will

2686
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:28,160
can how late binding will
 

2687
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,630
can how late binding will
it will improve the i mean you know just

2688
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:30,640
it will improve the i mean you know just
 

2689
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,430
it will improve the i mean you know just
in time manufacturing or whatever

2690
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:33,440
in time manufacturing or whatever
 

2691
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:36,069
in time manufacturing or whatever
you can make you can defer a decision

2692
00:47:36,069 --> 00:47:36,079
you can make you can defer a decision
 

2693
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,829
you can make you can defer a decision
instead of doing your advanced planning

2694
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
instead of doing your advanced planning
 

2695
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,750
instead of doing your advanced planning
and say i'm gonna allocate thirty

2696
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:39,760
and say i'm gonna allocate thirty
 

2697
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,829
and say i'm gonna allocate thirty
percent to this and fifty percent so in

2698
00:47:41,829 --> 00:47:41,839
percent to this and fifty percent so in
 

2699
00:47:41,839 --> 00:47:43,430
percent to this and fifty percent so in
all kinds of domains there's an

2700
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:43,440
all kinds of domains there's an
 

2701
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,990
all kinds of domains there's an
optimality to laziness in many cases

2702
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:46,000
optimality to laziness in many cases
 

2703
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,230
optimality to laziness in many cases
decision is not made in advance so

2704
00:47:48,230 --> 00:47:48,240
decision is not made in advance so
 

2705
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,630
decision is not made in advance so
instead you you design

2706
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
instead you you design
 

2707
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:53,270
instead you you design
in order to be flexible uh uh to to

2708
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:53,280
in order to be flexible uh uh to to
 

2709
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,430
in order to be flexible uh uh to to
change with the uh uh

2710
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:55,440
change with the uh uh
 

2711
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,030
change with the uh uh
with the way the wind is blowing yeah

2712
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:57,040
with the way the wind is blowing yeah
 

2713
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,150
with the way the wind is blowing yeah
but so the reason that line resonated

2714
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:00,160
but so the reason that line resonated
 

2715
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,829
but so the reason that line resonated
with a lot of people

2716
00:48:01,829 --> 00:48:01,839
with a lot of people
 

2717
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:03,510
with a lot of people
is because

2718
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:03,520
is because
 

2719
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,630
is because
uh there's something about the

2720
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,640
uh there's something about the
 

2721
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,549
uh there's something about the
programmer's mind

2722
00:48:06,549 --> 00:48:06,559
programmer's mind
 

2723
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:09,750
programmer's mind
that wants that enjoys optimization so

2724
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:09,760
that wants that enjoys optimization so
 

2725
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,750
that wants that enjoys optimization so
it's a constant struggle

2726
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
it's a constant struggle
 

2727
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:12,870
it's a constant struggle
to

2728
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
to
 

2729
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:13,910
to
balance

2730
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
balance
 

2731
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,190
balance
laziness

2732
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:15,200
laziness
 

2733
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,589
laziness
and lay binding with

2734
00:48:17,589 --> 00:48:17,599
and lay binding with
 

2735
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,549
and lay binding with
the desire to optimize

2736
00:48:20,549 --> 00:48:20,559
the desire to optimize
 

2737
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:24,069
the desire to optimize
the elegance of a well-optimized code is

2738
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:24,079
the elegance of a well-optimized code is
 

2739
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,430
the elegance of a well-optimized code is
something that's compelling to

2740
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:25,440
something that's compelling to
 

2741
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,470
something that's compelling to
programming

2742
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:26,480
programming
 

2743
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,430
programming
yeah

2744
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:27,440
yeah
 

2745
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,790
yeah
it's a

2746
00:48:28,790 --> 00:48:28,800
it's a
 

2747
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,510
it's a
another concept of beauty

2748
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:31,520
another concept of beauty
 

2749
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,589
another concept of beauty
let me ask you a weird question

2750
00:48:33,589 --> 00:48:33,599
let me ask you a weird question
 

2751
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,950
let me ask you a weird question
so roger penrose

2752
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:36,960
so roger penrose
 

2753
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:40,870
so roger penrose
has talked about computation computers

2754
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:40,880
has talked about computation computers
 

2755
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,630
has talked about computation computers
and

2756
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:42,640
and
 

2757
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,030
and
he proposed that

2758
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:45,040
he proposed that
 

2759
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,870
he proposed that
the way the human mind discovers

2760
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:46,880
the way the human mind discovers
 

2761
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,349
the way the human mind discovers
mathematical ideas is something more

2762
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:49,359
mathematical ideas is something more
 

2763
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:50,790
mathematical ideas is something more
than a computer

2764
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:50,800
than a computer
 

2765
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,270
than a computer
that that a universal turing machine

2766
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:53,280
that that a universal turing machine
 

2767
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,589
that that a universal turing machine
cannot

2768
00:48:55,589 --> 00:48:55,599
cannot
 

2769
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,150
cannot
do everything that a human mind can do

2770
00:48:58,150 --> 00:48:58,160
do everything that a human mind can do
 

2771
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,069
do everything that a human mind can do
now this includes

2772
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:00,079
now this includes
 

2773
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,030
now this includes
discovering mathematical ideas and it

2774
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:03,040
discovering mathematical ideas and it
 

2775
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,309
discovering mathematical ideas and it
also includes

2776
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:04,319
also includes
 

2777
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,589
also includes
he's written a book about it

2778
00:49:05,589 --> 00:49:05,599
he's written a book about it
 

2779
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:06,870
he's written a book about it
consciousness

so i don't know if you know roger but

2782
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:09,040
so i don't know if you know roger but
 

2783
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,230
so i don't know if you know roger but
yeah

nice
 

2791
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,470
nice
so do you think there is such a limit to

2792
00:49:18,470 --> 00:49:18,480
so do you think there is such a limit to
 

2793
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,190
so do you think there is such a limit to
the computer do you think consciousness

2794
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,200
the computer do you think consciousness
 

2795
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,270
the computer do you think consciousness
is more than a computation do you think

2796
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:23,280
is more than a computation do you think
 

2797
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,549
is more than a computation do you think
the human mind the way it thinks is more

2798
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:26,559
the human mind the way it thinks is more
 

2799
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,870
the human mind the way it thinks is more
than a computation

2800
00:49:28,870 --> 00:49:28,880
than a computation
 

2801
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,510
than a computation
i i mean like i i can say yes or no but

2802
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:31,520
i i mean like i i can say yes or no but
 

2803
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,270
i i mean like i i can say yes or no but
but but i don't i have no reason

2804
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:35,280
but but i don't i have no reason
 

2805
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,069
but but i don't i have no reason
i mean

2806
00:49:36,069 --> 00:49:36,079
i mean
 

2807
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:37,910
i mean
so you don't find it useful to have an

2808
00:49:37,910 --> 00:49:37,920
so you don't find it useful to have an
 

2809
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,309
so you don't find it useful to have an
intuition in one way or the other like

2810
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:40,319
intuition in one way or the other like
 

2811
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:42,230
intuition in one way or the other like
when you think about algorithms do you

2812
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:42,240
when you think about algorithms do you
 

2813
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,270
when you think about algorithms do you
isn't it

2814
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:45,280
isn't it
 

2815
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:47,910
isn't it
unanswerable question in my opinion is

2816
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:47,920
unanswerable question in my opinion is
 

2817
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,510
unanswerable question in my opinion is
is no better than anybody else you think

2818
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:49,520
is no better than anybody else you think
 

2819
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,510
is no better than anybody else you think
it's unanswerable so you don't think

2820
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:51,520
it's unanswerable so you don't think
 

2821
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:52,790
it's unanswerable so you don't think
eventually science

2822
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:52,800
eventually science
 

2823
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,549
eventually science
angels can dance on the head i mean i

2824
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:54,559
angels can dance on the head i mean i
 

2825
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,910
angels can dance on the head i mean i
don't know

2826
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:55,920
don't know
 

2827
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,390
don't know
but angels

2828
00:49:58,390 --> 00:49:58,400
but angels
 

2829
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,309
but angels
anyway there are lots of things that are

2830
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:00,319
anyway there are lots of things that are
 

2831
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,710
anyway there are lots of things that are
beyond that that we can speculate about

2832
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:02,720
beyond that that we can speculate about
 

2833
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,589
beyond that that we can speculate about
but

2834
00:50:03,589 --> 00:50:03,599
but
 

2835
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,030
but
i don't want somebody to say oh yeah

2836
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:05,040
i don't want somebody to say oh yeah
 

2837
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:07,670
i don't want somebody to say oh yeah
canoe said this and and so he's he's

2838
00:50:07,670 --> 00:50:07,680
canoe said this and and so he's he's
 

2839
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,549
canoe said this and and so he's he's
he's smart and so he so that must be

2840
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:10,559
he's smart and so he so that must be
 

2841
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,910
he's smart and so he so that must be
i mean i say it's something that uh

2842
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
i mean i say it's something that uh
 

2843
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,069
i mean i say it's something that uh
we'll never know

2844
00:50:16,069 --> 00:50:16,079
we'll never know
 

2845
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:17,109
we'll never know
interesting

2846
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:17,119
interesting
 

2847
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,309
interesting
okay that's a strong statement i i don't

2848
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:20,319
okay that's a strong statement i i don't
 

2849
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,990
okay that's a strong statement i i don't
i personally think it's something we

2850
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:22,000
i personally think it's something we
 

2851
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,069
i personally think it's something we
will know eventually like there's no

2852
00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:24,079
will know eventually like there's no
 

2853
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,109
will know eventually like there's no
reason to me why the the workings of the

2854
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:27,119
reason to me why the the workings of the
 

2855
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,790
reason to me why the the workings of the
human mind

2856
00:50:28,790 --> 00:50:28,800
human mind
 

2857
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,589
human mind
are not within the reach of science

2858
00:50:31,589 --> 00:50:31,599
are not within the reach of science
 

2859
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,190
are not within the reach of science
that's absolutely possible and i'm not

2860
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:33,200
that's absolutely possible and i'm not
 

2861
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,790
that's absolutely possible and i'm not
denying it yeah

2862
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:34,800
denying it yeah
 

2863
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,549
denying it yeah
uh but right now you don't have a good

2864
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:36,559
uh but right now you don't have a good
 

2865
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,630
uh but right now you don't have a good
intuition i mean that's also possible

2866
00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:38,640
intuition i mean that's also possible
 

2867
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:40,950
intuition i mean that's also possible
you know that and ai

2868
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:40,960
you know that and ai
 

2869
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,430
you know that and ai
you know created the universe you know

2870
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:43,440
you know created the universe you know
 

2871
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,870
you know created the universe you know
intelligent design

2872
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:44,880
intelligent design
 

2873
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,430
intelligent design
has all been done by an ai yes

2874
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:47,440
has all been done by an ai yes
 

2875
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,910
has all been done by an ai yes
this is i mean all these things are but

2876
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:49,920
this is i mean all these things are but
 

2877
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:52,630
this is i mean all these things are but
but but but you're asking me to

2878
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:52,640
but but but you're asking me to
 

2879
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,870
but but but you're asking me to
to pronounce on it and and i don't have

2880
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:54,880
to pronounce on it and and i don't have
 

2881
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,069
to pronounce on it and and i don't have
any expertise i i i i'm a teacher that

2882
00:50:58,069 --> 00:50:58,079
any expertise i i i i'm a teacher that
 

2883
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,470
any expertise i i i i'm a teacher that
passes on knowledge but i don't

2884
00:51:00,470 --> 00:51:00,480
passes on knowledge but i don't
 

2885
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,230
passes on knowledge but i don't
but i don't know

2886
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:02,240
but i don't know
 

2887
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,510
but i don't know
the fact that i

2888
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:03,520
the fact that i
 

2889
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,470
the fact that i
that i vote yes or no on

2890
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:06,480
that i vote yes or no on
 

2891
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,270
that i vote yes or no on
well you do have expertise as a human

2892
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:09,280
well you do have expertise as a human
 

2893
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,750
well you do have expertise as a human
not as a not as a teacher

2894
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:11,760
not as a not as a teacher
 

2895
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,470
not as a not as a teacher
or a scholar of computer science

2896
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:14,480
or a scholar of computer science
 

2897
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:16,790
or a scholar of computer science
i mean that's ultimately the realm of

2898
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:16,800
i mean that's ultimately the realm of
 

2899
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,630
i mean that's ultimately the realm of
where the discussion of human thought

2900
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:18,640
where the discussion of human thought
 

2901
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:26,790
where the discussion of human thought
yeah well i know we're in consciousness

2902
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:26,800

 

2903
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,870

he might even thought he proved it but

2904
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:28,880
he might even thought he proved it but
 

2905
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,109
he might even thought he proved it but
no he doesn't he doesn't prove it he is

2906
00:51:31,109 --> 00:51:31,119
no he doesn't he doesn't prove it he is
 

2907
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,030
no he doesn't he doesn't prove it he is
following intuition but

2908
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:33,040
following intuition but
 

2909
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,670
following intuition but
but i mean you have to ask john mccarthy

2910
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:35,680
but i mean you have to ask john mccarthy
 

2911
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,990
but i mean you have to ask john mccarthy
john mccarthy

2912
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:38,000
john mccarthy
 

2913
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,109
john mccarthy
i think

2914
00:51:39,109 --> 00:51:39,119
i think
 

2915
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:41,430
i think
uh we're totally unimpressed by these

2916
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:41,440
uh we're totally unimpressed by these
 

2917
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,670
uh we're totally unimpressed by these
statements

2918
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:43,680
statements
 

2919
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,589
statements
so you don't think so even like the

2920
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:45,599
so you don't think so even like the
 

2921
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:47,990
so you don't think so even like the
touring paper on

2922
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,000
touring paper on
 

2923
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,069
touring paper on
uh on the touring test

2924
00:51:50,069 --> 00:51:50,079
uh on the touring test
 

2925
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:51,109
uh on the touring test
that

2926
00:51:51,109 --> 00:51:51,119
that
 

2927
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:53,270
that
you know starts by asking can machines

2928
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:53,280
you know starts by asking can machines
 

2929
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:56,069
you know starts by asking can machines
think oh um you don't think these kind

2930
00:51:56,069 --> 00:51:56,079
think oh um you don't think these kind
 

2931
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,510
think oh um you don't think these kind
of um

2932
00:51:57,510 --> 00:51:57,520
of um
 

2933
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,710
of um
touring doesn't like that question yeah

2934
00:52:00,710 --> 00:52:00,720
touring doesn't like that question yeah
 

2935
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,790
touring doesn't like that question yeah
i don't consider it important let's put

2936
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:02,800
i don't consider it important let's put
 

2937
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,549
i don't consider it important let's put
it that way

2938
00:52:04,549 --> 00:52:04,559
it that way
 

2939
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,710
it that way
because it it's in the category of

2940
00:52:06,710 --> 00:52:06,720
because it it's in the category of
 

2941
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,150
because it it's in the category of
things that

2942
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:08,160
things that
 

2943
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,309
things that
it it it would be nice you know but i

2944
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:10,319
it it it would be nice you know but i
 

2945
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:11,990
it it it would be nice you know but i
think it's beyond knowledge and so i

2946
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:12,000
think it's beyond knowledge and so i
 

2947
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,510
think it's beyond knowledge and so i
don't

2948
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
don't
 

2949
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,790
don't
i'm not i'm more interested in knowing

2950
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:16,800
i'm not i'm more interested in knowing
 

2951
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,670
i'm not i'm more interested in knowing
about

2952
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:17,680
about
 

2953
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:20,309
about
the riemann hypothesis or something

2954
00:52:20,309 --> 00:52:20,319
the riemann hypothesis or something
 

2955
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,150
the riemann hypothesis or something
so when you say it's an interesting

2956
00:52:22,150 --> 00:52:22,160
so when you say it's an interesting
 

2957
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,309
so when you say it's an interesting
statement beyond knowledge

2958
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:24,319
statement beyond knowledge
 

2959
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,549
statement beyond knowledge
yeah i think what you mean

2960
00:52:26,549 --> 00:52:26,559
yeah i think what you mean
 

2961
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,270
yeah i think what you mean
is it's not sufficiently well

2962
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:29,280
is it's not sufficiently well
 

2963
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,190
is it's not sufficiently well
it's not even known well enough to be

2964
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:31,200
it's not even known well enough to be
 

2965
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:33,430
it's not even known well enough to be
able to formalize it

2966
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:33,440
able to formalize it
 

2967
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,390
able to formalize it
in order to ask a clear question yeah

2968
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:36,400
in order to ask a clear question yeah
 

2969
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,829
in order to ask a clear question yeah
and so that's why it's beyond knowledge

2970
00:52:37,829 --> 00:52:37,839
and so that's why it's beyond knowledge
 

2971
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,990
and so that's why it's beyond knowledge
but that doesn't mean it's not

2972
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:40,000
but that doesn't mean it's not
 

2973
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,150
but that doesn't mean it's not
eventually going to be formalized yeah

2974
00:52:42,150 --> 00:52:42,160
eventually going to be formalized yeah
 

2975
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,910
eventually going to be formalized yeah
yeah maybe consciousness will be

2976
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:43,920
yeah maybe consciousness will be
 

2977
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,549
yeah maybe consciousness will be
understood some some day but uh the last

2978
00:52:46,549 --> 00:52:46,559
understood some some day but uh the last
 

2979
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,150
understood some some day but uh the last
time i checked

2980
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:48,160
time i checked
 

2981
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,270
time i checked
uh

2982
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:49,280
uh
 

2983
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,870
uh
it it was still 200 years away

2984
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:52,880
it it was still 200 years away
 

2985
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,549
it it was still 200 years away
i haven't been specializing in this by

2986
00:52:54,549 --> 00:52:54,559
i haven't been specializing in this by
 

2987
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,710
i haven't been specializing in this by
any means but but but i went to lectures

2988
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:56,720
any means but but but i went to lectures
 

2989
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:59,109
any means but but but i went to lectures
about it 20 years ago when i was

2990
00:52:59,109 --> 00:52:59,119
about it 20 years ago when i was
 

2991
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:01,510
about it 20 years ago when i was
uh there was there was a symposium at

2992
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:01,520
uh there was there was a symposium at
 

2993
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,309
uh there was there was a symposium at
the american academy in in cambridge and

2994
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:04,319
the american academy in in cambridge and
 

2995
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:07,510
the american academy in in cambridge and
it started out by saying essentially

2996
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:07,520
it started out by saying essentially
 

2997
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:08,790
it started out by saying essentially
everything that's been written about

2998
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:08,800
everything that's been written about
 

2999
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,390
everything that's been written about
consciousness is

3000
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:10,400
consciousness is
 

3001
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,950
consciousness is
is hogwash

3002
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:12,960
is hogwash
 

3003
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,549
is hogwash
i tend to

3004
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:16,559

 

3005
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,069

i tend to disagree with that a little

3006
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:18,079
i tend to disagree with that a little
 

3007
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,990
i tend to disagree with that a little
bit so well it's

3008
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:20,000
bit so well it's
 

3009
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,150
bit so well it's
so consciousness for the longest time

3010
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:22,160
so consciousness for the longest time
 

3011
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,190
so consciousness for the longest time
still

3012
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:23,200
still
 

3013
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,950
still
is in the realm of philosophy so it's

3014
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:24,960
is in the realm of philosophy so it's
 

3015
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,190
is in the realm of philosophy so it's
just conversations without any basis and

3016
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
just conversations without any basis and
 

3017
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,950
just conversations without any basis and
yeah understanding

00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:28,960
yeah understanding
 

3019
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,069
yeah understanding

still
 

3021
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:31,270
still
i think

3022
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:31,280
i think
 

3023
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,349
i think
once you start creating artificial

3024
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
once you start creating artificial
 

3025
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,589
once you start creating artificial
intelligence systems that interact with

3026
00:53:35,589 --> 00:53:35,599
intelligence systems that interact with
 

3027
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,309
intelligence systems that interact with
humans

3028
00:53:38,309 --> 00:53:38,319

 

3029
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,630

and they have personality

3030
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:40,640
and they have personality
 

3031
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,750
and they have personality
they have identity you start flirting

3032
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:43,760
they have identity you start flirting
 

3033
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:45,990
they have identity you start flirting
with the question of consciousness not

3034
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,000
with the question of consciousness not
 

3035
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,230
with the question of consciousness not
from a philosophical perspective but

3036
00:53:48,230 --> 00:53:48,240
from a philosophical perspective but
 

3037
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,309
from a philosophical perspective but
from an engineering perspective

3038
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:50,319
from an engineering perspective
 

3039
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:52,710
from an engineering perspective
and then starts becoming much more

3040
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:52,720
and then starts becoming much more
 

3041
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,950
and then starts becoming much more
like i feel like yeah yeah don't

3042
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:54,960
like i feel like yeah yeah don't
 

3043
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,470
like i feel like yeah yeah don't
misunderstand me i

3044
00:53:56,470 --> 00:53:56,480
misunderstand me i
 

3045
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,870
misunderstand me i
i i i i certainly don't disagree with

3046
00:53:58,870 --> 00:53:58,880
i i i i certainly don't disagree with
 

3047
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:00,870
i i i i certainly don't disagree with
that at all um

3048
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:00,880
that at all um
 

3049
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,589
that at all um
and

3050
00:54:01,589 --> 00:54:01,599
and
 

3051
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:03,670
and
even at these lectures that we had

3052
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:03,680
even at these lectures that we had
 

3053
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,589
even at these lectures that we had
you know 20 years ago there were

3054
00:54:05,589 --> 00:54:05,599
you know 20 years ago there were
 

3055
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:06,950
you know 20 years ago there were
neurologists

3056
00:54:06,950 --> 00:54:06,960
neurologists
 

3057
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,549
neurologists
pointing out that

3058
00:54:08,549 --> 00:54:08,559
pointing out that
 

3059
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,670
pointing out that
that human beings had actually decided

3060
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:11,680
that human beings had actually decided
 

3061
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:13,270
that human beings had actually decided
to do something before they were

3062
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:13,280
to do something before they were
 

3063
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,150
to do something before they were
conscious of making that decision yeah

3064
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:16,160
conscious of making that decision yeah
 

3065
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:17,349
conscious of making that decision yeah
uh

3066
00:54:17,349 --> 00:54:17,359
uh
 

3067
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,910
uh
i mean they could tell that

3068
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:19,920
i mean they could tell that
 

3069
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,510
i mean they could tell that
you know that signals were being sent to

3070
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:21,520
you know that signals were being sent to
 

3071
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,069
you know that signals were being sent to
their arms before they before their they

3072
00:54:24,069 --> 00:54:24,079
their arms before they before their they
 

3073
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,510
their arms before they before their they
knew that they were

3074
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:25,520
knew that they were
 

3075
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,030
knew that they were
anything like this

3076
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:27,040
anything like this
 

3077
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,030
anything like this
are true and and uh

3078
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:29,040
are true and and uh
 

3079
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,910
are true and and uh
my uh you know less valiant has

3080
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:31,920
my uh you know less valiant has
 

3081
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,990
my uh you know less valiant has
an architecture for the brain and more

3082
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:34,000
an architecture for the brain and more
 

3083
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,510

this architecture

3102
00:54:53,910 --> 00:54:53,920
this architecture
 

3103
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,789
this architecture
by which you could uh create a

3104
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:56,799
by which you could uh create a
 

3105
00:54:56,799 --> 00:54:58,710
by which you could uh create a
uh things that

3106
00:54:58,710 --> 00:54:58,720
uh things that
 

3107
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:00,870
uh things that
that correlate well with the uh with

3108
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:00,880
that correlate well with the uh with
 

3109
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,069
that correlate well with the uh with
experiments that are done on

3110
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:02,079
experiments that are done on
 

3111
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,309
experiments that are done on
consciousness uh

3112
00:55:04,309 --> 00:55:04,319
consciousness uh
 

3113
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,030
consciousness uh
and and and and he

3114

and and and and he
 

3115
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,030
and and and and he
he actually you know has a

3116
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:09,040
he actually you know has a
 

3117
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:12,710
he actually you know has a
a machine language that in which you can

3118
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:12,720
a machine language that in which you can
 

3119
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:13,910
a machine language that in which you can
you can write

3120
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:13,920
you can write
 

3121
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,750
you can write
code and

3122
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:15,760
code and
 

3123
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,750
code and
and test hypotheses

3124
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:17,760
and test hypotheses
 

3125
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:19,109
and test hypotheses
uh

3126
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:19,119
uh
 

3127
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,670
uh
and so it it might you know we might

3128
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:21,680
and so it it might you know we might
 

3129
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,589
and so it it might you know we might
have a big breakthrough my personal

3130
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:23,599
have a big breakthrough my personal
 

3131
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,109
have a big breakthrough my personal
feeling is that

3132
00:55:25,109 --> 00:55:25,119
feeling is that
 

3133
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,230
feeling is that
consciousness

3134
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:26,240
consciousness
 

3135
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:28,069
consciousness
the the best model

3136
00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:28,079
the the best model
 

3137
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,589
the the best model
i

3138
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:29,599
i
 

3139
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,470
i
i've heard of uh to explain the the

3140
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,480
i've heard of uh to explain the the
 

3141
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,430
i've heard of uh to explain the the
miracle of consciousness uh is

3142
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:35,440
miracle of consciousness uh is
 

3143
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,270
miracle of consciousness uh is
that that

3144
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:37,280
that that
 

3145
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,789
that that
that somehow

that somehow
 

3147
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:40,630
that somehow
inside of our

are all in there
 

3167
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,990
are all in there
and there's like a voting going on yeah

3168
00:55:57,990 --> 00:55:58,000
and there's like a voting going on yeah
 

3169

there was this book

3180
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:10,480
there was this book
 

3181
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:12,870
there was this book
machine intelligence or unintelligent on

3182
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:12,880
machine intelligence or unintelligent on
 

3183

atkinson uh was what was it what was a
 

3187
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,910
atkinson uh was what was it what was a
total

3188
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:19,920
total
 

3189
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,950
total
devotee of that book well i like

3190
00:56:22,950 --> 00:56:22,960
devotee of that book well i like
 

3191
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,190
devotee of that book well i like
whether it's consciousness or something

3192
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:25,200
whether it's consciousness or something
 

3193
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,510
whether it's consciousness or something
else i like the storytelling part that

3194
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:27,520
else i like the storytelling part that
 

3195
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,829
else i like the storytelling part that
we it feels like uh for us

3196
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:31,839
we it feels like uh for us
 

3197
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,630
we it feels like uh for us
humans it feels like there's a concrete

3198
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:34,640
humans it feels like there's a concrete
 

3199
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,549
humans it feels like there's a concrete
it's almost like literary programming i

3200
00:56:36,549 --> 00:56:36,559
it's almost like literary programming i
 

3201
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,069
it's almost like literary programming i
don't know what the programming going on

3202
00:56:38,069 --> 00:56:38,079
don't know what the programming going on
 

3203
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,510
don't know what the programming going on
on the inside but i'm getting a nice

3204
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:39,520
on the inside but i'm getting a nice
 

3205
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,950
on the inside but i'm getting a nice
story here about

3206
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
story here about
 

3207
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,510
story here about
what happened and it feels like i'm in

3208
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520
what happened and it feels like i'm in
 

3209
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,190
what happened and it feels like i'm in
control and i'm getting a nice clear

3210
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:45,200
control and i'm getting a nice clear
 

3211
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:47,750
control and i'm getting a nice clear
story so but it's also possible there's

3212
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:47,760
story so but it's also possible there's
 

3213
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,589
story so but it's also possible there's
a computation going on

3214
00:56:49,589 --> 00:56:49,599
a computation going on
 

3215
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:51,190
a computation going on
that's really messy there's a bunch of

3216
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:51,200
that's really messy there's a bunch of
 

3217
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,109
that's really messy there's a bunch of
different competing ideas

3218
00:56:53,109 --> 00:56:53,119
different competing ideas
 

3219
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:55,109
different competing ideas
and in the end it just kind of generates

3220
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:55,119
and in the end it just kind of generates
 

3221
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:57,510
and in the end it just kind of generates
a story for you to uh

3222
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:57,520
a story for you to uh
 

3223
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,069
a story for you to uh
a consistent story for you to believe

3224
00:57:00,069 --> 00:57:00,079
a consistent story for you to believe
 

3225
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,990
a consistent story for you to believe
and that makes it all nice yeah and so

3226
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:04,000
and that makes it all nice yeah and so
 

3227
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,430
and that makes it all nice yeah and so
i prefer to talk about things that i

3228
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:05,440
i prefer to talk about things that i
 

3229
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,470
i prefer to talk about things that i
have some expertise and then things for

3230
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:08,480
have some expertise and then things for
 

3231
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,829
have some expertise and then things for
which i which i'm only a

3232
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:10,839
which i which i'm only a
 

3233
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:12,630
which i which i'm only a
uh you know

3234
00:57:12,630 --> 00:57:12,640
uh you know
 

3235
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,549
uh you know
on the sideline

3236
00:57:14,549 --> 00:57:14,559
on the sideline
 

3237
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:16,710
on the sideline
so there's a tricky thing i don't know

3238
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:16,720
so there's a tricky thing i don't know
 

3239
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,789
so there's a tricky thing i don't know
if you have any expertise in this you

3240
00:57:18,789 --> 00:57:18,799
if you have any expertise in this you
 

3241
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,069
if you have any expertise in this you
might be a little bit on the sideline

3242
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:20,079
might be a little bit on the sideline
 

3243
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,829
might be a little bit on the sideline
it'd be interesting to ask though

3244
00:57:21,829 --> 00:57:21,839
it'd be interesting to ask though
 

3245
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:23,430
it'd be interesting to ask though
what are your thoughts on cellular

3246
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:23,440
what are your thoughts on cellular
 

3247
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,670
what are your thoughts on cellular
automata and the game of life

3248
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:25,680
automata and the game of life
 

3249
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:27,270
automata and the game of life
have you ever played with those kind of

3250
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:27,280
have you ever played with those kind of
 

3251
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,069
have you ever played with those kind of
little uh games i think uh the game of

3252
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
little uh games i think uh the game of
 

3253
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,390
little uh games i think uh the game of
life uh it is

3254
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
life uh it is
 

3255
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:35,030
life uh it is
it is wonderful and uh

it's sped up a lot

something that
known as the canoes bendix algorithm now

3474
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:35,680
known as the canoes bendix algorithm now
 

3475
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:36,789
known as the canoes bendix algorithm now
but but he

3476

01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,670
[Music]
before this conference but he never

3504
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:03,680
before this conference but he never
 

3505
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:06,230
before this conference but he never
published it and and he climaxed his

3506
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:06,240
published it and and he climaxed his
 

3507
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,390
published it and and he climaxed his
stock by

3508
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:08,400
stock by
 

3509
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,950
stock by
building some nozzle

3510
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:10,960
building some nozzle
 

3511
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:12,870
building some nozzle
you have these lit these little plastic

3512
01:02:12,870 --> 01:02:12,880
you have these lit these little plastic
 

3513
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:14,230
you have these lit these little plastic
things that you that you could stick

3514
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:14,240
things that you that you could stick
 

3515
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,190
things that you that you could stick
together

3516
01:02:15,190 --> 01:02:15,200
together
 

3517
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,510
together
uh it's it's it's

3518
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:17,520
uh it's it's it's
 

3519
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:21,029
uh it's it's it's
it's something like lego but easier

3520
01:02:21,029 --> 01:02:21,039
it's something like lego but easier
 

3521
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,349
it's something like lego but easier
and so he made a whole bunch of knots in

3522
01:02:23,349 --> 01:02:23,359
and so he made a whole bunch of knots in
 

3523
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:24,870
and so he made a whole bunch of knots in
front of the audience and so on and then

3524
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:24,880
front of the audience and so on and then
 

3525
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,630
front of the audience and so on and then
disassembled it

3526
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:26,640
disassembled it
 

3527
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,069
disassembled it
so it was

3528
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:28,079
so it was
 

3529
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:30,789
so it was
a dramatic lecture

3530
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:30,799
a dramatic lecture
 

3531
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:32,390
a dramatic lecture
before he had learned how to give even

3532
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:32,400
before he had learned how to give even
 

3533
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,470
before he had learned how to give even
more dramatic lectures later

3534
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:34,480
more dramatic lectures later
 

3535
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:35,349
more dramatic lectures later
so

3536
01:02:35,349 --> 01:02:35,359
so
 

3537
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:36,549
so
all right and

3538
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:36,559

would be a great
 

3615
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,230
would be a great
thing to teach students how to invent

01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:00,880
up conway's theory and and i i changed
 

3697

up conway's theory and and i i changed
the name to surreal numbers that so this

3698
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:03,200
the name to surreal numbers that so this
 

3699
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,150
the name to surreal numbers that so this
book is now published as surreal number

3700
01:05:06,150 --> 01:05:06,160
book is now published as surreal number
 

3701
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,270
book is now published as surreal number
and um and

3702
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:09,280
and um and
 

3703
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,870

in every way but the thing is i had lost
that i had lost that napkin in which you

3730
01:05:39,029 --> 01:05:39,039
that i had lost that napkin in which you
 

3731
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:41,910
that i had lost that napkin in which you
wrote the theory but but i i

3732
01:05:41,910 --> 01:05:41,920
wrote the theory but but i i
 

3733
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,510
wrote the theory but but i i
i looked for it but i couldn't find it

3734
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:43,520
i looked for it but i couldn't find it
 

3735
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:45,270
i looked for it but i couldn't find it
so i

3736
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:45,280
so i
 

3737
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,589
so i
tried to recreate from memory what he

3738
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:47,599
tried to recreate from memory what he
 

3739
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,950
tried to recreate from memory what he
told me at that luncheon uh in calgary

3740
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:50,960
told me at that luncheon uh in calgary
 

3741
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,309
told me at that luncheon uh in calgary
and and as i as i wrote the book i i was

3742
01:05:54,309 --> 01:05:54,319
and and as i as i wrote the book i i was
 

3743
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,230
and and as i as i wrote the book i i was
going through exactly what i what the

3744
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:56,240
going through exactly what i what the
 

3745
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:57,750
going through exactly what i what the
characters in the book were supposed to

3746
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:57,760
characters in the book were supposed to
 

3747
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:00,309
characters in the book were supposed to
be doing so i start with the

3748
01:06:00,309 --> 01:06:00,319
be doing so i start with the
 

3749
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,990
be doing so i start with the
with the two axioms that start out the

3750
01:06:01,990 --> 01:06:02,000
with the two axioms that start out the
 

3751
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,230
with the two axioms that start out the
whole thing and everything is defined it

3752
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:04,240
whole thing and everything is defined it
 

3753
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,990
whole thing and everything is defined it
flows from that but you have to discover

3754
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:06,000
flows from that but you have to discover
 

3755
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:06,950
flows from that but you have to discover
why

3756
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:06,960
why
 

3757
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,589
why
and and as a every mistake that i make

3758
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:09,599
and and as a every mistake that i make
 

3759
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,910
and and as a every mistake that i make
as i'm trying to discover it i uh my

3760
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:11,920
as i'm trying to discover it i uh my
 

3761
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,870
as i'm trying to discover it i uh my
characters make two right you know and

3762
01:06:14,870 --> 01:06:14,880
characters make two right you know and
 

3763
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,349
characters make two right you know and
and and so it was it's a long long story

3764
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:17,359
and and so it was it's a long long story
 

3765
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,190
and and so it was it's a long long story
and i but but i worked through this week

3766
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:19,200
and i but but i worked through this week
 

3767
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:20,470

the book

3820
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:15,520
the book
 

3821
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:17,589
the book
was typed they sent it to conway

3822
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:17,599
was typed they sent it to conway
 

3823
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,829
was typed they sent it to conway
and and he said well don you got the

3824
01:07:19,829 --> 01:07:19,839
and and he said well don you got the
 

3825
01:07:19,839 --> 01:07:23,829
and and he said well don you got the
axiom the one axiom wrong

3826
01:07:23,829 --> 01:07:23,839

 

3827
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,309

there is a difference between

3828
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:26,319
there is a difference between
 

3829
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:27,510
there is a difference between
um

3830
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:27,520
um
 

3831
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:29,910
um
less than or equal and not greater than

3832
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:29,920
less than or equal and not greater than
 

3833
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,430
less than or equal and not greater than
i don't know

3834
01:07:31,430 --> 01:07:31,440
i don't know
 

3835
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:34,390
i don't know
the opposite of being greater than yeah

3836
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:34,400
the opposite of being greater than yeah
 

3837
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:36,950
the opposite of being greater than yeah
and less than or equal but anyway

3838
01:07:36,950 --> 01:07:36,960
and less than or equal but anyway
 

3839
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,470
and less than or equal but anyway
technically it can make a difference

3840
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:38,480
technically it can make a difference
 

3841
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,390
technically it can make a difference
when you're developing a

3842
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:40,400
when you're developing a
 

3843
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:43,109
when you're developing a
logical theory and the way i had chosen

3844
01:07:43,109 --> 01:07:43,119
logical theory and the way i had chosen
 

3845
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,390
logical theory and the way i had chosen
was harder

3846
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:44,400
was harder
 

3847
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,710
was harder
to do than john's original

3848
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:46,720
to do than john's original
 

3849

uh then in the summer time i took
 

3885
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:26,070
uh then in the summer time i took
another week off and went to a

a place in in in
 

3889
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,550
a place in in in
the mountains of norway and and rewrote

3890
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:30,560
the mountains of norway and and rewrote
 

3891
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:31,590
the mountains of norway and and rewrote
the book

3892

01:09:29,269 --> 01:09:29,279
terms it's it's that the
 

3947
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:31,669
terms it's it's that the
that the set of all stable marriages it

3948
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:31,679
that the set of all stable marriages it
 

3949
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,669
that the set of all stable marriages it
forms a lattice

3950
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:33,679
forms a lattice
 

3951
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,590
forms a lattice
and and there was a simple way to find

3952
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:35,600
and and there was a simple way to find
 

3953
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,189
and and there was a simple way to find
the greatest lower bound

3954
01:09:37,189 --> 01:09:37,199
the greatest lower bound
 

3955
01:09:37,199 --> 01:09:39,030
the greatest lower bound
of of two stable

3956
01:09:39,030 --> 01:09:39,040
of of two stable
 

3957
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:40,229
of of two stable
pairings and

3958
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:40,239
pairings and
 

3959
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:41,749
pairings and
and least upper bound of two stable

3960
01:09:41,749 --> 01:09:41,759
and least upper bound of two stable
 

3961
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:43,510
and least upper bound of two stable
married and so i could use it in my

3962
01:09:43,510 --> 01:09:43,520
married and so i could use it in my
 

3963
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,910
married and so i could use it in my
lecture the next day and he came up with

3964
01:09:45,910 --> 01:09:45,920
lecture the next day and he came up with
 

3965
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,110
lecture the next day and he came up with
this theorem you know during the party

3966
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:49,120
this theorem you know during the party
 

3967
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,470
this theorem you know during the party
uh and it it

3968
01:09:50,470 --> 01:09:50,480
uh and it it
 

3969
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:51,749
uh and it it
it's a brilliant yeah it's a

3970
01:09:51,749 --> 01:09:51,759
it's a brilliant yeah it's a
 

3971
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:54,070
it's a brilliant yeah it's a
distributive lesson i mean it

3972
01:09:54,070 --> 01:09:54,080
distributive lesson i mean it
 

3973
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:55,910
distributive lesson i mean it
it's uh you know

3974
01:09:55,910 --> 01:09:55,920
it's uh you know
 

3975
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:59,030
it's uh you know
uh it it added greatly to the theory of

3976
01:09:59,030 --> 01:09:59,040
uh it it added greatly to the theory of
 

3977
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:01,510
uh it it added greatly to the theory of
of stable matching

3978
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:01,520
of stable matching
 

3979
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,830
of stable matching
so you mentioned your wife jill

3980
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:03,840
so you mentioned your wife jill
 

3981
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:06,149
so you mentioned your wife jill
you mentioned stable marriage

3982
01:10:06,149 --> 01:10:06,159
you mentioned stable marriage
 

3983
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:07,669
you mentioned stable marriage
can you tell the story of how you two

3984
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
can you tell the story of how you two
 

3985
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:08,790
can you tell the story of how you two
met

3986
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:08,800
met
 

3987
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,110
met
so we celebrated 60 years of wedded

3988
01:10:11,110 --> 01:10:11,120
so we celebrated 60 years of wedded
 

3989
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:11,910
so we celebrated 60 years of wedded
bliss

3990

with a computer science book all right i
 

4035
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,110
with a computer science book all right i
read the was it the manual that she was

4036
01:11:01,110 --> 01:11:01,120
read the was it the manual that she was
 

4037

manual that she had had she had to take
 

4041
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,229
manual that she had had she had to take
a class in computer science okay

4042
01:11:08,229 --> 01:11:08,239
a class in computer science okay
 

4043
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:11,110
a class in computer science okay
and and uh you're the tutor no no yeah

4044
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:11,120
and and uh you're the tutor no no yeah
 

4045

you know
 

4051
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,189
you know
trying to learn certain concepts but i

4052
01:11:21,189 --> 01:11:21,199
trying to learn certain concepts but i
 

4053
01:11:21,199 --> 01:11:23,669
trying to learn certain concepts but i
learned art from her

and so we we worked together
 

4057
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,070
and so we we worked together
you know occasionally in design

4058
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:28,080
you know occasionally in design
 

4059
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:29,350
you know occasionally in design
projects but

4060
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:29,360
projects but
 

4061
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,229
projects but
but every year we write a christmas card

4062
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:32,239
but every year we write a christmas card
 

4063
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,430
but every year we write a christmas card
and and we each have to

4064
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:35,440
and and we each have to
 

4065
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,110
and and we each have to
compromise our

4066
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:37,120
compromise our
 

4067
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,390
compromise our
our own

4068
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:38,400
our own
 

4069
01:11:38,400 --> 01:11:40,390
our own
notions of beauty yes

4070
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:40,400
notions of beauty yes
 

4071
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,390
notions of beauty yes
uh when did you

4072
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:42,400
uh when did you
 

4073

credentialism versus uh

4282
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:25,360
credentialism versus uh
 

4283
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,830
credentialism versus uh
inspirationalism

4284
01:15:27,830 --> 01:15:27,840
inspirationalism
 

4285
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,750
inspirationalism
i don't know if those are words but

4286
01:15:29,750 --> 01:15:29,760
i don't know if those are words but
 

4287
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,790
i don't know if those are words but
sort of uh yeah understanding versus

4288
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:32,800
sort of uh yeah understanding versus
 

4289
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,590
sort of uh yeah understanding versus
just giving a little um

4290
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:35,600
just giving a little um
 

4291
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,189
just giving a little um
it would be plaque

4292
01:15:37,189 --> 01:15:37,199
it would be plaque
 

4293
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,229
it would be plaque
and you know it's it's very much like

4294
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:40,239
and you know it's it's very much like
 

4295
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:41,669
and you know it's it's very much like
what we were talking about if you want

4296
01:15:41,669 --> 01:15:41,679
what we were talking about if you want
 

4297
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:43,910
what we were talking about if you want
the computer to

4298
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
the computer to
 

4299
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:45,350
the computer to
if you want to be able to believe the

4300
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:45,360
if you want to be able to believe the
 

4301
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:48,390
if you want to be able to believe the
answer computer is sure it's doing that

4302
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:48,400
answer computer is sure it's doing that
 

4303
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:49,590
answer computer is sure it's doing that
one of the things

4304
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:49,600
one of the things

01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,750
one of the things
bob floyd showed me in the 60s there was

4306
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:51,760
bob floyd showed me in the 60s there was
 

4307
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,189
bob floyd showed me in the 60s there was
a

a
 

4309
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:56,070
a
uh he loved this cartoon there was a

4310
01:15:56,070 --> 01:15:56,080
uh he loved this cartoon there was a
 

4311
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,189
uh he loved this cartoon there was a
there were two

4312
01:15:57,189 --> 01:15:57,199
there were two
 

4313
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,030
there were two
guys standing in front of

4314
01:15:59,030 --> 01:15:59,040
guys standing in front of
 

4315
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:00,470
guys standing in front of
in those days the computer was a big

4316
01:16:00,470 --> 01:16:00,480
in those days the computer was a big
 

4317
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:01,510
in those days the computer was a big
thing you know

4318
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:01,520
thing you know
 

4319
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:03,030
thing you know
and and the first guy says to the other

4320
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:03,040
and and the first guy says to the other
 

4321
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,149
and and the first guy says to the other
guy he said

4322
01:16:04,149 --> 01:16:04,159
guy he said
 

4323
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:05,590
guy he said
this machine

4324
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:05,600
this machine
 

4325
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,950
this machine
can do in one second what it would take

4326
01:16:08,950 --> 01:16:08,960
can do in one second what it would take
 

4327
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:11,110
can do in one second what it would take
uh a million people to do in a hundred

4328
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:11,120
uh a million people to do in a hundred
 

4329
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:12,070
uh a million people to do in a hundred
years

4330
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:12,080
years
 

4331
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:13,990
years
and the other guy says oh so how do you

4332
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:14,000
and the other guy says oh so how do you
 

4333
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:15,310
and the other guy says oh so how do you
know it's right

4334
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:15,320
know it's right
 

4335
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,830
know it's right
[Laughter]

4336
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:17,840
[Laughter]
 

4337
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,590
[Laughter]
that's a good line uh

4338
01:16:21,590 --> 01:16:21,600
that's a good line uh
 

4339
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,430
that's a good line uh
is there some interesting distinction

4340
01:16:23,430 --> 01:16:23,440
is there some interesting distinction
 

4341
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:26,149
is there some interesting distinction
between physics and math to you

4342
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:26,159
between physics and math to you
 

4343
01:16:26,159 --> 01:16:28,310
between physics and math to you
have you looked at physics much to like

4344
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:28,320
have you looked at physics much to like
 

4345
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,310
have you looked at physics much to like
speak university feynman

01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:30,320
speak university feynman
 

4347
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,590
speak university feynman
so

4348
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:31,600
so
 

4349
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:32,950
so
the difference between the physics

4350
01:16:32,950 --> 01:16:32,960
the difference between the physics
 

4351
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,790
the difference between the physics

do you see that as a gap are they

4362
01:16:43,030 --> 01:16:43,040
do you see that as a gap are they
 

4363
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:45,590
do you see that as a gap are they
strongly overlapping

4364
01:16:45,590 --> 01:16:45,600
strongly overlapping
 

4365
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:46,950
strongly overlapping
it's quite different

4366
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:46,960
it's quite different
 

4367
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:49,430
it's quite different
in my opinion i um i started as a

4368
01:16:49,430 --> 01:16:49,440
in my opinion i um i started as a
 

4369
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,790
in my opinion i um i started as a
physics major and i switched into math

4370
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:52,800
physics major and i switched into math
 

4371
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,950
physics major and i switched into math
and

4372
01:16:54,950 --> 01:16:54,960
and
 

4373
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,470
and
probably the reason was that i could i

4374
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
probably the reason was that i could i
 

4375
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:58,550
probably the reason was that i could i
could get a plus on the physics exam but

4376
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:58,560
could get a plus on the physics exam but
 

4377
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,830
could get a plus on the physics exam but
i like i never had any idea why i would

4378
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:01,840
i like i never had any idea why i would
 

4379
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,350
i like i never had any idea why i would
have been able to

4380
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:03,360
have been able to
 

4381
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:04,870
have been able to
come up with the problems that were on

4382
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:04,880
come up with the problems that were on
 

4383
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:06,709
come up with the problems that were on
those exams

4384
01:17:06,709 --> 01:17:06,719
those exams
 

4385
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:08,229
those exams
but but in math

4386
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:08,239
but but in math
 

4387
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,270
but but in math
i i i knew

4388
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:11,280
i i i knew
 

4389
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,189
i i i knew
you know why the teacher set those

4390
01:17:13,189 --> 01:17:13,199
you know why the teacher set those
 

4391
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:14,950
you know why the teacher set those
problems and i thought of other problems

4392
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:14,960
problems and i thought of other problems
 

4393
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,790
problems and i thought of other problems
that i could set too

4394
01:17:16,790 --> 01:17:16,800
that i could set too
 

4395
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,709
that i could set too
and i believe it's quite a different

4396
01:17:18,709 --> 01:17:18,719
and i believe it's quite a different
 

4397
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,510
and i believe it's quite a different
mentality

4398
01:17:21,510 --> 01:17:21,520

 

4399
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,229

is it it has to do with your philosophy

4400
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:24,239
is it it has to do with your philosophy
 

4401
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:27,669
is it it has to do with your philosophy
of geek geekdom

4402
01:17:27,669 --> 01:17:27,679

 

4403
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,630

i mean

4404
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
i mean
 

4405
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,630
i mean
some of my computer scientist friends

4406
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:30,640
some of my computer scientist friends
 

4407
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:32,310
some of my computer scientist friends
are really good at physics and others

4408
01:17:32,310 --> 01:17:32,320
are really good at physics and others
 

4409
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:35,270
are really good at physics and others
are not and and i i'm

4410
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:35,280
are not and and i i'm
 

4411
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:37,510
are not and and i i'm
uh you know i'm really good at algebra

4412
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:37,520
uh you know i'm really good at algebra
 

4413
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,830
uh you know i'm really good at algebra
but not at geometry you

4414
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:39,840
but not at geometry you
 

4415
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:40,870
but not at geometry you
talk about different parts of

4416
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:40,880
talk about different parts of
 

4417
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:43,189
talk about different parts of
mathematics you know i just it's

4418
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
mathematics you know i just it's
 

4419
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,870
mathematics you know i just it's
so they're different kind of physical

4420
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:44,880
so they're different kind of physical
 

4421
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:46,709
so they're different kind of physical
but physicists think of things in terms

4422
01:17:46,709 --> 01:17:46,719
but physicists think of things in terms
 

4423
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,910
but physicists think of things in terms
of waves

4424
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:47,920
of waves
 

4425
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:48,790
of waves
and

4426
01:17:48,790 --> 01:17:48,800
and
 

4427
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,709
and
i can think of

4428
01:17:50,709 --> 01:17:50,719
i can think of
 

4429
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,310
i can think of
things in terms of waves but it's like a

4430
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:52,320
things in terms of waves but it's like a
 

4431
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:54,229
things in terms of waves but it's like a
dog walking on hind legs if i'm thinking

4432
01:17:54,229 --> 01:17:54,239
dog walking on hind legs if i'm thinking
 

4433
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:56,870
dog walking on hind legs if i'm thinking
about it so you basically you like to

4434
01:17:56,870 --> 01:17:56,880
about it so you basically you like to
 

4435
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,590
about it so you basically you like to
see the world in in uh

4436
01:17:59,590 --> 01:17:59,600
see the world in in uh
 

4437
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:01,990
see the world in in uh
in discrete ways and then this is more

4438
01:18:01,990 --> 01:18:02,000
in discrete ways and then this is more
 

4439
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,870
in discrete ways and then this is more
continuous yeah i i i'm not sure

4440
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:04,880
continuous yeah i i i'm not sure
 

4441
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,950
continuous yeah i i i'm not sure
if turing would been a great physicist i

4442
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:08,960
if turing would been a great physicist i
 

4443
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:10,709
if turing would been a great physicist i
think it was a pretty good

4444
01:18:10,709 --> 01:18:10,719
think it was a pretty good
 

4445
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:12,310
think it was a pretty good
chemist

4446
01:18:12,310 --> 01:18:12,320
chemist
 

4447
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,790
chemist
i don't know but but uh but anyway i see

4448
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:14,800
i don't know but but uh but anyway i see
 

4449
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:15,910
i don't know but but uh but anyway i see
things

4450
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:15,920
things
 

4451
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:19,669
things
i i i believe that computer science is

4452
01:18:19,669 --> 01:18:19,679
i i i believe that computer science is
 

4453
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:21,590
i i i believe that computer science is
largely

4454
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:21,600
largely
 

4455
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:25,910
largely
driven by uh a people who have

4456
01:18:25,910 --> 01:18:25,920
driven by uh a people who have
 

4457
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:27,430
driven by uh a people who have
brains who work

4458
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:27,440
brains who work
 

4459
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:28,950
brains who work
who are good at

4460
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:28,960
who are good at
 

4461
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:30,470
who are good at
resonating with

4462
01:18:30,470 --> 01:18:30,480
resonating with
 

4463
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:32,310
resonating with
certain kind of

4464
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:32,320
certain kind of
 

4465
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,470
certain kind of
of of concepts

4466
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:34,480
of of concepts
 

4467
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:36,550
of of concepts
and like quantum computers it takes a

4468
01:18:36,550 --> 01:18:36,560
and like quantum computers it takes a
 

4469
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:37,830
and like quantum computers it takes a
different kind of brain yeah that's

4470
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
different kind of brain yeah that's
 

4471
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,350
different kind of brain yeah that's
interesting yeah

4472
01:18:39,350 --> 01:18:39,360
interesting yeah
 

4473
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,950
interesting yeah
it's it's well quantum computers is

4474
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:40,960
it's it's well quantum computers is
 

4475
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,030
it's it's well quantum computers is
almost like at the intersection in terms

4476
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:43,040
almost like at the intersection in terms
 

4477
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:44,630
almost like at the intersection in terms
of brain

4478
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:44,640
of brain
 

4479
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,990
of brain
uh between computer science and physics

4480
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:48,000
uh between computer science and physics
 

4481
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:49,830
uh between computer science and physics
because they it involves both at least

4482
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:49,840
because they it involves both at least
 

4483
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:53,110
because they it involves both at least
at this at this time

4484
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:53,120
at this at this time
 

4485
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,270
at this at this time
but there is like the physicists i've

4486
01:18:55,270 --> 01:18:55,280
but there is like the physicists i've
 

4487
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:56,149
but there is like the physicists i've
known

4488
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
known
 

4489
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,189
known
they have incredibly powerful intuition

4490
01:18:59,189 --> 01:18:59,199
they have incredibly powerful intuition
 

4491
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,350
they have incredibly powerful intuition
and and there's a lot i mean statistical

4492
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:01,360
and and there's a lot i mean statistical
 

4493
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:04,310
and and there's a lot i mean statistical
mechanics so i i study

4494
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:04,320
mechanics so i i study
 

4495
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,709
mechanics so i i study
uh statistical mechanics and

4496
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:06,719
uh statistical mechanics and
 

4497
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:08,470
uh statistical mechanics and
you know

4498
01:19:08,470 --> 01:19:08,480
you know
 

4499
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:11,270
you know
i mean random processes uh uh are

4500
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
i mean random processes uh uh are
 

4501
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,350
i mean random processes uh uh are
related to algorithms in a lot of a lot

4502
01:19:13,350 --> 01:19:13,360
related to algorithms in a lot of a lot
 

4503
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:15,350
related to algorithms in a lot of a lot
of ways and so but there's lots of

4504
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:15,360
of ways and so but there's lots of
 

4505
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,030
of ways and so but there's lots of
different flavors of flavors of physics

4506
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:17,040
different flavors of flavors of physics
 

4507
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,470
different flavors of flavors of physics
as there are different flavors of

4508
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:18,480
as there are different flavors of
 

4509
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,390
as there are different flavors of
mathematics as well

4510
01:19:20,390 --> 01:19:20,400
mathematics as well
 

4511
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,590
mathematics as well
um but but the thing is that i i don't

4512
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:23,600
um but but the thing is that i i don't
 

4513
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,110
um but but the thing is that i i don't
see

4514
01:19:25,110 --> 01:19:25,120
see
 

4515
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,630
see
well

4516
01:19:26,630 --> 01:19:26,640
well
 

4517
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:29,270
well
actually when they talk to physicists

4518
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:29,280
actually when they talk to physicists
 

4519
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:30,870
actually when they talk to physicists
use a completely different language than

4520
01:19:30,870 --> 01:19:30,880
use a completely different language than
 

4521
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,030
use a completely different language than
when they're talking to

4522
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:33,040
when they're talking to
 

4523
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,110
when they're talking to
when they're writing expository papers

4524
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:35,120
when they're writing expository papers
 

4525
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,110
when they're writing expository papers
so i didn't understand quantum mechanics

4526
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:37,120
so i didn't understand quantum mechanics
 

4527
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,790
so i didn't understand quantum mechanics
at all from reading about it in

4528
01:19:38,790 --> 01:19:38,800
at all from reading about it in
 

4529
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,390
at all from reading about it in
scientific american

4530
01:19:40,390 --> 01:19:40,400
scientific american
 

4531
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,149
scientific american
but but when i read

4532
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:42,159
but but when i read
 

4533
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:43,590
but but when i read
you know how they described it to each

4534
01:19:43,590 --> 01:19:43,600
you know how they described it to each
 

4535
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:45,510
you know how they described it to each
other talking about eigen eigenvalues

4536
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:45,520
other talking about eigen eigenvalues
 

4537
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:47,110
other talking about eigen eigenvalues
and

4538
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:47,120
and
 

4539
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:49,030
and
various mathematical

4540
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:49,040
various mathematical
 

4541
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,550
various mathematical
terms that

4542
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:50,560
terms that
 

4543
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,390
terms that
that made sense

4544
01:19:52,390 --> 01:19:52,400
that made sense
 

4545
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,470
that made sense
then it made sense to me

4546
01:19:54,470 --> 01:19:54,480
then it made sense to me
 

4547
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:57,430
then it made sense to me
but but hawking said that

4548
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:57,440
but but hawking said that
 

4549
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,189
but but hawking said that
every formula you put in a book you lose

4550
01:19:59,189 --> 01:19:59,199
every formula you put in a book you lose
 

4551
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:00,709
every formula you put in a book you lose
half of your readers and so he didn't

4552
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:00,719
half of your readers and so he didn't
 

4553
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:02,229
half of your readers and so he didn't
put any formulas into the book so i

4554
01:20:02,229 --> 01:20:02,239
put any formulas into the book so i
 

4555
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:05,189
put any formulas into the book so i
couldn't understand his book at all

4556
01:20:05,189 --> 01:20:05,199
couldn't understand his book at all
 

4557
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:07,270
couldn't understand his book at all
you could say you understood it but

4558
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:07,280
you could say you understood it but
 

4559
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:08,870
you could say you understood it but
i really

4560
01:20:08,870 --> 01:20:08,880
i really
 

4561
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:10,229
i really
i really didn't

4562
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:10,239
i really didn't
 

4563
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,390
i really didn't
um well feynman

4564
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:12,400
um well feynman
 

4565
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:15,910
um well feynman
also spoke in this way so feynman

4566
01:20:15,910 --> 01:20:15,920
also spoke in this way so feynman
 

4567
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:17,430
also spoke in this way so feynman
i think prided himself on a really

4568
01:20:17,430 --> 01:20:17,440
i think prided himself on a really
 

4569
01:20:17,440 --> 01:20:19,110
i think prided himself on a really
strong intuition but at the same time he

4570
01:20:19,110 --> 01:20:19,120
strong intuition but at the same time he
 

4571
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:22,149
strong intuition but at the same time he
was hiding all the the really good the

4572
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:22,159
was hiding all the the really good the
 

4573
01:20:22,159 --> 01:20:24,790
was hiding all the the really good the
the deep computation he was doing so so

4574
01:20:24,790 --> 01:20:24,800
the deep computation he was doing so so
 

4575
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,189
the deep computation he was doing so so
there was one thing that that uh

4576
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
there was one thing that that uh
 

4577
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,310
there was one thing that that uh
that i i was never able to uh yeah i

4578
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:30,320
that i i was never able to uh yeah i
 

4579
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,229
that i i was never able to uh yeah i
wish i had more time to to work out with

4580
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:32,239
wish i had more time to to work out with
 

4581
01:20:32,239 --> 01:20:33,030
wish i had more time to to work out with
him but

4582
01:20:33,030 --> 01:20:33,040
him but
 

4583
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,470
him but
i guess i could describe it for you

4584
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:34,480
i guess i could describe it for you
 

4585
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:36,229
i guess i could describe it for you
there's

4586
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:36,239
there's
 

4587
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:38,149
there's
there's something that got my name

4588
01:20:38,149 --> 01:20:38,159
there's something that got my name
 

4589
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:39,510
there's something that got my name
attached to it

4590
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:39,520
attached to it
 

4591
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,229
attached to it
called knuth arrow notation but

4592
01:20:42,229 --> 01:20:42,239
called knuth arrow notation but
 

4593
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:44,629
called knuth arrow notation but
it's a notation for very large numbers

4594
01:20:44,629 --> 01:20:44,639
it's a notation for very large numbers
 

4595
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,709
it's a notation for very large numbers
and so uh it i find out that that

4596
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:48,719
and so uh it i find out that that
 

4597
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:52,550
and so uh it i find out that that
somebody invented it in in 1830s

4598
01:20:52,550 --> 01:20:52,560
somebody invented it in in 1830s
 

4599
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,950
somebody invented it in in 1830s
it's fairly easy to

4600
01:20:54,950 --> 01:20:54,960
it's fairly easy to
 

4601
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,830
it's fairly easy to
to understand anyway so you start with

4602
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:57,840
to understand anyway so you start with
 

4603
01:20:57,840 --> 01:20:58,629
to understand anyway so you start with
x

4604
01:20:58,629 --> 01:20:58,639
x
 

4605
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:01,270
x
plus x plus x plus x

4606
01:21:01,270 --> 01:21:01,280
plus x plus x plus x
 

4607
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:02,629
plus x plus x plus x
n times

4608
01:21:02,629 --> 01:21:02,639
n times
 

4609
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:06,790
n times
and and you can call that x n

4610
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:06,800
and and you can call that x n
 

4611
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:09,189
and and you can call that x n
so x n is multiplication then you take x

4612
01:21:09,189 --> 01:21:09,199
so x n is multiplication then you take x
 

4613
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:10,470
so x n is multiplication then you take x
times x

4614
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:10,480
times x
 

4615
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,830
times x
times x times x and n time that gives

4616
01:21:12,830 --> 01:21:12,840
times x times x and n time that gives
 

4617
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:17,590
times x times x and n time that gives
you exponentiation x to the nth power

4618
01:21:17,590 --> 01:21:17,600
you exponentiation x to the nth power
 

4619
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,229
you exponentiation x to the nth power
so that's one arrow x

4620
01:21:20,229 --> 01:21:20,239
so that's one arrow x
 

4621
01:21:20,239 --> 01:21:22,790
so that's one arrow x
so x n with no arrows is multiplication

4622
01:21:22,790 --> 01:21:22,800
so x n with no arrows is multiplication
 

4623
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:23,510
so x n with no arrows is multiplication
x

4624
01:21:23,510 --> 01:21:23,520
x
 

4625
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:26,629
x
arrow n is x to the nth power yes just

4626
01:21:26,629 --> 01:21:26,639
arrow n is x to the nth power yes just
 

4627
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:28,950
arrow n is x to the nth power yes just
to clarify for the

4628
01:21:28,950 --> 01:21:28,960
to clarify for the
 

4629
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:29,990
to clarify for the
uh

4630
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,000
uh
 

4631
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,110
uh
so x times x times x n times is

4632
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:33,120
so x times x times x n times is
 

4633
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,350
so x times x times x n times is
obviously x n

4634
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:35,360
obviously x n
 

4635
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:36,390
obviously x n
and x

4636
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:36,400
and x
 

4637
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:39,270
and x
x plus x plus x n times

4638
01:21:39,270 --> 01:21:39,280
x plus x plus x n times
 

4639
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:42,229
x plus x plus x n times
oh yeah okay and then uh xn

4640
01:21:42,229 --> 01:21:42,239
oh yeah okay and then uh xn
 

4641
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:45,750
oh yeah okay and then uh xn
multiplication is x to the n uh and then

4642
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:45,760
multiplication is x to the n uh and then
 

4643
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:47,830
multiplication is x to the n uh and then
and then here the arrow is when you're

4644
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:47,840
and then here the arrow is when you're
 

4645
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,430
and then here the arrow is when you're
doing the same kind of repetitive

4646
01:21:49,430 --> 01:21:49,440
doing the same kind of repetitive
 

4647
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,990
doing the same kind of repetitive
operation for the exponential so i so i

4648
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:52,000
operation for the exponential so i so i
 

4649
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,149
operation for the exponential so i so i
put in one arrow and i get x to the nth

4650
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:54,159
put in one arrow and i get x to the nth
 

4651
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,709
put in one arrow and i get x to the nth
power now i put in two arrows and that

4652
01:21:56,709 --> 01:21:56,719
power now i put in two arrows and that
 

4653
01:21:56,719 --> 01:21:59,030
power now i put in two arrows and that
makes takes x to the x to the x to the x

4654
01:21:59,030 --> 01:21:59,040
makes takes x to the x to the x to the x
 

4655
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,070
makes takes x to the x to the x to the x
to the x

4656
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:00,080
to the x
 

4657
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,750
to the x
n times pi

4658
01:22:01,750 --> 01:22:01,760
n times pi
 

4659
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:03,910
n times pi
so in other words if

4660
01:22:03,910 --> 01:22:03,920
so in other words if
 

4661
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,590
so in other words if
if if it's two

4662
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:05,600
if if it's two
 

4663
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:06,310
if if it's two
uh

4664
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:06,320
uh
 

4665
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,750
uh
double arrow

4666
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:07,760
double arrow
 

4667
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,709
double arrow
uh three that would be

4668
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:10,719
uh three that would be
 

4669
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:13,270
uh three that would be
that would be 2 to the 2 to the 2

4670
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:13,280
that would be 2 to the 2 to the 2
 

4671
01:22:13,280 --> 01:22:14,709
that would be 2 to the 2 to the 2
so that would be 2 to the fourth power

4672
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:14,719
so that would be 2 to the fourth power
 

4673
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,310
so that would be 2 to the fourth power
that'd be 16 okay okay so so so that's

4674
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:18,320
that'd be 16 okay okay so so so that's
 

4675
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:19,590
that'd be 16 okay okay so so so that's
the double arrow

4676
01:22:19,590 --> 01:22:19,600
the double arrow
 

4677
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:21,189
the double arrow
and now you can

4678
01:22:21,189 --> 01:22:21,199
and now you can
 

4679
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:22,070
and now you can
do a

4680
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:22,080
do a
 

4681
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,590
do a
triple arrow

4682
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:23,600
triple arrow
 

4683
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:26,470
triple arrow
uh of course uh and

4684
01:22:26,470 --> 01:22:26,480
uh of course uh and
 

4685
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,070
uh of course uh and
and so on

4686
01:22:28,070 --> 01:22:28,080
and so on
 

4687
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:28,790
and so on
and

4688
01:22:28,790 --> 01:22:28,800
and
 

4689
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,149
and
and i i had this this paper called

4690
01:22:32,149 --> 01:22:32,159
and i i had this this paper called
 

4691
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:32,950
and i i had this this paper called
uh

4692
01:22:32,950 --> 01:22:32,960
uh
 

4693
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,070
uh
well

4694
01:22:34,070 --> 01:22:34,080
well
 

4695
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,990
well
essentially big numbers

4696
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:36,000
essentially big numbers
 

4697
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:36,950
essentially big numbers
uh

4698
01:22:36,950 --> 01:22:36,960
uh
 

4699
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,550
uh
you know you yeah you try to impress

4700
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:38,560
you know you yeah you try to impress
 

4701
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:40,149
you know you yeah you try to impress
your friend but by saying a number

4702
01:22:40,149 --> 01:22:40,159
your friend but by saying a number
 

4703
01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:42,550
your friend but by saying a number
they've never thought of before yeah and

4704
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:42,560
they've never thought of before yeah and
 

4705
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:43,510
they've never thought of before yeah and
and

4706
01:22:43,510 --> 01:22:43,520
and
 

4707
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:45,830
and
and i i gave a special name

4708
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:45,840
and i i gave a special name
 

4709
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:46,709
and i i gave a special name
for it

4710
01:22:46,709 --> 01:22:46,719
for it
 

4711
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:47,510
for it
we

4712
01:22:47,510 --> 01:22:47,520
we
 

4713
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:49,910
we
designed a font for it that has script k

4714
01:22:49,910 --> 01:22:49,920
designed a font for it that has script k
 

4715
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,030
designed a font for it that has script k
and so on but it but it really is 10

4716
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:53,040
and so on but it but it really is 10
 

4717
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:54,870
and so on but it but it really is 10
i think like 10

4718
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:54,880
i think like 10
 

4719
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:57,750
i think like 10
quadruple aero 3 or something like that

4720
01:22:57,750 --> 01:22:57,760
quadruple aero 3 or something like that
 

4721
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:59,910
quadruple aero 3 or something like that
and i claim that that number if it

4722
01:22:59,910 --> 01:22:59,920
and i claim that that number if it
 

4723
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:01,590
and i claim that that number if it
is so mind-boggling that you can't

4724
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:01,600
is so mind-boggling that you can't
 

4725
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:03,910
is so mind-boggling that you can't
comprehend how large it is

4726
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:03,920
comprehend how large it is
 

4727
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:05,590
comprehend how large it is
but anyway fine

4728
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:05,600
but anyway fine
 

4729
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,510
but anyway fine
i talked to feynman about this and he

4730
01:23:07,510 --> 01:23:07,520
i talked to feynman about this and he
 

4731
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,350
i talked to feynman about this and he
said oh

4732
01:23:09,350 --> 01:23:09,360
said oh
 

4733
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,990
said oh
let's just let's just use double arrow

4734
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:12,000
let's just let's just use double arrow
 

4735
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,229
let's just let's just use double arrow
but instead of taking integers let's

4736
01:23:14,229 --> 01:23:14,239
but instead of taking integers let's
 

4737
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:15,430
but instead of taking integers let's
consider

4738
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:15,440
consider
 

4739
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,669
consider
complex numbers right so

4740
01:23:17,669 --> 01:23:17,679
complex numbers right so
 

4741
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:22,310
complex numbers right so
you know you have

4742
01:23:22,310 --> 01:23:22,320

 

4743
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,110

that means x to the x

4744
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:25,120
that means x to the x
 

4745
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,350
that means x to the x
x but what about x

4746
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
x but what about x
 

4747
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:29,629
x but what about x
x double arrow two

4748
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:29,639
x double arrow two
 

4749
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:32,950
x double arrow two
2.5 well that's not too hard to figure

4750
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:32,960
2.5 well that's not too hard to figure
 

4751
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:35,110
2.5 well that's not too hard to figure
out that's interpolate between those but

4752
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:35,120
out that's interpolate between those but
 

4753
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,709
out that's interpolate between those but
what what what

4754
01:23:36,709 --> 01:23:36,719
what what what
 

4755
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:39,030
what what what
x double arrow

4756
01:23:39,030 --> 01:23:39,040
x double arrow
 

4757
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:42,149
x double arrow
i or one plus i or some complex number

4758
01:23:42,149 --> 01:23:42,159
i or one plus i or some complex number
 

4759
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:42,950
i or one plus i or some complex number
uh

4760
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:42,960
uh
 

4761
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,070
uh
and

4762
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:44,080
and
 

4763
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,270
and
and uh so he claimed that

4764
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:47,280
and uh so he claimed that
 

4765
01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,149
and uh so he claimed that
that that there was no analytic

4766
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:50,159
that that there was no analytic
 

4767
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,510
that that there was no analytic
function that would

4768
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:51,520
function that would
 

4769
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,629
function that would
that would do that would do the job uh

4770
01:23:54,629 --> 01:23:54,639
that would do that would do the job uh
 

4771
01:23:54,639 --> 01:23:57,910
that would do that would do the job uh
but i i i i didn't know how he could

4772
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:57,920
but i i i i didn't know how he could
 

4773
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:02,229
but i i i i didn't know how he could
claim that that was that wasn't true

4774
01:24:02,229 --> 01:24:02,239
claim that that was that wasn't true
 

4775
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:04,310
claim that that was that wasn't true
and his next question was did then have

4776
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:04,320
and his next question was did then have
 

4777
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,290
and his next question was did then have
a complex number of arrows

4778
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:06,300
a complex number of arrows
 

4779
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:09,430
a complex number of arrows
[Laughter]

4780
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:09,440
[Laughter]
 

4781
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:12,390
[Laughter]
yeah okay wow okay okay so so that's

4782
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:12,400
yeah okay wow okay okay so so that's
 

4783
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:14,830
yeah okay wow okay okay so so that's
that's fine uh that's

4784
01:24:14,830 --> 01:24:14,840
that's fine uh that's
 

4785
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,350
that's fine uh that's
fine can you describe what the

4786
01:24:17,350 --> 01:24:17,360
fine can you describe what the
 

4787
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,950
fine can you describe what the
[Music]

4788
01:24:18,950 --> 01:24:18,960
[Music]
 

4789
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:19,830
[Music]
uh

4790
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:19,840
uh
 

4791
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,629
uh
new morris pratt algorithm does

4792
01:24:22,629 --> 01:24:22,639
new morris pratt algorithm does
 

4793
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:24,790
new morris pratt algorithm does
and how did you come to develop it one

4794
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:24,800
and how did you come to develop it one
 

4795
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:27,270
and how did you come to develop it one
of the many things that you're known for

4796
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:27,280
of the many things that you're known for
 

4797
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,830
of the many things that you're known for
and has your name attached to it yeah

4798
01:24:29,830 --> 01:24:29,840
and has your name attached to it yeah
 

4799
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:31,270
and has your name attached to it yeah
all right so

4800
01:24:31,270 --> 01:24:31,280
all right so
 

4801
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:34,950
all right so
it should be actually morris pratt knuth

4802
01:24:34,950 --> 01:24:34,960
it should be actually morris pratt knuth
 

4803
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:37,030
it should be actually morris pratt knuth
but we decided to use alphabetical order

4804
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:37,040
but we decided to use alphabetical order
 

4805
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:39,189
but we decided to use alphabetical order
when we published the paper

4806
01:24:39,189 --> 01:24:39,199
when we published the paper
 

4807
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:40,709
when we published the paper
the problem is

4808
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:40,719
the problem is
 

4809
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:43,270
the problem is
uh something that everybody knows now if

4810
01:24:43,270 --> 01:24:43,280
uh something that everybody knows now if
 

4811
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,149
uh something that everybody knows now if
they're if they're using a search engine

4812
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:46,159
they're if they're using a search engine
 

4813
01:24:46,159 --> 01:24:48,070
they're if they're using a search engine
uh

4814
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:48,080
uh
 

4815
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,270
uh
you have a

4816
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:49,280
you have a
 

4817
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,070
you have a
a large collection of text

4818
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,080
a large collection of text
 

4819
01:24:52,080 --> 01:24:53,910
a large collection of text
and you want to know if

4820
01:24:53,910 --> 01:24:53,920
and you want to know if
 

4821
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,189
and you want to know if
if the word

4822
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:55,199
if the word
 

4823
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:57,270
if the word
canoeist appears anywhere in the text to

4824
01:24:57,270 --> 01:24:57,280
canoeist appears anywhere in the text to
 

4825
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:00,070
canoeist appears anywhere in the text to
say or or some

4826
01:25:00,070 --> 01:25:00,080
say or or some
 

4827
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:01,910
say or or some
some other word that's less interesting

4828
01:25:01,910 --> 01:25:01,920
some other word that's less interesting
 

4829
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:02,950
some other word that's less interesting
than

4830
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:02,960
than
 

4831
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:04,790
than
but anyway that's the most interesting

4832
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:04,800
but anyway that's the most interesting
 

4833
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:05,590
but anyway that's the most interesting
thing

4834
01:25:05,590 --> 01:25:05,600
thing
 

4835
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:07,510
thing
or something mega morris right

4836
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:07,520
or something mega morris right
 

4837
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,229
or something mega morris right
so we have we have

4838
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:09,239
so we have we have
 

4839
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:13,350
so we have we have
a large piece of text and it it's all

4840
01:25:13,350 --> 01:25:13,360
a large piece of text and it it's all
 

4841
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:16,310
a large piece of text and it it's all
one long one-dimensional thing you know

4842
01:25:16,310 --> 01:25:16,320
one long one-dimensional thing you know
 

4843
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,990
one long one-dimensional thing you know
first or second letter

4844
01:25:17,990 --> 01:25:18,000
first or second letter
 

4845
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,270
first or second letter
et cetera et cetera et cetera and so uh

4846
01:25:21,270 --> 01:25:21,280
et cetera et cetera et cetera and so uh
 

4847
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,510
et cetera et cetera et cetera and so uh
the question you would like to be able

4848
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:23,520
the question you would like to be able
 

4849
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,750
the question you would like to be able
to do this

4850
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:25,760
to do this
 

4851
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,110
to do this
um

4852
01:25:27,110 --> 01:25:27,120
um
 

4853
01:25:27,120 --> 01:25:29,270
um
and the obvious way is that let's say

4854
01:25:29,270 --> 01:25:29,280
and the obvious way is that let's say
 

4855
01:25:29,280 --> 01:25:31,830
and the obvious way is that let's say
we're looking for morris they don't know

4856
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:31,840
we're looking for morris they don't know
 

4857
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:34,709
we're looking for morris they don't know
that so we would we would go through and

4858
01:25:34,709 --> 01:25:34,719
that so we would we would go through and
 

4859
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:36,709
that so we would we would go through and
wait till we get to letter m then we

4860
01:25:36,709 --> 01:25:36,719
wait till we get to letter m then we
 

4861
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:38,709
wait till we get to letter m then we
look at the next word and sure enough

4862
01:25:38,709 --> 01:25:38,719
look at the next word and sure enough
 

4863
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:42,229
look at the next word and sure enough
it's an o and then an r but then that oh

4864
01:25:42,229 --> 01:25:42,239
it's an o and then an r but then that oh
 

4865
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,350
it's an o and then an r but then that oh
too bad

4866
01:25:43,350 --> 01:25:43,360
too bad
 

4867
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,550
too bad
um

4868
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:44,560
um
 

4869
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,750
um
yeah the next letter is is e

4870
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:47,760
yeah the next letter is is e
 

4871
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,870
yeah the next letter is is e
so we missed we missed out on morris

4872
01:25:50,870 --> 01:25:50,880
so we missed we missed out on morris
 

4873
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,550
so we missed we missed out on morris
and so

4874
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:52,560
and so
 

4875
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:55,110
and so
we go back and start looking for another

4876
01:25:55,110 --> 01:25:55,120
we go back and start looking for another
 

4877
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:56,550
we go back and start looking for another
okay all over again so that's the

4878
01:25:56,550 --> 01:25:56,560
okay all over again so that's the
 

4879
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:58,229
okay all over again so that's the
obvious way to do it

4880
01:25:58,229 --> 01:25:58,239
obvious way to do it
 

4881
01:25:58,239 --> 01:25:59,350
obvious way to do it
all right

4882
01:25:59,350 --> 01:25:59,360
all right
 

4883
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:00,229
all right
um

4884
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:00,239
um
 

4885
01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:03,110
um
and and jim morris noticed

4886
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:03,120
and and jim morris noticed
 

4887
01:26:03,120 --> 01:26:05,830
and and jim morris noticed
there was a more clever way

4888
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:05,840
there was a more clever way
 

4889
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:07,189
there was a more clever way
to do it

4890
01:26:07,189 --> 01:26:07,199
to do it
 

4891
01:26:07,199 --> 01:26:09,350
to do it
the obvious way would have started

4892
01:26:09,350 --> 01:26:09,360
the obvious way would have started
 

4893
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,629
the obvious way would have started
let's say

4894
01:26:10,629 --> 01:26:10,639
let's say
 

4895
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:12,310
let's say
you know we found that let letter m at

4896
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:12,320
you know we found that let letter m at
 

4897
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:14,390
you know we found that let letter m at
character position one thousand

4898
01:26:14,390 --> 01:26:14,400
character position one thousand
 

4899
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,950
character position one thousand
so it was started next at character

4900
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:16,960
so it was started next at character
 

4901
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,570
so it was started next at character
position 1001

4902
01:26:18,570 --> 01:26:18,580
position 1001
 

4903
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:19,830
position 1001
[Music]

4904
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:19,840
[Music]
 

4905
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:20,709
[Music]
but

4906
01:26:20,709 --> 01:26:20,719
but
 

4907
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,430
but
but he but he said no look we we already

4908
01:26:23,430 --> 01:26:23,440
but he but he said no look we we already
 

4909
01:26:23,440 --> 01:26:25,430
but he but he said no look we we already
read the o and the r

4910
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:25,440
read the o and the r
 

4911
01:26:25,440 --> 01:26:27,910
read the o and the r
and we know that they aren't m's

4912
01:26:27,910 --> 01:26:27,920
and we know that they aren't m's
 

4913
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:30,629
and we know that they aren't m's
so we could we could start

4914
01:26:30,629 --> 01:26:30,639
so we could we could start
 

4915
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:33,270
so we could we could start
we don't have to read those over again

4916
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:33,280
we don't have to read those over again
 

4917
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,189
we don't have to read those over again
all right so uh

4918
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:35,199
all right so uh
 

4919
01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:37,430
all right so uh
and this gets pretty tricky when

4920
01:26:37,430 --> 01:26:37,440
and this gets pretty tricky when
 

4921
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,990
and this gets pretty tricky when
when the word isn't morris but it's more

4922
01:26:39,990 --> 01:26:40,000
when the word isn't morris but it's more
 

4923
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,030
when the word isn't morris but it's more
like

4924
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:41,040
like
 

4925
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,510
like
abracadabra where you have patterns that

4926
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:43,520
abracadabra where you have patterns that
 

4927
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:45,910
abracadabra where you have patterns that
are occurring uh

4928
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:45,920
are occurring uh
 

4929
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,750
are occurring uh
like repeating patterns

4930
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:47,760
like repeating patterns
 

4931
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:49,189
like repeating patterns
at the beginning at the middle right

4932
01:26:49,189 --> 01:26:49,199
at the beginning at the middle right
 

4933
01:26:49,199 --> 01:26:52,470
at the beginning at the middle right
right so so um

4934
01:26:52,470 --> 01:26:52,480
right so so um
 

4935
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:54,070
right so so um
he worked it out

4936
01:26:54,070 --> 01:26:54,080
he worked it out
 

4937
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:56,149
he worked it out
and he put it into the system software

4938
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:56,159
and he put it into the system software
 

4939
01:26:56,159 --> 01:26:58,950
and he put it into the system software
at berkeley i think it was where he was

4940
01:26:58,950 --> 01:26:58,960
at berkeley i think it was where he was
 

4941
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,030
at berkeley i think it was where he was
he was writing some berkeley unix i

4942
01:27:01,030 --> 01:27:01,040
he was writing some berkeley unix i
 

4943
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:03,669
he was writing some berkeley unix i
think was some routine i was supposed to

4944
01:27:03,669 --> 01:27:03,679
think was some routine i was supposed to
 

4945
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:05,910
think was some routine i was supposed to
find occurrences of patterns in texas

4946
01:27:05,910 --> 01:27:05,920
find occurrences of patterns in texas
 

4947
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,149
find occurrences of patterns in texas
and

4948
01:27:08,149 --> 01:27:08,159

 

4949
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:10,470

and

4950
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:10,480

 

4951
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:12,229

we didn't explain it

4952
01:27:12,229 --> 01:27:12,239
we didn't explain it
 

4953
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,390
we didn't explain it
and and so he found out that several

4954
01:27:14,390 --> 01:27:14,400
and and so he found out that several
 

4955
01:27:14,400 --> 01:27:16,950
and and so he found out that several
months later somebody had

4956
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:16,960
months later somebody had
 

4957
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:18,310
months later somebody had
had looked at it didn't look right and

4958
01:27:18,310 --> 01:27:18,320
had looked at it didn't look right and
 

4959
01:27:18,320 --> 01:27:20,470
had looked at it didn't look right and
so they ripped it out

4960
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:20,480
so they ripped it out
 

4961
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:22,229
so they ripped it out
so he had this this algorithm but it

4962
01:27:22,229 --> 01:27:22,239
so he had this this algorithm but it
 

4963
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:24,390
so he had this this algorithm but it
didn't make it through

4964
01:27:24,390 --> 01:27:24,400
didn't make it through
 

4965
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:25,990
didn't make it through
you know because he what wasn't

4966
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:26,000

nobody knew about this particularly

4970
01:27:30,390 --> 01:27:30,400
nobody knew about this particularly
 

4971
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:34,390
nobody knew about this particularly
von pratt also had independently

discovered it a year or two later

4974
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:38,320

cook was a professor at berkeley uh
 

4999
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,430
cook was a professor at berkeley uh
and uh

5000
01:28:05,430 --> 01:28:05,440
and uh
 

5001
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:06,310

uh
 

5003
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,430
uh
it was the

5004
01:28:07,430 --> 01:28:07,440
it was the
 

5005
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:09,510
it was the
greatest mistake that

5006
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:09,520
greatest mistake that
 

5007
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:11,510

berkeley cs department made was not to

5008
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:11,520
berkeley cs department made was not to
 

5009
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,870
berkeley cs department made was not to
give him tenure

5010
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:12,880
give him tenure
 

5011
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:14,629
give him tenure
and so steve went to

5012
01:28:14,629 --> 01:28:14,639
and so steve went to
 

5013
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:18,229
and so steve went to
went to toronto but um but i but i knew

01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,950
steve while he was at berkeley
and he had come up with a

5018
01:28:22,950 --> 01:28:22,960
and he had come up with a
 

5019
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:25,189
and he had come up with a

something on
 

5039
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:42,870
something on
at the top of a stack or it can put more

5040
01:28:42,870 --> 01:28:42,880
at the top of a stack or it can put more
 

5041
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:44,790
at the top of a stack or it can put more
things on the stack or or it can take

5042
01:28:44,790 --> 01:28:44,800
things on the stack or or it can take
 

5043
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,310
things on the stack or or it can take
things off the stack

5044
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:46,320
things off the stack
 

5045
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:49,590
things off the stack
like it can't remember a long string of

5046
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:49,600
like it can't remember a long string of
 

5047
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,910
like it can't remember a long string of
symbols but but it can remember them in

5048
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:51,920
symbols but but it can remember them in
 

5049
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:54,390
symbols but but it can remember them in
reverse order so so if you tell a stack

5050
01:28:54,390 --> 01:28:54,400
reverse order so so if you tell a stack
 

5051
01:28:54,400 --> 01:28:58,149
reverse order so so if you tell a stack
of thomas on

5052

5053
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:02,149

it can tell you afterwards edcba

01:29:02,149 --> 01:29:02,159
it can tell you afterwards edcba
 

5055
01:29:02,159 --> 01:29:03,350
it can tell you afterwards edcba
you know it doesn't have any other

but but but somehow the fact that it can
 

5099
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:53,350
but but but somehow the fact that it can
do it at all

5100
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:53,360
do it at all
 

5101
01:29:53,360 --> 01:29:55,590
do it at all
means that there has to be a fast way

5102
01:29:55,590 --> 01:29:55,600
means that there has to be a fast way
 

5103
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,590
means that there has to be a fast way
so i thought this was a pretty

5104
01:29:57,590 --> 01:29:57,600
so i thought this was a pretty
 

5105
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:59,750
so i thought this was a pretty
you know cool theorem

5106
01:29:59,750 --> 01:29:59,760
you know cool theorem
 

5107
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,990
you know cool theorem
and so i tried it out on

5108
01:30:01,990 --> 01:30:02,000
and so i tried it out on
 

5109
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,910
and so i tried it out on
on a problem

5110
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:03,920
on a problem
 

5111
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:05,590
on a problem
where i knew

5112
01:30:05,590 --> 01:30:05,600
where i knew
 

5113
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,310
where i knew
a stack automaton could do it

5114
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:08,320
a stack automaton could do it
 

5115
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,390
a stack automaton could do it
but i couldn't figure out a fast way to

5116
01:30:10,390 --> 01:30:10,400
but i couldn't figure out a fast way to
 

5117
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:12,310
but i couldn't figure out a fast way to
do it on a regular computer i thought i

5118
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:12,320
do it on a regular computer i thought i
 

5119
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,149
do it on a regular computer i thought i
was a pretty good programmer

5120
01:30:14,149 --> 01:30:14,159
was a pretty good programmer
 

5121
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:15,110
was a pretty good programmer
but

5122
01:30:15,110 --> 01:30:15,120
but
 

5123
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:16,629
but
but by golly

5124
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:16,639
but by golly
 

5125
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,790
but by golly
i couldn't think of any way to recognize

5126
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:18,800
i couldn't think of any way to recognize
 

5127
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:21,189
i couldn't think of any way to recognize
this language

5128
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:21,199
this language
 

5129
01:30:21,199 --> 01:30:22,950
this language
efficiently

5130
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:22,960
efficiently
 

5131
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,550
efficiently
so i went through steve cook's

5132
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:24,560
so i went through steve cook's
 

5133
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:26,070
so i went through steve cook's
construction

5134
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,080
construction
 

5135
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:27,830
construction
i filled my blackboard

5136
01:30:27,830 --> 01:30:27,840
i filled my blackboard
 

5137
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:29,430
i filled my blackboard
with all the

5138
01:30:29,430 --> 01:30:29,440
with all the
 

5139
01:30:29,440 --> 01:30:32,070
with all the
everything that stack thomas undone

5140
01:30:32,070 --> 01:30:32,080
everything that stack thomas undone
 

5141
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,030
everything that stack thomas undone
did you know i i i wrote down and and

5142
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:35,040
did you know i i i wrote down and and
 

5143
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:36,470
did you know i i i wrote down and and
then i tried to

5144
01:30:36,470 --> 01:30:36,480
then i tried to
 

5145
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:38,629
then i tried to
see patterns in that

5146
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:38,639
see patterns in that
 

5147
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,070
see patterns in that
and

5148
01:30:40,070 --> 01:30:40,080
and
 

5149
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:41,750
and
and how did he convert that into a

5150
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:41,760
and how did he convert that into a
 

5151
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,629
and how did he convert that into a
computer program on a regular machine

5152
01:30:44,629 --> 01:30:44,639
computer program on a regular machine
 

5153
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:46,229
computer program on a regular machine
um and

5154
01:30:46,229 --> 01:30:46,239
um and
 

5155
01:30:46,239 --> 01:30:49,110
um and
finally i psyched it out

5156
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,120
finally i psyched it out
 

5157
01:30:49,120 --> 01:30:50,790
finally i psyched it out
what was what was the thing i was

5158
01:30:50,790 --> 01:30:50,800
what was what was the thing i was
 

5159
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,790
what was what was the thing i was
missing so that i could

5160
01:30:52,790 --> 01:30:52,800
missing so that i could
 

5161
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:54,470
missing so that i could
say oh yeah this is what i should do in

5162
01:30:54,470 --> 01:30:54,480
say oh yeah this is what i should do in
 

5163
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,669
say oh yeah this is what i should do in
my program

5164
01:30:55,669 --> 01:30:55,679
my program
 

5165
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:56,629
my program
uh

5166
01:30:56,629 --> 01:30:56,639
uh
 

5167
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,629
uh
and now i have an efficient program

5168
01:30:58,629 --> 01:30:58,639
and now i have an efficient program
 

5169
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,830
and now i have an efficient program
and and so i

5170
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:00,840
and and so i
 

5171
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:04,629
and and so i
uh i i would never have thought about

5172
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:04,639
uh i i would never have thought about
 

5173
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:05,669
uh i i would never have thought about
like

5174
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:05,679
like
 

5175
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:07,830
like
that if i hadn't had his theorem which

5176
01:31:07,830 --> 01:31:07,840
that if i hadn't had his theorem which
 

5177
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,990
that if i hadn't had his theorem which
was purely abstract thing

5178
01:31:09,990 --> 01:31:10,000
was purely abstract thing
 

5179
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,990
was purely abstract thing
actually

5180
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:12,000
actually
 

5181
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,990
actually
to try to intuit how to use the stack

5182
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:14,000
to try to intuit how to use the stack
 

5183
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,149
to try to intuit how to use the stack
automaton for the the string matching

5184
01:31:16,149 --> 01:31:16,159
automaton for the the string matching
 

5185
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:20,070
automaton for the the string matching
problem yeah so so so the problem i

5186
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:20,080
problem yeah so so so the problem i
 

5187
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:21,510
problem yeah so so so the problem i
i had

5188
01:31:21,510 --> 01:31:21,520
i had
 

5189
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:23,430
i had
started with was not the string matching

5190
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:23,440
started with was not the string matching
 

5191
01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,030
started with was not the string matching
part but then i realized that the string

5192
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:25,040
part but then i realized that the string
 

5193
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:26,950
part but then i realized that the string
matching problem was another thing which

5194
01:31:26,950 --> 01:31:26,960
matching problem was another thing which
 

5195
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:28,229
matching problem was another thing which
would also be

5196
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:28,239
would also be
 

5197
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,310
would also be
could be done by a stack of automatons

5198
01:31:30,310 --> 01:31:30,320
could be done by a stack of automatons
 

5199
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:32,790
could be done by a stack of automatons
and and so when when i looked at what

5200
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:32,800
and and so when when i looked at what
 

5201
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:35,669
and and so when when i looked at what
that told me then i had a nice algorithm

5202
01:31:35,669 --> 01:31:35,679
that told me then i had a nice algorithm
 

5203
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:36,550
that told me then i had a nice algorithm
for this

5204
01:31:36,550 --> 01:31:36,560
for this
 

5205
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:38,950
for this
string matching problem uh

5206
01:31:38,950 --> 01:31:38,960
string matching problem uh
 

5207
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:41,270
string matching problem uh
and and it told me

5208
01:31:41,270 --> 01:31:41,280
and and it told me
 

5209
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:43,590
and and it told me
exactly what i should remember as i'm as

5210
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:43,600
exactly what i should remember as i'm as
 

5211
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,590
exactly what i should remember as i'm as
i'm going through the string

5212
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:45,600
i'm going through the string
 

5213
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,590
i'm going through the string
and i worked it out and and i wrote this

5214
01:31:47,590 --> 01:31:47,600
and i worked it out and and i wrote this
 

5215
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,110
and i worked it out and and i wrote this
little paper called

5216
01:31:49,110 --> 01:31:49,120
little paper called
 

5217
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:52,229
little paper called
automata theory can be useful

5218
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:52,239
automata theory can be useful
 

5219
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,229
automata theory can be useful
and and the reason was that it was first

5220
01:31:54,229 --> 01:31:54,239
and and the reason was that it was first
 

5221
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:56,070
and and the reason was that it was first
i mean i had been reading all kinds of

5222
01:31:56,070 --> 01:31:56,080
i mean i had been reading all kinds of
 

5223
01:31:56,080 --> 01:31:59,030
i mean i had been reading all kinds of
papers about automated theory

5224
01:31:59,030 --> 01:31:59,040
papers about automated theory
 

5225
01:31:59,040 --> 01:32:01,430
papers about automated theory
but it never taught me it never improved

5226
01:32:01,430 --> 01:32:01,440
but it never taught me it never improved
 

5227
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:04,310
but it never taught me it never improved
my programming for for everyday problems

5228
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:04,320
my programming for for everyday problems
 

5229
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,229
my programming for for everyday problems
uh it was something that you published

5230
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:06,239
uh it was something that you published
 

5231
01:32:06,239 --> 01:32:08,229
uh it was something that you published
in journals and and and you know it was

5232
01:32:08,229 --> 01:32:08,239
in journals and and and you know it was
 

5233
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:11,430
in journals and and and you know it was
it was interesting stuff but it but here

5234
01:32:11,430 --> 01:32:11,440
it was interesting stuff but it but here
 

5235
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:13,270
it was interesting stuff but it but here
was a case where i couldn't figure out

5236
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:13,280
was a case where i couldn't figure out
 

5237
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:15,510
was a case where i couldn't figure out
how to write the program i had a theorem

5238
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:15,520
how to write the program i had a theorem
 

5239
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:17,669
how to write the program i had a theorem
from automated theory then i knew how to

5240
01:32:17,669 --> 01:32:17,679
from automated theory then i knew how to
 

5241
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:20,790
from automated theory then i knew how to
write the program so this was

5242
01:32:20,790 --> 01:32:20,800
write the program so this was
 

5243
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:21,830
write the program so this was
for me

5244
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:21,840
for me
 

5245
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:22,950
for me
uh

5246
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:22,960
uh
 

5247
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:24,870
uh
you know a change in life i started to

5248
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:24,880
you know a change in life i started to
 

5249
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,709
you know a change in life i started to
say maybe i should

5250
01:32:26,709 --> 01:32:26,719
say maybe i should
 

5251
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:28,550
say maybe i should
learn more about thomas

5252
01:32:28,550 --> 01:32:28,560
learn more about thomas
 

5253
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:29,430
learn more about thomas
and

5254
01:32:29,430 --> 01:32:29,440
and
 

5255
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,910
and
and and and i i showed this note to

5256
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:31,920
and and and i i showed this note to
 

5257
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:33,750
and and and i i showed this note to
vaughn pratt and he said

5258
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:33,760
vaughn pratt and he said
 

5259
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:34,550
vaughn pratt and he said
that's

5260
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:34,560
that's
 

5261
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,030
that's
similar to something i was working on

5262
01:32:37,030 --> 01:32:37,040
similar to something i was working on
 

5263
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,590
similar to something i was working on
um and then uh

5264
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:39,600
um and then uh
 

5265
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,070
um and then uh
and jim morris was at berkeley too at

5266
01:32:42,070 --> 01:32:42,080
and jim morris was at berkeley too at
 

5267
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,669
and jim morris was at berkeley too at
the time

5268
01:32:43,669 --> 01:32:43,679
the time
 

5269
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:45,270
the time
anyway he

5270
01:32:45,270 --> 01:32:45,280
anyway he
 

5271
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:47,110
anyway he
he he's had an illustrious career but i

5272
01:32:47,110 --> 01:32:47,120
he he's had an illustrious career but i
 

5273
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:48,229
he he's had an illustrious career but i
haven't kept

5274
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:48,239
haven't kept
 

5275
01:32:48,239 --> 01:32:50,470
haven't kept
track of jim but one is my colleague at

5276
01:32:50,470 --> 01:32:50,480
track of jim but one is my colleague at
 

5277
01:32:50,480 --> 01:32:51,669
track of jim but one is my colleague at
stanford

5278
01:32:51,669 --> 01:32:51,679
stanford
 

5279
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:53,189
stanford
and my student

5280
01:32:53,189 --> 01:32:53,199
and my student
 

5281
01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:57,030
and my student
uh later but but this was before vaughn

5282
01:32:57,030 --> 01:32:57,040
uh later but but this was before vaughn
 

5283
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:59,030
uh later but but this was before vaughn
ron was still a graduate student and

5284
01:32:59,030 --> 01:32:59,040
ron was still a graduate student and
 

5285
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:01,110
ron was still a graduate student and
hadn't come to stanford yet so we found

5286
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,120
hadn't come to stanford yet so we found
 

5287
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:02,390
hadn't come to stanford yet so we found
out that we'd all been working on the

5288
01:33:02,390 --> 01:33:02,400
out that we'd all been working on the
 

5289
01:33:02,400 --> 01:33:04,950
out that we'd all been working on the
same thing so so it was our algorithm we

5290
01:33:04,950 --> 01:33:04,960
same thing so so it was our algorithm we
 

5291
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:06,629
same thing so so it was our algorithm we
each discovered it independently but

5292
01:33:06,629 --> 01:33:06,639
each discovered it independently but
 

5293
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:09,189
each discovered it independently but
each of us had discovered a different

5294
01:33:09,189 --> 01:33:09,199
each of us had discovered a different
 

5295
01:33:09,199 --> 01:33:12,470
each of us had discovered a different
a different part of the elephant

5296
01:33:12,470 --> 01:33:12,480
a different part of the elephant
 

5297
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:13,910
a different part of the elephant
you know a different

5298
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:13,920
you know a different
 

5299
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:16,149
you know a different
aspect of it and so we could put our

5300
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:16,159
aspect of it and so we could put our
 

5301
01:33:16,159 --> 01:33:17,030
aspect of it and so we could put our
our

5302
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:17,040
our
 

5303
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:19,189
our
our things together it was my job to

5304
01:33:19,189 --> 01:33:19,199
our things together it was my job to
 

5305
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,870
our things together it was my job to
write the paper

5306
01:33:20,870 --> 01:33:20,880
write the paper
 

5307
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:23,510
write the paper
how did the elephants bring to life

5308
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:23,520
how did the elephants bring to life
 

5309
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:26,149
how did the elephants bring to life
spring to life was because i

5310
01:33:26,149 --> 01:33:26,159
spring to life was because i
 

5311
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,550
spring to life was because i
i had drafted this paper

5312
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:28,560
i had drafted this paper
 

5313
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:30,390
i had drafted this paper
autonomous theory

5314
01:33:30,390 --> 01:33:30,400
autonomous theory
 

5315
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,790
autonomous theory
oh it can be useful which was seen by

5316
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:32,800
oh it can be useful which was seen by
 

5317
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,030
oh it can be useful which was seen by
vaughn and then by jim and then then

5318
01:33:35,030 --> 01:33:35,040
vaughn and then by jim and then then
 

5319
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,390
vaughn and then by jim and then then
then we combined

5320
01:33:36,390 --> 01:33:36,400
then we combined
 

5321
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,790
then we combined
because maybe they had also

5322
01:33:38,790 --> 01:33:38,800
because maybe they had also
 

5323
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,149
because maybe they had also
been thinking of writing something up

5324
01:33:40,149 --> 01:33:40,159
been thinking of writing something up
 

5325
01:33:40,159 --> 01:33:43,990
been thinking of writing something up
about it about specifically history

5326
01:33:43,990 --> 01:33:44,000
about it about specifically history
 

5327
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:48,470
about it about specifically history
problem

5328
01:33:48,470 --> 01:33:48,480

 

5329
01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:51,110

let me ask a ridiculous question

5330
01:33:51,110 --> 01:33:51,120
let me ask a ridiculous question
 

5331
01:33:51,120 --> 01:33:53,110
let me ask a ridiculous question
uh last time we talked you told me what

5332
01:33:53,110 --> 01:33:53,120
uh last time we talked you told me what
 

5333
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:55,430
uh last time we talked you told me what
the most beautiful algorithm is

5334
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:55,440
the most beautiful algorithm is
 

5335
01:33:55,440 --> 01:33:56,470
the most beautiful algorithm is
actually

5336
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:56,480
actually
 

5337
01:33:56,480 --> 01:33:59,510
actually
uh for strongly connected graphs

5338
01:33:59,510 --> 01:33:59,520
uh for strongly connected graphs
 

5339
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,390
uh for strongly connected graphs
what is the hardest problem

5340
01:34:02,390 --> 01:34:02,400
what is the hardest problem
 

5341
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,430
what is the hardest problem
puzzle

5342
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:03,440
puzzle
 

5343
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,750
puzzle
idea in computer science for you

5344
01:34:05,750 --> 01:34:05,760
idea in computer science for you
 

5345
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:08,229
idea in computer science for you
personally that you had to work through

5346
01:34:08,229 --> 01:34:08,239
personally that you had to work through
 

5347
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:10,310
personally that you had to work through
just something that was just the

5348
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:10,320
just something that was just the
 

5349
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:12,229
just something that was just the
hardest thing that i've ever

5350
01:34:12,229 --> 01:34:12,239
hardest thing that i've ever
 

5351
01:34:12,239 --> 01:34:14,149
hardest thing that i've ever
been involved with yeah

5352
01:34:14,149 --> 01:34:14,159
been involved with yeah
 

5353
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,709
been involved with yeah
okay well yeah that's i don't

5354
01:34:16,709 --> 01:34:16,719
okay well yeah that's i don't
 

5355
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:19,030
okay well yeah that's i don't
know how to answer questions like that

5356
01:34:19,030 --> 01:34:19,040
know how to answer questions like that
 

5357
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:23,669
know how to answer questions like that
but in this case uh it's pretty clear

5358
01:34:23,669 --> 01:34:23,679

 

5359
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:25,350

okay because

5360
01:34:25,350 --> 01:34:25,360
okay because
 

5361
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,350
okay because
it's uh

5362
01:34:27,350 --> 01:34:27,360
it's uh
 

5363
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:28,470
it's uh
called the

5364
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:28,480
called the
 

5365
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,189
called the
the birth of the giant component okay so

5366
01:34:31,189 --> 01:34:31,199
the birth of the giant component okay so
 

5367
01:34:31,199 --> 01:34:33,189
the birth of the giant component okay so
now let me explain that because this is

5368
01:34:33,189 --> 01:34:33,199
now let me explain that because this is
 

5369
01:34:33,199 --> 01:34:34,390
now let me explain that because this is
actually gets

5370
01:34:34,390 --> 01:34:34,400
actually gets
 

5371
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:36,229
actually gets
gets into physics too

5372
01:34:36,229 --> 01:34:36,239
gets into physics too
 

5373
01:34:36,239 --> 01:34:38,390
gets into physics too
and it gets into something called bose

5374
01:34:38,390 --> 01:34:38,400
and it gets into something called bose
 

5375
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,910
and it gets into something called bose
einstein statistics

5376
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:39,920
einstein statistics
 

5377
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,109
einstein statistics
but but

5378
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:41,119
but but
 

5379
01:34:41,119 --> 01:34:42,470
but but
but anyway

5380
01:34:42,470 --> 01:34:42,480
but anyway
 

5381
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:43,830
but anyway
it's got

5382
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:43,840
it's got
 

5383
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:45,510
it's got
some interesting stories and it

5384
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:45,520
some interesting stories and it
 

5385
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:49,109
some interesting stories and it
connected with berkeley again

5386
01:34:49,109 --> 01:34:49,119

 

5387
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:49,990

so

5388
01:34:49,990 --> 01:34:50,000
so
 

5389
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,470
so
start with the idea of a random graph

5390
01:34:52,470 --> 01:34:52,480
start with the idea of a random graph
 

5391
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:55,430
start with the idea of a random graph
now this is

5392
01:34:55,430 --> 01:34:55,440

 

5393
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,229

here we we just say we have n points

5394
01:34:58,229 --> 01:34:58,239
here we we just say we have n points
 

5395
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,709
here we we just say we have n points
that are totally unconnected

5396
01:35:00,709 --> 01:35:00,719
that are totally unconnected
 

5397
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:01,510
that are totally unconnected
and

5398
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:01,520
and
 

5399
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,910
and
and there's no geometry involved there's

5400
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
and there's no geometry involved there's
 

5401
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:06,149
and there's no geometry involved there's
no saying some points are further apart

5402
01:35:06,149 --> 01:35:06,159
no saying some points are further apart
 

5403
01:35:06,159 --> 01:35:09,189
no saying some points are further apart
than others all points are exactly

5404
01:35:09,189 --> 01:35:09,199
than others all points are exactly
 

5405
01:35:09,199 --> 01:35:11,750
than others all points are exactly
are exactly alike and

5406
01:35:11,750 --> 01:35:11,760
are exactly alike and
 

5407
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:14,390
are exactly alike and
let's say we have 100 points and

5408
01:35:14,390 --> 01:35:14,400
let's say we have 100 points and
 

5409
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,629
let's say we have 100 points and
and we number them from zero zero to

5410
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:16,639
and we number them from zero zero to
 

5411
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:17,830
and we number them from zero zero to
nine nine

5412
01:35:17,830 --> 01:35:17,840
nine nine
 

5413
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,350
nine nine
all right

5414
01:35:19,350 --> 01:35:19,360
all right
 

5415
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:22,149
all right
now let's let's take pi

5416
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:22,159
now let's let's take pi
 

5417
01:35:22,159 --> 01:35:25,350
now let's let's take pi
uh the digits of pi so

5418
01:35:25,350 --> 01:35:25,360
uh the digits of pi so
 

5419
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:30,310
uh the digits of pi so
two at a time so so we had 31 41 59 26

5420
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:30,320
two at a time so so we had 31 41 59 26
 

5421
01:35:30,320 --> 01:35:33,109
two at a time so so we had 31 41 59 26
we we can look go go through pi

5422
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:33,119
we we can look go go through pi
 

5423
01:35:33,119 --> 01:35:34,790
we we can look go go through pi
and so

5424
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:34,800
and so
 

5425
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,030
and so
so we take the first two 31

5426
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
so we take the first two 31
 

5427
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,590
so we take the first two 31
41 and let's

5428
01:35:39,590 --> 01:35:39,600
41 and let's
 

5429
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:42,310
41 and let's
let's put a connection between point 31

5430
01:35:42,310 --> 01:35:42,320
let's put a connection between point 31
 

5431
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,870
let's put a connection between point 31
and point 41

5432
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:44,880
and point 41
 

5433
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,149
and point 41
that's an edge in the graph so

5434
01:35:48,149 --> 01:35:48,159
that's an edge in the graph so
 

5435
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:49,510
that's an edge in the graph so
then we take

5436
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:49,520
then we take
 

5437
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,189
then we take
5 9 2 6

5438
01:35:51,189 --> 01:35:51,199
5 9 2 6
 

5439
01:35:51,199 --> 01:35:53,669
5 9 2 6
and make another edge

5440
01:35:53,669 --> 01:35:53,679
and make another edge
 

5441
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:56,629
and make another edge
and the graph gets bigger it gets more

5442
01:35:56,629 --> 01:35:56,639
and the graph gets bigger it gets more
 

5443
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:57,669
and the graph gets bigger it gets more
and more

5444
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:57,679
and more
 

5445
01:35:57,679 --> 01:35:58,950
and more
connected

5446
01:35:58,950 --> 01:35:58,960
connected
 

5447
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:01,270
connected
as we add these things one at a time

5448
01:36:01,270 --> 01:36:01,280
as we add these things one at a time
 

5449
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,830
as we add these things one at a time
okay so we start out with end points

5450
01:36:03,830 --> 01:36:03,840
okay so we start out with end points
 

5451
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:06,629
okay so we start out with end points
and and we add uh

5452
01:36:06,629 --> 01:36:06,639
and and we add uh
 

5453
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:07,910
and and we add uh
m edges

5454
01:36:07,910 --> 01:36:07,920
m edges
 

5455
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,950
m edges
okay now each edge is completely

5456
01:36:10,950 --> 01:36:10,960
okay now each edge is completely
 

5457
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:12,629
okay now each edge is completely
we forgot about

5458
01:36:12,629 --> 01:36:12,639
we forgot about
 

5459
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:14,870
we forgot about
edges we had before we make an edge

5460
01:36:14,870 --> 01:36:14,880
edges we had before we make an edge
 

5461
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:17,350
edges we had before we make an edge
twice we might get an edge from a point

5462
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:17,360
twice we might get an edge from a point
 

5463
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:19,030
twice we might get an edge from a point
to its selfie but

5464
01:36:19,030 --> 01:36:19,040
to its selfie but
 

5465
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,669
to its selfie but
um you know maybe pi is going to

5466
01:36:21,669 --> 01:36:21,679
um you know maybe pi is going to
 

5467
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:24,229
um you know maybe pi is going to
have a run of four digits in there

5468
01:36:24,229 --> 01:36:24,239
have a run of four digits in there
 

5469
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:25,830
have a run of four digits in there
so we're gonna

5470
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:25,840
so we're gonna
 

5471
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,510
so we're gonna
but anyway

5472
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:27,520
but anyway
 

5473
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,229
but anyway
we're evolving a graph at random

5474
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:30,239
we're evolving a graph at random
 

5475
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,149
we're evolving a graph at random
um and

5476
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:32,159
um and
 

5477
01:36:32,159 --> 01:36:34,870
um and
a magical thing happens

5478
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:34,880
a magical thing happens
 

5479
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:36,629
a magical thing happens
when the number of edges

5480
01:36:36,629 --> 01:36:36,639
when the number of edges
 

5481
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:37,669
when the number of edges
is

5482
01:36:37,669 --> 01:36:37,679
is
 

5483
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:40,550
is
like point four nine and

5484
01:36:40,550 --> 01:36:40,560
like point four nine and
 

5485
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:41,990
like point four nine and
uh

5486
01:36:41,990 --> 01:36:42,000
uh
 

5487
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,070
uh
so maybe n is a million

5488
01:36:44,070 --> 01:36:44,080
so maybe n is a million
 

5489
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:45,430
so maybe n is a million
and i have

5490
01:36:45,430 --> 01:36:45,440
and i have
 

5491
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:46,870
and i have
uh you know

5492
01:36:46,870 --> 01:36:46,880
uh you know
 

5493
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:49,430
uh you know
490 000 edges

5494
01:36:49,430 --> 01:36:49,440
490 000 edges
 

5495
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:50,229
490 000 edges
uh

5496
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:50,239
uh
 

5497
01:36:50,239 --> 01:36:51,430
uh
then

5498
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:51,440
then
 

5499
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,590
then
it almost all the time

5500
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:53,600
it almost all the time
 

5501
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,550
it almost all the time
it it consists of isolated trees

5502
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:58,560

 

5503
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,350

not even any loops right

5504
01:37:01,350 --> 01:37:01,360
not even any loops right
 

5505
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,189
not even any loops right
it's a very small number of veggies so

5506
01:37:03,189 --> 01:37:03,199
it's a very small number of veggies so
 

5507
01:37:03,199 --> 01:37:04,709
it's a very small number of veggies so
far

5508
01:37:04,709 --> 01:37:04,719
far
 

5509
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:07,510
far
a little less than half n and right but

5510
01:37:07,510 --> 01:37:07,520
a little less than half n and right but
 

5511
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:10,070
a little less than half n and right but
if i had point five one inches so a

5512
01:37:10,070 --> 01:37:10,080
if i had point five one inches so a
 

5513
01:37:10,080 --> 01:37:11,990
if i had point five one inches so a
little more than half in

5514
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:12,000
little more than half in
 

5515
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,709
little more than half in
so it's you know million points

5516
01:37:14,709 --> 01:37:14,719
so it's you know million points
 

5517
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,149
so it's you know million points
510 000 edges

5518
01:37:18,149 --> 01:37:18,159
510 000 edges
 

5519
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:22,950
510 000 edges
now it probably has

5520
01:37:22,950 --> 01:37:22,960

 

5521
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:24,070

a

5522
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:24,080
a
 

5523
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:25,910
a
one component that's much bigger than

5524
01:37:25,910 --> 01:37:25,920
one component that's much bigger than
 

5525
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,790
one component that's much bigger than
the others

5526
01:37:28,790 --> 01:37:28,800

 

5527
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,070

um and we call that the giant component

5528
01:37:32,070 --> 01:37:32,080
um and we call that the giant component
 

5529
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,709
um and we call that the giant component
is that can you clap so can you clarify

5530
01:37:34,709 --> 01:37:34,719
is that can you clap so can you clarify
 

5531
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:35,430
is that can you clap so can you clarify
so

5532
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:35,440
so
 

5533
01:37:35,440 --> 01:37:37,590
so
is there a name for this kind of random

5534
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:37,600
is there a name for this kind of random
 

5535
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:41,189
is there a name for this kind of random
super cool pie random graph

5536
01:37:41,189 --> 01:37:41,199
super cool pie random graph
 

5537
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,430
super cool pie random graph
well i i call it

5538
01:37:43,430 --> 01:37:43,440
well i i call it
 

5539
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,229
well i i call it
part the pie graph no no i

5540
01:37:46,229 --> 01:37:46,239
part the pie graph no no i
 

5541
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:48,870
part the pie graph no no i
the pie graph is actually

5542
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:48,880
the pie graph is actually
 

5543
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:51,510
the pie graph is actually
my pie graph is based on

5544
01:37:51,510 --> 01:37:51,520
my pie graph is based on
 

5545
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:53,669
my pie graph is based on
on binary representation of pi not the

5546
01:37:53,669 --> 01:37:53,679
on binary representation of pi not the
 

5547
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:56,790
on binary representation of pi not the
decimal representation of pi but but but

5548
01:37:56,790 --> 01:37:56,800
decimal representation of pi but but but
 

5549
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,790
decimal representation of pi but but but
but anyway

5550
01:37:58,790 --> 01:37:58,800
but anyway
 

5551
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:01,350
but anyway
let's suppose i was rolling dice instead

5552
01:38:01,350 --> 01:38:01,360
let's suppose i was rolling dice instead
 

5553
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:03,590
let's suppose i was rolling dice instead
what's that so sorry so it doesn't it

5554
01:38:03,590 --> 01:38:03,600
what's that so sorry so it doesn't it
 

5555
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,109
what's that so sorry so it doesn't it
doesn't have to be pi

5556
01:38:05,109 --> 01:38:05,119
doesn't have to be pi
 

5557
01:38:05,119 --> 01:38:07,030
doesn't have to be pi
any source

5558
01:38:07,030 --> 01:38:07,040
any source
 

5559
01:38:07,040 --> 01:38:09,270
any source
the point is every step

5560
01:38:09,270 --> 01:38:09,280
the point is every step
 

5561
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,590
the point is every step
choose totally at random one of those

5562
01:38:11,590 --> 01:38:11,600
choose totally at random one of those
 

5563
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:12,950
choose totally at random one of those
endpoints

5564
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:12,960
endpoints
 

5565
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:14,950
endpoints
and choose totally at random another one

5566
01:38:14,950 --> 01:38:14,960
and choose totally at random another one
 

5567
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,109
and choose totally at random another one
of the end points

5568
01:38:17,109 --> 01:38:17,119
of the end points
 

5569
01:38:17,119 --> 01:38:19,270
of the end points
make that an edge

5570
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:19,280
make that an edge
 

5571
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,430
make that an edge
that's the process yeah

5572
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:21,440
that's the process yeah
 

5573
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,270
that's the process yeah
so there's there's nothing magical about

5574
01:38:23,270 --> 01:38:23,280
so there's there's nothing magical about
 

5575
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:26,229
so there's there's nothing magical about
pi they you're no no i was using pi to

5576
01:38:26,229 --> 01:38:26,239
pi they you're no no i was using pi to
 

5577
01:38:26,239 --> 01:38:28,550
pi they you're no no i was using pi to
sort of saying pi is sort of random that

5578
01:38:28,550 --> 01:38:28,560
sort of saying pi is sort of random that
 

5579
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:30,790
sort of saying pi is sort of random that
nobody knows a pattern in exactly got it

5580
01:38:30,790 --> 01:38:30,800
nobody knows a pattern in exactly got it
 

5581
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:33,109
nobody knows a pattern in exactly got it
i got it but it's not

5582
01:38:33,109 --> 01:38:33,119
i got it but it's not
 

5583
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,990
i got it but it's not
yeah i i could have just as well drawn

5584
01:38:35,990 --> 01:38:36,000
yeah i i could have just as well drawn
 

5585
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,550
yeah i i could have just as well drawn
straws or something um this was a

5586
01:38:38,550 --> 01:38:38,560
straws or something um this was a
 

5587
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,350
straws or something um this was a
concept invented by erdogan rainey and

5588
01:38:41,350 --> 01:38:41,360
concept invented by erdogan rainey and
 

5589
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:43,750
concept invented by erdogan rainey and
they called evolution of random graphs

5590
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:43,760
they called evolution of random graphs
 

5591
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,229
they called evolution of random graphs
and if you start out with with a large

5592
01:38:46,229 --> 01:38:46,239
and if you start out with with a large
 

5593
01:38:46,239 --> 01:38:47,270
and if you start out with with a large
number n

5594
01:38:47,270 --> 01:38:47,280
number n
 

5595
01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,750
number n
and you and you repeat this process all

5596
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:49,760
and you and you repeat this process all
 

5597
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:52,149
and you and you repeat this process all
of a sudden a big bang happens at one

5598
01:38:52,149 --> 01:38:52,159
of a sudden a big bang happens at one
 

5599
01:38:52,159 --> 01:38:54,149
of a sudden a big bang happens at one
half n there'll be two points together

5600
01:38:54,149 --> 01:38:54,159
half n there'll be two points together
 

5601
01:38:54,159 --> 01:38:56,830
half n there'll be two points together
then maybe we'll have half have

5602
01:38:56,830 --> 01:38:56,840
then maybe we'll have half have
 

5603
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,470
then maybe we'll have half have
three uh

5604
01:38:58,470 --> 01:38:58,480
three uh
 

5605
01:38:58,480 --> 01:38:59,270
three uh
and then

5606
01:38:59,270 --> 01:38:59,280
and then
 

5607
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,149
and then
you know

5608
01:39:00,149 --> 01:39:00,159
you know
 

5609
01:39:00,159 --> 01:39:01,910
you know
then they maybe branch out a little bit

5610
01:39:01,910 --> 01:39:01,920
then they maybe branch out a little bit
 

5611
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:03,990
then they maybe branch out a little bit
but but they'll all be separate until we

5612
01:39:03,990 --> 01:39:04,000
but but they'll all be separate until we
 

5613
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:05,910
but but they'll all be separate until we
get to one half end

5614
01:39:05,910 --> 01:39:05,920
get to one half end
 

5615
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,229
get to one half end
and we pass one half in and all of a

5616
01:39:08,229 --> 01:39:08,239
and we pass one half in and all of a
 

5617
01:39:08,239 --> 01:39:10,149
and we pass one half in and all of a
sudden

5618
01:39:10,149 --> 01:39:10,159
sudden
 

5619
01:39:10,159 --> 01:39:12,070
sudden
there's substance to it that

5620
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:12,080
there's substance to it that
 

5621
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:14,229
there's substance to it that
there are there's a big

5622
01:39:14,229 --> 01:39:14,239
there are there's a big
 

5623
01:39:14,239 --> 01:39:15,830
there are there's a big
clump of stuff that's all joined

5624
01:39:15,830 --> 01:39:15,840
clump of stuff that's all joined
 

5625
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:17,510
clump of stuff that's all joined
together so it's almost like a phase

5626
01:39:17,510 --> 01:39:17,520
together so it's almost like a phase
 

5627
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:20,709
together so it's almost like a phase
transition of some kind it's exactly it

5628
01:39:20,709 --> 01:39:20,719
transition of some kind it's exactly it
 

5629
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:22,310
transition of some kind it's exactly it
it's a phase transition but it's

5630
01:39:22,310 --> 01:39:22,320
it's a phase transition but it's
 

5631
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:24,149
it's a phase transition but it's
actually it's a double phase transition

5632
01:39:24,149 --> 01:39:24,159
actually it's a double phase transition
 

5633
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:27,830
actually it's a double phase transition
and turns out it it it happens

5634
01:39:27,830 --> 01:39:27,840
and turns out it it it happens
 

5635
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,189
and turns out it it it happens
there's actually two things going on at

5636
01:39:29,189 --> 01:39:29,199
there's actually two things going on at
 

5637
01:39:29,199 --> 01:39:30,149
there's actually two things going on at
once

5638
01:39:30,149 --> 01:39:30,159
once
 

5639
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:32,629
once
at this phase transition which

5640
01:39:32,629 --> 01:39:32,639
at this phase transition which
 

5641
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:35,590
at this phase transition which
uh which is very remarkable about okay

5642
01:39:35,590 --> 01:39:35,600
uh which is very remarkable about okay
 

5643
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:37,750
uh which is very remarkable about okay
so so um

5644
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:37,760
so so um
 

5645
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:39,270
so so um
a lot of the most important algorithms

5646
01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:39,280
a lot of the most important algorithms
 

5647
01:39:39,280 --> 01:39:41,350
a lot of the most important algorithms
are based on random processes and so i

5648
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:41,360
are based on random processes and so i
 

5649
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,189
are based on random processes and so i
wanted to you know i want to understand

5650
01:39:43,189 --> 01:39:43,199
wanted to you know i want to understand
 

5651
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:45,350
wanted to you know i want to understand
random processes now

5652
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:45,360
random processes now
 

5653
01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:46,790
random processes now
so there are data structures that sort

5654
01:39:46,790 --> 01:39:46,800
so there are data structures that sort
 

5655
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,229
so there are data structures that sort
of grow this way

5656
01:39:48,229 --> 01:39:48,239
of grow this way
 

5657
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:49,590
of grow this way
okay so

5658
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:49,600
okay so
 

5659
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:52,149
okay so
so dick carp one of the leading

5660
01:39:52,149 --> 01:39:52,159
so dick carp one of the leading
 

5661
01:39:52,159 --> 01:39:54,709
so dick carp one of the leading

under taking stat snapshots
 

5685
01:40:16,080 --> 01:40:17,590
under taking stat snapshots
every so often

5686
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:17,600
every so often
 

5687
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,590
every so often
take a look at what the graph is

5688
01:40:19,590 --> 01:40:19,600
take a look at what the graph is
 

5689
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,310
take a look at what the graph is
and the rumor was that every time they

5690
01:40:22,310 --> 01:40:22,320
and the rumor was that every time they
 

5691
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:23,430
and the rumor was that every time they
looked

5692
01:40:23,430 --> 01:40:23,440
looked
 

5693
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,270
looked
that there was only one component that

5694
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:25,280
that there was only one component that
 

5695
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:27,830
that there was only one component that
had loops in it almost always they do a

5696
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:27,840
had loops in it almost always they do a
 

5697
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:29,430
had loops in it almost always they do a
million experience

5698
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:29,440
million experience
 

5699
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:30,470
million experience
and

5700
01:40:30,470 --> 01:40:30,480
and
 

5701
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:31,350
and
only

5702
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:31,360
only
 

5703
01:40:31,360 --> 01:40:33,030
only
three or four times did they ever ever

5704
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:33,040
three or four times did they ever ever
 

5705
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:37,910
three or four times did they ever ever
happen to see a loop at at this point

5706
01:40:37,910 --> 01:40:37,920

 

5707
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,270

no more than one component with the loop

5708
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:41,280
no more than one component with the loop
 

5709
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,030
no more than one component with the loop
so they want you to keep till the graph

5710
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:43,040
so they want you to keep till the graph
 

5711
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:43,830
so they want you to keep till the graph
gets

5712
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:43,840
gets
 

5713
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:45,270
gets
completely full

5714
01:40:45,270 --> 01:40:45,280
completely full
 

5715
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:45,990
completely full
uh

5716
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:46,000
uh
 

5717
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,229
uh
so it starts out totally empty and gets

5718
01:40:48,229 --> 01:40:48,239
so it starts out totally empty and gets
 

5719
01:40:48,239 --> 01:40:49,510
so it starts out totally empty and gets
more and more

5720
01:40:49,510 --> 01:40:49,520
more and more
 

5721
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,390
more and more
more and more edges all the time uh and

5722
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:52,400
more and more edges all the time uh and
 

5723
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:53,590
more and more edges all the time uh and
and so okay

5724
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:53,600
and so okay
 

5725
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:55,910
and so okay
certainly a loop comes along once but

5726
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:55,920
certainly a loop comes along once but
 

5727
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:57,830
certainly a loop comes along once but
but now all the loops

5728
01:40:57,830 --> 01:40:57,840
but now all the loops
 

5729
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,709
but now all the loops
stay somehow joined to that one

5730
01:41:02,709 --> 01:41:02,719

 

5731
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:03,590

they're

5732
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:03,600
they're
 

5733
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,590
they're
there never were two guys with loops wow

5734
01:41:07,590 --> 01:41:07,600
there never were two guys with loops wow
 

5735
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:10,390
there never were two guys with loops wow
okay in this experiment okay so anyway

5736
01:41:10,390 --> 01:41:10,400
okay in this experiment okay so anyway
 

5737
01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:12,310
okay in this experiment okay so anyway
this one almost always

5738
01:41:12,310 --> 01:41:12,320
this one almost always
 

5739
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:14,470
this one almost always
certainly not always yeah

5740
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:14,480
certainly not always yeah
 

5741
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:16,550
certainly not always yeah
but but but with high very high

5742
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
but but but with high very high
 

5743
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,189
but but but with high very high
probability that seemed to be true so

5744
01:41:19,189 --> 01:41:19,199
probability that seemed to be true so
 

5745
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:21,590
probability that seemed to be true so
so we heard about this rumor at stanford

5746
01:41:21,590 --> 01:41:21,600
so we heard about this rumor at stanford
 

5747
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:22,709
so we heard about this rumor at stanford
and we said

5748
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:22,719
and we said
 

5749
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:25,750
and we said
if if that's true then must you know

5750
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:25,760
if if that's true then must you know
 

5751
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:27,590
if if that's true then must you know
a lot more must also be true so there's

5752
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:27,600
a lot more must also be true so there's
 

5753
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,109
a lot more must also be true so there's
a whole bunch there's a whole theory out

5754
01:41:29,109 --> 01:41:29,119
a whole bunch there's a whole theory out
 

5755
01:41:29,119 --> 01:41:30,550
a whole bunch there's a whole theory out
there waiting to be discovered that we

5756
01:41:30,550 --> 01:41:30,560
there waiting to be discovered that we
 

5757
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,790
there waiting to be discovered that we
haven't ever thought about so so let's

5758
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:32,800
haven't ever thought about so so let's
 

5759
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,070
haven't ever thought about so so let's
take a look at it

5760
01:41:34,070 --> 01:41:34,080
take a look at it
 

5761
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,990
take a look at it
and so we look closer and we find out no

5762
01:41:35,990 --> 01:41:36,000
and so we look closer and we find out no
 

5763
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,550
and so we look closer and we find out no
it actually it's not true

5764
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:38,560
it actually it's not true
 

5765
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:39,350
it actually it's not true
but

5766
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:39,360
but
 

5767
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,629
but
but in fact it's almost true

5768
01:41:42,629 --> 01:41:42,639
but in fact it's almost true
 

5769
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:43,990
but in fact it's almost true
namely

5770
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:44,000
namely
 

5771
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,229
namely
there's a very short interval of time

5772
01:41:46,229 --> 01:41:46,239
there's a very short interval of time
 

5773
01:41:46,239 --> 01:41:48,070
there's a very short interval of time
when it's true

5774
01:41:48,070 --> 01:41:48,080
when it's true
 

5775
01:41:48,080 --> 01:41:49,750
when it's true
and and if you don't happen to look at

5776
01:41:49,750 --> 01:41:49,760
and and if you don't happen to look at
 

5777
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:50,390
and and if you don't happen to look at
it

5778
01:41:50,390 --> 01:41:50,400
it
 

5779
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:52,629
it
during that short interval of time

5780
01:41:52,629 --> 01:41:52,639
during that short interval of time
 

5781
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:54,790
during that short interval of time
then you miss it

5782
01:41:54,790 --> 01:41:54,800
then you miss it
 

5783
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:55,830
then you miss it
so

5784
01:41:55,830 --> 01:41:55,840
so
 

5785
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,910
so
that in other words there'll be a period

5786
01:41:57,910 --> 01:41:57,920
that in other words there'll be a period
 

5787
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,950
that in other words there'll be a period
where they're two or three components

5788
01:42:00,950 --> 01:42:00,960
where they're two or three components
 

5789
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,629
where they're two or three components
have loops

5790
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
have loops
 

5791
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:03,990
have loops
but

5792
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:04,000
but
 

5793
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,189
but
they join together pretty soon okay

5794
01:42:07,189 --> 01:42:07,199
they join together pretty soon okay
 

5795
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:09,109
they join together pretty soon okay
so so

5796
01:42:09,109 --> 01:42:09,119
so so
 

5797
01:42:09,119 --> 01:42:11,189
so so
if you don't have

5798
01:42:11,189 --> 01:42:11,199
if you don't have
 

5799
01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:13,590
if you don't have
a real fast shutter speed you're going

5800
01:42:13,590 --> 01:42:13,600
a real fast shutter speed you're going
 

5801
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:14,390
a real fast shutter speed you're going
to miss

5802
01:42:14,390 --> 01:42:14,400
to miss
 

5803
01:42:14,400 --> 01:42:16,149
to miss
you're going to miss that instant so

5804
01:42:16,149 --> 01:42:16,159
you're going to miss that instant so
 

5805
01:42:16,159 --> 01:42:18,310
you're going to miss that instant so
separate loops don't exist for long

5806
01:42:18,310 --> 01:42:18,320
separate loops don't exist for long
 

5807
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:20,310
separate loops don't exist for long
that's that's it yeah you know i started

5808
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
that's that's it yeah you know i started
 

5809
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,870
that's that's it yeah you know i started
looking at this to make it quantitative

5810
01:42:22,870 --> 01:42:22,880
looking at this to make it quantitative
 

5811
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:24,709
looking at this to make it quantitative
and uh

5812
01:42:24,709 --> 01:42:24,719
and uh
 

5813
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:26,390
and uh
basic problem was to slow down the big

5814
01:42:26,390 --> 01:42:26,400
basic problem was to slow down the big
 

5815
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,030
basic problem was to slow down the big
bang so that i could watch it happening

5816
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
bang so that i could watch it happening
 

5817
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:32,870
bang so that i could watch it happening
yeah i i think i can explain it actually

5818
01:42:32,870 --> 01:42:32,880
yeah i i think i can explain it actually
 

5819
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,590
yeah i i think i can explain it actually
in fairly elementary terms deep

5820
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:35,600
in fairly elementary terms deep
 

5821
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,510
in fairly elementary terms deep
even without writing a formula that's

5822
01:42:37,510 --> 01:42:37,520
even without writing a formula that's
 

5823
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,470
even without writing a formula that's
right like hawking would do uh and and

5824
01:42:40,470 --> 01:42:40,480
right like hawking would do uh and and
 

5825
01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:42,629
right like hawking would do uh and and
and so uh

5826
01:42:42,629 --> 01:42:42,639
and so uh
 

5827
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:45,430
and so uh
let's let's watch the evolution and and

5828
01:42:45,430 --> 01:42:45,440
let's let's watch the evolution and and
 

5829
01:42:45,440 --> 01:42:48,149
let's let's watch the evolution and and
at first uh these edges are coming along

5830
01:42:48,149 --> 01:42:48,159
at first uh these edges are coming along
 

5831
01:42:48,159 --> 01:42:49,669
at first uh these edges are coming along
and they're just making

5832
01:42:49,669 --> 01:42:49,679
and they're just making
 

5833
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:51,109
and they're just making
things without loops

5834
01:42:51,109 --> 01:42:51,119
things without loops
 

5835
01:42:51,119 --> 01:42:53,669
things without loops
which we call trees okay so then all of

5836
01:42:53,669 --> 01:42:53,679
which we call trees okay so then all of
 

5837
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:55,910
which we call trees okay so then all of
a sudden the loop first appears so at

5838
01:42:55,910 --> 01:42:55,920
a sudden the loop first appears so at
 

5839
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,910
a sudden the loop first appears so at
that point i have one component that has

5840
01:42:57,910 --> 01:42:57,920
that point i have one component that has
 

5841
01:42:57,920 --> 01:42:58,870
that point i have one component that has
a loop

5842
01:42:58,870 --> 01:42:58,880
a loop
 

5843
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:00,629
a loop
all right now

5844
01:43:00,629 --> 01:43:00,639
all right now
 

5845
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:02,390
all right now
now i say that the complexity of a

5846
01:43:02,390 --> 01:43:02,400
now i say that the complexity of a
 

5847
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,990
now i say that the complexity of a
component

5848
01:43:03,990 --> 01:43:04,000
component
 

5849
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,709
component
is the number of edges minus the number

5850
01:43:06,709 --> 01:43:06,719
is the number of edges minus the number
 

5851
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:08,310
is the number of edges minus the number
of vertices

5852
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:08,320
of vertices
 

5853
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:11,830
of vertices
so if i have a loop i have like a loop

5854
01:43:11,830 --> 01:43:11,840
so if i have a loop i have like a loop
 

5855
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:15,109
so if i have a loop i have like a loop
of length five it has five edges and

5856
01:43:15,109 --> 01:43:15,119
of length five it has five edges and
 

5857
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:17,189
of length five it has five edges and
five vertices

5858
01:43:17,189 --> 01:43:17,199
five vertices
 

5859
01:43:17,199 --> 01:43:20,390
five vertices
um or or i could put a tail on that

5860
01:43:20,390 --> 01:43:20,400
um or or i could put a tail on that
 

5861
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:21,830
um or or i could put a tail on that
and that would be another edge another

5862
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,840
and that would be another edge another
 

5863
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,109
and that would be another edge another
vertex like a zero one two complexity

5864
01:43:25,109 --> 01:43:25,119
vertex like a zero one two complexity
 

5865
01:43:25,119 --> 01:43:27,189
vertex like a zero one two complexity
kind of thing so so if the if the

5866
01:43:27,189 --> 01:43:27,199
kind of thing so so if the if the
 

5867
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:29,910
kind of thing so so if the if the
complexity is zero we have one

5868
01:43:29,910 --> 01:43:29,920
complexity is zero we have one
 

5869
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,550
complexity is zero we have one
one loop i call it a cycle or i call a

5870
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:32,560
one loop i call it a cycle or i call a
 

5871
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:35,430
one loop i call it a cycle or i call a
cyclic component so so cyclic component

5872
01:43:35,430 --> 01:43:35,440
cyclic component so so cyclic component
 

5873
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:36,830
cyclic component so so cyclic component
looks like

5874
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:36,840
looks like
 

5875
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:38,390
looks like
a

5876
01:43:38,390 --> 01:43:38,400
a
 

5877
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:39,990
a
a wheel

5878
01:43:39,990 --> 01:43:40,000
a wheel
 

5879
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:41,669
a wheel
to which you attach

5880
01:43:41,669 --> 01:43:41,679
to which you attach
 

5881
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:43,750
to which you attach
fibers

5882
01:43:43,750 --> 01:43:43,760
fibers
 

5883
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:45,910
fibers
or trees

5884
01:43:45,910 --> 01:43:45,920
or trees
 

5885
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,270
or trees
they go branching but there's no more

5886
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:47,280
they go branching but there's no more
 

5887
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,790
they go branching but there's no more
loops there's only one loop and

5888
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:48,800
loops there's only one loop and
 

5889
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:50,070
loops there's only one loop and
everything else

5890
01:43:50,070 --> 01:43:50,080
everything else
 

5891
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,870
everything else
feeds into that loop okay and that has

5892
01:43:52,870 --> 01:43:52,880
feeds into that loop okay and that has
 

5893
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:54,870
feeds into that loop okay and that has
complexity zero

5894
01:43:54,870 --> 01:43:54,880
complexity zero
 

5895
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,709
complexity zero
but but a tree itself has complexity

5896
01:43:56,709 --> 01:43:56,719
but but a tree itself has complexity
 

5897
01:43:56,719 --> 01:43:58,870
but but a tree itself has complexity
minus one because it has

5898
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
minus one because it has
 

5899
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:00,550
minus one because it has
uh uh you know

5900
01:44:00,550 --> 01:44:00,560
uh uh you know
 

5901
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:01,350
uh uh you know
like

5902
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:01,360
like
 

5903
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,350
like
like it might have ten vertices and nine

5904
01:44:03,350 --> 01:44:03,360
like it might have ten vertices and nine
 

5905
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,750
like it might have ten vertices and nine
edges to tie the time together so nine

5906
01:44:05,750 --> 01:44:05,760
edges to tie the time together so nine
 

5907
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:07,910
edges to tie the time together so nine
minus ten is minus one so

5908
01:44:07,910 --> 01:44:07,920
minus ten is minus one so
 

5909
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:09,669
minus ten is minus one so
so complexity

5910
01:44:09,669 --> 01:44:09,679
so complexity
 

5911
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:11,990
so complexity
minus one is a tree

5912
01:44:11,990 --> 01:44:12,000
minus one is a tree
 

5913
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,669
minus one is a tree
it's gotta be connected that's what i

5914
01:44:13,669 --> 01:44:13,679
it's gotta be connected that's what i
 

5915
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:14,790
it's gotta be connected that's what i
mean by a component it's gotta be

5916
01:44:14,790 --> 01:44:14,800
mean by a component it's gotta be
 

5917
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:17,270
mean by a component it's gotta be
connected so so so if if i have ten

5918
01:44:17,270 --> 01:44:17,280
connected so so so if if i have ten
 

5919
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,430
connected so so so if if i have ten
things connected i have to have nine

5920
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:19,440
things connected i have to have nine
 

5921
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:21,350
things connected i have to have nine
edges

5922
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,360
edges
 

5923
01:44:21,360 --> 01:44:22,870
edges
can you clarify

5924
01:44:22,870 --> 01:44:22,880
can you clarify
 

5925
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:26,390
can you clarify
why when complexity goes uh you can go

5926
01:44:26,390 --> 01:44:26,400
why when complexity goes uh you can go
 

5927
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,870
why when complexity goes uh you can go
above zero i'm a little yes

5928
01:44:28,870 --> 01:44:28,880
above zero i'm a little yes
 

5929
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:30,310
above zero i'm a little yes
right so

5930
01:44:30,310 --> 01:44:30,320
right so
 

5931
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:32,229
right so
the complexity plus one is the number of

5932
01:44:32,229 --> 01:44:32,239
the complexity plus one is the number of
 

5933
01:44:32,239 --> 01:44:33,270
the complexity plus one is the number of
loops

5934
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:33,280
loops
 

5935
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:36,870
loops
so if complexity is zero i have one loop

5936
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:36,880
so if complexity is zero i have one loop
 

5937
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,350
so if complexity is zero i have one loop
if if if complexity is one

5938
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:39,360
if if if complexity is one
 

5939
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:41,270
if if if complexity is one
that means i have one more edge then i

5940
01:44:41,270 --> 01:44:41,280
that means i have one more edge then i
 

5941
01:44:41,280 --> 01:44:43,030
that means i have one more edge then i
have vertex

5942
01:44:43,030 --> 01:44:43,040
have vertex
 

5943
01:44:43,040 --> 01:44:45,109
have vertex
so i might have like

5944
01:44:45,109 --> 01:44:45,119
so i might have like
 

5945
01:44:45,119 --> 01:44:46,229
so i might have like
11

5946
01:44:46,229 --> 01:44:46,239
11
 

5947
01:44:46,239 --> 01:44:48,470
11
edges and 10 vertices

5948
01:44:48,470 --> 01:44:48,480
edges and 10 vertices
 

5949
01:44:48,480 --> 01:44:50,790
edges and 10 vertices
it's so it turns we call that a bicycle

5950
01:44:50,790 --> 01:44:50,800
it's so it turns we call that a bicycle
 

5951
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:53,189
it's so it turns we call that a bicycle
because it it it's got two loops and

5952
01:44:53,189 --> 01:44:53,199
because it it it's got two loops and
 

5953
01:44:53,199 --> 01:44:57,830
because it it it's got two loops and
it's got to have two loops in it

5954
01:44:57,830 --> 01:44:57,840

 

5955
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:00,149

why can't it be trees just going off of

5956
01:45:00,149 --> 01:45:00,159
why can't it be trees just going off of
 

5957
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:01,750
why can't it be trees just going off of
the loop

5958
01:45:01,750 --> 01:45:01,760
the loop
 

5959
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:04,229
the loop
that i would need more edges than

5960
01:45:04,229 --> 01:45:04,239
that i would need more edges than
 

5961
01:45:04,239 --> 01:45:05,270
that i would need more edges than
all right

5962
01:45:05,270 --> 01:45:05,280
all right
 

5963
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,750
all right
right okay so so every time i get

5964
01:45:07,750 --> 01:45:07,760
right okay so so every time i get
 

5965
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:09,669
right okay so so every time i get
another loop i i get

5966
01:45:09,669 --> 01:45:09,679
another loop i i get
 

5967
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,830
another loop i i get
another excess of edges over vertices i

5968
01:45:11,830 --> 01:45:11,840
another excess of edges over vertices i
 

5969
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,189
another excess of edges over vertices i
got you okay

5970
01:45:13,189 --> 01:45:13,199
got you okay
 

5971
01:45:13,199 --> 01:45:15,830
got you okay
so in other words uh

5972
01:45:15,830 --> 01:45:15,840
so in other words uh
 

5973
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:18,070
so in other words uh
we start out and

5974
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:18,080
we start out and
 

5975
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,750
we start out and
after i have one loop i have one

5976
01:45:19,750 --> 01:45:19,760
after i have one loop i have one
 

5977
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,590
after i have one loop i have one
component that has

5978
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:21,600
component that has
 

5979
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:25,669
component that has
a cycle in it not now the the next step

5980
01:45:25,669 --> 01:45:25,679
a cycle in it not now the the next step
 

5981
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:28,550
a cycle in it not now the the next step
uh according to the rumor would be that

5982
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:28,560
uh according to the rumor would be that
 

5983
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:30,709
uh according to the rumor would be that
at the next step i would have

5984
01:45:30,709 --> 01:45:30,719
at the next step i would have
 

5985
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,750
at the next step i would have
a bicycle

5986
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:33,760

 

5987
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,070

in the evolution of almost all graphs it

5988
01:45:36,070 --> 01:45:36,080
in the evolution of almost all graphs it
 

5989
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:38,790
in the evolution of almost all graphs it
would go from cycle to a bicycle but in

5990
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:38,800
would go from cycle to a bicycle but in
 

5991
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:40,629
would go from cycle to a bicycle but in
fact there's a certain probability it

5992
01:45:40,629 --> 01:45:40,639
fact there's a certain probability it
 

5993
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:41,590
fact there's a certain probability it
goes

5994
01:45:41,590 --> 01:45:41,600
goes
 

5995
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,109
goes
from cycle to two you know

5996
01:45:45,109 --> 01:45:45,119
from cycle to two you know
 

5997
01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:48,149
from cycle to two you know
to two different cycles all right

5998
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:48,159
to two different cycles all right
 

5999
01:45:48,159 --> 01:45:50,149
to two different cycles all right
um and i worked out the probability it

6000
01:45:50,149 --> 01:45:50,159
um and i worked out the probability it
 

6001
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:51,590
um and i worked out the probability it
was something like five out of twenty

6002
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:51,600
was something like five out of twenty
 

6003
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,709
was something like five out of twenty
four

6004
01:45:52,709 --> 01:45:52,719
four
 

6005
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:54,709
four
that was pretty high

6006
01:45:54,709 --> 01:45:54,719
that was pretty high
 

6007
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:56,550
that was pretty high
it was substantial yeah

6008
01:45:56,550 --> 01:45:56,560
it was substantial yeah
 

6009
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:58,870
it was substantial yeah
uh but still

6010
01:45:58,870 --> 01:45:58,880
uh but still
 

6011
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:00,550
uh but still
soon they're going to merge together

6012
01:46:00,550 --> 01:46:00,560
soon they're going to merge together
 

6013
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:02,470
soon they're going to merge together
almost okay so

6014
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:02,480
almost okay so
 

6015
01:46:02,480 --> 01:46:04,709
almost okay so
that's so cool but but then it splits

6016
01:46:04,709 --> 01:46:04,719
that's so cool but but then it splits
 

6017
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:05,669
that's so cool but but then it splits
again

6018
01:46:05,669 --> 01:46:05,679
again
 

6019
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:08,149
again
after you have either either two or one

6020
01:46:08,149 --> 01:46:08,159
after you have either either two or one
 

6021
01:46:08,159 --> 01:46:11,189
after you have either either two or one
one uh the next step is you either have

6022
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:11,199
one uh the next step is you either have
 

6023
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:14,149
one uh the next step is you either have
three or you have two one or you have

6024
01:46:14,149 --> 01:46:14,159
three or you have two one or you have
 

6025
01:46:14,159 --> 01:46:15,669
three or you have two one or you have
one on one okay

6026
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:15,679
one on one okay
 

6027
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,270
one on one okay
and so i worked out the probability

6028
01:46:19,270 --> 01:46:19,280
and so i worked out the probability
 

6029
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,350
and so i worked out the probability
for for those transitions

6030
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:21,360
for for those transitions
 

6031
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:22,310
for for those transitions
and

6032
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:22,320
and
 

6033
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:23,990
and
i worked it out up to

6034
01:46:23,990 --> 01:46:24,000
i worked it out up to
 

6035
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,470
i worked it out up to
up to the first five transitions

6036
01:46:26,470 --> 01:46:26,480
up to the first five transitions
 

6037
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:28,870
up to the first five transitions
and i had these so i had these strange

6038
01:46:28,870 --> 01:46:28,880
and i had these so i had these strange
 

6039
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:31,270
and i had these so i had these strange
numbers five twenty fours and i stayed

6040
01:46:31,270 --> 01:46:31,280
numbers five twenty fours and i stayed
 

6041
01:46:31,280 --> 01:46:33,830
numbers five twenty fours and i stayed
up all night and about three a.m

6042
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:33,840
up all night and about three a.m
 

6043
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,149
up all night and about three a.m
i i had the numbers computed and i

6044
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:36,159
i i had the numbers computed and i
 

6045
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:38,310
i i had the numbers computed and i
looked at them and here were

6046
01:46:38,310 --> 01:46:38,320
looked at them and here were
 

6047
01:46:38,320 --> 01:46:43,750
looked at them and here were
the denominator was something like

6048
01:46:43,750 --> 01:46:43,760

 

6049
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,990

20 2 3 0 2 3.

6050
01:46:47,990 --> 01:46:48,000
20 2 3 0 2 3.
 

6051
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:48,870
20 2 3 0 2 3.
so

6052
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:48,880
so
 

6053
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,790
so
the probability was something over 2 3 0

6054
01:46:50,790 --> 01:46:50,800
the probability was something over 2 3 0
 

6055
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:51,910
the probability was something over 2 3 0
2 3.

6056
01:46:51,910 --> 01:46:51,920
2 3.
 

6057
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:53,510
2 3.
i don't know how you worked that out but

6058
01:46:53,510 --> 01:46:53,520
i don't know how you worked that out but
 

6059
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:55,350
i don't know how you worked that out but
i had a formula of that you know i could

6060
01:46:55,350 --> 01:46:55,360
i had a formula of that you know i could
 

6061
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:57,750
i had a formula of that you know i could
calculate the probability yeah and and i

6062
01:46:57,750 --> 01:46:57,760
calculate the probability yeah and and i
 

6063
01:46:57,760 --> 01:46:59,350
calculate the probability yeah and and i
could find the limiting probability as n

6064
01:46:59,350 --> 01:46:59,360
could find the limiting probability as n
 

6065
01:46:59,360 --> 01:47:01,430
could find the limiting probability as n
goes to infinity and and it turned out

6066
01:47:01,430 --> 01:47:01,440
goes to infinity and and it turned out
 

6067
01:47:01,440 --> 01:47:03,990
goes to infinity and and it turned out
to be this number but the denominator

6068
01:47:03,990 --> 01:47:04,000
to be this number but the denominator
 

6069
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,990
to be this number but the denominator
was 2 0 and i and i looked at the

6070
01:47:05,990 --> 01:47:06,000
was 2 0 and i and i looked at the
 

6071
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,629
was 2 0 and i and i looked at the
denominator and i said wait a minute

6072
01:47:08,629 --> 01:47:08,639
denominator and i said wait a minute
 

6073
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:11,189
denominator and i said wait a minute
this number factors because

6074
01:47:11,189 --> 01:47:11,199
this number factors because
 

6075
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:14,790
this number factors because
1001 is equal to 7 times 11 times 13. i

6076
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:14,800
1001 is equal to 7 times 11 times 13. i
 

6077
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,229
1001 is equal to 7 times 11 times 13. i
had learned that in my first computer

6078
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:16,239
had learned that in my first computer
 

6079
01:47:16,239 --> 01:47:18,709
had learned that in my first computer
program so

6080
01:47:18,709 --> 01:47:18,719
program so
 

6081
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:20,310
program so
so so

6082
01:47:20,310 --> 01:47:20,320
so so
 

6083
01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:22,229
so so
so 23023

6084
01:47:22,229 --> 01:47:22,239
so 23023
 

6085
01:47:22,239 --> 01:47:24,950
so 23023
yeah is 7 times 11 times

6086
01:47:24,950 --> 01:47:24,960
yeah is 7 times 11 times
 

6087
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,310
yeah is 7 times 11 times
13 times 23.

6088
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:28,320
13 times 23.
 

6089
01:47:28,320 --> 01:47:30,310
13 times 23.
that's not a random number there has to

6090
01:47:30,310 --> 01:47:30,320
that's not a random number there has to
 

6091
01:47:30,320 --> 01:47:31,590
that's not a random number there has to
be a reason

6092
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:31,600
be a reason
 

6093
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:32,629
be a reason
why

6094
01:47:32,629 --> 01:47:32,639
why
 

6095
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:34,830
why
those small primes appear in the

6096
01:47:34,830 --> 01:47:34,840
those small primes appear in the
 

6097
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:37,270
those small primes appear in the
denominator but my think

6098
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:37,280
denominator but my think
 

6099
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,830
denominator but my think
so all of a sudden that suggested

6100
01:47:39,830 --> 01:47:39,840
so all of a sudden that suggested
 

6101
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,270
so all of a sudden that suggested
um

6102
01:47:41,270 --> 01:47:41,280
um
 

6103
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:43,109
um
another way of looking at the problem

6104
01:47:43,109 --> 01:47:43,119
another way of looking at the problem
 

6105
01:47:43,119 --> 01:47:45,430
another way of looking at the problem
where small prime factors

6106
01:47:45,430 --> 01:47:45,440
where small prime factors
 

6107
01:47:45,440 --> 01:47:46,870
where small prime factors
would occur

6108
01:47:46,870 --> 01:47:46,880
would occur
 

6109
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:47,669
would occur
so

6110
01:47:47,669 --> 01:47:47,679
so
 

6111
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:50,870
so
what would that be so that said oh yeah

6112
01:47:50,870 --> 01:47:50,880
what would that be so that said oh yeah
 

6113
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:52,229
what would that be so that said oh yeah
let me take the logarithm of this

6114
01:47:52,229 --> 01:47:52,239
let me take the logarithm of this
 

6115
01:47:52,239 --> 01:47:55,189
let me take the logarithm of this
formula and and sure enough it's going

6116
01:47:55,189 --> 01:47:55,199
formula and and sure enough it's going
 

6117
01:47:55,199 --> 01:47:56,790
formula and and sure enough it's going
to simplify

6118
01:47:56,790 --> 01:47:56,800
to simplify
 

6119
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,310
to simplify
and and it happened

6120
01:47:58,310 --> 01:47:58,320
and and it happened
 

6121
01:47:58,320 --> 01:47:59,510
and and it happened
so

6122
01:47:59,510 --> 01:47:59,520
so
 

6123
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,270
so
and i wouldn't have noticed it except

6124
01:48:01,270 --> 01:48:01,280
and i wouldn't have noticed it except
 

6125
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:03,109
and i wouldn't have noticed it except
for this factorization

6126
01:48:03,109 --> 01:48:03,119
for this factorization
 

6127
01:48:03,119 --> 01:48:06,229
for this factorization
okay so i go to bed and i say okay this

6128
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:06,239
okay so i go to bed and i say okay this
 

6129
01:48:06,239 --> 01:48:07,910
okay so i go to bed and i say okay this
is this looks like i'm slowing down the

6130
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:07,920
is this looks like i'm slowing down the
 

6131
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:09,590
is this looks like i'm slowing down the
big bang i can figure out what's going

6132
01:48:09,590 --> 01:48:09,600
big bang i can figure out what's going
 

6133
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,629
big bang i can figure out what's going
on here

6134
01:48:10,629 --> 01:48:10,639
on here
 

6135
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:12,229
on here
and

6136
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:12,239
and
 

6137
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:13,990
and
the next day it turned out bill gates

6138
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:14,000
the next day it turned out bill gates
 

6139
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:16,709
the next day it turned out bill gates
comes to stanford to visit uh they're

6140
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:16,719
comes to stanford to visit uh they're
 

6141
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:18,950
comes to stanford to visit uh they're
trying to sell him on donating money to

6142
01:48:18,950 --> 01:48:18,960
trying to sell him on donating money to
 

6143
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:20,870
trying to sell him on donating money to
uh for a new computer science building

6144
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:20,880
uh for a new computer science building
 

6145
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:21,750
uh for a new computer science building
sure

6146
01:48:21,750 --> 01:48:21,760
sure
 

6147
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:22,470
sure
and

6148
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:22,480
and
 

6149
01:48:22,480 --> 01:48:24,790
and
and they and uh so they gave me an

6150
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:24,800
and they and uh so they gave me an
 

6151
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:27,189
and they and uh so they gave me an
appointment to talk to bill and i

6152
01:48:27,189 --> 01:48:27,199
appointment to talk to bill and i
 

6153
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:30,709
appointment to talk to bill and i
and i wrote down on the blackboard this

6154
01:48:30,709 --> 01:48:30,719
and i wrote down on the blackboard this
 

6155
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:32,550
and i wrote down on the blackboard this
this evolutionary diagram you're going

6156
01:48:32,550 --> 01:48:32,560
this evolutionary diagram you're going
 

6157
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:34,310
this evolutionary diagram you're going
from one to two five twenty fourths in

6158
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:34,320
from one to two five twenty fourths in
 

6159
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:35,830
from one to two five twenty fourths in
all this business yeah

6160
01:48:35,830 --> 01:48:35,840
all this business yeah
 

6161
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:38,470
all this business yeah
and i wrote it down and anyway at the

6162
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:38,480
and i wrote it down and anyway at the
 

6163
01:48:38,480 --> 01:48:39,910
and i wrote it down and anyway at the
end of the day the

6164
01:48:39,910 --> 01:48:39,920
end of the day the
 

6165
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:42,550
end of the day the
uh he was discussing people with the

6166
01:48:42,550 --> 01:48:42,560
uh he was discussing people with the
 

6167
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,030
uh he was discussing people with the
with the uh development office and he

6168
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:45,040
with the uh development office and he
 

6169
01:48:45,040 --> 01:48:47,109
with the uh development office and he
said boy i was really impressed with

6170
01:48:47,109 --> 01:48:47,119
said boy i was really impressed with
 

6171
01:48:47,119 --> 01:48:49,990
said boy i was really impressed with
what professor knuth said

6172
01:48:49,990 --> 01:48:50,000
what professor knuth said
 

6173
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:51,510
what professor knuth said
about this

6174
01:48:51,510 --> 01:48:51,520
about this
 

6175
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:53,189
about this
giant component

6176
01:48:53,189 --> 01:48:53,199
giant component
 

6177
01:48:53,199 --> 01:48:56,149
giant component
and uh and so uh you know i i love this

6178
01:48:56,149 --> 01:48:56,159
and uh and so uh you know i i love this
 

6179
01:48:56,159 --> 01:48:58,229
and uh and so uh you know i i love this
story because it shows that

6180
01:48:58,229 --> 01:48:58,239
story because it shows that
 

6181
01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:00,470
story because it shows that
theoretical computer science has is

6182
01:49:00,470 --> 01:49:00,480
theoretical computer science has is
 

6183
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:02,070
theoretical computer science has is
really worthwhile you know

6184
01:49:02,070 --> 01:49:02,080
really worthwhile you know
 

6185
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,750
really worthwhile you know
does bill have you ever talked to bill

6186
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:03,760
does bill have you ever talked to bill
 

6187
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,550
does bill have you ever talked to bill
gates about it uh since then

6188
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:06,560
gates about it uh since then
 

6189
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:07,750
gates about it uh since then
yeah

6190
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:07,760
yeah
 

6191
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:09,109
yeah
that's a cool yeah that's a cool little

6192
01:49:09,109 --> 01:49:09,119
that's a cool yeah that's a cool little
 

6193
01:49:09,119 --> 01:49:12,229
that's a cool yeah that's a cool little
moment in history yeah but but anyway

6194
01:49:12,229 --> 01:49:12,239
moment in history yeah but but anyway
 

6195
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:14,629
moment in history yeah but but anyway
he happened to visit on exactly the day

6196
01:49:14,629 --> 01:49:14,639
he happened to visit on exactly the day
 

6197
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:15,990
he happened to visit on exactly the day
after i had

6198
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:16,000
after i had
 

6199
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,470
after i had
i i had found this pattern and

6200
01:49:18,470 --> 01:49:18,480
i i had found this pattern and
 

6201
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:20,390
i i had found this pattern and
that allowed me to to crack the problem

6202
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:20,400
that allowed me to to crack the problem
 

6203
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:24,070
that allowed me to to crack the problem
so you know so that i could develop the

6204
01:49:24,070 --> 01:49:24,080
so you know so that i could develop the
 

6205
01:49:24,080 --> 01:49:27,030
so you know so that i could develop the
uh the theory some more and understand

6206
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:27,040
uh the theory some more and understand
 

6207
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,189
uh the theory some more and understand
what's happening in the big but

6208
01:49:29,189 --> 01:49:29,199
what's happening in the big but
 

6209
01:49:29,199 --> 01:49:29,990
what's happening in the big but
uh

6210
01:49:29,990 --> 01:49:30,000
uh
 

6211
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,149
uh
because i could i could now write down

6212
01:49:32,149 --> 01:49:32,159
because i could i could now write down
 

6213
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,189
because i could i could now write down
explicit formulas for stuff right and so

6214
01:49:35,189 --> 01:49:35,199
explicit formulas for stuff right and so
 

6215
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:36,470
explicit formulas for stuff right and so
it would you know

6216
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
it would you know
 

6217
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:37,910
it would you know
it would work not only the first few

6218
01:49:37,910 --> 01:49:37,920
it would work not only the first few
 

6219
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:40,070
it would work not only the first few
steps but also they'll study the whole

6220
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:40,080
steps but also they'll study the whole
 

6221
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:42,390
steps but also they'll study the whole
process and and i worked further and

6222
01:49:42,390 --> 01:49:42,400
process and and i worked further and
 

6223
01:49:42,400 --> 01:49:43,589
process and and i worked further and
further and i

6224
01:49:43,589 --> 01:49:43,599
further and i
 

6225
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:45,910
further and i
with two authors co-authors and we

6226
01:49:45,910 --> 01:49:45,920
with two authors co-authors and we
 

6227
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:47,750
with two authors co-authors and we
finally figured out

6228
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:47,760
finally figured out
 

6229
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,750
finally figured out
that the probability

6230
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:49,760
that the probability
 

6231
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:50,950
that the probability
that

6232
01:49:50,950 --> 01:49:50,960
that
 

6233
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,149
that
the rumor

6234
01:49:52,149 --> 01:49:52,159
the rumor
 

6235
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,990
the rumor
was true in other words look at the

6236
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:54,000
was true in other words look at the
 

6237
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:57,830
was true in other words look at the
evolution of a of a random graph going

6238
01:49:57,830 --> 01:49:57,840
evolution of a of a random graph going
 

6239
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:01,270
evolution of a of a random graph going
from zero zero to to complete

6240
01:50:01,270 --> 01:50:01,280
from zero zero to to complete
 

6241
01:50:01,280 --> 01:50:03,669
from zero zero to to complete
and say what's the probability that at

6242
01:50:03,669 --> 01:50:03,679
and say what's the probability that at
 

6243
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:05,910
and say what's the probability that at
every point in time there was only one

6244
01:50:05,910 --> 01:50:05,920
every point in time there was only one
 

6245
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:08,390
every point in time there was only one
component with a cycle

6246
01:50:08,390 --> 01:50:08,400
component with a cycle
 

6247
01:50:08,400 --> 01:50:09,830
component with a cycle
we started with this rumor saying

6248
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
we started with this rumor saying
 

6249
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,669
we started with this rumor saying
there's only one site there's only one

6250
01:50:11,669 --> 01:50:11,679
there's only one site there's only one
 

6251
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:14,550
there's only one site there's only one
component with the cycle and and

6252
01:50:14,550 --> 01:50:14,560
component with the cycle and and
 

6253
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:15,430
component with the cycle and and
uh

6254
01:50:15,430 --> 01:50:15,440
uh
 

6255
01:50:15,440 --> 01:50:16,950
uh
so

6256
01:50:16,950 --> 01:50:16,960
so
 

6257
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:18,470
so
it's a hundred percent

6258
01:50:18,470 --> 01:50:18,480
it's a hundred percent
 

6259
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:20,550
it's a hundred percent
the rumor was that was 100

6260
01:50:20,550 --> 01:50:20,560
the rumor was that was 100
 

6261
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:22,550
the rumor was that was 100
it turned out the actual numbers was

6262
01:50:22,550 --> 01:50:22,560
it turned out the actual numbers was
 

6263
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:23,270
it turned out the actual numbers was
like

6264
01:50:23,270 --> 01:50:23,280
like
 

6265
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,910
like
percent or i i don't know i should

6266
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:25,920
percent or i i don't know i should
 

6267
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,510
percent or i i don't know i should
remember the number but i do but i don't

6268
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:27,520
remember the number but i do but i don't
 

6269
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:29,990
remember the number but i do but i don't
have it with me but but anyway

6270
01:50:29,990 --> 01:50:30,000
have it with me but but anyway
 

6271
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,030
have it with me but but anyway
but but the but the number

6272
01:50:33,030 --> 01:50:33,040
but but the but the number
 

6273
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,189
but but the but the number
it it turned out to be like 12 over pi

6274
01:50:35,189 --> 01:50:35,199
it it turned out to be like 12 over pi
 

6275
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:36,470
it it turned out to be like 12 over pi
squared or

6276
01:50:36,470 --> 01:50:36,480
squared or
 

6277
01:50:36,480 --> 01:50:39,589
squared or
anything

6278
01:50:39,589 --> 01:50:39,599

 

6279
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:40,790

it was a nice

6280
01:50:40,790 --> 01:50:40,800
it was a nice
 

6281
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:44,070
it was a nice
it related to pi yeah um and we could

6282
01:50:44,070 --> 01:50:44,080
it related to pi yeah um and we could
 

6283
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:45,510
it related to pi yeah um and we could
never have

6284
01:50:45,510 --> 01:50:45,520
never have
 

6285
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:46,950
never have
done that with

6286
01:50:46,950 --> 01:50:46,960
done that with
 

6287
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:48,870
done that with
but so that's the hardest problem i ever

6288
01:50:48,870 --> 01:50:48,880
but so that's the hardest problem i ever
 

6289
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:50,470
but so that's the hardest problem i ever
saw in my life was to prove that this

6290
01:50:50,470 --> 01:50:50,480
saw in my life was to prove that this
 

6291
01:50:50,480 --> 01:50:53,990
saw in my life was to prove that this
probability is is it was proven

6292
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
probability is is it was proven
 

6293
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,310
probability is is it was proven
the probability was proven yeah i was

6294
01:50:56,310 --> 01:50:56,320
the probability was proven yeah i was
 

6295
01:50:56,320 --> 01:50:58,870
the probability was proven yeah i was
able to prove this that this

6296
01:50:58,870 --> 01:50:58,880
able to prove this that this
 

6297
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:00,870
able to prove this that this
and and and this should shed light on a

6298
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:00,880
and and and this should shed light on a
 

6299
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:02,390
and and and this should shed light on a
whole bunch of other things about random

6300
01:51:02,390 --> 01:51:02,400
whole bunch of other things about random
 

6301
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:05,189
whole bunch of other things about random
graphs that that was sort of the

6302
01:51:05,189 --> 01:51:05,199
graphs that that was sort of the
 

6303
01:51:05,199 --> 01:51:06,390
graphs that that was sort of the
the major

6304
01:51:06,390 --> 01:51:06,400
the major
 

6305
01:51:06,400 --> 01:51:08,070
the major
thing we were asked after that's super

6306
01:51:08,070 --> 01:51:08,080
thing we were asked after that's super
 

6307
01:51:08,080 --> 01:51:08,790
thing we were asked after that's super
cool

6308
01:51:08,790 --> 01:51:08,800
cool
 

6309
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:10,390
cool
what was the connection to physics that

6310
01:51:10,390 --> 01:51:10,400
what was the connection to physics that
 

6311
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,430
what was the connection to physics that
you mentioned

6312
01:51:11,430 --> 01:51:11,440
you mentioned
 

6313
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,990
you mentioned
well bose einstein statistics is the

6314
01:51:13,990 --> 01:51:14,000
well bose einstein statistics is the
 

6315
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:15,750
well bose einstein statistics is the
study of how

6316
01:51:15,750 --> 01:51:15,760
study of how
 

6317
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:18,310
study of how
molecules uh

6318
01:51:18,310 --> 01:51:18,320
molecules uh
 

6319
01:51:18,320 --> 01:51:21,669
molecules uh
bond together

6320
01:51:21,669 --> 01:51:21,679

 

6321
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:23,270

without geometry

6322
01:51:23,270 --> 01:51:23,280
without geometry
 

6323
01:51:23,280 --> 01:51:26,310
without geometry
without distance

6324
01:51:26,310 --> 01:51:26,320

 

6325
01:51:26,320 --> 01:51:30,229

you created the tech type setting system

6326
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:30,239
you created the tech type setting system
 

6327
01:51:30,239 --> 01:51:33,350
you created the tech type setting system
and released it as open source

6328
01:51:33,350 --> 01:51:33,360
and released it as open source
 

6329
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,589
and released it as open source
just on that little aspect

6330
01:51:35,589 --> 01:51:35,599
just on that little aspect
 

6331
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:38,470
just on that little aspect
why did you release it as open source

6332
01:51:38,470 --> 01:51:38,480
why did you release it as open source
 

6333
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,750
why did you release it as open source
what is your vision for open source

6334
01:51:41,750 --> 01:51:41,760
what is your vision for open source
 

6335
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:44,070
what is your vision for open source
no okay well that the word open source

6336
01:51:44,070 --> 01:51:44,080
no okay well that the word open source
 

6337
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:46,709
no okay well that the word open source
didn't exist at that time but we but i i

6338
01:51:46,709 --> 01:51:46,719
didn't exist at that time but we but i i
 

6339
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:50,550
didn't exist at that time but we but i i
didn't want proprietary rights over it

6340
01:51:50,550 --> 01:51:50,560
didn't want proprietary rights over it
 

6341
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:52,709
didn't want proprietary rights over it
because i saw

6342
01:51:52,709 --> 01:51:52,719
because i saw
 

6343
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:53,750
because i saw
how

6344
01:51:53,750 --> 01:51:53,760
how
 

6345
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:55,990
how
proprietary rights were holding things

6346
01:51:55,990 --> 01:51:56,000
proprietary rights were holding things
 

6347
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:56,790
proprietary rights were holding things
back

6348
01:51:56,790 --> 01:51:56,800
back
 

6349
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,709
back
in the late 50s

6350
01:51:58,709 --> 01:51:58,719
in the late 50s
 

6351
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:00,550
in the late 50s
people at ibm developed the language

6352
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:00,560
people at ibm developed the language
 

6353
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:03,750
people at ibm developed the language
called fortran they could have

6354
01:52:03,750 --> 01:52:03,760
called fortran they could have
 

6355
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:05,830
called fortran they could have
kept it proprietary they could have said

6356
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:05,840
kept it proprietary they could have said
 

6357
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:08,390
kept it proprietary they could have said
only ibm can use this language everybody

6358
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:08,400
only ibm can use this language everybody
 

6359
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,109
only ibm can use this language everybody
else has to but but they didn't

6360
01:52:11,109 --> 01:52:11,119
else has to but but they didn't
 

6361
01:52:11,119 --> 01:52:14,470
else has to but but they didn't
they said anybody who can write who can

6362
01:52:14,470 --> 01:52:14,480
they said anybody who can write who can
 

6363
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:15,990
they said anybody who can write who can
translate fortran

6364
01:52:15,990 --> 01:52:16,000
translate fortran
 

6365
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:17,109
translate fortran
into the

01:52:20,790 --> 01:52:20,800
is allowed to
 

6371
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,510
is allowed to
make fortran compilers too

6372
01:52:23,510 --> 01:52:23,520
make fortran compilers too
 

6373
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,030
make fortran compilers too
um

6374
01:52:25,030 --> 01:52:25,040
um
 

6375
01:52:25,040 --> 01:52:27,589
um
on the other hand in the typography

6376
01:52:27,589 --> 01:52:27,599
on the other hand in the typography
 

6377
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:28,830
on the other hand in the typography
industry i had

6378
01:52:28,830 --> 01:52:28,840
industry i had
 

6379
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,750
industry i had
seen a lot of languages that were

6380
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:31,760
seen a lot of languages that were
 

6381
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:33,350
seen a lot of languages that were
developed for

6382
01:52:33,350 --> 01:52:33,360
developed for
 

6383
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:35,189
developed for
composing pages

6384
01:52:35,189 --> 01:52:35,199
composing pages
 

6385
01:52:35,199 --> 01:52:37,669
composing pages
and each manufacturer had his own

6386
01:52:37,669 --> 01:52:37,679
and each manufacturer had his own
 

6387
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,790
and each manufacturer had his own
language for composing pages

6388
01:52:40,790 --> 01:52:40,800
language for composing pages
 

6389
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,030
language for composing pages
and that was holding everything back

6390
01:52:43,030 --> 01:52:43,040
and that was holding everything back
 

6391
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:45,430
and that was holding everything back
because people

6392
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:45,440
because people
 

6393
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:47,750
because people
were tied to a particular manufacturer

6394
01:52:47,750 --> 01:52:47,760
were tied to a particular manufacturer
 

6395
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:49,589
were tied to a particular manufacturer
and and then a new equipment is invented

6396
01:52:49,589 --> 01:52:49,599
and and then a new equipment is invented
 

6397
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:51,750
and and then a new equipment is invented
a year later but printing printing

6398
01:52:51,750 --> 01:52:51,760
a year later but printing printing
 

6399
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:53,109
a year later but printing printing
machines they have to

6400
01:52:53,109 --> 01:52:53,119
machines they have to
 

6401
01:52:53,119 --> 01:52:55,350
machines they have to
expect to amortize the cost over 20 30

6402
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:55,360
expect to amortize the cost over 20 30
 

6403
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:56,550
expect to amortize the cost over 20 30
years

6404
01:52:56,550 --> 01:52:56,560
years
 

6405
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:58,629
years
so you didn't want that for tech

6406
01:52:58,629 --> 01:52:58,639
so you didn't want that for tech
 

6407
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:02,310
so you didn't want that for tech
i didn't need the income

6408
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:02,320
i didn't need the income
 

6409
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:05,830
i didn't need the income
okay i already i i already had

6410
01:53:05,830 --> 01:53:05,840
okay i already i i already had
 

6411
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:06,709
okay i already i i already had
uh

6412
01:53:06,709 --> 01:53:06,719
uh
 

6413
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:08,550
uh
a good job

6414
01:53:08,550 --> 01:53:08,560
a good job
 

6415
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:09,430
a good job
and

6416
01:53:09,430 --> 01:53:09,440
and
 

6417
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,189
and
you know

6418
01:53:11,189 --> 01:53:11,199
you know
 

6419
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:14,629
you know
my books were

6420
01:53:14,629 --> 01:53:14,639

 

6421
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:16,790

people were buying enough books that i

6422
01:53:16,790 --> 01:53:16,800
people were buying enough books that i
 

6423
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:17,669
people were buying enough books that i
that

6424
01:53:17,669 --> 01:53:17,679
that
 

6425
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:21,189
that
that it would bring me

6426
01:53:21,189 --> 01:53:21,199
that it would bring me
 

6427
01:53:21,199 --> 01:53:23,030
that it would bring me
plenty of supplemental income for

6428
01:53:23,030 --> 01:53:23,040
plenty of supplemental income for
 

6429
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:25,589
plenty of supplemental income for
everything my kids needed for education

6430
01:53:25,589 --> 01:53:25,599
everything my kids needed for education
 

6431
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:26,709
everything my kids needed for education
whatever

6432
01:53:26,709 --> 01:53:26,719
whatever
 

6433
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:28,790
whatever
so there was no reason for me to try to

6434
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:28,800
so there was no reason for me to try to
 

6435
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:31,910
so there was no reason for me to try to
maximize income any further

6436
01:53:31,910 --> 01:53:31,920
maximize income any further
 

6437
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:34,070
maximize income any further
income is sort of a threshold function

6438
01:53:34,070 --> 01:53:34,080
income is sort of a threshold function
 

6439
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,430
income is sort of a threshold function
if you don't have

6440
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:35,440
if you don't have
 

6441
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,990
if you don't have
if you don't have enough you're starving

6442
01:53:37,990 --> 01:53:38,000
if you don't have enough you're starving
 

6443
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,070
if you don't have enough you're starving
but if if you get over the threshold

6444
01:53:40,070 --> 01:53:40,080
but if if you get over the threshold
 

6445
01:53:40,080 --> 01:53:41,669
but if if you get over the threshold
then you start thinking about

6446
01:53:41,669 --> 01:53:41,679
then you start thinking about
 

6447
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:44,870
then you start thinking about
philanthropy or else or you're trying to

6448
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:44,880
philanthropy or else or you're trying to
 

6449
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:47,430
philanthropy or else or you're trying to
take it with you but uh

6450
01:53:47,430 --> 01:53:47,440
take it with you but uh
 

6451
01:53:47,440 --> 01:53:50,149
take it with you but uh
but anyway there's a i had

6452
01:53:50,149 --> 01:53:50,159
but anyway there's a i had
 

6453
01:53:50,159 --> 01:53:52,870
but anyway there's a i had
my income was over the threshold so

6454
01:53:52,870 --> 01:53:52,880
my income was over the threshold so
 

6455
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:54,870
my income was over the threshold so
so that i i didn't need

6456
01:53:54,870 --> 01:53:54,880
so that i i didn't need
 

6457
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,830
so that i i didn't need
to keep it and so i specifically could

6458
01:53:57,830 --> 01:53:57,840
to keep it and so i specifically could
 

6459
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,669
to keep it and so i specifically could
see the advantage of

6460
01:53:59,669 --> 01:53:59,679
see the advantage of
 

6461
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:02,709
see the advantage of
of of making it open for everybody

6462
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:02,719
of of making it open for everybody
 

6463
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:04,870
of of making it open for everybody
do you think uh most software should be

6464
01:54:04,870 --> 01:54:04,880
do you think uh most software should be
 

6465
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:06,149
do you think uh most software should be
open

6466
01:54:06,149 --> 01:54:06,159
open
 

6467
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,550
open
so i think that

6468
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:08,560
so i think that
 

6469
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:10,629
so i think that
people should charge for non-trivial

6470
01:54:10,629 --> 01:54:10,639
people should charge for non-trivial
 

6471
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:13,109
people should charge for non-trivial
software but not for trivial software

6472
01:54:13,109 --> 01:54:13,119
software but not for trivial software
 

6473
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:16,070
software but not for trivial software
yeah you give an example of i think

6474
01:54:16,070 --> 01:54:16,080
yeah you give an example of i think
 

6475
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:19,750
yeah you give an example of i think
adobe photoshop versus on linux

6476
01:54:19,750 --> 01:54:19,760
adobe photoshop versus on linux
 

6477
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,830
adobe photoshop versus on linux
as photoshop has value which so

6478
01:54:23,830 --> 01:54:23,840
as photoshop has value which so
 

6479
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,790
as photoshop has value which so
it's definitely worth paying

6480
01:54:26,790 --> 01:54:26,800
it's definitely worth paying
 

6481
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,870
it's definitely worth paying
paying for all the stuff i mean

6482
01:54:28,870 --> 01:54:28,880
paying for all the stuff i mean
 

6483
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:30,709
paying for all the stuff i mean
and i mean

6484
01:54:30,709 --> 01:54:30,719
and i mean
 

6485
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:33,030
and i mean
well they keep adding

6486
01:54:33,030 --> 01:54:33,040
well they keep adding
 

6487
01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:35,109
well they keep adding
adding stuff that just

6488
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:35,119
adding stuff that just
 

6489
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:37,109
adding stuff that just
that my wife and i don't

6490
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:37,119
that my wife and i don't
 

6491
01:54:37,119 --> 01:54:38,950
that my wife and i don't
care about but

6492
01:54:38,950 --> 01:54:38,960
care about but
 

6493
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:41,990
care about but
somebody does but i mean but they have

6494
01:54:41,990 --> 01:54:42,000
somebody does but i mean but they have
 

6495
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:43,189
somebody does but i mean but they have
built in a

6496
01:54:43,189 --> 01:54:43,199
built in a
 

6497
01:54:43,199 --> 01:54:47,030
built in a
fantastic uh uh undo feature for example

6498
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:47,040
fantastic uh uh undo feature for example
 

6499
01:54:47,040 --> 01:54:48,870
fantastic uh uh undo feature for example
in photoshop

6500
01:54:48,870 --> 01:54:48,880
in photoshop
 

6501
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:51,990
in photoshop
where you you you can go through a

6502
01:54:51,990 --> 01:54:52,000
where you you you can go through a
 

6503
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,070
where you you you can go through a
sequence of a thousand complicated steps

6504
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:54,080
sequence of a thousand complicated steps
 

6505
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,350
sequence of a thousand complicated steps
on graphics and

6506
01:54:55,350 --> 01:54:55,360
on graphics and
 

6507
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,550
on graphics and
it can

6508
01:54:56,550 --> 01:54:56,560
it can
 

6509
01:54:56,560 --> 01:54:58,550
it can
take you back anywhere in that sequence

6510
01:54:58,550 --> 01:54:58,560
take you back anywhere in that sequence
 

6511
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:00,070
take you back anywhere in that sequence
yeah

6512
01:55:00,070 --> 01:55:00,080
yeah
 

6513
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,390
yeah
with really beautiful algorithms i mean

6514
01:55:02,390 --> 01:55:02,400
with really beautiful algorithms i mean
 

6515
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,790
with really beautiful algorithms i mean
yeah it's it's oh that's interesting i

6516
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:04,800
yeah it's it's oh that's interesting i
 

6517
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:06,390
yeah it's it's oh that's interesting i
didn't think about what algorithm it

6518
01:55:06,390 --> 01:55:06,400
didn't think about what algorithm it
 

6519
01:55:06,400 --> 01:55:07,750
didn't think about what algorithm it
must be some kind of efficient

6520
01:55:07,750 --> 01:55:07,760
must be some kind of efficient
 

6521
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,310
must be some kind of efficient
representation really yeah i know i mean

6522
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:10,320
representation really yeah i know i mean
 

6523
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,030
representation really yeah i know i mean
there's a lot of really subtle

6524
01:55:13,030 --> 01:55:13,040
there's a lot of really subtle
 

6525
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:15,189
there's a lot of really subtle
nobel prize class like

6526
01:55:15,189 --> 01:55:15,199
nobel prize class like
 

6527
01:55:15,199 --> 01:55:18,310
nobel prize class like
creation of intellectual property in in

6528
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:18,320
creation of intellectual property in in
 

6529
01:55:18,320 --> 01:55:20,390
creation of intellectual property in in
there

6530
01:55:20,390 --> 01:55:20,400
there
 

6531
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:23,589
there
and uh

6532
01:55:23,589 --> 01:55:23,599

 

6533
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:24,229

and

6534
01:55:24,229 --> 01:55:24,239
and
 

6535
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:26,470
and
with patents uh you've got a limited

6536
01:55:26,470 --> 01:55:26,480
with patents uh you've got a limited
 

6537
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:28,390
with patents uh you've got a limited
time to

6538
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:28,400
time to
 

6539
01:55:28,400 --> 01:55:31,270
time to
uh i mean eventually the idea of patents

6540
01:55:31,270 --> 01:55:31,280
uh i mean eventually the idea of patents
 

6541
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:32,709
uh i mean eventually the idea of patents
is that you publish

6542
01:55:32,709 --> 01:55:32,719
is that you publish
 

6543
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:34,550
is that you publish
so that it's not secret it's not a trade

6544
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:34,560
so that it's not secret it's not a trade
 

6545
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:37,030
so that it's not secret it's not a trade
secret

6546
01:55:37,030 --> 01:55:37,040

 

6547
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:39,109

that said

6548
01:55:39,109 --> 01:55:39,119
that said
 

6549
01:55:39,119 --> 01:55:41,350
that said
you you've said that i currently use

6550
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:41,360
you you've said that i currently use
 

6551
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:44,629
you you've said that i currently use
ubuntu linux on a standalone laptop

6552
01:55:44,629 --> 01:55:44,639
ubuntu linux on a standalone laptop
 

6553
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:46,790
ubuntu linux on a standalone laptop
it has no internet connection

6554
01:55:46,790 --> 01:55:46,800
it has no internet connection
 

6555
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,109
it has no internet connection
i occasionally carry flash memory drives

6556
01:55:49,109 --> 01:55:49,119
i occasionally carry flash memory drives
 

6557
01:55:49,119 --> 01:55:51,750
i occasionally carry flash memory drives
between the machine and the macs that i

6558
01:55:51,750 --> 01:55:51,760
between the machine and the macs that i
 

6559
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:54,550
between the machine and the macs that i
use for network surfing and graphics

6560
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:54,560
use for network surfing and graphics
 

6561
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:57,510
use for network surfing and graphics
but i trust my family jewels only to

01:55:57,510 --> 01:55:57,520
but i trust my family jewels only to
 

6563

linux
 

6565
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:00,870
linux
why do you love linux

6566
01:56:00,870 --> 01:56:00,880
why do you love linux
 

6567
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:02,550
why do you love linux
the version of linux that i use is

6568
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:02,560
the version of linux that i use is
 

6569
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:05,189
the version of linux that i use is
stable i i i

6570
01:56:05,189 --> 01:56:05,199
stable i i i
 

6571
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:07,109
stable i i i
actually i i'm gonna have to upgrade one

6572
01:56:07,109 --> 01:56:07,119
actually i i'm gonna have to upgrade one
 

6573
01:56:07,119 --> 01:56:08,470
actually i i'm gonna have to upgrade one
of these days but

6574
01:56:08,470 --> 01:56:08,480
of these days but
 

6575
01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:10,950
of these days but
to a newer version of ubuntu yeah i'll

6576
01:56:10,950 --> 01:56:10,960
to a newer version of ubuntu yeah i'll
 

6577
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:12,950
to a newer version of ubuntu yeah i'll

massive puzzles
 

6831
02:00:56,400 --> 02:00:58,709
massive puzzles
and uh you can find that on wikipedia

6832
02:00:58,709 --> 02:00:58,719
and uh you can find that on wikipedia
 

6833
02:00:58,719 --> 02:00:59,990
and uh you can find that on wikipedia
certainly uh

6834
02:00:59,990 --> 02:01:00,000
certainly uh
 

6835
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:01,510
certainly uh
as an example

6836
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:01,520
as an example
 

6837
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,109
as an example
m-a-s-y-u

6839
02:01:03,119 --> 02:01:06,390
m-a-s-y-u
um and and so i and so i decided i would

6840
02:01:06,390 --> 02:01:06,400
um and and so i and so i decided i would
 

6841
02:01:06,400 --> 02:01:07,910
um and and so i and so i decided i would
take pi

6842
02:01:07,910 --> 02:01:07,920
take pi
 

6843
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:09,669

the actual
image of it and it

6846
02:01:11,750 --> 02:01:11,760
image of it and it
 

6847
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:15,189
image of it and it
had pixels and i i would put a stone

6848
02:01:15,189 --> 02:01:15,199
had pixels and i i would put a stone
 

6849
02:01:15,199 --> 02:01:16,149
had pixels and i i would put a stone
wherever

and and but

6856
02:01:21,270 --> 02:01:21,280
and and but
 

6857
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:22,790
and and but
the problem was

02:01:22,790 --> 02:01:22,800
the problem was
 

6859
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,629
the problem was
find a way to make some of the stones

6860

find a way to make some of the stones
 

6861
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:26,790
find a way to make some of the stones
white some of the stones black so that

6862
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:26,800
white some of the stones black so that
 

6863
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:28,149
white some of the stones black so that
there's a unique solution to the

6864
02:01:28,149 --> 02:01:28,159
there's a unique solution to the
 

6865
02:01:28,159 --> 02:01:31,030
there's a unique solution to the
mossview puzzle

6866
02:01:31,030 --> 02:01:31,040

 

6867
02:01:31,040 --> 02:01:31,910

that was

6868
02:01:31,910 --> 02:01:31,920
that was
 

6869
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:33,990
that was
a good test case for my algorithm on how

6870
02:01:33,990 --> 02:01:34,000
a good test case for my algorithm on how
 

6871
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:36,550
a good test case for my algorithm on how
to design master puzzles because i i

6872
02:01:36,550 --> 02:01:36,560
to design master puzzles because i i
 

6873
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:38,149
to design master puzzles because i i
insisted in advance

6874
02:01:38,149 --> 02:01:38,159
insisted in advance
 

6875
02:01:38,159 --> 02:01:40,390
insisted in advance
that the stones had to be placed in

6876
02:01:40,390 --> 02:01:40,400
that the stones had to be placed in
 

6877
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:41,910
that the stones had to be placed in
exactly the positions that make the

6878
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:41,920
exactly the positions that make the
 

6879
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,629
exactly the positions that make the
letter pie make a juice letter okay

6880
02:01:44,629 --> 02:01:44,639
letter pie make a juice letter okay
 

6881
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,109
letter pie make a juice letter okay
all right that's cool and and

6882
02:01:47,109 --> 02:01:47,119
all right that's cool and and
 

6883
02:01:47,119 --> 02:01:48,709
all right that's cool and and
i saw you know

6884
02:01:48,709 --> 02:01:48,719
i saw you know
 

6885
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:51,189
i saw you know
and it turned out there was a a

6886
02:01:51,189 --> 02:01:51,199
and it turned out there was a a
 

6887
02:01:51,199 --> 02:01:53,030
and it turned out there was a a
a unique way to do that

6888
02:01:53,030 --> 02:01:53,040
a unique way to do that
 

6889
02:01:53,040 --> 02:01:54,709
a unique way to do that
um and so

6890
02:01:54,709 --> 02:01:54,719
um and so
 

6891
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:56,950
um and so
so pi is a

6892
02:01:56,950 --> 02:01:56,960
so pi is a
 

6893
02:01:56,960 --> 02:01:58,310
so pi is a
source of

where i can prove that i'm starting with
 

6899
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:04,470
where i can prove that i'm starting with
something that isn't canned

6900
02:02:04,470 --> 02:02:04,480

02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:13,910
graphs
uh graceful graphs

6908
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:13,920
uh graceful graphs
 

6909
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:15,750
uh graceful graphs
is the following

6910
02:02:15,750 --> 02:02:15,760
is the following
 

6911
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:18,790
is the following
you have a graph that has

6912
02:02:18,790 --> 02:02:18,800
you have a graph that has
 

6913
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:20,470
you have a graph that has
m edges to it

6914
02:02:20,470 --> 02:02:20,480
m edges to it
 

6915
02:02:20,480 --> 02:02:22,550
m edges to it
all right and

6916
02:02:22,550 --> 02:02:22,560
all right and
 

6917
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,350
all right and
you attach numbers to every vertex

6918
02:02:25,350 --> 02:02:25,360
you attach numbers to every vertex
 

6919
02:02:25,360 --> 02:02:27,109
you attach numbers to every vertex
in the following way so every time you

6920
02:02:27,109 --> 02:02:27,119
in the following way so every time you
 

6921
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:29,589
in the following way so every time you
have an edge between vertices

6922
02:02:29,589 --> 02:02:29,599
have an edge between vertices
 

6923
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:31,350
have an edge between vertices
you take the difference between those

6924
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:31,360
you take the difference between those
 

6925
02:02:31,360 --> 02:02:33,030
you take the difference between those
numbers

6926
02:02:33,030 --> 02:02:33,040
numbers
 

6927
02:02:33,040 --> 02:02:35,510
numbers
and and that difference is it's got to

6928
02:02:35,510 --> 02:02:35,520
and and that difference is it's got to
 

6929
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:36,629
and and that difference is it's got to
be

6930
02:02:36,629 --> 02:02:36,639
be
 

6931
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:38,950
be
tell you what edge it is so so

6932
02:02:38,950 --> 02:02:38,960
tell you what edge it is so so
 

6933
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:41,350
tell you what edge it is so so
one edge two numbers will be one apart

6934
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:41,360
one edge two numbers will be one apart
 

6935
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:42,790
one edge two numbers will be one apart
there'll be another edge where the

6936
02:02:42,790 --> 02:02:42,800
there'll be another edge where the
 

6937
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:46,149
there'll be another edge where the
numbers are two apart and so uh great

6938
02:02:46,149 --> 02:02:46,159
numbers are two apart and so uh great
 

6939
02:02:46,159 --> 02:02:49,030
numbers are two apart and so uh great
computer problem can you find a graceful

6940
02:02:49,030 --> 02:02:49,040
computer problem can you find a graceful
 

6941
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,990
computer problem can you find a graceful
way to label a graph

6942
02:02:51,990 --> 02:02:52,000
way to label a graph
 

6943
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,390
way to label a graph
so i started with a so i started with a

6944
02:02:54,390 --> 02:02:54,400
so i started with a so i started with a
 

6945
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:56,790
so i started with a so i started with a
graph that i use for

6946
02:02:56,790 --> 02:02:56,800
graph that i use for
 

6947
02:02:56,800 --> 02:02:59,030
graph that i use for
an organic graph not

6948
02:02:59,030 --> 02:02:59,040
an organic graph not
 

6949
02:02:59,040 --> 02:03:00,709
an organic graph not
not a

6950
02:03:00,709 --> 02:03:00,719
not a
 

6951
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:02,390
not a
mathematically symmetric graph or

6952
02:03:02,390 --> 02:03:02,400
mathematically symmetric graph or
 

6953
02:03:02,400 --> 02:03:04,790
mathematically symmetric graph or
anything and i take this i take the 49

6954
02:03:04,790 --> 02:03:04,800
anything and i take this i take the 49
 

6955
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:06,950
anything and i take this i take the 49
states of the united states

6956
02:03:06,950 --> 02:03:06,960
states of the united states
 

6957
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:08,629
states of the united states
uh

6958
02:03:08,629 --> 02:03:08,639
uh
 

6959
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:10,390
uh
the edges that go from one state to the

6960
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:10,400
the edges that go from one state to the
 

6961
02:03:10,400 --> 02:03:13,109
the edges that go from one state to the
next state so for example california be

6962
02:03:13,109 --> 02:03:13,119
next state so for example california be
 

6963
02:03:13,119 --> 02:03:14,550
next state so for example california be
next to oregon

6964
02:03:14,550 --> 02:03:14,560
next to oregon
 

6965
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,910
next to oregon
nevada

6966
02:03:15,910 --> 02:03:15,920
nevada
 

6967
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:17,830
nevada
arizona okay

6968
02:03:17,830 --> 02:03:17,840
arizona okay
 

6969
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:19,510
arizona okay
and and

6970
02:03:19,510 --> 02:03:19,520
and and
 

6971
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:22,470
and and
and i include this district of columbia

6972
02:03:22,470 --> 02:03:22,480
and i include this district of columbia
 

6973
02:03:22,480 --> 02:03:26,709
and i include this district of columbia
uh so i have 49 i can't get at la alaska

6974
02:03:26,709 --> 02:03:26,719
uh so i have 49 i can't get at la alaska
 

6975
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:28,629
uh so i have 49 i can't get at la alaska
and hawaii in there because they don't

6976
02:03:28,629 --> 02:03:28,639
and hawaii in there because they don't
 

6977
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,629
and hawaii in there because they don't
touch you have to be able to drive from

6978
02:03:30,629 --> 02:03:30,639
touch you have to be able to drive from
 

6979
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:33,270
touch you have to be able to drive from
one to the other so is there a graceful

6980
02:03:33,270 --> 02:03:33,280
one to the other so is there a graceful
 

6981
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:36,470
one to the other so is there a graceful
labeling of of the united states

6982
02:03:36,470 --> 02:03:36,480
labeling of of the united states
 

6983
02:03:36,480 --> 02:03:38,790
labeling of of the united states
each state gets a number

6984
02:03:38,790 --> 02:03:38,800
each state gets a number
 

6985
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:41,669
each state gets a number
and then if california is number 30 and

6986
02:03:41,669 --> 02:03:41,679
and then if california is number 30 and
 

6987
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:43,430
and then if california is number 30 and
oregon is number 11.

6988
02:03:43,430 --> 02:03:43,440
oregon is number 11.
 

6989
02:03:43,440 --> 02:03:45,350
oregon is number 11.
that edge is going to be number

6990
02:03:45,350 --> 02:03:45,360
that edge is going to be number
 

6991
02:03:45,360 --> 02:03:47,589
that edge is going to be number
19. the difference between those right

6992
02:03:47,589 --> 02:03:47,599
19. the difference between those right
 

6993
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:48,470
19. the difference between those right
okay

6994
02:03:48,470 --> 02:03:48,480
okay
 

6995
02:03:48,480 --> 02:03:50,950
okay
so is there a way to do this for for all

6996
02:03:50,950 --> 02:03:50,960
so is there a way to do this for for all
 

6997
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:51,990
so is there a way to do this for for all
the states

6998
02:03:51,990 --> 02:03:52,000
the states
 

6999
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,470
the states
and at that and so i was i was thinking

7000
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:54,480
and at that and so i was i was thinking
 

7001
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:57,109
and at that and so i was i was thinking
of having a contest uh

7002
02:03:57,109 --> 02:03:57,119
of having a contest uh
 

7003
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:59,589
of having a contest uh
for people to to get it as graceful as

7004
02:03:59,589 --> 02:03:59,599
for people to to get it as graceful as
 

7005
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:00,790
for people to to get it as graceful as
they could

7006
02:04:00,790 --> 02:04:00,800
they could
 

7007
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:03,990
they could
uh but my friend tamara kiki

7008
02:04:03,990 --> 02:04:04,000
uh but my friend tamara kiki
 

7009
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:06,310
uh but my friend tamara kiki
actually solved the problem by proving

7010
02:04:06,310 --> 02:04:06,320
actually solved the problem by proving
 

7011
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,550
actually solved the problem by proving
that i mean i was able i was able to get

7012
02:04:08,550 --> 02:04:08,560
that i mean i was able i was able to get
 

7013
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:10,550
that i mean i was able i was able to get
it down

7014
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:10,560
it down
 

7015
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:12,470
it down
within seven or something like that he

7016
02:04:12,470 --> 02:04:12,480
within seven or something like that he
 

7017
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,629
within seven or something like that he
was able to get a perfect solution

7018
02:04:14,629 --> 02:04:14,639
was able to get a perfect solution
 

7019
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:16,390
was able to get a perfect solution
the actual solution or to prove that a

7020
02:04:16,390 --> 02:04:16,400
the actual solution or to prove that a
 

7021
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:17,830
the actual solution or to prove that a
solution exists

7022
02:04:17,830 --> 02:04:17,840
solution exists
 

7023
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:20,310
solution exists
more precisely i i had figured out a way

7024
02:04:20,310 --> 02:04:20,320
more precisely i i had figured out a way
 

7025
02:04:20,320 --> 02:04:22,470
more precisely i i had figured out a way
to put labels on so that

7026
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:22,480
to put labels on so that
 

7027
02:04:22,480 --> 02:04:25,109
to put labels on so that
all the all the uh all the edges were

7028
02:04:25,109 --> 02:04:25,119
all the all the uh all the edges were
 

7029
02:04:25,119 --> 02:04:28,229
all the all the uh all the edges were
labeled somewhere between one and 117

7030
02:04:28,229 --> 02:04:28,239
labeled somewhere between one and 117
 

7031
02:04:28,239 --> 02:04:29,910
labeled somewhere between one and 117
but but there were some some get some

7032
02:04:29,910 --> 02:04:29,920
but but there were some some get some
 

7033
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:31,589
but but there were some some get some
gaps in there because

7034
02:04:31,589 --> 02:04:31,599
gaps in there because
 

7035
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:33,030
gaps in there because
i should really have gone from one to

7036
02:04:33,030 --> 02:04:33,040
i should really have gone from one to
 

7037
02:04:33,040 --> 02:04:35,990
i should really have gone from one to
105 or what the whatever the number is

7038
02:04:35,990 --> 02:04:36,000
105 or what the whatever the number is
 

7039
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:36,709
105 or what the whatever the number is
so

7040
02:04:36,709 --> 02:04:36,719
so
 

7041
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:38,950
so
i gave myself too much

7042
02:04:38,950 --> 02:04:38,960
i gave myself too much
 

7043
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:40,550
i gave myself too much
you know a lot of slack

7044
02:04:40,550 --> 02:04:40,560
you know a lot of slack
 

7045
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:42,629
you know a lot of slack
he did it without any slack whatsoever a

7046
02:04:42,629 --> 02:04:42,639
he did it without any slack whatsoever a
 

7047
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:44,550
he did it without any slack whatsoever a
perfect grace for labeling

7048
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:44,560
perfect grace for labeling
 

7049
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,030
perfect grace for labeling
and and so i you know i

7050
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:47,040
and and so i you know i
 

7051
02:04:47,040 --> 02:04:49,589
and and so i you know i
call out the contest uh because the

7052
02:04:49,589 --> 02:04:49,599
call out the contest uh because the
 

7053
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:51,669
call out the contest uh because the
problem is already solid and too easy in

7054
02:04:51,669 --> 02:04:51,679
problem is already solid and too easy in
 

7055
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:53,750
problem is already solid and too easy in
a sense because tom was able to do it in

7056
02:04:53,750 --> 02:04:53,760
a sense because tom was able to do it in
 

7057
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:54,870
a sense because tom was able to do it in
an afternoon

7058
02:04:54,870 --> 02:04:54,880
an afternoon
 

7059
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:57,350
an afternoon
um he sorry he did the algorithm or for

02:04:57,350 --> 02:04:57,360
um he sorry he did the algorithm or for
 

7061
02:04:57,360 --> 02:05:00,310
um he sorry he did the algorithm or for
this particular uh for the stick united

7062
02:05:00,310 --> 02:05:00,320
this particular uh for the stick united
 

7063
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:01,750
this particular uh for the stick united
states for the united states this

7064
02:05:01,750 --> 02:05:01,760
states for the united states this
 

7065
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:02,870
states for the united states this
problem is

7066
02:05:02,870 --> 02:05:02,880
problem is
 

7067
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:05,030
problem is
this problem is incredibly hard i mean

7068
02:05:05,030 --> 02:05:05,040
this problem is incredibly hard i mean
 

7069
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:06,950
this problem is incredibly hard i mean
for the general generally okay

7070
02:05:06,950 --> 02:05:06,960
for the general generally okay
 

7071
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:08,629
for the general generally okay
but it's like it's like coloring but it

7072
02:05:08,629 --> 02:05:08,639
but it's like it's like coloring but it
 

7073
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:10,069
but it's like it's like coloring but it
was very lucky that we worked for the

7074
02:05:10,069 --> 02:05:10,079
was very lucky that we worked for the
 

7075
02:05:10,079 --> 02:05:13,270
was very lucky that we worked for the
united states sure um i think but but i

7076
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:13,280
united states sure um i think but but i
 

7077
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,270
united states sure um i think but but i
mean the theory is still very uncomplete

7078
02:05:15,270 --> 02:05:15,280
mean the theory is still very uncomplete
 

7079
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:18,310
mean the theory is still very uncomplete
but but but anyway then tom came back a

7080
02:05:18,310 --> 02:05:18,320
but but but anyway then tom came back a
 

7081
02:05:18,320 --> 02:05:20,069
but but but anyway then tom came back a
couple days later and he had been able

7082
02:05:20,069 --> 02:05:20,079
couple days later and he had been able
 

7083
02:05:20,079 --> 02:05:22,069
couple days later and he had been able
to not only find a graceful labeling but

7084
02:05:22,069 --> 02:05:22,079
to not only find a graceful labeling but
 

7085
02:05:22,079 --> 02:05:23,669
to not only find a graceful labeling but
he

7086
02:05:23,669 --> 02:05:23,679
he
 

7087
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:24,709
he
but

7088
02:05:24,709 --> 02:05:24,719
but
 

7089
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:27,430
but
the label of washington was 31.

7090
02:05:27,430 --> 02:05:27,440
the label of washington was 31.
 

7091
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,109
the label of washington was 31.
the label of

7092
02:05:29,109 --> 02:05:29,119
the label of
 

7093
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:30,790
the label of
of idaho

7094
02:05:30,790 --> 02:05:30,800
of idaho
 

7095
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:35,350
of idaho
was 41 following the digits of pi

7096
02:05:35,350 --> 02:05:35,360
was 41 following the digits of pi
 

7097
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,069
was 41 following the digits of pi
yeah

7098
02:05:36,069 --> 02:05:36,079
yeah
 

7099
02:05:36,079 --> 02:05:37,430
yeah
going across

7100
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:37,440
going across
 

7101
02:05:37,440 --> 02:05:39,990
going across
the topic of the united states he has

7102
02:05:39,990 --> 02:05:40,000
the topic of the united states he has
 

7103
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,910
the topic of the united states he has
the digits of pipeline did he do it on

7104
02:05:41,910 --> 02:05:41,920
the digits of pipeline did he do it on
 

7105
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:43,350
the digits of pipeline did he do it on
purpose

7106
02:05:43,350 --> 02:05:43,360
purpose
 

7107
02:05:43,360 --> 02:05:45,109
purpose
he was able to still get a graceful

7108
02:05:45,109 --> 02:05:45,119
he was able to still get a graceful
 

7109
02:05:45,119 --> 02:05:52,870
he was able to still get a graceful
labeling with that with

7110
02:05:52,870 --> 02:05:52,880

 

7111
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:56,550

all roads lead to pie yeah somehow um
 

7121
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:08,709
all roads lead to pie yeah somehow um
somehow often hidden

7122
02:06:08,709 --> 02:06:08,719
somehow often hidden
 

7123
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:10,870
somehow often hidden
uh in the middle of like the the most

7124
02:06:10,870 --> 02:06:10,880
uh in the middle of like the the most
 

7125
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:12,550
uh in the middle of like the the most
difficult problems

7126

can i ask you about uh
productivity

7130
02:06:16,709 --> 02:06:16,719
productivity
 

7131
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:19,830
productivity
productivity yeah you said that quote my

productivity yeah you said that quote my
 

7133
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:21,510
productivity yeah you said that quote my
scheduling principle

7134
02:06:21,510 --> 02:06:21,520
scheduling principle
 

7135
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:24,629
scheduling principle
is to do the thing i hate most

can you explain this process to a
 

7143
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,430
can you explain this process to a
productive life

7144
02:06:33,430 --> 02:06:33,440
productive life
 

7145
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,270
productive life
oh i see well

7146
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:35,280
oh i see well
 

7147
02:06:35,280 --> 02:06:36,870
oh i see well
but all the time i'm working out and

02:06:43,990 --> 02:06:44,000
unpleasant tasks finished yes is that
 

7155
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:45,990
unpleasant tasks finished yes is that
something you would advise to others

7156
02:06:45,990 --> 02:06:46,000
something you would advise to others
 

7157
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:49,430
something you would advise to others

during the pandemic i feel my
 

7163
02:06:53,360 --> 02:06:56,390
during the pandemic i feel my
productivity actually went down by half

7164
02:06:56,390 --> 02:06:56,400
productivity actually went down by half
 

7165
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,750
productivity actually went down by half
um

7166
02:06:57,750 --> 02:06:57,760
um
 

7167
02:06:57,760 --> 02:06:59,910
um
because i have to

7168
02:06:59,910 --> 02:06:59,920
because i have to
 

7169
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:01,430
because i have to
um

7170
02:07:01,430 --> 02:07:01,440
um
 

7171
02:07:01,440 --> 02:07:03,910
um
i have to communicate by

7172
02:07:03,910 --> 02:07:03,920
i have to communicate by
 

7173
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:06,149
i have to communicate by
writing which is slow i have to

7174
02:07:06,149 --> 02:07:06,159
writing which is slow i have to
 

7175
02:07:06,159 --> 02:07:08,229
writing which is slow i have to
i mean i i don't like to send out a bad

7176
02:07:08,229 --> 02:07:08,239
i mean i i don't like to send out a bad
 

7177
02:07:08,239 --> 02:07:10,310
i mean i i don't like to send out a bad
sentence so i

7178
02:07:10,310 --> 02:07:10,320
sentence so i
 

7179
02:07:10,320 --> 02:07:11,750
sentence so i
you know i go through and reread what

7180
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:11,760
you know i go through and reread what
 

7181
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:14,069
you know i go through and reread what
i've written and edit and fix it so so

7182
02:07:14,069 --> 02:07:14,079
i've written and edit and fix it so so
 

7183
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:15,830
i've written and edit and fix it so so
everything takes a long a lot longer

7184
02:07:15,830 --> 02:07:15,840
everything takes a long a lot longer
 

7185
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:16,709
everything takes a long a lot longer
when i'm

7186
02:07:16,709 --> 02:07:16,719
when i'm
 

7187
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:19,350
when i'm
when i'm communicating by

7188
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:19,360
when i'm communicating by
 

7189
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:21,830
when i'm communicating by
by text messages um

7190
02:07:21,830 --> 02:07:21,840
by text messages um
 

7191
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:23,189
by text messages um
instead of just

7192
02:07:23,189 --> 02:07:23,199
instead of just
 

7193
02:07:23,199 --> 02:07:24,470
instead of just
you know

7194
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:24,480
you know
 

7195
02:07:24,480 --> 02:07:26,790
you know
together with somebody in the room and

7196
02:07:26,790 --> 02:07:26,800
together with somebody in the room and
 

7197
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:28,709
together with somebody in the room and
it's also

7198
02:07:28,709 --> 02:07:28,719
it's also
 

7199
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:30,550
it's also
slower because the libraries are closed

7200
02:07:30,550 --> 02:07:30,560
slower because the libraries are closed
 

7201
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,830
slower because the libraries are closed
and stuff

7202
02:07:31,830 --> 02:07:31,840
and stuff
 

7203
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:33,030
and stuff
but there's another thing about

7204
02:07:33,030 --> 02:07:33,040
but there's another thing about
 

7205
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:34,709
but there's another thing about
scheduling that i learned from my mother

7206
02:07:34,709 --> 02:07:34,719
scheduling that i learned from my mother
 

7207
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:36,790
scheduling that i learned from my mother
that i should probably tell you and that

7208
02:07:36,790 --> 02:07:36,800
that i should probably tell you and that
 

7209
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:38,149
that i should probably tell you and that
is

7210
02:07:38,149 --> 02:07:38,159
is
 

7211
02:07:38,159 --> 02:07:40,310
is
um it's different from what people in

7212
02:07:40,310 --> 02:07:40,320
um it's different from what people in
 

7213
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:42,870
um it's different from what people in
robotics field do which is called

7214
02:07:42,870 --> 02:07:42,880
robotics field do which is called
 

7215
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:44,550
robotics field do which is called
planning

7216
02:07:44,550 --> 02:07:44,560
planning
 

7217
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:47,510
planning
so she had this principle

7218
02:07:47,510 --> 02:07:47,520
so she had this principle
 

7219
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:49,350
so she had this principle
that was

7220
02:07:49,350 --> 02:07:49,360
that was
 

7221
02:07:49,360 --> 02:07:51,109
that was
see something that needs to be done and

7222
02:07:51,109 --> 02:07:51,119
see something that needs to be done and
 

7223
02:07:51,119 --> 02:07:53,669
see something that needs to be done and
do it

7224
02:07:53,669 --> 02:07:53,679

 

7225
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:54,950

you know i would just

7226
02:07:54,950 --> 02:07:54,960
you know i would just
 

7227
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:56,470
you know i would just
instead of saying i'm going to do this

7228
02:07:56,470 --> 02:07:56,480
instead of saying i'm going to do this
 

7229
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,790
instead of saying i'm going to do this
first and do this first

7230
02:07:58,790 --> 02:07:58,800
first and do this first
 

7231
02:07:58,800 --> 02:07:59,589
first and do this first
just

7232
02:07:59,589 --> 02:07:59,599
just
 

7233
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:02,550
just

7843
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:01,669
because that would mean that
a thousand thousand people of russia

7844
02:19:01,669 --> 02:19:01,679
a thousand thousand people of russia
 

7845

a thousand thousand people of russia
would would be killed that wouldn't be

otherwise killed
 

7849
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:08,230

02:19:08,230 --> 02:19:08,240
all right and so
 

7851
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:10,469
all right and so
his his life's goal

02:19:15,910 --> 02:19:15,920
a russian prince who's visiting england
 

7857
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,150
a russian prince who's visiting england

02:19:18,150 --> 02:19:18,160
because that will make will mean the
 

7859
02:19:18,160 --> 02:19:19,990

czar will not form the alliance all

7860
02:19:19,990 --> 02:19:20,000
czar will not form the alliance all
 

7861

right
 

7863
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:23,509
right
so we have this

7864
02:19:23,509 --> 02:19:23,519
so we have this
 

7865
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:25,190
so we have this
question

7866
02:19:25,190 --> 02:19:25,200
question
 

7867
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:27,429

02:19:28,870 --> 02:19:28,880
should it actually
 

7871
02:19:28,880 --> 02:19:30,870
should it actually
do something that will lead to

7872
02:19:30,870 --> 02:19:30,880
do something that will lead to
 

7873
02:19:30,880 --> 02:19:33,030
do something that will lead to
