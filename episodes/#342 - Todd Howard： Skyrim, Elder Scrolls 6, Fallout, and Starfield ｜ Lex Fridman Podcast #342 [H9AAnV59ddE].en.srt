usually you're going to find a door or a
 

93
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,510
usually you're going to find a door or a
space where the designers didn't uh

up and getting over a wall
 

99
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,929
up and getting over a wall
that they didn't expect right so it's

100
00:01:59,929 --> 00:01:59,939
that they didn't expect right so it's
 

101
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,010
that they didn't expect right so it's
not a designed doorway out it's uh

102
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,020
not a designed doorway out it's uh
 

103
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,830
not a designed doorway out it's uh
accidental unintended doorway out and

104
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:06,840
accidental unintended doorway out and
 

105
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,469
accidental unintended doorway out and
it's a it's a happy bug you could like

106
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:09,479
it's a it's a happy bug you could like
 

107
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,390
it's a it's a happy bug you could like
trim and show just get in the ocean and

108
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,400
trim and show just get in the ocean and
 

109
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,670
trim and show just get in the ocean and
go until just keep going and keep going

110
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:13,680
go until just keep going and keep going
 

111
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,070
go until just keep going and keep going
right but the more realistic the game

112
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,080
right but the more realistic the game
 

113
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,869
right but the more realistic the game
becomes the harder it is to find that

114
00:02:17,869 --> 00:02:17,879
becomes the harder it is to find that
 

115
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,270
becomes the harder it is to find that
door the the bigger the world the bigger

116
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:20,280
door the the bigger the world the bigger
 

117
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,710
door the the bigger the world the bigger
the open world

118
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:21,720
the open world
 

119
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,890
the open world
and then as we do it we learn

120
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:24,900
and then as we do it we learn
 

121
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,890
and then as we do it we learn
they're going to find a way so just

122
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:26,900
they're going to find a way so just
 

123
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,710
they're going to find a way so just
don't try to pen them in usually we

124
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:30,720
don't try to pen them in usually we
 

125
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,369
don't try to pen them in usually we
leave like this developer test cell yeah

126
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:34,379
leave like this developer test cell yeah
 

127
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,229
leave like this developer test cell yeah
area in the game that we don't

128
00:02:36,229 --> 00:02:36,239

129
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,470

anticipate anyone will find and and they
 

131
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,290
anticipate anyone will find and and they
ultimately find it it usually has crates

132
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:42,300
ultimately find it it usually has crates
 

133
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,850
ultimately find it it usually has crates
of all the weapons in the game and

a lot of times when you write characters

and there's some characters like that
 

161
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,030
and there's some characters like that
that the player definitely cares about

162
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,040
that the player definitely cares about
 

163
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,790

so there's an AI
 

273
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,570

there's a manager for all the people and

rest of the world is going to shut down
so that they can really make that as

we're I I really prefer that the rest of

we're I I really prefer that the rest of
 

317
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,790
we're I I really prefer that the rest of
it's going on it's more of a simulation

318
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:22,800
it's going on it's more of a simulation
 

319
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,890
it's going on it's more of a simulation
that we're building

00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:24,900
that we're building
 

321
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,309
that we're building
so when those things Collide that's

322
00:06:28,309 --> 00:06:28,319
so when those things Collide that's
 

323
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,550
so when those things Collide that's
where it gets the most interesting

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:31,560
where it gets the most interesting
 

325
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,010
where it gets the most interesting
and so we're running all of those people

326
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:34,020
and so we're running all of those people
 

327
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,809
and so we're running all of those people
and understanding where they want to go

328
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:35,819
and understanding where they want to go
 

329
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:37,129
and understanding where they want to go
and their cycles and what they want to

330
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:37,139
and their cycles and what they want to
 

331
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,689
and their cycles and what they want to
do and the ones that are closer to you

332
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:38,699
do and the ones that are closer to you
 

333
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,850
do and the ones that are closer to you
we just update a lot more it's one way

334
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:40,860
we just update a lot more it's one way
 

335
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,990
we just update a lot more it's one way
to think about it

336
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
to think about it
 

337
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,150
to think about it
I mean that's really fascinating that's

338
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,160
I mean that's really fascinating that's
 

339
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,370
I mean that's really fascinating that's
something that people had um

340
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:46,380
something that people had um
 

341
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,529
something that people had um
they're wondering about to what degree

342
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:48,539
they're wondering about to what degree
 

343
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:52,909
they're wondering about to what degree
is possible to run the world without you

344
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:52,919
is possible to run the world without you
 

345
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:55,610
is possible to run the world without you
so there is a feeling to role-playing

346
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:55,620
so there is a feeling to role-playing
 

347
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,230
so there is a feeling to role-playing
games that you're the central you're at

348
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,240
games that you're the central you're at
 

349
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,550
games that you're the central you're at
the center of the world the whole world

350
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:58,560
the center of the world the whole world
 

351
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,370
the center of the world the whole world
rotates around you as it does in normal

352
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:01,380
rotates around you as it does in normal
 

353
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,290
rotates around you as it does in normal
life like when we walk around it there's

354
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:03,300
life like when we walk around it there's
 

355
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,189
life like when we walk around it there's
a

356
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:04,199
a
 

357
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,950
a
when you forget yourself you start to

358
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:06,960
when you forget yourself you start to
 

359
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,450
when you forget yourself you start to
take yourself very seriously like you

360
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,460
take yourself very seriously like you
 

361
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,309
take yourself very seriously like you
are the center of the world uh you

362
00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
are the center of the world uh you
 

363
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,870
are the center of the world uh you
forget that there's eight billion people

364
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:11,880
forget that there's eight billion people
 

365
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,610
forget that there's eight billion people
on Earth and if you gotta have lies

366
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:13,620
on Earth and if you gotta have lies
 

367
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,590
on Earth and if you gotta have lies
that's actually a sobering realization

368
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:15,600
that's actually a sobering realization
 

369
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,629
that's actually a sobering realization
that they all have really interesting

370
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:17,639
that they all have really interesting
 

371
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:20,089
that they all have really interesting
life stories and they have their worries

372
00:07:20,089 --> 00:07:20,099
life stories and they have their worries
 

373
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,550
life stories and they have their worries
they suffer in different

374
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:22,560
they suffer in different
 

375
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,129
they suffer in different
complicated ways

376
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:25,139
complicated ways
 

377
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:26,930
complicated ways
and yet

378
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:26,940
and yet
 

379
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,610
and yet
when you play a role-playing game

380
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:28,620
when you play a role-playing game
 

381
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,870
when you play a role-playing game
there's a

382
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:29,880
there's a
 

383
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,850
there's a
I mean both computationally from a

384
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:31,860
I mean both computationally from a
 

385
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,730
I mean both computationally from a
storytelling perspective you wonder if

386
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:34,740
storytelling perspective you wonder if
 

387
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,350
storytelling perspective you wonder if
the world goes on without you like if

388
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:36,360
the world goes on without you like if
 

389
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,029
the world goes on without you like if
you come back if you take a break and

390
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:38,039
you come back if you take a break and
 

391
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,309
you come back if you take a break and
you come back is there still a bustling

392
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:40,319
you come back is there still a bustling
 

393
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,430
you come back is there still a bustling
town that now has a history since you

394
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:43,440
town that now has a history since you
 

395
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,249
town that now has a history since you
have last visited so to what degree can

396
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:46,259
have last visited so to what degree can
 

397
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:48,830
have last visited so to what degree can
you create a world that goes on without

398
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:48,840
you create a world that goes on without
 

399
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,529
you create a world that goes on without
you or goes on at the same time as you

400
00:07:51,529 --> 00:07:51,539
you or goes on at the same time as you
 

401
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,089
you or goes on at the same time as you
do your thing whatever the heck you're

402
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:53,099
do your thing whatever the heck you're
 

403
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:55,370
do your thing whatever the heck you're
doing we don't prioritize the stuff you

404
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:55,380
doing we don't prioritize the stuff you
 

405
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,529
doing we don't prioritize the stuff you
can't see so it's more like an amusement

406
00:07:57,529 --> 00:07:57,539
can't see so it's more like an amusement
 

407
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,870
can't see so it's more like an amusement
park if you study like the design or

408
00:07:59,870 --> 00:07:59,880
park if you study like the design or
 

409
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,129
park if you study like the design or
level designers did this how do they

410
00:08:01,129 --> 00:08:01,139
level designers did this how do they
 

411
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,290
level designers did this how do they
build Disney World in these places so it

412
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:03,300
build Disney World in these places so it
 

413
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,790
build Disney World in these places so it
still exists

414
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:04,800
still exists
 

415
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,890
still exists
for you the player

416
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:06,900
for you the player
 

417
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,870
for you the player
so it is fairly you know when you're

418
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:08,880
so it is fairly you know when you're
 

419
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,010
so it is fairly you know when you're
going to come in this is what you're

420
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,020
going to come in this is what you're
 

421
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,629
going to come in this is what you're
going to see the shops are in the front

422
00:08:11,629 --> 00:08:11,639
going to see the shops are in the front
 

423
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:13,189
going to see the shops are in the front
you're going to do this

424
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:13,199
you're going to do this
 

425
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,629
you're going to do this
it's just for us to make it far more

426
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:16,639
it's just for us to make it far more
 

427
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,369
it's just for us to make it far more
believable and get some more emergent

428
00:08:19,369 --> 00:08:19,379
believable and get some more emergent
 

429
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:20,809
believable and get some more emergent
Behavior

430
00:08:20,809 --> 00:08:20,819
Behavior
 

431
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,050
Behavior
that not just make that sort of

432
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:24,060
that not just make that sort of
 

433
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,390
that not just make that sort of
the versamillitude of what you're in for

434
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:26,400
the versamillitude of what you're in for
 

435
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,770
the versamillitude of what you're in for
that moment

436
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:27,780
that moment
 

437
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,710
that moment
but you you buy it all I always say like

438
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:30,720
but you you buy it all I always say like
 

439
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,449
but you you buy it all I always say like
you know we got to do the little things

440
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:32,459
you know we got to do the little things
 

441
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,870
you know we got to do the little things
so that you buy the reality of the

442
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:35,880
so that you buy the reality of the
 

443
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,610
so that you buy the reality of the
virtual world you're in so we want to do

444
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:37,620
virtual world you're in so we want to do
 

445
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,709
virtual world you're in so we want to do
something crazy you know when a dragon

446
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:39,719
something crazy you know when a dragon
 

447
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,630
something crazy you know when a dragon
lands or a death law comes out of the

448
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:41,640
lands or a death law comes out of the
 

449
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,370
lands or a death law comes out of the
Wasteland or those kind of things that

450
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:43,380
Wasteland or those kind of things that
 

451
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,310
Wasteland or those kind of things that
you it has the impact to you as the

452
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:46,320
you it has the impact to you as the
 

453
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,210
you it has the impact to you as the
viewer

454
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:47,220
viewer
 

455
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,930
viewer
that it would to the people in the world

456
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:50,940
that it would to the people in the world
 

457
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,009
that it would to the people in the world
okay

458
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:52,019
okay
 

459
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,170
okay
but still you are simulating stuff

460
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,180
but still you are simulating stuff
 

461
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,090
but still you are simulating stuff
that's close to you it is a bit of a

462
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:56,100
that's close to you it is a bit of a
 

463
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,970
that's close to you it is a bit of a
simulation going on oh absolutely yes

464
00:08:58,970 --> 00:08:58,980
simulation going on oh absolutely yes
 

465
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,889
simulation going on oh absolutely yes
and so that creates some interesting

466
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:00,899
and so that creates some interesting
 

467
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:03,050
and so that creates some interesting
Dynamics then and the stuff that we're

468
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,060
Dynamics then and the stuff that we're
 

469
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,570
Dynamics then and the stuff that we're
looking at in the future in our plan is

470
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:05,580
looking at in the future in our plan is
 

471
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,490
looking at in the future in our plan is
to push that even more

472
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:07,500
to push that even more
 

473
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,850
to push that even more
to think about

474
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:10,860

 

475
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,490

how these things exist in the world

476
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:13,500
how these things exist in the world
 

477
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,290
how these things exist in the world
first

478
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:15,300
first
 

479
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,210
first
then we do some of this but even more so

480
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,220
then we do some of this but even more so
 

481
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,949
then we do some of this but even more so
in the future to say how do these things

482
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:18,959
in the future to say how do these things
 

483
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,530
in the future to say how do these things
exist take like a faction in the world

484
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:21,540
exist take like a faction in the world
 

485
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:24,530
exist take like a faction in the world
what is their role in the world as

00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:19,740
let's go to the very beginning what's
 

743
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,889
let's go to the very beginning what's
the origin story you know what let's

744

the origin story you know what let's
even go before then what's uh when's the

00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:07,440
being in fifth grade when the TRS-80 was
 

783
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,870
being in fifth grade when the TRS-80 was
brought into the classroom and there was

784
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:08,880
brought into the classroom and there was
 

785
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,310

a Star Trek game
 

787
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,850
a Star Trek game
and I was enamored with it

788
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:13,860
and I was enamored with it
 

789
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,470
and I was enamored with it
and they were going to start teaching

790
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:15,480
and they were going to start teaching
 

791
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,470
and they were going to start teaching
some rudimentary programming like okay

792
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:18,480
some rudimentary programming like okay
 

793
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,629
some rudimentary programming like okay
would you like to know how this is made

794
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:20,639
would you like to know how this is made
 

795
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,569
would you like to know how this is made
and I was I was hooked I was like I need

796
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:23,579
and I was I was hooked I was like I need
 

797
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:25,610
and I was I was hooked I was like I need
to figure out how to make this stuff

798
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:25,620
to figure out how to make this stuff
 

799
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,310
to figure out how to make this stuff
and so I was just you know self-taught

800
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:28,320
and so I was just you know self-taught
 

801
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,009
and so I was just you know self-taught
programmer and my whole goal

802
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:31,019
programmer and my whole goal
 

803
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:34,250
programmer and my whole goal
was to write my own video games

804
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:34,260
was to write my own video games
 

805
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,050
was to write my own video games
and uh

806

you know by sixth seventh grade I had
 

809
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:41,030
you know by sixth seventh grade I had
written my own much better Star Trek

810
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,040
written my own much better Star Trek
 

811
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,910
written my own much better Star Trek
clone for this yeah of course Apple II

812
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:43,920
clone for this yeah of course Apple II
 

813
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,990
clone for this yeah of course Apple II
um and uh I really enjoyed programming

814
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:48,000
um and uh I really enjoyed programming
 

815
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,730
um and uh I really enjoyed programming
on the Apple II then

816
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:49,740
on the Apple II then
 

817
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,769
on the Apple II then
and that I think was the right level of

818
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:51,779
and that I think was the right level of
 

819
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:53,269
and that I think was the right level of
like complexity

820
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:53,279
like complexity
 

821
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,310
like complexity
you know at that age where you could

822
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:55,320
you know at that age where you could
 

823
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,230
you know at that age where you could
kind of you were always learning but you

824
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:57,240
kind of you were always learning but you
 

825
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,850
kind of you were always learning but you
could still understand a lot of the

826
00:15:58,850 --> 00:15:58,860
could still understand a lot of the
 

827
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,889
could still understand a lot of the
problem set for like this is when I when

828
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:00,899
problem set for like this is when I when
 

829
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:02,569
problem set for like this is when I when
I get on the screen

830
00:16:02,569 --> 00:16:02,579
I get on the screen
 

831
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:05,629
I get on the screen
and I was also into art so I did a lot

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:05,639
and I was also into art so I did a lot
 

833
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,310
and I was also into art so I did a lot
of Art and I did a lot of programming

834
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:07,320
of Art and I did a lot of programming
 

835
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,710
of Art and I did a lot of programming
and I was always making games that was

843
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,069
making games like how did you think of
it was it from a graphics perspective

844
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:19,079
it was it from a graphics perspective
 

845
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:21,350
it was it from a graphics perspective
like what shows up on screen

846
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:21,360
like what shows up on screen

like what what like um
what does it mean to create a video game

856
00:16:32,509 --> 00:16:32,519
what does it mean to create a video game
 

857
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,629
what does it mean to create a video game
at that young age to you well it was a

858

the Wizardry and Ultima that were able
 

883
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,130
the Wizardry and Ultima that were able
to bring that to a computer so I could

884
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:04,140
to bring that to a computer so I could
 

885
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,470

and then oh no I have to go to school I
 

893
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,730
and then oh no I have to go to school I
want to come home and figure out how to

894
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:13,740
want to come home and figure out how to
 

895
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,250
want to come home and figure out how to
how to do this problem in the game

896
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:16,260
how to do this problem in the game
 

897
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,289
how to do this problem in the game
and so whatever I was creating was

898
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:18,299
and so whatever I was creating was
 

899
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:20,990
and so whatever I was creating was
something that I was excited about at

900
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,000
something that I was excited about at
 

901
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,949
something that I was excited about at
the time

902
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:21,959
the time
 

903
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:25,490
the time
I made a Raiders of the Lost Ark games

904
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:25,500
I made a Raiders of the Lost Ark games
 

905
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,990
I made a Raiders of the Lost Ark games
um like with graphics and everything

906
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,000
um like with graphics and everything
 

907
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,909
um like with graphics and everything
yeah I was so it was usually you know

908
00:17:28,909 --> 00:17:28,919
yeah I was so it was usually you know
 

909
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,250
yeah I was so it was usually you know
made a Miami Vice game made it grew The

910
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:31,260
made a Miami Vice game made it grew The
 

911
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,530
made a Miami Vice game made it grew The
Wanderer game made a traveler game I

912
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:33,540
Wanderer game made a traveler game I
 

913
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,450
Wanderer game made a traveler game I
made and but every time I was doing it I

914
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:35,460
made and but every time I was doing it I
 

915
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,930
made and but every time I was doing it I
wanted to figure out a new method on the

916
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:38,940
wanted to figure out a new method on the
 

917
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,090
wanted to figure out a new method on the
Apple II of pulling it off graphically

918
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:41,100
Apple II of pulling it off graphically
 

919
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,909
Apple II of pulling it off graphically
whether that was editing character sets

920
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:43,919
whether that was editing character sets
 

921
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,029
whether that was editing character sets
to get Graphics in different formats or

922
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:47,039
to get Graphics in different formats or
 

923
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,390
to get Graphics in different formats or
how can I enable the secret double high

924
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,400
how can I enable the secret double high
 

925
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,570
how can I enable the secret double high
res mode it had or just things like that

926
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:53,580
res mode it had or just things like that
 

927
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,610
res mode it had or just things like that
where it became kind of this Limitless

928
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:55,620
where it became kind of this Limitless
 

929
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,370
where it became kind of this Limitless
what can I make this do and I had some

930
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:58,380
what can I make this do and I had some
 

931
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,570
what can I make this do and I had some
friends who were doing the same thing

932
00:17:59,570 --> 00:17:59,580
friends who were doing the same thing
 

933
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,850
friends who were doing the same thing
and then you get into who can impress

934
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:01,860
and then you get into who can impress
 

935
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,070
and then you get into who can impress
each other and I was kind of middle of

936
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:04,080
each other and I was kind of middle of
 

937
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,529
each other and I was kind of middle of
the pack I would say

938
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:06,539
the pack I would say
 

939
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:07,490
the pack I would say
um

940
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:07,500
um
 

941
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,470
um
and that but but again this was the time

942

and that but but again this was the time
 

943
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,850
and that but but again this was the time
where they're bringing computers into

944
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:10,860
where they're bringing computers into
 

945
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,470
where they're bringing computers into
the school then the apples come into the

946
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:12,480
the school then the apples come into the
 

947
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,450
the school then the apples come into the
school and the teachers

948
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:14,460
school and the teachers
 

949
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,610
school and the teachers
are learning it because they have to

950
00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:16,620
are learning it because they have to
 

951
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,350
are learning it because they have to
teach the students but then I was I

would say I was part of a group of

954
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:19,380
would say I was part of a group of
 

955
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,970
would say I was part of a group of
students that were like way past that

956
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:22,980
students that were like way past that
 

957
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,810
students that were like way past that
um and it was very much of a self-taught

958
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:26,820
um and it was very much of a self-taught
 

959
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,789
um and it was very much of a self-taught
uh you know how do you make this thing

960
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:28,799
uh you know how do you make this thing
 

961
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,450
uh you know how do you make this thing

floppy it was yeah it's I believe it's
 

1243
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,930
floppy it was yeah it's I believe it's
six floppy disks six floppy disks maybe

1244
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:53,940
six floppy disks six floppy disks maybe
 

1245
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,310
six floppy disks six floppy disks maybe
it was eight

1246
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,320
it was eight
 

1247
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,770
it was eight
yeah but in those days the number of

1248
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:57,780
yeah but in those days the number of
 

1249
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:00,289
yeah but in those days the number of
floppy disks was very very important to

1250
00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:00,299
floppy disks was very very important to
 

1251
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,730
floppy disks was very very important to
what

1252
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:01,740
what
 

1253
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,770
what
the money you were making

so you know if you want to do a big huge
 

1257
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,190
so you know if you want to do a big huge
game like well that's just too many

1258
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:07,200
game like well that's just too many
 

1259
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,970
game like well that's just too many
discs so the CD-ROM became this

1260
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:10,980
discs so the CD-ROM became this
 

1261
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,010
discs so the CD-ROM became this
this jumping off point for the whole

1262
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:13,020
this jumping off point for the whole
 

1263
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:17,270
this jumping off point for the whole
industry where oh it's unlimited data

1264
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,280
industry where oh it's unlimited data
 

1265
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:21,310

00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:44,330
instanced objects all over it and
that is still a lot of how we build our

1438
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:44,340
that is still a lot of how we build our
 

1439
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,570
that is still a lot of how we build our
worlds what's an instanced object it's

1440
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:47,580
worlds what's an instanced object it's
 

1441
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,390
worlds what's an instanced object it's
you know some games every

1442
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:50,400
you know some games every
 

1443
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,149
you know some games every
uh you know wall or building is kind of

1444
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:53,159
uh you know wall or building is kind of
 

1445
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:56,810
uh you know wall or building is kind of
unique in its data whereas we would just

1446
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:56,820
unique in its data whereas we would just
 

1447
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,430
unique in its data whereas we would just
build you know these little husks of

1448
00:27:58,430 --> 00:27:58,440
build you know these little husks of
 

1449
00:27:58,440 --> 00:27:59,990
build you know these little husks of
buildings and then place them all over

1450
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:00,000
buildings and then place them all over
 

1451
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,330
buildings and then place them all over
the place so the memory and the way you

1452
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:02,340
the place so the memory and the way you
 

1453
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,269
the place so the memory and the way you
render it is much more optimal so that

1454
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:05,279
render it is much more optimal so that
 

1455
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,310
render it is much more optimal so that
allows you to build a bigger World once

1456
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:07,320
allows you to build a bigger World once
 

1457
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,950
allows you to build a bigger World once
you build a bigger World much faster and

1458
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:09,960
you build a bigger World much faster and
 

1459
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,210
you build a bigger World much faster and
not

1460
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:11,220
not
 

1461
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,310
not
um you know not every single version of

1462
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,320
um you know not every single version of
 

1463
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,990
um you know not every single version of
that building is in its own unique

1464
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:15,000
that building is in its own unique
 

1465
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,029
that building is in its own unique
architecture that is going to take up

1466
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:17,039
architecture that is going to take up
 

1467
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,090
architecture that is going to take up
memory and processing speed etc etc so

1468
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:20,100
memory and processing speed etc etc so
 

1469
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,830
memory and processing speed etc etc so
you're they're very much feeling the

1470
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:21,840
you're they're very much feeling the
 

1471
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,330
you're they're very much feeling the
computational constraints of the system

1472
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:23,340
computational constraints of the system
 

1473
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,830
computational constraints of the system
when you're creating these open ones and

1474
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:24,840
when you're creating these open ones and
 

1475
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,049
when you're creating these open ones and
you know what that's the thing then you

1476
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:27,059
you know what that's the thing then you
 

1477
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:30,169
you know what that's the thing then you
see some of it now but in those times I

1478
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:30,179
see some of it now but in those times I
 

1479
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:33,649
see some of it now but in those times I
do feel like every year the technology

1480
00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:33,659
do feel like every year the technology
 

1481
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,510
do feel like every year the technology
moved and maybe it's because same thing

1482
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
moved and maybe it's because same thing
 

1483
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,029
moved and maybe it's because same thing
we're like that my age at that time

1484
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:37,039
we're like that my age at that time
 

1485
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,370
we're like that my age at that time
where every year somebody was coming up

1486
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,380
where every year somebody was coming up
 

1487
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:43,549
where every year somebody was coming up
with some new method or some new game

1488
00:28:43,549 --> 00:28:43,559
with some new method or some new game
 

1489
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,630
with some new method or some new game
system

1490
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:44,640
system
 

1491
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,970
system
and

1492
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:46,980
and
 

1493
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,250
and
it was every year that Innovation

1494
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,260
it was every year that Innovation
 

1495
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:52,310
it was every year that Innovation
Innovation Innovation and then you know

1496
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:52,320
Innovation Innovation and then you know
 

1497
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,830
Innovation Innovation and then you know
3D acceleration comes along and then

1498
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:54,840
3D acceleration comes along and then
 

1499
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,390
3D acceleration comes along and then
these things come along and then HD

1500
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:56,400
these things come along and then HD
 

1501
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,430
these things come along and then HD
comes along and it is true that as time

1502
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:58,440
comes along and it is true that as time
 

1503
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,669
comes along and it is true that as time
goes on there is visually a diminishing

1504
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
goes on there is visually a diminishing
 

1505
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,370
goes on there is visually a diminishing

00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:04,380
return in terms of
 

1507
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,890

what you're able to do on the screen and

1508
00:29:06,890 --> 00:29:06,900
what you're able to do on the screen and
 

1509
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,990
what you're able to do on the screen and
it there's a ton of work that goes into

1510
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:09,000
it there's a ton of work that goes into
 

1511
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,269
it there's a ton of work that goes into
it now because just rendering this cup

1512
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
it now because just rendering this cup
 

1513
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,970
it now because just rendering this cup
to the perfect shine and material and

1514
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:13,980
to the perfect shine and material and

illumination off this wallet gets a ton

1518
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:17,700
illumination off this wallet gets a ton
 

1519
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,210
illumination off this wallet gets a ton
of work

1520
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:19,220
of work
 

1521
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,950
of work
but you can pretty much do what you want

1522
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:21,960
but you can pretty much do what you want
 

1523
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,630
but you can pretty much do what you want
now if you want to put the time in

1524
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:23,640
now if you want to put the time in
 

1525
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,029
now if you want to put the time in
whereas then okay you can't do

1526
00:29:26,029 --> 00:29:26,039
whereas then okay you can't do
 

1527
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:27,529
whereas then okay you can't do
everything you want

1528
00:29:27,529 --> 00:29:27,539
everything you want
 

1529
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:28,730
everything you want
so

1530
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:28,740
so
 

1531
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,210
so
pick your battles really carefully and

1532
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:32,220
pick your battles really carefully and
 

1533
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,769
pick your battles really carefully and
it technically you couldn't do what you

1534
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:33,779
it technically you couldn't do what you
 

1535
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,630
it technically you couldn't do what you
want if that makes sense how much

1536
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:35,640
want if that makes sense how much
 

1537
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,470
want if that makes sense how much
trade-off is there now in um how much

1538
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:39,480
trade-off is there now in um how much
 

1539
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,810
trade-off is there now in um how much
effort you put into

1540
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:41,820
effort you put into
 

1541
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,529
effort you put into
the the realism of the graphics versus

1542
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:45,539
the the realism of the graphics versus
 

1543
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:47,990
the the realism of the graphics versus
the story and actually not even how much

1544
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:48,000
the story and actually not even how much
 

1545
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,870
the story and actually not even how much
effort you put in but is there um

1546
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:50,880
effort you put in but is there um
 

1547
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,210
effort you put in but is there um
a trade-off in the experience the feel

1548
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:53,220
a trade-off in the experience the feel
 

1549
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,409
a trade-off in the experience the feel
of the game

1550
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:54,419
of the game
 

1551
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:57,649
of the game
in terms of realism and story

1552
00:29:57,649 --> 00:29:57,659
in terms of realism and story
 

1553
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,889
in terms of realism and story
usually we will start with let the

1554
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:00,899
usually we will start with let the
 

1555
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:03,110
usually we will start with let the
player have as much agency and do as

1556
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,120
player have as much agency and do as
 

1557
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,570
player have as much agency and do as
many things as they can as possible and

1558
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:05,580
many things as they can as possible and
 

1559
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,669
many things as they can as possible and
we will sacrifice

1560
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
we will sacrifice
 

1561
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,769
we will sacrifice
some graphic Fidelity for that some

1562
00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:09,779
some graphic Fidelity for that some
 

1563
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:11,930
some graphic Fidelity for that some
speed for that you know we could make a

1564
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:11,940
speed for that you know we could make a
 

1565
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,850
speed for that you know we could make a
game that

1566
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:13,860
game that
 

1567
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,830
game that
you know our traditionally our games are

1568
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:15,840
you know our traditionally our games are
 

1569
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,750
you know our traditionally our games are
you know we okay with 30 frames a second

1570
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:17,760
you know we okay with 30 frames a second
 

1571
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,190
you know we okay with 30 frames a second
as long as it looks really good and the

1572
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:19,200
as long as it looks really good and the
 

1573
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,510
as long as it looks really good and the
simulation is running and all of those

1574
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:20,520
simulation is running and all of those
 

1575
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,549
simulation is running and all of those
things so we'll we'll sacrifice some of

1576
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:22,559
things so we'll we'll sacrifice some of
 

1577
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,190
things so we'll we'll sacrifice some of
that Fidelity for the player experience

1578
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,200
that Fidelity for the player experience
 

1579
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,529
that Fidelity for the player experience
in in this the kind of things that that

1580
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:27,539
in in this the kind of things that that
 

1581
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:29,389
in in this the kind of things that that
I do

1582
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:29,399
I do
 

1583
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,730
I do
um but from like a Manpower standpoint

1584
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:31,740
um but from like a Manpower standpoint
 

1585
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,649
um but from like a Manpower standpoint
the graphics programmers work on

1586
00:30:33,649 --> 00:30:33,659
the graphics programmers work on
 

1587
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,269
the graphics programmers work on
Graphics the artists work on Art and we

1588
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:35,279
Graphics the artists work on Art and we
 

1589
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,070
Graphics the artists work on Art and we
have a you know awesome team of artists

1590
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,080
have a you know awesome team of artists
 

1591
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,990
have a you know awesome team of artists
and designers and writers and

1592
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:39,000
and designers and writers and
 

1593
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,630
and designers and writers and
programmers it's usually where we find

1594
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:41,640

and so
 

1823
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,109
and so
finding that what's going to make it

1824
00:35:24,109 --> 00:35:24,119
finding that what's going to make it
 

1825
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:26,930
finding that what's going to make it
kind of unique and usually I lean on

00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:26,940
kind of unique and usually I lean on
 

1827
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,829
kind of unique and usually I lean on
something that is grounded in

something that is grounded in
 

1829
00:35:30,839 --> 00:35:33,530
something that is grounded in
reality for what it is

and then have lesser kind of
Fantastical things at least at the start

1834
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:41,760
Fantastical things at least at the start
 

1835
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,970
Fantastical things at least at the start
and then they they kind of build so even

1836
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:43,980
and then they they kind of build so even
 

1837
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:46,430
and then they they kind of build so even
when we do star field I mean it's a

1838
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:46,440
when we do star field I mean it's a
 

1839

1977
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:24,589
they and ours are less I believe they're
less Fantastical looking in general they

1978
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:24,599
less Fantastical looking in general they
 

1979
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,290
less Fantastical looking in general they
look like beasts that could exist in

1980
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:27,300
look like beasts that could exist in
 

1981
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,790
look like beasts that could exist in
that World

1982

um and then how we introduce them it's
 

1985
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,290
um and then how we introduce them it's
kind of a little bit of a slow

1986
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:33,300
kind of a little bit of a slow
 

1987
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:36,829
kind of a little bit of a slow
you know role in Skyrim and that the

1988
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:36,839
you know role in Skyrim and that the
 

1989
00:38:36,839 --> 00:38:38,930
you know role in Skyrim and that the
people in the world are reacting to the

1990
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:38,940
people in the world are reacting to the
 

1991
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,150
people in the world are reacting to the
dragons appearing

1992
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,160
dragons appearing

want something that mirrors the player
 

1997
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,329
want something that mirrors the player

2015
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,970
I'm playing it and I'm searching pretty
sure

2016
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:06,980

 

2017
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,990

to my memory look I guess someone would

2018
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,000
to my memory look I guess someone would
 

2019
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,190
to my memory look I guess someone would
probably correct me like actually there

2020
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:10,200
probably correct me like actually there
 

2021
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,630
probably correct me like actually there
is a dragon here

is a dragon here
 

2023
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,490

00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:13,500
um but I'm pretty sure they're sort of
 

2025
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,370
um but I'm pretty sure they're sort of
they're not yeah and then

2026
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:16,380

00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:29,160
the time yeah uh just a brief tangent on
 

2037
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,829
the time yeah uh just a brief tangent on
that I thought redgar was a really

2038
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:30,839
that I thought redgar was a really
 

2039

there's a jumping there's a dynamic like
Airy nature like it's that like Park

Airy nature like it's that like Park
 

2069
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,490
Airy nature like it's that like Park
yeah that was our situation

2070
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:07,500
yeah that was our situation
 

2071
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,410
yeah that was our situation
um yeah it was an incredible game what

2072
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:09,420
um yeah it was an incredible game what
 

2073
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:10,970
um yeah it was an incredible game what
why do you think let me ask sort of a

2074
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:10,980
why do you think let me ask sort of a
 

2075
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,470
why do you think let me ask sort of a
dark question why do you think that game

2076
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:12,480
dark question why do you think that game
 

2077

going on a handcrafted world so we're
 

2087
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:28,190
going on a handcrafted world so we're
coming off a Daggerfall Morrowind is

2088
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,200
coming off a Daggerfall Morrowind is
 

2089
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,810
coming off a Daggerfall Morrowind is
sort of in design

2090
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:29,820
sort of in design
 

2091
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,030
sort of in design
and then you know part of our

2092
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,040
and then you know part of our
 

2093
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,710
and then you know part of our
development teams broke up to do

2094
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:33,720
development teams broke up to do
 

2095
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,630
development teams broke up to do
different things this game would did

2096
00:40:35,630 --> 00:40:35,640
different things this game would did
 

2097
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,450
different things this game would did
battle spire and Red Guard was my game

and I wanted to do something a little
 

2103
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,390
and I wanted to do something a little
more Ultima feeling handcrafted world I

2104
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:44,400
more Ultima feeling handcrafted world I
 

2105
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,550
more Ultima feeling handcrafted world I
really like things that blend up genres

2106

so I know it's in the adventure game
 

2109
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,750
so I know it's in the adventure game
category but it really does a lot of

2110
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:50,760
category but it really does a lot of
 

2111

there's a lot of Ultima in it

2118
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:58,500
there's a lot of Ultima in it
 

2119
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,470
there's a lot of Ultima in it
um and really see what we could do with

2120
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:00,480
um and really see what we could do with
 

2121
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,609
um and really see what we could do with
the engine

2122
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:01,619
the engine
 

2123
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:04,849
the engine
but it's very much I think plays like it

2124
00:41:04,849 --> 00:41:04,859
but it's very much I think plays like it
 

2125
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,710
but it's very much I think plays like it
would have had a much better home on say

2126
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:06,720
would have had a much better home on say
 

2127
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,230
would have had a much better home on say

right where it's a much more like
 

2133
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,450
right where it's a much more like
constantly Tomb Raider had come out so

2134
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:14,460
constantly Tomb Raider had come out so
 

2135
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,550

do you see those influences of Tomb
 

2137
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,030
do you see those influences of Tomb
Raider on that game and

2138
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,040
Raider on that game and
 

2139
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:22,490
Raider on that game and
3D effects cards have just come out and

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,609
3D effects cards have just come out and
so okay we can do and it was the last I

2142
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:25,619
so okay we can do and it was the last I
 

2143
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,770
so okay we can do and it was the last I
think it's one of the last like dos

2144
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:27,780
think it's one of the last like dos
 

2145
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,290
think it's one of the last like dos
games in a Windows world so it I think

2146
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:30,300
games in a Windows world so it I think
 

2147
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,589
games in a Windows world so it I think
it missed kind of a technology window as

2148
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:33,599
it missed kind of a technology window as
 

2149
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,849
it missed kind of a technology window as
well as

2150
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:34,859
well as
 

2151
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,430
well as

and
I felt

xenomax media and Robert Altman came in
and we were starting more when we had

2186
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:15,720
and we were starting more when we had
 

2187
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,210
and we were starting more when we had
just sort of started and it was sort of

that whole experience that made you sort
 

2191
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:21,349
that whole experience that made you sort

2197
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,470
and that's where like okay we're gonna
make Morrowind

2198
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:27,480
make Morrowind
 

2199
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,130
make Morrowind
and make the biggest best RPG we can

2200
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:31,140
and make the biggest best RPG we can
 

2201
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,569
and make the biggest best RPG we can
make we know what the audience wants

2202
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:32,579
make we know what the audience wants
 

2203
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:34,670
make we know what the audience wants
from us we know what we could do

2204
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:34,680
from us we know what we could do
 

2205
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,530
from us we know what we could do
building a world so there's like

2206
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:36,540
building a world so there's like
 

2207
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,329
building a world so there's like
callbacks to how we built the world in

2208
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:38,339
callbacks to how we built the world in
 

2209
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:40,910
callbacks to how we built the world in
Red Guard Morrowind is a large-scale

2210
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:40,920
Red Guard Morrowind is a large-scale
 

2211
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,829
Red Guard Morrowind is a large-scale
handcrafted but if you were to put it

2212
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:42,839
handcrafted but if you were to put it
 

2213
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:44,810
handcrafted but if you were to put it
you know pixel per pixel with Daggerfall

2214
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:44,820
you know pixel per pixel with Daggerfall
 

2215
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,370
you know pixel per pixel with Daggerfall
you wouldn't even see Morrowind like

2216
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:46,380
you wouldn't even see Morrowind like
 

2217
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,770
you wouldn't even see Morrowind like
because Daggerfall is so big but the

2218
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:48,780
because Daggerfall is so big but the
 

2219
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:52,250
because Daggerfall is so big but the
impact of playing it I think is in many

2220
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:52,260
impact of playing it I think is in many
 

2221
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:54,609
impact of playing it I think is in many
ways equal but different

2222
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:54,619
ways equal but different
 

2223
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:57,890
ways equal but different
just you personally psychologically did

2224
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:57,900
just you personally psychologically did
 

2225
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,170
just you personally psychologically did
you have doubt about yourself from from

2226
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:00,180
you have doubt about yourself from from
 

2227
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,630
you have doubt about yourself from from
the performance of Red Guard like do I

2228
00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:02,640
the performance of Red Guard like do I
 

2229
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:04,730
the performance of Red Guard like do I
even do I know what it is of course of

2230
00:43:04,730 --> 00:43:04,740
even do I know what it is of course of
 

2231
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,910
even do I know what it is of course of
course where do you get the how do you

2232
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:07,920
course where do you get the how do you
 

2233
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,490
course where do you get the how do you
overcome that I

2234
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:10,500
overcome that I
 

2235
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,410
overcome that I
I don't know I would say this honestly I

2236
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:12,420
I don't know I would say this honestly I
 

2237
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,650
I don't know I would say this honestly I
enjoy it so much you know like I'm so

2238
00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:15,660
enjoy it so much you know like I'm so
 

2239
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,589
enjoy it so much you know like I'm so
I'm so heads down like that becomes For

2240
00:43:18,589 --> 00:43:18,599
I'm so heads down like that becomes For
 

2241
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,109
I'm so heads down like that becomes For
Better or Worse like my life yeah

2242
00:43:21,109 --> 00:43:21,119
Better or Worse like my life yeah
 

2243
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,089
Better or Worse like my life yeah
um and

2244
00:43:23,089 --> 00:43:23,099
um and
 

2245
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:24,890
um and
it's just something that I want to play

2246
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:24,900
it's just something that I want to play
 

2247
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,809
it's just something that I want to play
so much it becomes like there's a little

2248
00:43:26,809 --> 00:43:26,819
so much it becomes like there's a little
 

2249
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,210
so much it becomes like there's a little
bit you get a little obsessed with it no

2250
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:29,220
bit you get a little obsessed with it no
 

2251
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:32,630
bit you get a little obsessed with it no
but I mean you love Red Guard right so

2252
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:32,640
but I mean you love Red Guard right so
 

2253
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:35,630
but I mean you love Red Guard right so
like doesn't that mean isn't there a

2254
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:35,640
like doesn't that mean isn't there a
 

2255
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,430
like doesn't that mean isn't there a
kind of self-doubt about do I know what

2256
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:37,440
kind of self-doubt about do I know what
 

2257
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,470
kind of self-doubt about do I know what
it takes to create a great game well no

2258
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:39,480
it takes to create a great game well no
 

2259
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,150
it takes to create a great game well no
I think red guard's a great game right

2260
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:41,160
I think red guard's a great game right
 

2261
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,730
I think red guard's a great game right
so you were sure even if okay like do I

2262
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:43,740
so you were sure even if okay like do I
 

2263
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,770
so you were sure even if okay like do I
like that game it's about finding an odd

2264
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:45,780
like that game it's about finding an odd
 

2265
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,329
like that game it's about finding an odd
Okay so

2266
00:43:47,329 --> 00:43:47,339
Okay so
 

2267
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:49,490
Okay so
I love Red Guard yeah and the people who

2268
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:49,500
I love Red Guard yeah and the people who
 

2269
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,410
I love Red Guard yeah and the people who
play it it won the bunch of awards and

2270
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:51,420
play it it won the bunch of awards and
 

2271
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,690
play it it won the bunch of awards and
it you know it like critically was a

2272
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:53,700
it you know it like critically was a
 

2273
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,069
it you know it like critically was a
pretty good game did not sell

2274
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:57,079
pretty good game did not sell
 

2275
00:43:57,079 --> 00:43:59,569
pretty good game did not sell
and the reason for that again like we

2276
00:43:59,569 --> 00:43:59,579
and the reason for that again like we
 

2277
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,190
and the reason for that again like we
probably made this the wrong type of

2278
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:01,200
probably made this the wrong type of
 

2279
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,109
probably made this the wrong type of
game and we missed a technology window

2280
00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:03,119
game and we missed a technology window
 

2281
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:05,510
game and we missed a technology window
we also thought it was very conservative

2282
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:05,520
we also thought it was very conservative
 

2283
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,190
we also thought it was very conservative
we're gonna do this

2284
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:07,200
we're gonna do this
 

2285
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,770
we're gonna do this
so my main takeaway was I'm not going to

2286
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:09,780
so my main takeaway was I'm not going to
 

2287
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,170
so my main takeaway was I'm not going to
be conservative again I'm going to swing

2288
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:12,180
be conservative again I'm going to swing
 

2289
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,410
be conservative again I'm going to swing
for the fences and we've had you know

2290
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:15,420
for the fences and we've had you know
 

2291
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,270
for the fences and we've had you know
there'll be some rough edges in swinging

2292
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:17,280
there'll be some rough edges in swinging
 

2293
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:18,829
there'll be some rough edges in swinging
for the fences and shooting for the moon

2294
00:44:18,829 --> 00:44:18,839
for the fences and shooting for the moon
 

2295
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:20,809
for the fences and shooting for the moon
but we'd rather do that in the land

2296
00:44:20,809 --> 00:44:20,819
but we'd rather do that in the land
 

2297
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:22,730
but we'd rather do that in the land
where we land than be very very

2298
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:22,740
where we land than be very very
 

2299
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,170
where we land than be very very
conservative

2300
00:44:24,170 --> 00:44:24,180
conservative
 

2301
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,990
conservative
and what we're putting out there

2302
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,000
and what we're putting out there
 

2303
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,870
and what we're putting out there
you've mentioned just referencing this

2304
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:29,880
you've mentioned just referencing this
 

2305
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,069
you've mentioned just referencing this
game uh on a Reddit AMA that long time

2306
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:34,079
game uh on a Reddit AMA that long time
 

2307
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,290
game uh on a Reddit AMA that long time
ago during Red Guard the lead programmer

2308
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:36,300
ago during Red Guard the lead programmer
 

2309
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:37,370
ago during Red Guard the lead programmer
made me

2310
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:37,380
made me
 

2311
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:39,950
made me
made all the buildings up up and down

2312
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:39,960
made all the buildings up up and down
 

2313
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,109
made all the buildings up up and down
after you played for 10 minutes just to

2314
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:42,119
after you played for 10 minutes just to
 

2315
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:44,930
after you played for 10 minutes just to
mess with me uh just a curious tangent

2316
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:44,940
mess with me uh just a curious tangent
 

2317
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,690
mess with me uh just a curious tangent
what What's um involved with programming

2318
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:47,700
what What's um involved with programming
 

2319
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,069
what What's um involved with programming
in open world game so so we talked about

2320
00:44:51,069 --> 00:44:51,079
in open world game so so we talked about
 

2321
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,530
in open world game so so we talked about
we will talk about design and so on but

2322
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:54,540
we will talk about design and so on but
 

2323
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,690
we will talk about design and so on but
specifically the programming because I

2324
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:56,700
specifically the programming because I
 

2325
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,970
specifically the programming because I
think this question came from what are

2326
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:58,980
think this question came from what are
 

2327
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:01,309
think this question came from what are
some interesting sticky bugs that you've

2328
00:45:01,309 --> 00:45:01,319
some interesting sticky bugs that you've
 

2329
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:03,410
some interesting sticky bugs that you've
encountered throughout your life in

2330
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:03,420
encountered throughout your life in
 

2331
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,030
encountered throughout your life in
creating these games and this is one of

2332
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:05,040
creating these games and this is one of
 

2333
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,309
creating these games and this is one of
them that you mentioned so what are some

2334
00:45:07,309 --> 00:45:07,319
them that you mentioned so what are some
 

2335
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,970
them that you mentioned so what are some
of the challenges of

2336
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:09,980
of the challenges of
 

2337
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,010
of the challenges of
programming these open world games

2338
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:13,020
programming these open world games
 

2339
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,710
programming these open world games
I mean there are different flavors of

2340
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:15,720
I mean there are different flavors of
 

2341
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,309
I mean there are different flavors of
them right your gtas will have different

2342
00:45:18,309 --> 00:45:18,319
them right your gtas will have different
 

2343
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:20,630
them right your gtas will have different
issues than

2344
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:20,640
issues than
 

2345
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,849
issues than
you know the Ubisoft games versus our

2346
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:22,859
you know the Ubisoft games versus our
 

2347
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:24,349
you know the Ubisoft games versus our
games I can sort of you know speak to

2348
00:45:24,349 --> 00:45:24,359
games I can sort of you know speak to
 

2349
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:25,550
games I can sort of you know speak to
ours

2350
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:25,560
ours
 

2351
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,730
ours
which is you want to build systems right

2352
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:28,740
which is you want to build systems right
 

2353
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:29,930
which is you want to build systems right
because they're gonna they're gonna play

2354
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:29,940
because they're gonna they're gonna play
 

2355
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,910
because they're gonna they're gonna play
the game for a very long time as well

2356
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:31,920
the game for a very long time as well
 

2357
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,290
the game for a very long time as well
which we've learned

2358
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:33,300
which we've learned
 

2359
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,910
which we've learned
and

2360
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:34,920
and
 

2361
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,069
and
you can't go through and touch

2362
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:37,079
you can't go through and touch
 

2363
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,670
you can't go through and touch
everything by hand per se so you have to

2364
00:45:40,670 --> 00:45:40,680
everything by hand per se so you have to
 

2365
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:44,210
everything by hand per se so you have to
rely on some systemic level of creation

2366
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:44,220
rely on some systemic level of creation
 

2367
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:47,210
rely on some systemic level of creation
and a lot of systems that are robust

2368
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:47,220
and a lot of systems that are robust
 

2369
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,250
and a lot of systems that are robust
enough so that when they touch another

2370
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:49,260
enough so that when they touch another
 

2371
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:52,550
enough so that when they touch another
one things aren't breaking apart

2372
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:52,560
one things aren't breaking apart
 

2373
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:54,230
one things aren't breaking apart
so there's like a

2374
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:54,240
so there's like a
 

2375
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,450
so there's like a
what are the major systems is there like

2376
00:45:56,450 --> 00:45:56,460
what are the major systems is there like
 

2377
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,130
what are the major systems is there like
the physics of the game the engine of

2378
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:58,140
the physics of the game the engine of
 

2379
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,930
the physics of the game the engine of
how like stuff

2380
00:45:59,930 --> 00:45:59,940
how like stuff
 

2381
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,430
how like stuff
yeah like

2382
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:01,440
yeah like
 

2383
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,230
yeah like
um yeah the physics the motion and maybe

2384
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:03,240
um yeah the physics the motion and maybe
 

2385
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,790
um yeah the physics the motion and maybe
how light is rendered and all that kind

2386
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:04,800
how light is rendered and all that kind
 

2387
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,230
how light is rendered and all that kind
of stuff right so you have the rendering

2388
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:06,240
of stuff right so you have the rendering
 

2389
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,990
of stuff right so you have the rendering
right of like okay this is how I'm gonna

2390
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:09,000
right of like okay this is how I'm gonna
 

2391
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,230
right of like okay this is how I'm gonna
render the data that I have

2392
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:12,240
render the data that I have
 

2393
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,089
render the data that I have
so a lot of people confuse engines with

2394
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:14,099
so a lot of people confuse engines with
 

2395
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:16,430
so a lot of people confuse engines with
rendering I mean they're combined

2396
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:16,440
rendering I mean they're combined
 

2397
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,109
rendering I mean they're combined
obviously but there's the data you're

2398
00:46:18,109 --> 00:46:18,119
obviously but there's the data you're
 

2399
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:20,150
obviously but there's the data you're
gonna give to a renderer which is the

2400
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:20,160
gonna give to a renderer which is the
 

2401
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,410
gonna give to a renderer which is the
thing that you know the audience you

2402
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:21,420
thing that you know the audience you
 

2403
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,390
thing that you know the audience you
know that draws the pixels on the screen

2404
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:23,400
know that draws the pixels on the screen
 

2405
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,450
know that draws the pixels on the screen
so there's a most of the engine is how

2406
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:26,460
so there's a most of the engine is how
 

2407
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:29,450
so there's a most of the engine is how
are you going to bring in that data and

2408
00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:29,460
are you going to bring in that data and
 

2409
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,750
are you going to bring in that data and
give it to the renderer to to draw it so

2410
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:32,760
give it to the renderer to to draw it so
 

2411
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,950
give it to the renderer to to draw it so
you have that whole system of walking

2412
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:33,960
you have that whole system of walking
 

2413
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,690
you have that whole system of walking
through the world feeding in the data

2414
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:35,700
through the world feeding in the data
 

2415
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,370
through the world feeding in the data
and drawing it

2416
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:37,380
and drawing it
 

2417
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:40,130
and drawing it
you then obviously have the physics and

2418
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:40,140
you then obviously have the physics and
 

2419
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:41,510
you then obviously have the physics and
the interactivity

2420
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:41,520
the interactivity
 

2421
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,130
the interactivity
what are the things that are there just

2422
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:43,140
what are the things that are there just
 

2423
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,569
what are the things that are there just
to be drawn

2424
00:46:44,569 --> 00:46:44,579
to be drawn
 

2425
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:46,190
to be drawn
and what are the things there that are

2426
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:46,200
and what are the things there that are
 

2427
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,589
and what are the things there that are
meant to be interacted with and touched

2428
00:46:48,589 --> 00:46:48,599
meant to be interacted with and touched
 

2429
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:51,829
meant to be interacted with and touched
we put a big premium on the ones that

2430
00:46:51,829 --> 00:46:51,839
we put a big premium on the ones that
 

2431
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:53,630
we put a big premium on the ones that
can be interacted with and touched

2432
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:53,640
can be interacted with and touched
 

2433
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:55,910
can be interacted with and touched
whether it's flowers whether the trees

sit in this chair pick up all this stuff

2438
00:46:59,809 --> 00:46:59,819
sit in this chair pick up all this stuff
 

2439
00:46:59,819 --> 00:47:02,630

make bread blah blah blah
 

2441
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,930

you then have the AI which Loops in the

2442
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:05,940
you then have the AI which Loops in the
 

2443
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:07,490
you then have the AI which Loops in the
stuff we talked about earlier in terms

2444
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:07,500
stuff we talked about earlier in terms
 

2445
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,910
stuff we talked about earlier in terms
of processing everybody and

2446
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:09,920
of processing everybody and
 

2447
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,250
of processing everybody and
combat systems which is a lot of what

2448
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:13,260
combat systems which is a lot of what
 

2449
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,050
combat systems which is a lot of what
and the people end up doing combat

2450
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:15,060
and the people end up doing combat
 

2451
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,990
and the people end up doing combat
systems on top of that AI how do they

2452
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:18,000
systems on top of that AI how do they
 

2453
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,829
systems on top of that AI how do they
react to those types of things and then

2454
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:21,839
react to those types of things and then
 

2455
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,410
react to those types of things and then
how how do they look at the things that

2456
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:24,420
how how do they look at the things that
 

2457
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,910
how how do they look at the things that
can be interacted with one of my

2458
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:25,920
can be interacted with one of my
 

2459
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,950
can be interacted with one of my
favorite things is when NPCs will go

2460
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:27,960
favorite things is when NPCs will go
 

2461
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,450
favorite things is when NPCs will go
pick up weapons in the world but you

2462
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:29,460
pick up weapons in the world but you
 

2463
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:30,650
pick up weapons in the world but you
don't see in other games and the first

2464
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:30,660
don't see in other games and the first
 

2465
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,150
don't see in other games and the first
time you see it in one of ours like very

2466
00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:32,160
time you see it in one of ours like very
 

2467
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,550
time you see it in one of ours like very
unexpected you can drop like a crazy

2468
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:34,560
unexpected you can drop like a crazy
 

2469
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,010
unexpected you can drop like a crazy
weapon be in a fight and an NPC runs

2470
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:37,020
weapon be in a fight and an NPC runs
 

2471
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,630
weapon be in a fight and an NPC runs
over picks it up and uses it on you it's

2472
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:38,640
over picks it up and uses it on you it's
 

2473
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,849
over picks it up and uses it on you it's
not something you would expect

2474
00:47:40,849 --> 00:47:40,859
not something you would expect
 

2475
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:43,849
not something you would expect
um but I love that stuff and that's

2476
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:43,859
um but I love that stuff and that's
 

2477
00:47:43,859 --> 00:47:46,250
um but I love that stuff and that's
integrated into a larger system the

2478
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:46,260
integrated into a larger system the
 

2479
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,410
integrated into a larger system the
ability to pick up the npcp accountable

2480
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:48,420
ability to pick up the npcp accountable
 

2481
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:50,630
ability to pick up the npcp accountable
so it's not like a little cork that's

2482
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:50,640
so it's not like a little cork that's
 

2483
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,790
so it's not like a little cork that's
hard-coded in it's part of a bigger

00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,550
hard-coded in it's part of a bigger

2486
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:55,560

2487
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,349

00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
scanning the environment that's one of
 

2489
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,329
scanning the environment that's one of
the rules hey is there a weapon

2490
00:47:59,329 --> 00:47:59,339
the rules hey is there a weapon
 

2491
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:02,329
the rules hey is there a weapon
that is better than the one I have

2492
00:48:02,329 --> 00:48:02,339
that is better than the one I have
 

2493
00:48:02,339 --> 00:48:04,609
that is better than the one I have
I'm gonna go get it now we do lock off

2494
00:48:04,609 --> 00:48:04,619
I'm gonna go get it now we do lock off
 

2495
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:06,230
I'm gonna go get it now we do lock off
if it's in a chest and that's treasure

2496
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:06,240
if it's in a chest and that's treasure
 

2497
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,030
if it's in a chest and that's treasure
we left for the player but it's in

2498
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:08,040
we left for the player but it's in
 

2499
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:08,930
we left for the player but it's in
particular

2500
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:08,940
particular
 

2501
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,250
particular
because what you don't want we actually

2502
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:10,260
because what you don't want we actually
 

2503
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,750
because what you don't want we actually
have this problem you start in Oblivion

2504
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:11,760
have this problem you start in Oblivion
 

2505
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,430
have this problem you start in Oblivion
I believe which is a separate level hey

2506
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:13,440
I believe which is a separate level hey
 

2507
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:16,250
I believe which is a separate level hey
let the enemies go pick up the you know

2508
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:16,260
let the enemies go pick up the you know
 

2509
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,050
let the enemies go pick up the you know
weapons if they're better so we make a

2510
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:18,060
weapons if they're better so we make a
 

2511
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,030
weapons if they're better so we make a
level and go in and wow all of the

2512
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:20,040
level and go in and wow all of the
 

2513
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,349
level and go in and wow all of the
enemies are armed of the teeth and

2514
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:21,359
enemies are armed of the teeth and
 

2515
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,550
enemies are armed of the teeth and
there's no treasure for the player

2516
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:22,560
there's no treasure for the player
 

2517
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:23,930
there's no treasure for the player
because the enemies went and took all

2518
00:48:23,930 --> 00:48:23,940
because the enemies went and took all
 

2519
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:26,210
because the enemies went and took all
the good weapons and you say okay they

2520
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:26,220
the good weapons and you say okay they
 

2521
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,650
the good weapons and you say okay they
don't take those they take the ones that

2522
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:27,660
don't take those they take the ones that
 

2523
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:30,829
don't take those they take the ones that
are dropped Yeah by other NPCs or the

2524
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:30,839
are dropped Yeah by other NPCs or the
 

2525
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:33,470
are dropped Yeah by other NPCs or the
player that's such a fascinating world

2526
00:48:33,470 --> 00:48:33,480
player that's such a fascinating world
 

2527
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,329
player that's such a fascinating world
of EX or the design of the experience

00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:35,339
of EX or the design of the experience
 

2529
00:48:35,339 --> 00:48:38,510
of EX or the design of the experience
for the NPC because in part that

00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:43,370
is uh defines the experience of the
player

2536
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:43,380
player
 

2537
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,290
player
so how they interact with their

2538
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:45,300
so how they interact with their
 

2539
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:47,690
so how they interact with their
environment defines how you how the

2540
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:47,700
environment defines how you how the
 

2541
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,670
environment defines how you how the
player experiences their environment is

2542
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:49,680
player experiences their environment is
 

2543
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:51,770
player experiences their environment is
there room for further and further

2544
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:51,780
there room for further and further
 

2545
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,770
there room for further and further
development of the AI that controls the

2548
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:55,920
MPC
 

2549
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,910
MPC
sure we're always iterating on it and

2550
00:48:58,910 --> 00:48:58,920
sure we're always iterating on it and
 

2551
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:02,870
sure we're always iterating on it and
again as we look in the future

2552
00:49:02,870 --> 00:49:02,880
again as we look in the future
 

2553
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,710
again as we look in the future
it's more about us finding those more

2554
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:06,720
it's more about us finding those more
 

2555
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,050
it's more about us finding those more
reactivity to the player and also

2556
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:09,060
reactivity to the player and also
 

2557
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:12,349
reactivity to the player and also
understanding their roles in the world

2558
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:12,359
understanding their roles in the world
 

2559
00:49:12,359 --> 00:49:15,349
understanding their roles in the world
so they're not just there they're not

2560
00:49:15,349 --> 00:49:15,359
so they're not just there they're not
 

2561
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:17,270
so they're not just there they're not
just there for the player to as a

2562
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:17,280
just there for the player to as a
 

2563
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,430
just there for the player to as a
signpost for the player but they're

2564
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:19,440
signpost for the player but they're
 

2565
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,890
signpost for the player but they're
reacting to the player but what about

2566
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:21,900
reacting to the player but what about
 

2567
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:23,690
reacting to the player but what about
you know some of the richest experiences

2568
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:23,700
you know some of the richest experiences
 

2569
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,750
you know some of the richest experiences
we have with people is like the chaos of

2570
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:26,760
we have with people is like the chaos of
 

2571
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,230
we have with people is like the chaos of
it the pull the push and pull the

unpredictability is there something I

2574
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:31,980
unpredictability is there something I
 

2575
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,290
unpredictability is there something I
don't know if you've been following but

2576
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:33,300
don't know if you've been following but
 

2577
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,930
don't know if you've been following but
the the quick amazing development of

dialogue systems
 

2587
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:46,910
dialogue systems
um do you think there's some possibility

2588
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:46,920
um do you think there's some possibility
 

2589
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,510
um do you think there's some possibility
of using sort of these incredible neural

2590
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:50,520
of using sort of these incredible neural
 

2591
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,109
of using sort of these incredible neural
Nets that can have open-ended dialogue

Nets that can have open-ended dialogue
 

2593
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:56,870
Nets that can have open-ended dialogue
basically chat Bots yep I've seen some

2594
00:49:56,870 --> 00:49:56,880
basically chat Bots yep I've seen some
 

2595
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,450
basically chat Bots yep I've seen some
incredible demos I do think it's coming

2596
00:49:59,450 --> 00:49:59,460
incredible demos I do think it's coming
 

2597
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:02,150
incredible demos I do think it's coming
I don't know when yeah

2598
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:02,160
I don't know when yeah
 

2599
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,650
I don't know when yeah
um and there's a little bit of a

2600
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:03,660
um and there's a little bit of a
 

2601
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,990
um and there's a little bit of a
question like what's ready for

2602
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:06,000
question like what's ready for
 

2603
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,170
question like what's ready for
real deployment and release

2604
00:50:09,170 --> 00:50:09,180
real deployment and release
 

2605
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,089
real deployment and release
versus

2606
00:50:11,089 --> 00:50:11,099
versus
 

2607
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:14,329
versus
hey let's use that to generate some

2608
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:14,339
hey let's use that to generate some
 

2609
00:50:14,339 --> 00:50:15,890
hey let's use that to generate some
things that is then static that we're

2610
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:15,900
things that is then static that we're
 

2611
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,170
things that is then static that we're
giving to the players

2612
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:18,180
giving to the players
 

2613
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,650
giving to the players
um versus yeah it's generated on the fly

2614
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:21,660
um versus yeah it's generated on the fly
 

2615
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,750
um versus yeah it's generated on the fly
but it's definitely coming it's

2616
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:23,760
but it's definitely coming it's
 

2617
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,309
but it's definitely coming it's
definitely coming and I think you'll see

2618
00:50:25,309 --> 00:50:25,319
definitely coming and I think you'll see
 

2619
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:27,349
definitely coming and I think you'll see
it in in the types of games that we do

2620
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:27,359
it in in the types of games that we do
 

2621
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:30,410
it in in the types of games that we do
it has great you know application I love

2622
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:30,420
it has great you know application I love
 

2623
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:32,210
it has great you know application I love
the idea that you'll be

2624
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:32,220
the idea that you'll be
 

2625
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:34,609
the idea that you'll be
um using that to design different uh

2626
00:50:34,609 --> 00:50:34,619
um using that to design different uh
 

2627
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:36,589
um using that to design different uh
NPCs and then testing if they're if

2628
00:50:36,589 --> 00:50:36,599
NPCs and then testing if they're if
 

2629
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,230
NPCs and then testing if they're if
they're good enough if they're like um a

2630
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:39,240
they're good enough if they're like um a
 

2631
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,970
they're good enough if they're like um a
little too crazy you don't want like the

2632
00:50:40,970 --> 00:50:40,980
little too crazy you don't want like the
 

2633
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:42,950
little too crazy you don't want like the
the super right but if we go back to it

2634
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:42,960
the super right but if we go back to it
 

2635
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,230
the super right but if we go back to it
being reactive some of that bot stuff

2636
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:45,240
being reactive some of that bot stuff
 

2637
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,329
being reactive some of that bot stuff
you know it's pretty it's incredible

2638
00:50:47,329 --> 00:50:47,339
you know it's pretty it's incredible
 

2639
00:50:47,339 --> 00:50:50,270
you know it's pretty it's incredible
it's then Translating that into voice

2640
00:50:50,270 --> 00:50:50,280
it's then Translating that into voice
 

2641
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,690
it's then Translating that into voice
and then is that being done

2642
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:52,700
and then is that being done
 

2643
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:56,030
and then is that being done
by the client as it being done on a

2644
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:56,040
by the client as it being done on a
 

2645
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,430
by the client as it being done on a
server is it baked into the game there's

2646
00:50:58,430 --> 00:50:58,440
server is it baked into the game there's
 

2647
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,710
server is it baked into the game there's
like different flavors of it so there's

2648
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:00,720
like different flavors of it so there's
 

2649
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:02,809
like different flavors of it so there's
still computational challenges like how

2650
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:02,819
still computational challenges like how
 

2651
00:51:02,819 --> 00:51:04,549
still computational challenges like how
do you actually make that happen right

2652
00:51:04,549 --> 00:51:04,559
do you actually make that happen right
 

2653
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:06,109
do you actually make that happen right
well what about

2654
00:51:06,109 --> 00:51:06,119
well what about
 

2655
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:08,569
well what about
oh in terms of creating the feeling of

2656
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:08,579
oh in terms of creating the feeling of
 

2657
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:10,309
oh in terms of creating the feeling of
an NPC

2658
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:10,319
an NPC
 

2659
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,770
an NPC
uh what's the role of voice actors and

2660
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:12,780
uh what's the role of voice actors and
 

2661
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:15,710
uh what's the role of voice actors and
awesome yeah we we work with a ton of

2662
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:15,720
awesome yeah we we work with a ton of
 

2663
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:16,910
awesome yeah we we work with a ton of
voice actors

2664
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:16,920
voice actors
 

2665
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,609
voice actors
and they bring so much to it and and

2666
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:19,619
and they bring so much to it and and
 

2667
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,109
and they bring so much to it and and
that's the thing

2668
00:51:21,109 --> 00:51:21,119
that's the thing
 

2669
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,270
that's the thing
um

2670
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:22,280
um
 

2671
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,470
um
they you know we can write some stuff

2672
00:51:24,470 --> 00:51:24,480
they you know we can write some stuff
 

2673
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,750
they you know we can write some stuff
and and the best ones get in there and

2674
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:26,760
and and the best ones get in there and
 

2675
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,329
and and the best ones get in there and
make it so much better or even ad-lib

2676
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:29,339
make it so much better or even ad-lib
 

2677
00:51:29,339 --> 00:51:32,930
make it so much better or even ad-lib
things and so we we do a lot of voice

2678
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:32,940
things and so we we do a lot of voice
 

2679
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:35,390
things and so we we do a lot of voice
recording and we used to do it kind of

2680
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:35,400
recording and we used to do it kind of
 

2681
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,609
recording and we used to do it kind of
like at the end of the project

2682
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:37,619
like at the end of the project
 

2683
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,250
like at the end of the project
and now we do it throughout we start

2684
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:40,260
and now we do it throughout we start
 

2685
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,650
and now we do it throughout we start
really early and we just start recording

2686
00:51:42,650 --> 00:51:42,660
really early and we just start recording
 

2687
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,390
really early and we just start recording
so we're recording

2688
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:44,400
so we're recording
 

2689
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,609
so we're recording
for years and years literally probably

2690
00:51:46,609 --> 00:51:46,619
for years and years literally probably
 

2691
00:51:46,619 --> 00:51:49,309
for years and years literally probably
three years four years so part of the

2692

00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:15,049
where you explore space you know the
explore space role-playing game so take

3006
00:57:15,049 --> 00:57:15,059
explore space role-playing game so take
 

3007
00:57:15,059 --> 00:57:17,750
explore space role-playing game so take
the kind of games that we make and

3008
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:17,760
the kind of games that we make and
 

3009
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,210
the kind of games that we make and
give it a little bit of a different Spin

3010
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:20,220
give it a little bit of a different Spin
 

3011
00:57:20,220 --> 00:57:21,710
give it a little bit of a different Spin
and

3012
00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:21,720
and
 

3013
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:23,930
and
you know the other games that I loved

3014
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:23,940
you know the other games that I loved
 

3015
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:25,609
you know the other games that I loved
there was a pen and paper RPG I love

3016
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:25,619
there was a pen and paper RPG I love
 

3017
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:27,470
there was a pen and paper RPG I love
traveler it was one of the first games I

3018
00:57:27,470 --> 00:57:27,480
traveler it was one of the first games I
 

3019
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,970
traveler it was one of the first games I
made for the Apple II

3020
00:57:28,970 --> 00:57:28,980
made for the Apple II
 

3021
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,089
made for the Apple II
I didn't uh I never finished it right

3022
00:57:32,089 --> 00:57:32,099
I didn't uh I never finished it right
 

3023
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:33,670
I didn't uh I never finished it right
I'm just doing it on my own

3024
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:33,680
I'm just doing it on my own
 

3025
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,309
I'm just doing it on my own
and I love this game starflight was one

3026
00:57:37,309 --> 00:57:37,319
and I love this game starflight was one
 

3027
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:41,270
and I love this game starflight was one
star control two was a game that I loved

3028
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:41,280
star control two was a game that I loved
 

3029
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,670
star control two was a game that I loved
um Sundog was a big one in the Apple two

3030
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:43,680
um Sundog was a big one in the Apple two
 

3031
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:44,870
um Sundog was a big one in the Apple two
days that a lot of people don't know

3032
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:44,880
days that a lot of people don't know
 

3033
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:48,650
days that a lot of people don't know
that I loved and so a lot of us in the

3034
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:48,660
that I loved and so a lot of us in the
 

3035
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,349
that I loved and so a lot of us in the
studio felt it was time to do something

3036
00:57:51,349 --> 00:57:51,359
studio felt it was time to do something
 

3037
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,210
studio felt it was time to do something
new you know we're going between Elder

3038
00:57:53,210 --> 00:57:53,220
new you know we're going between Elder
 

3039
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:54,530
new you know we're going between Elder
Scrolls and Fallout and going back and

3040
00:57:54,530 --> 00:57:54,540
Scrolls and Fallout and going back and
 

3041
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,710
Scrolls and Fallout and going back and
forth and I mean we love that but hey

3042
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:57,720
forth and I mean we love that but hey
 

3043
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:59,870
forth and I mean we love that but hey
we've always wanted to do this explore

3044
00:57:59,870 --> 00:57:59,880
we've always wanted to do this explore
 

3045
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:02,569
we've always wanted to do this explore
the Galaxy science fiction game

3046
00:58:02,569 --> 00:58:02,579
the Galaxy science fiction game
 

3047
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:06,349
the Galaxy science fiction game
you know now is the time uh to do that

3048
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:06,359
you know now is the time uh to do that
 

3049
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:09,410
you know now is the time uh to do that
and uh that's a brave move so follow us

3050
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:09,420
and uh that's a brave move so follow us
 

3051
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:12,109
and uh that's a brave move so follow us
post-op apocalyptic

3052
00:58:12,109 --> 00:58:12,119
post-op apocalyptic
 

3053
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:13,670
post-op apocalyptic
on a single

3054
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
on a single
 

3055
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,829
on a single
Planet

3056
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:14,839
Planet
 

3057
00:58:14,839 --> 00:58:18,890
Planet
uh you know Elder Scrolls series is

3058
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:18,900
uh you know Elder Scrolls series is
 

3059
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,530
uh you know Elder Scrolls series is
uh on a single planet so this is going

3060
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:21,540
uh on a single planet so this is going
 

3061
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:24,770
uh on a single planet so this is going
out into the open world of many Star

3062
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:24,780
out into the open world of many Star
 

3063
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:28,069
out into the open world of many Star
systems many planets I saw that it's uh

3064
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:28,079
systems many planets I saw that it's uh
 

3065
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,069
systems many planets I saw that it's uh
thinking about a hundred star systems

3066
00:58:31,069 --> 00:58:31,079
thinking about a hundred star systems
 

3067
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:32,870
thinking about a hundred star systems
and a thousand planets available to

3068
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:32,880
and a thousand planets available to
 

3069
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,370
and a thousand planets available to
explore

3070
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:34,380
explore
 

3071
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,990
explore
um what is that world of stars and

3072
00:58:35,990 --> 00:58:36,000
um what is that world of stars and
 

3073
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,250
um what is that world of stars and
planets like

3074
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:37,260
planets like
 

3075
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,230
planets like
well you mentioned Daggerfall we go back

3076
00:58:39,230 --> 00:58:39,240
well you mentioned Daggerfall we go back
 

3077
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,670
well you mentioned Daggerfall we go back
to some of that well the first one we

3078
00:58:40,670 --> 00:58:40,680
to some of that well the first one we
 

3079
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,789
to some of that well the first one we
did it was how are we gonna

3080
00:58:43,789 --> 00:58:43,799
did it was how are we gonna
 

3081
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:46,309
did it was how are we gonna
render a planet like pull it off for the

3082
00:58:46,309 --> 00:58:46,319
render a planet like pull it off for the
 

3083
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,289
render a planet like pull it off for the
player like can we

3084
00:58:48,289 --> 00:58:48,299
player like can we
 

3085
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:50,329
player like can we
or do we have to sort of do it where you

3086
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:50,339
or do we have to sort of do it where you
 

3087
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:52,430
or do we have to sort of do it where you
can't land on all of them where you're

3088
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:52,440
can't land on all of them where you're
 

3089
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,250
can't land on all of them where you're
Landing in a very controlled small world

3090
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:55,260
Landing in a very controlled small world
 

3091
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:57,950
Landing in a very controlled small world
space that we you know kind of craft and

3092
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:57,960
space that we you know kind of craft and
 

3093
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,530
space that we you know kind of craft and
you would have a very limited set of

3094
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:00,540
you would have a very limited set of
 

3095
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:02,690
you would have a very limited set of
those if you go back to tone like well

3096
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:02,700
those if you go back to tone like well
 

3097
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:05,470
those if you go back to tone like well
that's probably the wrong tone

3098
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:05,480
that's probably the wrong tone
 

3099
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:08,210
that's probably the wrong tone
and how can we say yes like I want to

3100
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:08,220
and how can we say yes like I want to
 

3101
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,010
and how can we say yes like I want to
land on that ice ball so it started we

3102
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:10,020
land on that ice ball so it started we
 

3103
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:12,470
land on that ice ball so it started we
started the game right after Fallout 4

3104
00:59:12,470 --> 00:59:12,480
started the game right after Fallout 4
 

3105
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,569
started the game right after Fallout 4
so 2016.

3106
00:59:14,569 --> 00:59:14,579
so 2016.
 

3107
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:17,569
so 2016.
and the first thing we did was can you

3108
00:59:17,569 --> 00:59:17,579
and the first thing we did was can you
 

3109
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:20,210
and the first thing we did was can you
know how can we have a system to

3110
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:20,220
know how can we have a system to
 

3111
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,789
know how can we have a system to
generate these planets and make them

3112
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:22,799
generate these planets and make them
 

3113
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:23,870
generate these planets and make them
look

3114
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:23,880
look
 

3115
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:27,230
look
you know I'll say reasonable as opposed

3116
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:27,240
you know I'll say reasonable as opposed
 

3117
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:36,010
you know I'll say reasonable as opposed
to you know fractally goop

3118
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:36,020

 

3119
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,910

you've probably seen a lot of like

3120
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:37,920
you've probably seen a lot of like
 

3121
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,530
you've probably seen a lot of like
simulations whether they're space things

3122
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:39,540
simulations whether they're space things
 

3123
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,630
simulations whether they're space things
or landscape things where they're using

3124
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:41,640
or landscape things where they're using
 

3125
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:43,490
or landscape things where they're using
fractals and this the landscape does not

3126
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:43,500
fractals and this the landscape does not
 

3127
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,049
fractals and this the landscape does not
look real just this is like highs and

3128
00:59:45,049 --> 00:59:45,059
look real just this is like highs and
 

3129
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:48,589
look real just this is like highs and
lows and it's muddy and so we did find a

3130
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:48,599
lows and it's muddy and so we did find a
 

3131
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:50,270
lows and it's muddy and so we did find a
way we came up with a way

3132
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:50,280
way we came up with a way
 

3133
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:53,270
way we came up with a way
um had prototyped of of building tiles

3134
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:53,280
um had prototyped of of building tiles
 

3135
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:55,910
um had prototyped of of building tiles
like large tiles of landscape the way we

3136
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:55,920
like large tiles of landscape the way we
 

3137
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,890
like large tiles of landscape the way we
would usually build them we kind of

3138
00:59:57,890 --> 00:59:57,900
would usually build them we kind of
 

3139
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,750
would usually build them we kind of
generate them offline hand do some

3140
00:59:59,750 --> 00:59:59,760
generate them offline hand do some
 

3141
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,730
generate them offline hand do some
things and end up with these very

3142
01:00:01,730 --> 01:00:01,740
things and end up with these very
 

3143
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,970
things and end up with these very
realistic looking tiles of landscape and

3144
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:04,980
realistic looking tiles of landscape and
 

3145
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,089
realistic looking tiles of landscape and
then built a system that wraps those

3146
01:00:08,089 --> 01:00:08,099
then built a system that wraps those
 

3147
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:11,210
then built a system that wraps those
around a planet and blends them all

3148
01:00:11,210 --> 01:00:11,220
around a planet and blends them all
 

3149
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:12,349
around a planet and blends them all
together

3150
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:12,359
together
 

3151
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:14,390
together
and we had pretty successful results

3152
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:14,400
and we had pretty successful results
 

3153
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,430
and we had pretty successful results
with that and so we thought yeah we

3154
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:16,440
with that and so we thought yeah we
 

3155
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,650
with that and so we thought yeah we
could we could do this

3156
01:00:18,650 --> 01:00:18,660
could we could do this
 

3157
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:22,730
could we could do this
um and so there was a big design

3158
01:00:22,730 --> 01:00:22,740
um and so there was a big design
 

3159
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,190
um and so there was a big design
kind of problem to solve in terms of

3160
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:25,200
kind of problem to solve in terms of
 

3161
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,750
kind of problem to solve in terms of
well what's fun

3162
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:26,760
well what's fun
 

3163
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,809
well what's fun
about landing on a planet where there's

3164
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:29,819
about landing on a planet where there's
 

3165
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,549
about landing on a planet where there's
potentially nothing

3166
01:00:31,549 --> 01:00:31,559
potentially nothing
 

3167
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:33,710
potentially nothing
because there's a lot of planets and

3168
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:33,720
because there's a lot of planets and
 

3169
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:36,349
because there's a lot of planets and
moons if you kind of right in reality

3170
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:36,359
moons if you kind of right in reality
 

3171
01:00:36,359 --> 01:00:38,750
moons if you kind of right in reality
that well there's nothing on them except

3172
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:38,760
that well there's nothing on them except
 

3173
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,670
that well there's nothing on them except
resources and so we spent a lot of time

3174
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:40,680
resources and so we spent a lot of time
 

3175
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,069
resources and so we spent a lot of time
figuring out okay let's just lean in on

3176
01:00:43,069 --> 01:00:43,079
figuring out okay let's just lean in on
 

3177
01:00:43,079 --> 01:00:46,069
figuring out okay let's just lean in on
that can a be a lonely experience as

3178
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:46,079
that can a be a lonely experience as
 

3179
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:47,510
that can a be a lonely experience as
long as we tell the player here's what's

3180
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:47,520
long as we tell the player here's what's
 

3181
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,490
long as we tell the player here's what's
there here are the resources that are

3182
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:49,500
there here are the resources that are
 

3183
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,789
there here are the resources that are
there go find them but I equate it to

3184
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:52,799
there go find them but I equate it to
 

3185
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,950
there go find them but I equate it to
that moment of we said about listening

3186
01:00:54,950 --> 01:00:54,960
that moment of we said about listening
 

3187
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,990
that moment of we said about listening
to the wind go and watching the sunset

3188
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:57,000
to the wind go and watching the sunset
 

3189
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,849
to the wind go and watching the sunset
and I do think there's a certain Beauty

3190
01:00:58,849 --> 01:00:58,859
and I do think there's a certain Beauty
 

3191
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:01,910
and I do think there's a certain Beauty
to landing on a strange Planet being

3192
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:01,920
to landing on a strange Planet being
 

3193
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,950
to landing on a strange Planet being
somewhat the only person there building

3194
01:01:03,950 --> 01:01:03,960
somewhat the only person there building
 

3195
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,950
somewhat the only person there building
an outpost and we are modeling

3196
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:06,960
an outpost and we are modeling
 

3197
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:09,349
an outpost and we are modeling
all of the systems because that's how we

3198
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:09,359
all of the systems because that's how we
 

3199
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:10,670
all of the systems because that's how we
like to do things so you can watch

3200
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:10,680
like to do things so you can watch
 

3201
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,490
like to do things so you can watch
whatever that gas giant or Moon it will

3202
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:13,500
whatever that gas giant or Moon it will
 

3203
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:15,710
whatever that gas giant or Moon it will
rotate and go and

3204
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:15,720
rotate and go and
 

3205
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,190
rotate and go and
Sunrise Sunset and all of those things

3206
01:01:19,190 --> 01:01:19,200
Sunrise Sunset and all of those things
 

3207
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:21,710
Sunrise Sunset and all of those things
that you would expect and it's it's all

3208
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:21,720
that you would expect and it's it's all
 

3209
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,589
that you would expect and it's it's all
really happening and most people

3210
01:01:24,589 --> 01:01:24,599
really happening and most people
 

3211
01:01:24,599 --> 01:01:26,270
really happening and most people
probably won't notice or appreciate all

3212
01:01:26,270 --> 01:01:26,280
probably won't notice or appreciate all
 

3213
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:28,190
probably won't notice or appreciate all
of that but

3214
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:28,200
of that but
 

3215
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:29,450
of that but
um

3216
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:29,460
um
 

3217
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:33,230
um
I think it gives them the ability to say

01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:33,240
I think it gives them the ability to say
 

3219
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:35,750
I think it gives them the ability to say
I want to go do that and see that on

I want to go do that and see that on
 

3221
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,730
I want to go do that and see that on
that place as long as we tell them hey

3222
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:37,740
that place as long as we tell them hey
 

3223

at a certain moment like it does for me
with Skyrim like

about me
exactly Dusty that's that's the

3302
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:08,040
exactly Dusty that's that's the
 

3303
01:03:08,040 --> 01:03:09,710
exactly Dusty that's that's the
experience so you you want to create the

3304
01:03:09,710 --> 01:03:09,720
experience so you you want to create the
 

3305
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,569
experience so you you want to create the
whole planet and you want to have many

3306
01:03:11,569 --> 01:03:11,579
whole planet and you want to have many
 

3307
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,069
whole planet and you want to have many
of them

3308
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:13,079
of them
 

3309
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:16,190
of them
we have we do have many but once you

3310
01:03:16,190 --> 01:03:16,200
we have we do have many but once you
 

3311
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,109
we have we do have many but once you
build that system I think the numbers

3312
01:03:18,109 --> 01:03:18,119
build that system I think the numbers
 

3313
01:03:18,119 --> 01:03:19,309
build that system I think the numbers
become

3314
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:19,319
become
 

3315
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:22,069
become
I mean honestly a little bit we we wrap

3316
01:03:22,069 --> 01:03:22,079
I mean honestly a little bit we we wrap
 

3317
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,230
I mean honestly a little bit we we wrap
it in so we can name them all and and

3318
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:24,240
it in so we can name them all and and
 

3319
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,329
it in so we can name them all and and
have a finite set even though it's a

3320
01:03:26,329 --> 01:03:26,339
have a finite set even though it's a
 

3321
01:03:26,339 --> 01:03:29,270
have a finite set even though it's a
very very large number but a set that we

3322
01:03:29,270 --> 01:03:29,280
very very large number but a set that we
 

3323
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:30,710
very very large number but a set that we
can

3324
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:30,720
can
 

3325
01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:32,990
can
you know validate and and know about

3326
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:33,000
you know validate and and know about
 

3327
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,510
you know validate and and know about
even though it's a huge number but once

3328
01:03:35,510 --> 01:03:35,520
even though it's a huge number but once
 

3329
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,230
even though it's a huge number but once
you

3330
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:36,240
you
 

3331
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,670
you
once you're Building A system that can

3332
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:37,680
once you're Building A system that can
 

3333
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:39,289
once you're Building A system that can
build a planet I mean a planet is sort

3334
01:03:39,289 --> 01:03:39,299
build a planet I mean a planet is sort
 

3335
01:03:39,299 --> 01:03:40,910
build a planet I mean a planet is sort
of Infinite Space we go back to the

3336
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:40,920
of Infinite Space we go back to the
 

3337
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,130
of Infinite Space we go back to the
Daggerfall analogy right

3338
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:43,140
Daggerfall analogy right
 

3339
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,809
Daggerfall analogy right
if you have systems to build that much

3340
01:03:44,809 --> 01:03:44,819
if you have systems to build that much
 

3341
01:03:44,819 --> 01:03:47,270
if you have systems to build that much
space doing a hundred plants or a

3342
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:47,280
space doing a hundred plants or a
 

3343
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:48,530
space doing a hundred plants or a
thousand or ten thousand or a million

3344
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:48,540
thousand or ten thousand or a million
 

3345
01:03:48,540 --> 01:03:50,510
thousand or ten thousand or a million
planets is not it's just you just press

3346
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:50,520
planets is not it's just you just press
 

3347
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:52,549
planets is not it's just you just press
you just change the number and press the

3348
01:03:52,549 --> 01:03:52,559
you just change the number and press the
 

3349
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:54,890
you just change the number and press the
button but you can't you can't name them

3350
01:03:54,890 --> 01:03:54,900
button but you can't you can't name them
 

3351
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,870
button but you can't you can't name them
all you can't control like when you're

3352
01:03:56,870 --> 01:03:56,880
all you can't control like when you're
 

3353
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,210
all you can't control like when you're
getting in really big numbers

3354
01:03:59,210 --> 01:03:59,220
getting in really big numbers
 

3355
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:01,490
getting in really big numbers
hey what is what does this system way

3356
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:01,500
hey what is what does this system way
 

3357
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:03,770
hey what is what does this system way
out here feel like if you take your ship

3358
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:03,780
out here feel like if you take your ship
 

3359
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,809
out here feel like if you take your ship
and jump that far

3360
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:05,819
and jump that far
 

3361
01:04:05,819 --> 01:04:07,849
and jump that far
we do level the systems when you go to

3362
01:04:07,849 --> 01:04:07,859
we do level the systems when you go to
 

3363
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:09,289
we do level the systems when you go to
system you'll see oh this is like a

3364
01:04:09,289 --> 01:04:09,299
system you'll see oh this is like a
 

3365
01:04:09,299 --> 01:04:12,230
system you'll see oh this is like a
level 40 system and us being able to at

3366
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:12,240
level 40 system and us being able to at
 

3367
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,170
level 40 system and us being able to at
least control that scale is how we kind

3368
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,180
least control that scale is how we kind
 

3369
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:17,390
least control that scale is how we kind
of ended up with the 100-ish systems we

3370
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:17,400
of ended up with the 100-ish systems we
 

3371
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,849
of ended up with the 100-ish systems we
have what are the what are the levelings

3372
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:19,859
have what are the what are the levelings
 

3373
01:04:19,859 --> 01:04:22,010
have what are the what are the levelings
what do you mean by level levels it

3374
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:22,020
what do you mean by level levels it
 

3375
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:23,150
what do you mean by level levels it
could be like when you look at a map in

3376
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:23,160
could be like when you look at a map in
 

3377
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:24,710
could be like when you look at a map in
a game it says this is the area for

3378
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:24,720
a game it says this is the area for
 

3379
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:27,289
a game it says this is the area for
low-level players this is level one yeah

3380
01:04:27,289 --> 01:04:27,299
low-level players this is level one yeah
 

3381
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:30,950
low-level players this is level one yeah
yeah so we do that on a system basis

3382
01:04:30,950 --> 01:04:30,960
yeah so we do that on a system basis
 

3383
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,990
yeah so we do that on a system basis
star system

3384
01:04:32,990 --> 01:04:33,000
star system
 

3385
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,089
star system
I read that space travel is considered

3386
01:04:35,089 --> 01:04:35,099
I read that space travel is considered
 

3387
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:37,069
I read that space travel is considered
dangerous in this game can you explain

3388
01:04:37,069 --> 01:04:37,079
dangerous in this game can you explain
 

3389
01:04:37,079 --> 01:04:39,589
dangerous in this game can you explain
that's more of that goes back to a tone

3390
01:04:39,589 --> 01:04:39,599
that's more of that goes back to a tone
 

3391
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:40,430
that's more of that goes back to a tone
thing

3392
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:40,440
thing
 

3393
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:42,170
thing
right when you actually play the game

3394
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:42,180
right when you actually play the game
 

3395
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,270
right when you actually play the game
because it's a game like we don't really

3396
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:44,280
because it's a game like we don't really
 

3397
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:48,410
because it's a game like we don't really
kill you when you fly out in space but

3398
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:48,420
kill you when you fly out in space but
 

3399
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:50,930
kill you when you fly out in space but
it has a tone of there's some effort

3400
01:04:50,930 --> 01:04:50,940
it has a tone of there's some effort
 

3401
01:04:50,940 --> 01:04:52,490
it has a tone of there's some effort
involved

3402
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:52,500
involved
 

3403
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,470
involved
and we've dialed it back as we've been

3404
01:04:54,470 --> 01:04:54,480
and we've dialed it back as we've been
 

3405
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,390
and we've dialed it back as we've been
making the game whereas we used to run

3406
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:56,400
making the game whereas we used to run
 

3407
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:58,910
making the game whereas we used to run
out of fuel you jump and get stranded

3408
01:04:58,910 --> 01:04:58,920
out of fuel you jump and get stranded
 

3409
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:00,890
out of fuel you jump and get stranded
which on paper was a great like it's a

3410
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:00,900
which on paper was a great like it's a
 

3411
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:02,210
which on paper was a great like it's a
great moment when you get stranded you

3412
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:02,220
great moment when you get stranded you
 

3413
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:03,650
great moment when you get stranded you
have to press this Beacon you don't know

3414
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:03,660
have to press this Beacon you don't know
 

3415
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:05,510
have to press this Beacon you don't know
who's going to come

3416
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:05,520
who's going to come
 

3417
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:07,609
who's going to come
um turns out that's not like it just

3418
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:07,619
um turns out that's not like it just
 

3419
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,470
um turns out that's not like it just
stops your game we found you'll be

3420
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:09,480
stops your game we found you'll be
 

3421
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:11,569
stops your game we found you'll be
playing the game and I ran out of fuel

3422
01:05:11,569 --> 01:05:11,579
playing the game and I ran out of fuel
 

3423
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,490
playing the game and I ran out of fuel
okay I guess I'll just

3424
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:13,500
okay I guess I'll just
 

3425
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,650
okay I guess I'll just
wander these planets trying to mine for

3426
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:15,660
wander these planets trying to mine for
 

3427
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,150
wander these planets trying to mine for
fuel so I can get back to what I was

3428
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:17,160
fuel so I can get back to what I was
 

3429
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:19,549
fuel so I can get back to what I was
doing it's just you know it's a fun

3430
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:19,559
doing it's just you know it's a fun
 

3431
01:05:19,559 --> 01:05:22,130
doing it's just you know it's a fun
killer that's too realistic of a

3432
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:22,140
killer that's too realistic of a
 

3433
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,530
killer that's too realistic of a
simulation of The Human Condition

3434
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:24,540
simulation of The Human Condition
 

3435
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:26,270
simulation of The Human Condition
yeah I know the idea was well it's very

3436
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:26,280
yeah I know the idea was well it's very
 

3437
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:27,890
yeah I know the idea was well it's very
you know games do that if you had like a

3438
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:27,900
you know games do that if you had like a
 

3439
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,530
you know games do that if you had like a
hardcore you're right a hardcore

3440
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:30,540
hardcore you're right a hardcore
 

3441
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,150
hardcore you're right a hardcore
survival mode that's the kind of thing

3442
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:32,160
survival mode that's the kind of thing
 

3443
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,589
survival mode that's the kind of thing
you would do maybe we'll do it in the

3444
01:05:33,589 --> 01:05:33,599
you would do maybe we'll do it in the
 

3445
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:34,789
you would do maybe we'll do it in the
future

3446
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:34,799
future
 

3447
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:36,349
future
um but it's more of like a tone how they

3448
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:36,359
um but it's more of like a tone how they
 

3449
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:37,789
um but it's more of like a tone how they
build their ships do they have all the

3450
01:05:37,789 --> 01:05:37,799
build their ships do they have all the
 

3451
01:05:37,799 --> 01:05:40,569
build their ships do they have all the
right things for safety we do get into

3452
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:40,579
right things for safety we do get into
 

3453
01:05:40,579 --> 01:05:44,150
right things for safety we do get into
environmental things on the planets you

3454
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:44,160
environmental things on the planets you
 

3455
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,770
environmental things on the planets you
know in your spacesuit obviously a lot

3456
01:05:45,770 --> 01:05:45,780
know in your spacesuit obviously a lot
 

3457
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,510
know in your spacesuit obviously a lot
of different spacesuits and Buffs for

3458
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:47,520
of different spacesuits and Buffs for
 

3459
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,750
of different spacesuits and Buffs for
you know the gases the toxicity or the

3460
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:50,760
you know the gases the toxicity or the
 

3461
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:55,789
you know the gases the toxicity or the
temperature on on various planets

3462
01:05:55,789 --> 01:05:55,799

 

3463
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:58,549

are there robots yes those companions

3464
01:05:58,549 --> 01:05:58,559
are there robots yes those companions
 

3465
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:01,730
are there robots yes those companions
are they robots by chance can you one of

3466
01:06:01,730 --> 01:06:01,740
are they robots by chance can you one of
 

3467
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,250
are they robots by chance can you one of
the companions the robot Vasco yeah okay

3468
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:04,260
the companions the robot Vasco yeah okay
 

3469
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:05,809
the companions the robot Vasco yeah okay
so they have they have uh they have a

3470
01:06:05,809 --> 01:06:05,819
so they have they have uh they have a
 

3471
01:06:05,819 --> 01:06:07,370
so they have they have uh they have a
name and a personality and so on and

3475
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:12,950
Vasco does and then there's a whole
bunch of I call them generic robots

3476
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:12,960
bunch of I call them generic robots
 

3477
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,990
bunch of I call them generic robots
they're you like we use them for utility

3478
01:06:14,990 --> 01:06:15,000
they're you like we use them for utility
 

3479
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,170
they're you like we use them for utility
you know okay people we actually dialed

3480
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:18,180
you know okay people we actually dialed
 

3481
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,309
you know okay people we actually dialed
them back because if you think about

3482
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:19,319
them back because if you think about
 

3483
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:21,049
them back because if you think about
well you know a lot about this more than

3484
01:06:21,049 --> 01:06:21,059
well you know a lot about this more than
 

3485
01:06:21,059 --> 01:06:23,690
well you know a lot about this more than
uh me in terms of I'm offended right now

3486
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:23,700
uh me in terms of I'm offended right now
 

3487
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:26,270
uh me in terms of I'm offended right now
you're calling robots generic no no the

3488
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:26,280
you're calling robots generic no no the
 

3489
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,430
you're calling robots generic no no the
ones we use the ones we we use we made

3490
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:28,440
ones we use the ones we we use we made
 

3491
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,109
ones we use the ones we we use we made
them more generic we didn't so we didn't

3492
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:30,119
them more generic we didn't so we didn't
 

3493
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,930
them more generic we didn't so we didn't
feel sensitive about this I understand

3494
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:32,940
feel sensitive about this I understand
 

3495
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:35,510
feel sensitive about this I understand
um if you were to chart the future you

3496
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:35,520
um if you were to chart the future you
 

3497
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,190
um if you were to chart the future you
would say robots would have a much

3498
01:06:37,190 --> 01:06:37,200
would say robots would have a much
 

3499
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,650
would say robots would have a much
bigger role in our future than we are

3500
01:06:39,650 --> 01:06:39,660
bigger role in our future than we are
 

3501
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:41,089
bigger role in our future than we are
presenting

3502
01:06:41,089 --> 01:06:41,099
presenting
 

3503
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:44,270
presenting
um but that was a tone thing so we most

3504
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:44,280
um but that was a tone thing so we most
 

3505
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:46,309
um but that was a tone thing so we most
of our robots are there as utility

3506
01:06:46,309 --> 01:06:46,319
of our robots are there as utility
 

3507
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:48,589
of our robots are there as utility
robots and there are some combat ones as

3508
01:06:48,589 --> 01:06:48,599
robots and there are some combat ones as
 

3509
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,990
robots and there are some combat ones as
well as enemies so it's a deeply human

3510
01:06:50,990 --> 01:06:51,000
well as enemies so it's a deeply human
 

3511
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,990
well as enemies so it's a deeply human
world very much yes in in terms of its

3512
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:54,000
world very much yes in in terms of its
 

3513
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,890
world very much yes in in terms of its
own

3514
01:06:54,890 --> 01:06:54,900
own
 

3515
01:06:54,900 --> 01:06:57,349
own
uh so

3516
01:06:57,349 --> 01:06:57,359
uh so
 

3517
01:06:57,359 --> 01:07:00,049
uh so
have you talked to Elon about this about

3518
01:07:00,049 --> 01:07:00,059
have you talked to Elon about this about
 

3519
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,150
have you talked to Elon about this about
this game over there a little bit

3520
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:02,160
this game over there a little bit
 

3521
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:04,130
this game over there a little bit
how much of reality like the work of

3522
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:04,140
how much of reality like the work of
 

3523
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,890
how much of reality like the work of
SpaceX is an inspiration for the

3524
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:06,900
SpaceX is an inspiration for the
 

3525
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:08,690
SpaceX is an inspiration for the
decisions made in this game

3526
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:08,700
decisions made in this game
 

3527
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,049
decisions made in this game
I wouldn't say it's for the decisions we

3528
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:12,059
I wouldn't say it's for the decisions we
 

3529
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:14,390
I wouldn't say it's for the decisions we
made but

3530
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:14,400
made but
 

3531
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,910
made but
you know visiting SpaceX and walking in

3532
01:07:16,910 --> 01:07:16,920
you know visiting SpaceX and walking in
 

3533
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,250
you know visiting SpaceX and walking in
there it was

3534
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:19,260
there it was
 

3535
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:22,190
there it was
it's like the Avengers Mitch NASA it's

3536
01:07:22,190 --> 01:07:22,200
it's like the Avengers Mitch NASA it's
 

3537
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:24,829
it's like the Avengers Mitch NASA it's
like the most amazing and here we're

3538
01:07:24,829 --> 01:07:24,839
like the most amazing and here we're
 

3539
01:07:24,839 --> 01:07:26,990
like the most amazing and here we're
building the next gen like see the the

3540
01:07:26,990 --> 01:07:27,000
building the next gen like see the the
 

3541
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,930
building the next gen like see the the
dragon stuff before it was uh you know

3542
01:07:29,930 --> 01:07:29,940
dragon stuff before it was uh you know
 

3543
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:32,329
dragon stuff before it was uh you know
other people saw it like just I was

3544
01:07:32,329 --> 01:07:32,339
other people saw it like just I was
 

3545
01:07:32,339 --> 01:07:34,250
other people saw it like just I was
really

3546
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:34,260
really
 

3547
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,770
really
in awe

3548
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:36,780
in awe
 

3549
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:39,890
in awe
you know just giant machine that looks

3550
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:39,900
you know just giant machine that looks
 

3551
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:42,650
you know just giant machine that looks
for imperfections on the surface of

3552
01:07:42,650 --> 01:07:42,660
for imperfections on the surface of
 

3553
01:07:42,660 --> 01:07:44,569
for imperfections on the surface of
these giant

3554

these giant
you know fuselah just you know whenever

3556
01:07:48,289 --> 01:07:48,299
you know fuselah just you know whenever
 

3557
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:50,809
you know fuselah just you know whenever
and because you know we're in DC go to

3558
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:50,819
and because you know we're in DC go to
 

3559
01:07:50,819 --> 01:07:52,490
and because you know we're in DC go to
the air and space museum a lot and so

3560
01:07:52,490 --> 01:07:52,500
the air and space museum a lot and so
 

3561
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:55,309
the air and space museum a lot and so
whenever I look at those kind of things

3562
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:55,319
whenever I look at those kind of things
 

3563
01:07:55,319 --> 01:07:56,569
whenever I look at those kind of things
or you know you'll visit the space

3564
01:07:56,569 --> 01:07:56,579
or you know you'll visit the space
 

3565
01:07:56,579 --> 01:07:59,390
or you know you'll visit the space
shuttle sort of overcome with how big it

3566
01:07:59,390 --> 01:07:59,400
shuttle sort of overcome with how big it
 

3567
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,430
shuttle sort of overcome with how big it
is and I go stand back by the engines

3568
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:01,440
is and I go stand back by the engines
 

3569
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:05,029
is and I go stand back by the engines
and think about that thing leaving orbit

3570
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:05,039
and think about that thing leaving orbit
 

3571
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:06,410
and think about that thing leaving orbit
you know and one of the things that Elon

3572
01:08:06,410 --> 01:08:06,420
you know and one of the things that Elon
 

3573
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,569
you know and one of the things that Elon
really impresses like we're reaching the

3574
01:08:08,569 --> 01:08:08,579
really impresses like we're reaching the
 

3575
01:08:08,579 --> 01:08:10,609
really impresses like we're reaching the
edge of physics on a lot of the stuff

3576
01:08:10,609 --> 01:08:10,619
edge of physics on a lot of the stuff
 

3577
01:08:10,619 --> 01:08:13,190
edge of physics on a lot of the stuff
where how hard it is

3578
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:13,200
where how hard it is
 

3579
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:14,870
where how hard it is
to leave

3580
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:14,880
to leave
 

3581
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:16,309
to leave
orbit

the gravitational pull and like so the

3584
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:20,100
the gravitational pull and like so the
 

3585
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,950
the gravitational pull and like so the
engineering that has gone into that

3586
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:21,960
engineering that has gone into that
 

3587
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:25,550
engineering that has gone into that
rspace program what what he's doing now

3588
01:08:25,550 --> 01:08:25,560
rspace program what what he's doing now
 

3589
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,470

um I just marvel at I don't understand

3590
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:27,480
um I just marvel at I don't understand
 

3591

would think why don't you take a picture

3630
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:13,859
would think why don't you take a picture
 

3631
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:15,110
would think why don't you take a picture
of this thing

3632
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:15,120
of this thing
 

3633
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,269
of this thing
and the next day we found out it was in

3634
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:17,279
and the next day we found out it was in
 

3635
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:19,970
and the next day we found out it was in
the news it was the SpaceX launch in

3636
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:19,980
the news it was the SpaceX launch in
 

3637
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:21,769
the news it was the SpaceX launch in
Florida

3638
01:09:21,769 --> 01:09:21,779
Florida
 

3639
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:24,289
Florida
and I'm seeing it from

3640
01:09:24,289 --> 01:09:24,299
and I'm seeing it from
 

3641
01:09:24,299 --> 01:09:27,229
and I'm seeing it from
Delaware Maryland area it was one of the

3642
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:27,239
Delaware Maryland area it was one of the
 

3643
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:29,390
Delaware Maryland area it was one of the
most it was incredible it's just even

3644
01:09:29,390 --> 01:09:29,400
most it was incredible it's just even
 

3645
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,709
most it was incredible it's just even
just that

3646
01:09:30,709 --> 01:09:30,719
just that
 

3647
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:32,870
just that
I am in complete of

3648
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:32,880
I am in complete of
 

3649
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,329
I am in complete of
is there some aspect to that that you

3650
01:09:35,329 --> 01:09:35,339
is there some aspect to that that you
 

3651
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,849
is there some aspect to that that you
can replicate the The Majestic nature

3652
01:09:37,849 --> 01:09:37,859
can replicate the The Majestic nature
 

3653
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:42,110
can replicate the The Majestic nature
that in in the video game

3654
01:09:42,110 --> 01:09:42,120

 

3655
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,209

the answer to that you know I think some

3656
01:09:44,209 --> 01:09:44,219
the answer to that you know I think some
 

3657
01:09:44,219 --> 01:09:45,349
the answer to that you know I think some
of it we

3658
01:09:45,349 --> 01:09:45,359
of it we
 

3659
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:47,570
of it we
were doing when you're standing on a

3660
01:09:47,570 --> 01:09:47,580
were doing when you're standing on a
 

3661
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,010
were doing when you're standing on a
planet and you see you see the other

3662
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:49,020
planet and you see you see the other
 

3663
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:51,590
planet and you see you see the other
moons go by yeah and then you realize I

3664
01:09:51,590 --> 01:09:51,600
moons go by yeah and then you realize I
 

3665
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,450
moons go by yeah and then you realize I
could get my ship blast off and land

3666
01:09:53,450 --> 01:09:53,460
could get my ship blast off and land
 

3667
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,610
could get my ship blast off and land
there and build myself a home I think

3668
01:09:55,610 --> 01:09:55,620
there and build myself a home I think
 

3669
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,229
there and build myself a home I think
that's pretty cool

3670
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:57,239
that's pretty cool
 

3671
01:09:57,239 --> 01:09:59,930
that's pretty cool
there's a minor thing we do which is we

3672
01:09:59,930 --> 01:09:59,940
there's a minor thing we do which is we
 

3673
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,030
there's a minor thing we do which is we
um we have other ships come and go from

3674
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:02,040
um we have other ships come and go from
 

3675
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,530
um we have other ships come and go from
the Star ports when you're there so

3676
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:03,540
the Star ports when you're there so
 

3677
01:10:03,540 --> 01:10:04,790
the Star ports when you're there so
you'll be in a city and then you hear

3678
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:04,800
you'll be in a city and then you hear
 

3679
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,650
you'll be in a city and then you hear
this when you hear the engine you look

3680
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:06,660
this when you hear the engine you look
 

3681
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,390
this when you hear the engine you look
up and the ship is taking off or come

3682
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:08,400
up and the ship is taking off or come
 

3683
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:09,890
up and the ship is taking off or come
out that's great there's nothing for you

3684
01:10:09,890 --> 01:10:09,900
out that's great there's nothing for you
 

3685
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,770
out that's great there's nothing for you
to do but

3686
01:10:11,770 --> 01:10:11,780
to do but
 

3687
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,530
to do but
it's I think it's awesome yeah yeah

3688
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:15,540
it's I think it's awesome yeah yeah
 

3689
01:10:15,540 --> 01:10:17,689
it's I think it's awesome yeah yeah
and then that's all about creating the

3690
01:10:17,689 --> 01:10:17,699
and then that's all about creating the
 

3691
01:10:17,699 --> 01:10:20,570
and then that's all about creating the
soundscape to feel seeing it and like oh

3692
01:10:20,570 --> 01:10:20,580
soundscape to feel seeing it and like oh
 

3693
01:10:20,580 --> 01:10:22,850
soundscape to feel seeing it and like oh
that's real that's a ship that or you

3694
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:22,860
that's real that's a ship that or you
 

3695
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:24,950
that's real that's a ship that or you
jump into a system and you see these

3696
01:10:24,950 --> 01:10:24,960
jump into a system and you see these
 

3697
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,290
jump into a system and you see these
Freighters and sometimes they contact

3698
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:27,300
Freighters and sometimes they contact
 

3699
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:29,810
Freighters and sometimes they contact
you like

3700
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:29,820
you like
 

3701
01:10:29,820 --> 01:10:31,490
you like
um it's not all just like jump in and

3702
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:31,500
um it's not all just like jump in and
 

3703
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,450
um it's not all just like jump in and
combat

3704
01:10:32,450 --> 01:10:32,460
combat
 

3705
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:34,790
combat
do you ever think about the fact that

3706
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:34,800
do you ever think about the fact that
 

3707
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,370
do you ever think about the fact that
science fiction seems to make a

3708
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:37,380
science fiction seems to make a
 

3709
01:10:37,380 --> 01:10:40,850
science fiction seems to make a
it has a way of creating reality

3710
01:10:40,850 --> 01:10:40,860
it has a way of creating reality
 

3711
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:44,270
it has a way of creating reality
not just kind of predicting it or

3712
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:44,280
not just kind of predicting it or
 

3713
01:10:44,280 --> 01:10:47,330
not just kind of predicting it or
imagining it it's almost like the thing

3714
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:47,340
imagining it it's almost like the thing
 

3715
01:10:47,340 --> 01:10:49,430
imagining it it's almost like the thing
you put out there with a video game like

3716
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:49,440
you put out there with a video game like
 

3717
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:50,510
you put out there with a video game like
this

3718
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:50,520
this
 

3719
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,410
this
like Starfield that you cut anticipate

3720
01:10:54,410 --> 01:10:54,420
like Starfield that you cut anticipate
 

3721
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,770
like Starfield that you cut anticipate
it it kind of fuels people's imagination

3722
01:10:57,770 --> 01:10:57,780
it it kind of fuels people's imagination
 

3723
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:01,130
it it kind of fuels people's imagination
what is possible

3724
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:01,140

 

3725
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,709

maybe I don't know I don't know I can't

3726
01:11:03,709 --> 01:11:03,719
maybe I don't know I don't know I can't
 

3727
01:11:03,719 --> 01:11:06,350
maybe I don't know I don't know I can't
I can't say you're making me think now

3728
01:11:06,350 --> 01:11:06,360
I can't say you're making me think now
 

3729
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,110
I can't say you're making me think now
about other science fiction that

3730
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:09,120
about other science fiction that
 

3731
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:11,270
about other science fiction that
movie I love Minority Report it's more

3732
01:11:11,270 --> 01:11:11,280
movie I love Minority Report it's more
 

3733
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:13,430
movie I love Minority Report it's more
of like a not a space movie but more

3734
01:11:13,430 --> 01:11:13,440
of like a not a space movie but more
 

3735
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,890
of like a not a space movie but more
like looking at the future if you look

3736
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:15,900
like looking at the future if you look
 

3737
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:17,270
like looking at the future if you look
at a lot of the things in that movie

3738
01:11:17,270 --> 01:11:17,280
at a lot of the things in that movie
 

3739
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:19,070
at a lot of the things in that movie
it's almost like I think those are

3740
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:19,080
it's almost like I think those are
 

3741
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:23,209
it's almost like I think those are
coming true yeah I mean uh is that the

3742
01:11:23,209 --> 01:11:23,219
coming true yeah I mean uh is that the
 

3743
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:25,550
coming true yeah I mean uh is that the
one that you do interface this like uh

3744
01:11:25,550 --> 01:11:25,560
one that you do interface this like uh
 

3745
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,010
one that you do interface this like uh
it's the interfaces and then the you

3746
01:11:28,010 --> 01:11:28,020
it's the interfaces and then the you
 

3747
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:29,870
it's the interfaces and then the you
know a way looks his child's more like a

3748
01:11:29,870 --> 01:11:29,880
know a way looks his child's more like a
 

3749
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,290
know a way looks his child's more like a
holographic almost AR VR kind of thing

3750
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:33,300
holographic almost AR VR kind of thing
 

3751
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,550
holographic almost AR VR kind of thing
or digital billboards

3752
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:36,560
or digital billboards
 

3753
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,910
or digital billboards
or trying to predict human behavior

3754
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:40,920
or trying to predict human behavior
 

3755
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,530
or trying to predict human behavior
um there's that there's just a lot of

3756
01:11:42,530 --> 01:11:42,540
um there's that there's just a lot of
 

3757
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:44,149
um there's that there's just a lot of
future stuff in that movie as it comes

3758
01:11:44,149 --> 01:11:44,159
future stuff in that movie as it comes
 

3759
01:11:44,159 --> 01:11:45,890
future stuff in that movie as it comes
to sci-fi to your other question I don't

3760
01:11:45,890 --> 01:11:45,900
to sci-fi to your other question I don't
 

3761
01:11:45,900 --> 01:11:48,530
to sci-fi to your other question I don't
know I I don't know

3762
01:11:48,530 --> 01:11:48,540
know I I don't know
 

3763
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,330
know I I don't know
well I think it does and it's

3764
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:50,340
well I think it does and it's
 

3765
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,550
well I think it does and it's
interesting I mean I suppose

3766
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:52,560
interesting I mean I suppose
 

3767
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,250
interesting I mean I suppose
you're trying to create the most realist

3768
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:55,260
you're trying to create the most realist
 

3769
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:58,669
you're trying to create the most realist
sticking to the tone the most immersive

3770
01:11:58,669 --> 01:11:58,679
sticking to the tone the most immersive
 

3771
01:11:58,679 --> 01:12:00,950
sticking to the tone the most immersive
realistic world and almost by accident

3772
01:12:00,950 --> 01:12:00,960
realistic world and almost by accident
 

3773
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,689
realistic world and almost by accident
you create the thing that is possible

3774
01:12:02,689 --> 01:12:02,699
you create the thing that is possible
 

3775
01:12:02,699 --> 01:12:05,209
you create the thing that is possible
because you want it to be realistic in

3776
01:12:05,209 --> 01:12:05,219
because you want it to be realistic in
 

3777
01:12:05,219 --> 01:12:07,270
because you want it to be realistic in
some deep sense so

3778
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:07,280
some deep sense so
 

3779
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,430
some deep sense so
accidentally can become the possible and

3780
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:10,440
accidentally can become the possible and
 

3781
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,770
accidentally can become the possible and
then that places that idea in people's

3782
01:12:12,770 --> 01:12:12,780
then that places that idea in people's
 

3783
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,110
then that places that idea in people's
heads I mean if humans are ever to

3784
01:12:15,110 --> 01:12:15,120
heads I mean if humans are ever to
 

3785
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,930
heads I mean if humans are ever to
become a multi-planetary species

3786
01:12:17,930 --> 01:12:17,940
become a multi-planetary species
 

3787
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,610
become a multi-planetary species
we need

3788
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:19,620
we need
 

3789
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:21,649
we need
we need to play games

3790
01:12:21,649 --> 01:12:21,659
we need to play games
 

3791
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:24,350
we need to play games
we need to read sci-fi just help imagine

3792
01:12:24,350 --> 01:12:24,360
we need to read sci-fi just help imagine
 

3793
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:27,470
we need to read sci-fi just help imagine
that that's possible to look outside of

3794
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:27,480
that that's possible to look outside of
 

3795
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:30,050
that that's possible to look outside of
Earth to look outside look up on the

3796
01:12:30,050 --> 01:12:30,060
Earth to look outside look up on the
 

3797
01:12:30,060 --> 01:12:31,490
Earth to look outside look up on the
stars then we can actually travel out

3798
01:12:31,490 --> 01:12:31,500
stars then we can actually travel out
 

3799
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:33,649
stars then we can actually travel out
there I don't know there's power to

3800
01:12:33,649 --> 01:12:33,659
there I don't know there's power to
 

3801
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:36,229
there I don't know there's power to
sci-fi to do that I guess you shouldn't

3802
01:12:36,229 --> 01:12:36,239
sci-fi to do that I guess you shouldn't
 

3803
01:12:36,239 --> 01:12:37,990
sci-fi to do that I guess you shouldn't
feel the pressure of that

3804
01:12:37,990 --> 01:12:38,000
feel the pressure of that
 

3805
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,850
feel the pressure of that
I don't know if I'd make the leap

3806
01:12:40,850 --> 01:12:40,860
I don't know if I'd make the leap
 

3807
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,890
I don't know if I'd make the leap
now that's all that what we're doing

3808
01:12:42,890 --> 01:12:42,900
now that's all that what we're doing
 

3809
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:46,729
now that's all that what we're doing
might now maybe you know

3810
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:46,739
might now maybe you know
 

3811
01:12:46,739 --> 01:12:49,250
might now maybe you know
one of our you know hopefully it might

3812
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:49,260
one of our you know hopefully it might
 

3813
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:51,709
one of our you know hopefully it might
Inspire some young people who are headed

3814
01:12:51,709 --> 01:12:51,719
Inspire some young people who are headed
 

3815
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:53,930
Inspire some young people who are headed
in that direction alike

3816
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:53,940
in that direction alike
 

3817
01:12:53,940 --> 01:12:56,390
in that direction alike
Oh I thought about getting into space

3818
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:56,400
Oh I thought about getting into space
 

3819
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,189
Oh I thought about getting into space
and space exploration and being an

3820
01:12:58,189 --> 01:12:58,199
and space exploration and being an
 

3821
01:12:58,199 --> 01:13:00,110
and space exploration and being an
engineer doing these things and I played

3822
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:00,120
engineer doing these things and I played
 

3823
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,189
engineer doing these things and I played
this game and

3824
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:01,199
this game and
 

3825
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:02,990
this game and
you know it really

3826
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:03,000
you know it really
 

3827
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,270
you know it really
sparked that interest in me so I'm gonna

3828
01:13:05,270 --> 01:13:05,280
sparked that interest in me so I'm gonna
 

3829
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,430
sparked that interest in me so I'm gonna
go take that as a field and maybe that's

3830
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:07,440
go take that as a field and maybe that's
 

3831
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,770
go take that as a field and maybe that's
the person who goes and does some of

3832
01:13:09,770 --> 01:13:09,780
the person who goes and does some of
 

3833
01:13:09,780 --> 01:13:11,689
the person who goes and does some of
these things yeah because in the next

3834
01:13:11,689 --> 01:13:11,699
these things yeah because in the next
 

3835
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:13,430
these things yeah because in the next
couple of decades

3836
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:13,440
couple of decades
 

3837
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:16,610
couple of decades
a likely a human being will step foot on

3838
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:16,620
a likely a human being will step foot on
 

3839
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:18,890
a likely a human being will step foot on
Mars which are the first steps until

3840
01:13:18,890 --> 01:13:18,900
Mars which are the first steps until
 

3841
01:13:18,900 --> 01:13:21,830
Mars which are the first steps until
we're just becoming multi-planetary

3842
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:21,840
we're just becoming multi-planetary
 

3843
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,330
we're just becoming multi-planetary
and if you read some of the stuff

3844
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:23,340
and if you read some of the stuff
 

3845
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,310
and if you read some of the stuff
they're doing uh with the James Webb

3846
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:25,320
they're doing uh with the James Webb
 

3847
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:27,770
they're doing uh with the James Webb
Telescope and them being able to look

3848
01:13:27,770 --> 01:13:27,780
Telescope and them being able to look
 

3849
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:29,870
Telescope and them being able to look
for signs of life

3850
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:29,880
for signs of life
 

3851
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,930
for signs of life
on other planets it's quite fascinating

3852
01:13:32,930 --> 01:13:32,940
on other planets it's quite fascinating
 

3853
01:13:32,940 --> 01:13:35,209
on other planets it's quite fascinating
and you know recent stuff I read say

3854
01:13:35,209 --> 01:13:35,219
and you know recent stuff I read say
 

3855
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:38,450
and you know recent stuff I read say
they think in 20 years they will

3856
01:13:38,450 --> 01:13:38,460
they think in 20 years they will
 

3857
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,649
they think in 20 years they will
so

3858
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:39,659
so
 

3859
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:42,709
so
it's actually quite encouraging to think

3860
01:13:42,709 --> 01:13:42,719
it's actually quite encouraging to think
 

3861
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,290
it's actually quite encouraging to think
I was almost a dream of mine like in our

3862
01:13:45,290 --> 01:13:45,300
I was almost a dream of mine like in our
 

3863
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,870
I was almost a dream of mine like in our
lifetimes that we discover Life on

3864
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:47,880
lifetimes that we discover Life on
 

3865
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,010
lifetimes that we discover Life on
another planet

3866
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:49,020
another planet
 

3867
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,010
another planet
yeah especially if it's intelligent life

3868
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:52,020
yeah especially if it's intelligent life
 

3869
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:54,110
yeah especially if it's intelligent life
I've been talking to a lot of biologists

3870
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:54,120
I've been talking to a lot of biologists
 

3871
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,030
I've been talking to a lot of biologists
and a lot of folks I imagine there's

3872
01:13:56,030 --> 01:13:56,040
and a lot of folks I imagine there's
 

3873
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,250
and a lot of folks I imagine there's
life everywhere out there the numbers

3874
01:13:58,250 --> 01:13:58,260
life everywhere out there the numbers
 

3875
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,950
life everywhere out there the numbers
are would say so yes the challenging

3876
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:00,960
are would say so yes the challenging
 

3877
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,169
are would say so yes the challenging
question is what it looks like and how

3878
01:14:03,169 --> 01:14:03,179
question is what it looks like and how
 

3879
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:05,630
question is what it looks like and how
much of it is intelligent so a lot of

3880
01:14:05,630 --> 01:14:05,640
much of it is intelligent so a lot of
 

3881
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,729
much of it is intelligent so a lot of
biologists tell me the big the big

3882
01:14:07,729 --> 01:14:07,739
biologists tell me the big the big
 

3883
01:14:07,739 --> 01:14:10,370
biologists tell me the big the big
difficult leap is from the precarious to

3884
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:10,380
difficult leap is from the precarious to
 

3885
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:12,770
difficult leap is from the precarious to
the eukaryotes so like the the complex

3886
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:12,780
the eukaryotes so like the the complex
 

3887
01:14:12,780 --> 01:14:15,350
the eukaryotes so like the the complex
life it could be that a lot of our

3888
01:14:15,350 --> 01:14:15,360
life it could be that a lot of our
 

3889
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,810
life it could be that a lot of our
universe is just filled with bacteria

3890
01:14:17,810 --> 01:14:17,820
universe is just filled with bacteria
 

3891
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,149
universe is just filled with bacteria
I believe if if I'm understanding it

3892
01:14:20,149 --> 01:14:20,159
I believe if if I'm understanding it
 

3893
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:21,830
I believe if if I'm understanding it
right that there's two ways they're

3894
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:21,840
right that there's two ways they're
 

3895
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:23,330
right that there's two ways they're
going to look at planets when they can

3896
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:23,340
going to look at planets when they can
 

3897
01:14:23,340 --> 01:14:25,250
going to look at planets when they can
look at you know they can read hey this

3898
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:25,260
look at you know they can read hey this
 

3899
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:27,350
look at you know they can read hey this
planet has this kind of gas they can now

3900
01:14:27,350 --> 01:14:27,360
planet has this kind of gas they can now
 

3901
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,030
planet has this kind of gas they can now
look at the ones that are created by

3902
01:14:29,030 --> 01:14:29,040
look at the ones that are created by
 

3903
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,130
look at the ones that are created by
potential life forms and then the ones

3904
01:14:31,130 --> 01:14:31,140
potential life forms and then the ones
 

3905
01:14:31,140 --> 01:14:33,709
potential life forms and then the ones
that are created the byproducts of

3906
01:14:33,709 --> 01:14:33,719
that are created the byproducts of
 

3907
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,169
that are created the byproducts of
Industry so there's only certain ones

3908
01:14:36,169 --> 01:14:36,179
Industry so there's only certain ones
 

3909
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:37,910
Industry so there's only certain ones
that are created if you have a society

3910
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:37,920
that are created if you have a society
 

3911
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:39,470
that are created if you have a society
there

3912
01:14:39,470 --> 01:14:39,480
there
 

3913
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,870
there
um and that they can start looking on

3914
01:14:41,870 --> 01:14:41,880
um and that they can start looking on
 

3915
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,790
um and that they can start looking on
these types of in these types of star

3916
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:43,800
these types of in these types of star
 

3917
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:46,370
these types of in these types of star
systems and these planets but it takes a

3918
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:46,380
systems and these planets but it takes a
 

3919
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:47,450
systems and these planets but it takes a
lot of time because you have to book

3920
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:47,460
lot of time because you have to book
 

3921
01:14:47,460 --> 01:14:49,370
lot of time because you have to book
time on that telescope you have to like

3922
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:49,380
time on that telescope you have to like
 

3923
01:14:49,380 --> 01:14:51,229
time on that telescope you have to like
look at that planet over a long period

3924
01:14:51,229 --> 01:14:51,239
look at that planet over a long period
 

3925
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:53,090
look at that planet over a long period
of time but

3926
01:14:53,090 --> 01:14:53,100
of time but
 

3927
01:14:53,100 --> 01:14:55,490
of time but
in theory given enough time given the

3928
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:55,500
in theory given enough time given the
 

3929
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:57,950
in theory given enough time given the
amount of space out there

3930
01:14:57,950 --> 01:14:57,960
amount of space out there
 

3931
01:14:57,960 --> 01:14:59,510
amount of space out there
um

3932
01:14:59,510 --> 01:14:59,520
um
 

3933
01:14:59,520 --> 01:15:01,189
um
we would find one

3934
01:15:01,189 --> 01:15:01,199
we would find one
 

3935
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,930
we would find one
that would be a cool thing in this short

3936
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:02,940
that would be a cool thing in this short
 

3937
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:05,870
that would be a cool thing in this short
life of ours to find out definitively

3938
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:05,880
life of ours to find out definitively
 

3939
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,590
life of ours to find out definitively
that there is an an industrial

3940
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:08,600
that there is an an industrial
 

3941
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,330
that there is an an industrial
intelligent civilization out there

3942
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:11,340

things with like I love the Khajiit
 

4255
01:21:22,260 --> 01:21:26,870
things with like I love the Khajiit
follower mod for Skyrim it's awesome

4256
01:21:26,870 --> 01:21:26,880
follower mod for Skyrim it's awesome
 

4257
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:29,810
follower mod for Skyrim it's awesome
um the uh there have been quest lines

4258
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:29,820
um the uh there have been quest lines
 

4259
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:31,610
um the uh there have been quest lines
those things just take a really really

4260
01:21:31,610 --> 01:21:31,620
those things just take a really really
 

4261
01:21:31,620 --> 01:21:34,370
those things just take a really really
long time and so someone is going to do

4262
01:21:34,370 --> 01:21:34,380
long time and so someone is going to do
 

4263
01:21:34,380 --> 01:21:35,330
long time and so someone is going to do
that

4264
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:35,340
that
 

4265
01:21:35,340 --> 01:21:37,610
that
that's almost like it takes them a long

4266
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:37,620
that's almost like it takes them a long
 

4267
01:21:37,620 --> 01:21:41,270
that's almost like it takes them a long
time it's more than a hobby and we're

4268
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:41,280
time it's more than a hobby and we're
 

4269
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:43,010
time it's more than a hobby and we're
always looking at ways that we can make

4270
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:43,020
always looking at ways that we can make
 

4271
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,229
always looking at ways that we can make
it like hey they can turn a career into

4272
01:21:45,229 --> 01:21:45,239
it like hey they can turn a career into
 

4273
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:48,890
it like hey they can turn a career into
it because it's just awesome

4274
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:48,900
it because it's just awesome
 

4275
01:21:48,900 --> 01:21:51,590
it because it's just awesome
what about is is there any possibility

4276
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:51,600
what about is is there any possibility
 

4277
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,850
what about is is there any possibility
in doing a mod for the some of the AI

4278
01:21:55,850 --> 01:21:55,860
in doing a mod for the some of the AI
 

4279
01:21:55,860 --> 01:21:56,870
in doing a mod for the some of the AI
stuff

4280
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:56,880
stuff
 

4281
01:21:56,880 --> 01:22:00,890
stuff
there is and I've seen some but to

4282
01:22:00,890 --> 01:22:00,900
there is and I've seen some but to
 

4283
01:22:00,900 --> 01:22:02,810
there is and I've seen some but to
really move it along if they're using

4284
01:22:02,810 --> 01:22:02,820
really move it along if they're using
 

4285
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:04,130
really move it along if they're using
the tools that we already put out there

4286
01:22:04,130 --> 01:22:04,140
the tools that we already put out there
 

4287
01:22:04,140 --> 01:22:06,110
the tools that we already put out there
so to really move the AI along you'd

4288
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:06,120
so to really move the AI along you'd
 

4289
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:08,990
so to really move the AI along you'd
have to get in the code which some

4290
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:09,000
have to get in the code which some
 

4291
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:10,729
have to get in the code which some
people have figured out ways to hack in

4292
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:10,739
people have figured out ways to hack in
 

4293
01:22:10,739 --> 01:22:13,130
people have figured out ways to hack in
and do things with script extenders but

4294
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:13,140
and do things with script extenders but
 

4295
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:15,410
and do things with script extenders but
for the most part like really pushing it

4296
01:22:15,410 --> 01:22:15,420
for the most part like really pushing it
 

4297
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:17,450
for the most part like really pushing it
it does take us which is why you see

4298
01:22:17,450 --> 01:22:17,460
it does take us which is why you see
 

4299
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:20,570
it does take us which is why you see
when we have a new game come along the

4300
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:20,580
when we have a new game come along the
 

4301
01:22:20,580 --> 01:22:22,130
when we have a new game come along the
palette that they have is there's

4302
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:22,140
palette that they have is there's
 

4303
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,810
palette that they have is there's
there's so many more things they can do

4304
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:23,820
there's so many more things they can do
 

4305
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,169
there's so many more things they can do
well I've I've built Bots that play

4306
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:27,179
well I've I've built Bots that play
 

4307
01:22:27,179 --> 01:22:29,149
well I've I've built Bots that play
um the the driving games

4308
01:22:29,149 --> 01:22:29,159
um the the driving games
 

4309
01:22:29,159 --> 01:22:31,970
um the the driving games
but they do that by just taking

4310
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:31,980
but they do that by just taking
 

4311
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:34,490
but they do that by just taking
um reading the screen and doing basic

4312
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:34,500
um reading the screen and doing basic
 

4313
01:22:34,500 --> 01:22:36,169
um reading the screen and doing basic
not basic it's actually pretty

4314
01:22:36,169 --> 01:22:36,179
not basic it's actually pretty
 

4315
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:37,550
not basic it's actually pretty
complicated but computer vision doing

4316
01:22:37,550 --> 01:22:37,560
complicated but computer vision doing
 

4317
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,810
complicated but computer vision doing
the control but you're basically

4318
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:38,820
the control but you're basically
 

4319
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:40,970
the control but you're basically
simulating the human player

4320
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:40,980
simulating the human player
 

4321
01:22:40,980 --> 01:22:42,890
simulating the human player
um to do that for Skyrim or for what

4322
01:22:42,890 --> 01:22:42,900
um to do that for Skyrim or for what
 

4323
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:44,870
um to do that for Skyrim or for what
some of the open world games that's

4324
01:22:44,870 --> 01:22:44,880
some of the open world games that's
 

4325
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:46,910
some of the open world games that's
literally you have to create AGI to be

4326
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:46,920
literally you have to create AGI to be
 

4327
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:50,750
literally you have to create AGI to be
able to yep to play the those open well

4328
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:50,760
able to yep to play the those open well
 

4329
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:52,130
able to yep to play the those open well
maybe not maybe you can create a super

4330
01:22:52,130 --> 01:22:52,140
maybe not maybe you can create a super
 

4331
01:22:52,140 --> 01:22:54,950
maybe not maybe you can create a super
dumb like just a two-handed sword and

4332
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:54,960
dumb like just a two-handed sword and
 

4333
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:57,410
dumb like just a two-handed sword and
just keep swinging until look there's

4334
01:22:57,410 --> 01:22:57,420
just keep swinging until look there's
 

4335
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:58,970
just keep swinging until look there's
some bot stuff out there that does it we

4336
01:22:58,970 --> 01:22:58,980
some bot stuff out there that does it we
 

4337
01:22:58,980 --> 01:23:01,189
some bot stuff out there that does it we
have we have some very very dumb Bots

4338
01:23:01,189 --> 01:23:01,199
have we have some very very dumb Bots
 

4339
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:03,229
have we have some very very dumb Bots
that we use to run through the world to

4340
01:23:03,229 --> 01:23:03,239
that we use to run through the world to
 

4341
01:23:03,239 --> 01:23:05,630
that we use to run through the world to
test it that will Deploy on a whole

4342
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:05,640
test it that will Deploy on a whole
 

4343
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:07,729
test it that will Deploy on a whole
bunch of servers just to you know we do

4344
01:23:07,729 --> 01:23:07,739
bunch of servers just to you know we do
 

4345
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:09,590
bunch of servers just to you know we do
it every day we run through every space

4346
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:09,600
it every day we run through every space
 

4347
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:11,510
it every day we run through every space
we're doing Starfield and then just

4348
01:23:11,510 --> 01:23:11,520
we're doing Starfield and then just
 

4349
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,850
we're doing Starfield and then just
running they're all out there well it

4350
01:23:13,850 --> 01:23:13,860
running they're all out there well it
 

4351
01:23:13,860 --> 01:23:16,130
running they're all out there well it
does it very quickly it loads up every

4352
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:16,140
does it very quickly it loads up every
 

4353
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:17,750
does it very quickly it loads up every
place every

4354
01:23:17,750 --> 01:23:17,760
place every
 

4355
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,669
place every
every place in the game and runs around

4356
01:23:19,669 --> 01:23:19,679
every place in the game and runs around
 

4357
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:20,870
every place in the game and runs around
a little bit and then loads the next

4358
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:20,880
a little bit and then loads the next
 

4359
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:22,250
a little bit and then loads the next
place and runs around a little bit we're

4360
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:22,260
place and runs around a little bit we're
 

4361
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:24,169
place and runs around a little bit we're
just testing like did a crash what's the

4362
01:23:24,169 --> 01:23:24,179
just testing like did a crash what's the
 

4363
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:25,850
just testing like did a crash what's the
memory growth what's the get a report

4364
01:23:25,850 --> 01:23:25,860
memory growth what's the get a report
 

4365
01:23:25,860 --> 01:23:27,350
memory growth what's the get a report
hear all the places where the frame rate

4366
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:27,360
hear all the places where the frame rate
 

4367
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,970
hear all the places where the frame rate
wasn't up to Snuff

4368
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:28,980
wasn't up to Snuff
 

4369
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:30,950
wasn't up to Snuff
and then we do have one that will play

4370
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:30,960
and then we do have one that will play
 

4371
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:33,649
and then we do have one that will play
on its own heavily scripted but it lets

4372
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:33,659
on its own heavily scripted but it lets
 

4373
01:23:33,659 --> 01:23:35,090
on its own heavily scripted but it lets
us test

4374
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:35,100
us test
 

4375
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:36,290
us test
you know every time we make a build

4376
01:23:36,290 --> 01:23:36,300
you know every time we make a build
 

4377
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:38,390
you know every time we make a build
there's a bot that runs through like the

4378
01:23:38,390 --> 01:23:38,400
there's a bot that runs through like the
 

4379
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:41,149
there's a bot that runs through like the
first one or two main quests like it'll

4380
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:41,159
first one or two main quests like it'll
 

4381
01:23:41,159 --> 01:23:43,310
first one or two main quests like it'll
just play it that way we know do we

4382
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:43,320
just play it that way we know do we
 

4383
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,689
just play it that way we know do we
break anything

4384
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:44,699
break anything
 

4385
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:46,189
break anything
because you don't want to waste like

4386
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:46,199
because you don't want to waste like
 

4387
01:23:46,199 --> 01:23:48,169
because you don't want to waste like
qa's time like you guys broke it again

4388
01:23:48,169 --> 01:23:48,179
qa's time like you guys broke it again
 

4389
01:23:48,179 --> 01:23:50,450
qa's time like you guys broke it again
within five minutes so yeah

4390
01:23:50,450 --> 01:23:50,460
within five minutes so yeah
 

4391
01:23:50,460 --> 01:23:52,970
within five minutes so yeah
yeah so that's for but that's for like

4392
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:52,980
yeah so that's for but that's for like
 

4393
01:23:52,980 --> 01:23:55,550
yeah so that's for but that's for like
uh broken stuff right I wonder if you

4394
01:23:55,550 --> 01:23:55,560
uh broken stuff right I wonder if you
 

4395
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:58,310
uh broken stuff right I wonder if you
can build the bot that estimates the

4396
01:23:58,310 --> 01:23:58,320
can build the bot that estimates the
 

4397
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,229
can build the bot that estimates the
quality of the experience oh my gosh

4398
01:24:00,229 --> 01:24:00,239
quality of the experience oh my gosh
 

4399
01:24:00,239 --> 01:24:03,229
quality of the experience oh my gosh
okay can you do that but just like the

4400
01:24:03,229 --> 01:24:03,239
okay can you do that but just like the
 

4401
01:24:03,239 --> 01:24:04,130
okay can you do that but just like the
number

4402
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:04,140
number
 

4403
01:24:04,140 --> 01:24:06,350
number
like how boring or not boring the boring

4404
01:24:06,350 --> 01:24:06,360
like how boring or not boring the boring
 

4405
01:24:06,360 --> 01:24:08,689
like how boring or not boring the boring
meter how many times you die

4406
01:24:08,689 --> 01:24:08,699
meter how many times you die
 

4407
01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:10,430

mean I I feel like there's a balance to

4412
01:24:15,110 --> 01:24:15,120
mean I I feel like there's a balance to
 

4413
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,610
mean I I feel like there's a balance to
be stuck there because you always want

4414
01:24:16,610 --> 01:24:16,620
be stuck there because you always want
 

4415
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:19,130
be stuck there because you always want
to be in fear of death again yeah we

4416
01:24:19,130 --> 01:24:19,140
to be in fear of death again yeah we
 

4417
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:20,570
to be in fear of death again yeah we
always we have this chart at work we use

4418
01:24:20,570 --> 01:24:20,580
always we have this chart at work we use
 

4419
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:22,310
always we have this chart at work we use
which is like if you think about any

4420
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:22,320
which is like if you think about any
 

4421
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,870
which is like if you think about any
game that you've played that you've put

4422
01:24:23,870 --> 01:24:23,880
game that you've played that you've put
 

4423
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,870
game that you've played that you've put
down it's either about a frustration

4424
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:26,880
down it's either about a frustration
 

4425
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,930
down it's either about a frustration
slash confusion or boredom

4426
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:29,940
slash confusion or boredom
 

4427
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:33,050
slash confusion or boredom
yeah you gotta put the player right in

4428
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:33,060
yeah you gotta put the player right in
 

4429
01:24:33,060 --> 01:24:35,090
yeah you gotta put the player right in
the middle of that but I've sometimes

4430
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:35,100
the middle of that but I've sometimes
 

4431
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,330
the middle of that but I've sometimes
put down games from frustration only to

4432
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:38,340
put down games from frustration only to
 

4433
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:43,330
put down games from frustration only to

01:24:45,890 --> 01:24:45,900
so I mean that that's I mean the
 

4437
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,209
so I mean that that's I mean the
challenge

4438
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:47,219
challenge
 

4439
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:49,550

and then
we're always overlapping so while we're

4522

we're always overlapping so while we're

01:27:15,780 --> 01:27:17,629
um we do music early
you know so take Elder Scrolls six we

4566
01:27:17,629 --> 01:27:17,639
you know so take Elder Scrolls six we
 

4567
01:27:17,639 --> 01:27:18,890
you know so take Elder Scrolls six we
figure out where it's set what's the

4568
01:27:18,890 --> 01:27:18,900
figure out where it's set what's the
 

4569
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:20,990
figure out where it's set what's the
tone what are the big features we

4570
01:27:20,990 --> 01:27:21,000
tone what are the big features we
 

4571
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:22,310
tone what are the big features we
discussed the beginning of the game

4572
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:22,320
discussed the beginning of the game
 

4573
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,810
discussed the beginning of the game
which we've had for a very long time

4574
01:27:23,810 --> 01:27:23,820
which we've had for a very long time
 

4575
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:30,770
which we've had for a very long time
where's this set again um yep and

4576
01:27:30,770 --> 01:27:30,780

 

4577
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:33,530

uh damn it well at least we know we

4578
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:33,540
uh damn it well at least we know we
 

4579
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,270
uh damn it well at least we know we
narrowed it down that yeah that would be

4580
01:27:35,270 --> 01:27:35,280
narrowed it down that yeah that would be
 

4581
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:37,550
narrowed it down that yeah that would be
epic if it was like a portal into

4582
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:37,560
epic if it was like a portal into
 

4583
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:40,310
epic if it was like a portal into
another dimension anyway I like to do

4584
01:27:40,310 --> 01:27:40,320
another dimension anyway I like to do
 

4585
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:44,030
another dimension anyway I like to do
music so we've already done a take on

4586
01:27:44,030 --> 01:27:44,040
music so we've already done a take on
 

4587
01:27:44,040 --> 01:27:47,149
music so we've already done a take on
the music uh for Elder Scrolls six so

4588
01:27:47,149 --> 01:27:47,159
the music uh for Elder Scrolls six so
 

4589
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:48,770
the music uh for Elder Scrolls six so
you can sit there with the like the the

4590
01:27:48,770 --> 01:27:48,780
you can sit there with the like the the
 

4591
01:27:48,780 --> 01:27:51,530
you can sit there with the like the the
concept art and the music no no the

4592
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:51,540
concept art and the music no no the
 

4593
01:27:51,540 --> 01:27:53,629
concept art and the music no no the
music we put in the teaser for it this

4594
01:27:53,629 --> 01:27:53,639
music we put in the teaser for it this
 

4595
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:56,390
music we put in the teaser for it this
was 2018.

4596
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:56,400
was 2018.
 

4597
01:27:56,400 --> 01:27:59,590
was 2018.
um we've taken that further obviously

4598
01:27:59,590 --> 01:27:59,600
um we've taken that further obviously
 

4599
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,430
um we've taken that further obviously
and

4600
01:28:01,430 --> 01:28:01,440
and
 

4601
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:03,590
and
again we're working on the world you're

4602
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:03,600
again we're working on the world you're
 

4603
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:05,750
again we're working on the world you're
then doing concepting and design for the

4604
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:05,760
then doing concepting and design for the
 

4605
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:08,030
then doing concepting and design for the
world and then once we we're wrapping up

4606
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:08,040
world and then once we we're wrapping up
 

4607
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:10,129
world and then once we we're wrapping up
one game we can really start prototyping

4608
01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:10,139
one game we can really start prototyping
 

4609
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:12,530
one game we can really start prototyping
the new one and you're usually building

4610
01:28:12,530 --> 01:28:12,540
the new one and you're usually building
 

4611
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:15,050
the new one and you're usually building
kind of your initial spaces and so we do

4612
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:15,060
kind of your initial spaces and so we do
 

4613
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,850
kind of your initial spaces and so we do
like to do like a first playable a

4614
01:28:16,850 --> 01:28:16,860
like to do like a first playable a
 

4615
01:28:16,860 --> 01:28:18,590
like to do like a first playable a
smaller section of the game

4616
01:28:18,590 --> 01:28:18,600
smaller section of the game
 

4617
01:28:18,600 --> 01:28:21,050
smaller section of the game
that we can sort of prove out and show

4618
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:21,060
that we can sort of prove out and show
 

4619
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,850
that we can sort of prove out and show
to people hey this is how it feels

4620
01:28:22,850 --> 01:28:22,860
to people hey this is how it feels
 

4621
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:23,870
to people hey this is how it feels
different this is what it looks like

4622
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:23,880
different this is what it looks like
 

4623
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,850
different this is what it looks like
this is what's unique about it then we

4624
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:25,860
this is what's unique about it then we
 

4625
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,709
this is what's unique about it then we
turn that into a larger chunk when more

4626
01:28:27,709 --> 01:28:27,719
turn that into a larger chunk when more
 

4627
01:28:27,719 --> 01:28:29,270
turn that into a larger chunk when more
of the team comes on when the other game

4628
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:29,280
of the team comes on when the other game
 

4629
01:28:29,280 --> 01:28:31,790
of the team comes on when the other game
is done

4630
01:28:31,790 --> 01:28:31,800

 

4631
01:28:31,800 --> 01:28:33,830

um and that's still what we call a vs

4632
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:33,840
um and that's still what we call a vs
 

4633
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,689
um and that's still what we call a vs
vertical slice so you still don't have

4634
01:28:35,689 --> 01:28:35,699
vertical slice so you still don't have
 

4635
01:28:35,699 --> 01:28:37,189
vertical slice so you still don't have
the full team on it

4636
01:28:37,189 --> 01:28:37,199
the full team on it
 

4637
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:40,010
the full team on it
and it's a larger chunk of the game that

4638
01:28:40,010 --> 01:28:40,020
and it's a larger chunk of the game that
 

4639
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,810
and it's a larger chunk of the game that
you can play and then once you feel good

4640
01:28:41,810 --> 01:28:41,820
you can play and then once you feel good
 

4641
01:28:41,820 --> 01:28:44,149
you can play and then once you feel good
about that you're going to bring on

4642
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:44,159
about that you're going to bring on
 

4643
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,129
about that you're going to bring on
the rest of the team

4644
01:28:46,129 --> 01:28:46,139
the rest of the team
 

4645
01:28:46,139 --> 01:28:47,810
the rest of the team
and we're fortunate that the other games

4646
01:28:47,810 --> 01:28:47,820
and we're fortunate that the other games
 

4647
01:28:47,820 --> 01:28:49,310
and we're fortunate that the other games
we've done are popular enough that we

4648
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:49,320
we've done are popular enough that we
 

4649
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:51,350
we've done are popular enough that we
can be doing DLC and content and those

4650
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,360
can be doing DLC and content and those
 

4651
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,669
can be doing DLC and content and those
kind of things while we're getting the

4652
01:28:52,669 --> 01:28:52,679
kind of things while we're getting the
 

4653
01:28:52,679 --> 01:28:54,290
kind of things while we're getting the
one going and then we're at full

4654
01:28:54,290 --> 01:28:54,300
one going and then we're at full
 

4655
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,310
one going and then we're at full
production

4656
01:28:55,310 --> 01:28:55,320
production
 

4657
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,310
production
where we're sort of at maximum size we

4658
01:28:58,310 --> 01:28:58,320
where we're sort of at maximum size we
 

4659
01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:00,110
where we're sort of at maximum size we
just call that production that's like

4660
01:29:00,110 --> 01:29:00,120
just call that production that's like
 

4661
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:01,990
just call that production that's like
the full production period

4662
01:29:01,990 --> 01:29:02,000
the full production period
 

4663
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,850
the full production period
and that depending on the game

4664
01:29:04,850 --> 01:29:04,860
and that depending on the game
 

4665
01:29:04,860 --> 01:29:08,390
and that depending on the game
you know can run a year two years maybe

4666
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:08,400
you know can run a year two years maybe
 

4667
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,010
you know can run a year two years maybe
more

4668
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:10,020
more
 

4669
01:29:10,020 --> 01:29:12,229
more
and then you kind of have a finalizing

4670
01:29:12,229 --> 01:29:12,239
and then you kind of have a finalizing
 

4671
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:15,229
and then you kind of have a finalizing
final six months to a year on a game

4672
01:29:15,229 --> 01:29:15,239
final six months to a year on a game
 

4673
01:29:15,239 --> 01:29:18,950
final six months to a year on a game
which is okay we've built everything now

4674
01:29:18,950 --> 01:29:18,960
which is okay we've built everything now
 

4675
01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:20,149
which is okay we've built everything now
um

4676
01:29:20,149 --> 01:29:20,159
um
 

4677
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,330
um
and usually it needs a lot of glue where

4678
01:29:23,330 --> 01:29:23,340
and usually it needs a lot of glue where
 

4679
01:29:23,340 --> 01:29:24,709
and usually it needs a lot of glue where
we have a lot of

4680
01:29:24,709 --> 01:29:24,719
we have a lot of
 

4681
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:26,870
we have a lot of
very different elements that maybe

4682
01:29:26,870 --> 01:29:26,880
very different elements that maybe
 

4683
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,310
very different elements that maybe
aren't clicking together the way you

4684
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
aren't clicking together the way you
 

4685
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,870
aren't clicking together the way you
want outside of the regular polish for

4686
01:29:29,870 --> 01:29:29,880
want outside of the regular polish for
 

4687
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:31,270
want outside of the regular polish for
levels and features

4688
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
levels and features
 

4689
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,770
levels and features
and we're shaving and gluing and

4690
01:29:33,770 --> 01:29:33,780
and we're shaving and gluing and
 

4691
01:29:33,780 --> 01:29:35,149
and we're shaving and gluing and
sticking things together so that it's

4692
01:29:35,149 --> 01:29:35,159
sticking things together so that it's
 

4693
01:29:35,159 --> 01:29:37,250
sticking things together so that it's
not the schizophrenic game experience

4694
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:37,260
not the schizophrenic game experience
 

4695
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,530
not the schizophrenic game experience
that things flow from one end to another

4696
01:29:39,530 --> 01:29:39,540
that things flow from one end to another
 

4697
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,169
that things flow from one end to another
in terms of story like on that level

4698
01:29:42,169 --> 01:29:42,179
in terms of story like on that level
 

4699
01:29:42,179 --> 01:29:44,209
in terms of story like on that level
it's really no usually the story The

4700
01:29:44,209 --> 01:29:44,219
it's really no usually the story The
 

4701
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:45,590
it's really no usually the story The
designers have done a really good job

4702
01:29:45,590 --> 01:29:45,600
designers have done a really good job
 

4703
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,530
designers have done a really good job
it's more about game features you know

4704
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:48,540
it's more about game features you know
 

4705
01:29:48,540 --> 01:29:50,149
it's more about game features you know
and then how they interact with the

4706
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:50,159
and then how they interact with the
 

4707
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:52,010
and then how they interact with the
story or hey I went from this experience

4708
01:29:52,010 --> 01:29:52,020
story or hey I went from this experience
 

4709
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:54,470
story or hey I went from this experience
to this experience or picking flowers

4710
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:54,480
to this experience or picking flowers
 

4711
01:29:54,480 --> 01:29:57,189
to this experience or picking flowers
and Alchemy feels like a different game

4712
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:57,199
and Alchemy feels like a different game
 

4713
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:00,110
and Alchemy feels like a different game
then and then how is another character

4714
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:00,120
then and then how is another character
 

4715
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,570
then and then how is another character
referencing that and how is that

4716
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:02,580
referencing that and how is that
 

4717
01:30:02,580 --> 01:30:04,729
referencing that and how is that
intersecting with

4718
01:30:04,729 --> 01:30:04,739
intersecting with
 

4719
01:30:04,739 --> 01:30:08,030
intersecting with
the skill system and the interface like

4720
01:30:08,030 --> 01:30:08,040
the skill system and the interface like
 

4721
01:30:08,040 --> 01:30:10,729
the skill system and the interface like

and the the
 

4743
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,629
and the the
rate at which the game is giving you

rate at which the game is giving you
 

4745
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:40,970
rate at which the game is giving you
activities then you're in like what we

4746
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:40,980
activities then you're in like what we
 

4747
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:43,850
activities then you're in like what we
we describe as a game Flow what is and

4748
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:43,860
we describe as a game Flow what is and
 

4749
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:46,430
we describe as a game Flow what is and
it's not until really that last year

4750
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:46,440
it's not until really that last year
 

4751
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:48,649
it's not until really that last year
before that the game Flow was just it's

4752
01:30:48,649 --> 01:30:48,659
before that the game Flow was just it's
 

4753
01:30:48,659 --> 01:30:51,290
before that the game Flow was just it's
not it doesn't even exist

4754
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:51,300
not it doesn't even exist
 

4755
01:30:51,300 --> 01:30:53,270
not it doesn't even exist
in the way that you see it in the final

4756
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:53,280
in the way that you see it in the final
 

4757
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:54,410
in the way that you see it in the final
game

4758
01:30:54,410 --> 01:30:54,420
game
 

4759
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:56,450
game
and that's what we're working on a lot

4760
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:56,460
and that's what we're working on a lot
 

4761
01:30:56,460 --> 01:30:58,490
and that's what we're working on a lot
that last year

4762
01:30:58,490 --> 01:30:58,500
that last year
 

4763
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,530
that last year
so at which point is like the set of

4764
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:00,540
so at which point is like the set of
 

4765
01:31:00,540 --> 01:31:02,330
so at which point is like the set of
skills a skill tree

4766
01:31:02,330 --> 01:31:02,340
skills a skill tree
 

4767
01:31:02,340 --> 01:31:04,610
skills a skill tree
the characteristics of the role-playing

4768
01:31:04,610 --> 01:31:04,620
the characteristics of the role-playing
 

4769
01:31:04,620 --> 01:31:07,010
the characteristics of the role-playing
aspect of it when is that set the idea

4770
01:31:07,010 --> 01:31:07,020
aspect of it when is that set the idea
 

4771
01:31:07,020 --> 01:31:08,570
aspect of it when is that set the idea
is we usually have it in the beginning

4772
01:31:08,570 --> 01:31:08,580
is we usually have it in the beginning
 

4773
01:31:08,580 --> 01:31:10,669
is we usually have it in the beginning
but it's just we know it won't be done

4774
01:31:10,669 --> 01:31:10,679
but it's just we know it won't be done
 

4775
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:13,370
but it's just we know it won't be done
until that last year we'll have one but

4776
01:31:13,370 --> 01:31:13,380
until that last year we'll have one but
 

4777
01:31:13,380 --> 01:31:15,229
until that last year we'll have one but
we know it's going to get honed

4778
01:31:15,229 --> 01:31:15,239
we know it's going to get honed
 

4779
01:31:15,239 --> 01:31:18,410
we know it's going to get honed
because it's not until you really see

4780
01:31:18,410 --> 01:31:18,420
because it's not until you really see
 

4781
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:20,870
because it's not until you really see
okay how impactful is that one how much

4782
01:31:20,870 --> 01:31:20,880
okay how impactful is that one how much
 

4783
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:22,669
okay how impactful is that one how much
are you doing it like how much are you

4784
01:31:22,669 --> 01:31:22,679
are you doing it like how much are you
 

4785
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:24,470
are you doing it like how much are you
really and the main combat ones they

4786
01:31:24,470 --> 01:31:24,480
really and the main combat ones they
 

4787
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,390
really and the main combat ones they
always win you always know the players

4788
01:31:26,390 --> 01:31:26,400
always win you always know the players
 

4789
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:28,910
always win you always know the players
will drift toward the combat type skills

4790
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:28,920
will drift toward the combat type skills
 

4791
01:31:28,920 --> 01:31:30,470
will drift toward the combat type skills
because every character needs some

4792
01:31:30,470 --> 01:31:30,480
because every character needs some
 

4793
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:32,990
because every character needs some
amount of that but okay well how how

4794
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:33,000
amount of that but okay well how how
 

4795
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,970
amount of that but okay well how how
important is cooking how important is

is these other type of activities and
 

4801
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:41,149
is these other type of activities and
then how do you balance them where when

4802
01:31:41,149 --> 01:31:41,159
then how do you balance them where when
 

4803
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:43,189
then how do you balance them where when
you load up the skill menu it isn't

4804
01:31:43,189 --> 01:31:43,199
you load up the skill menu it isn't
 

4805
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:47,290
you load up the skill menu it isn't
automatically give me plus 10 damage

Animation time

4842
01:32:26,030 --> 01:32:26,040
Animation time
 

4843
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:28,189
Animation time
right and changing animations so they're

4844
01:32:28,189 --> 01:32:28,199
right and changing animations so they're
 

4845
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:30,110
right and changing animations so they're
impactful and they they happen at a rate

4846
01:32:30,110 --> 01:32:30,120
impactful and they they happen at a rate
 

4847
01:32:30,120 --> 01:32:33,169
impactful and they they happen at a rate
that the player feels

4848
01:32:33,169 --> 01:32:33,179
that the player feels
 

4849
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:36,050
that the player feels
like they're really doing it and then

4850
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:36,060
like they're really doing it and then
 

4851
01:32:36,060 --> 01:32:39,110
like they're really doing it and then
ultimately it's the illusion that the

4852
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
ultimately it's the illusion that the
 

4853
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:41,149
ultimately it's the illusion that the
enemies are smart

4854
01:32:41,149 --> 01:32:41,159
enemies are smart
 

4855
01:32:41,159 --> 01:32:43,070
enemies are smart
but they really

4856
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:43,080
but they really
 

4857
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,430
but they really
are there for you to kill them right so

4858
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:46,440
are there for you to kill them right so
 

4859
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:50,209
are there for you to kill them right so
they do a lot of things to just let

4860
01:32:50,209 --> 01:32:50,219
they do a lot of things to just let
 

4861
01:32:50,219 --> 01:32:52,490
they do a lot of things to just let
themselves get killed they're not a near

4862
01:32:52,490 --> 01:32:52,500
themselves get killed they're not a near
 

4863
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:54,830
themselves get killed they're not a near
Smart near smart as we can make them

4864
01:32:54,830 --> 01:32:54,840
Smart near smart as we can make them
 

4865
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:57,050
Smart near smart as we can make them
because it turns out that is not fun

4866
01:32:57,050 --> 01:32:57,060
because it turns out that is not fun

foreign
so there's a balance between but there's

4870
01:33:00,590 --> 01:33:00,600
so there's a balance between but there's
 

4871
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,610
so there's a balance between but there's
a that is I guess a kind of AI

4872
01:33:04,610 --> 01:33:04,620
a that is I guess a kind of AI
 

4873
01:33:04,620 --> 01:33:06,530
a that is I guess a kind of AI
and

4874
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:06,540
and
 

4875
01:33:06,540 --> 01:33:08,750
and
it's a very intimate interaction with an

4876
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:08,760
it's a very intimate interaction with an
 

4877
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,729
it's a very intimate interaction with an

scenarios
 

4899
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,129
scenarios
um and there's some games that just do

4900
01:33:34,129 --> 01:33:34,139
um and there's some games that just do
 

4901
01:33:34,139 --> 01:33:36,709
um and there's some games that just do
it extremely well in terms of

is there a science to it is it is it art

4930
01:34:05,270 --> 01:34:05,280
is there a science to it is it is it art
 

4931
01:34:05,280 --> 01:34:06,709
is there a science to it is it is it art
is it like

4932
01:34:06,709 --> 01:34:06,719
is it like
 

4933
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:10,790

of that so it's like an iterative
 

4937
01:34:12,120 --> 01:34:13,629
of that so it's like an iterative
process where you try different things

4938
01:34:13,629 --> 01:34:13,639
process where you try different things
 

4939
01:34:13,639 --> 01:34:15,649
process where you try different things
there's a lot of there's a lot of

01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,930
generation if you go if you played it a
lot or you're developing it it starts to

5310
01:41:26,930 --> 01:41:26,940
lot or you're developing it it starts to
 

5311
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:28,430

feel really long
 

5313
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:31,430
feel really long
but the first time you play it or second

and this idea
 

5319
01:41:37,020 --> 01:41:39,590
and this idea
it's a hard thing to say okay we want we

5320
01:41:39,590 --> 01:41:39,600
it's a hard thing to say okay we want we

the screen even when you play like a

5324
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:44,040
the screen even when you play like a
 

5325
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:45,350
the screen even when you play like a
Skyrim you don't know what you were

5326
01:41:45,350 --> 01:41:45,360
Skyrim you don't know what you were
 

5327
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:48,410
Skyrim you don't know what you were
doing before that but Fallout 3

5328
01:41:48,410 --> 01:41:48,420
doing before that but Fallout 3
 

5329
01:41:48,420 --> 01:41:51,470
doing before that but Fallout 3
you you were born in the vault and you

5330
01:41:51,470 --> 01:41:51,480
you you were born in the vault and you
 

5331
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:52,850
you you were born in the vault and you
raised in the vault and you lived in the

5332
01:41:52,850 --> 01:41:52,860
raised in the vault and you lived in the
 

5333
01:41:52,860 --> 01:41:54,890
raised in the vault and you lived in the
vault but you experience a part of that

5334
01:41:54,890 --> 01:41:54,900
vault but you experience a part of that
 

5335
01:41:54,900 --> 01:41:57,410
vault but you experience a part of that
so it's a very different when you step

5336
01:41:57,410 --> 01:41:57,420
so it's a very different when you step
 

5337
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:01,189
so it's a very different when you step
out it I think it really

5338
01:42:01,189 --> 01:42:01,199
out it I think it really
 

5339
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:03,169
out it I think it really
and then the visuals are the visuals but

5340
01:42:03,169 --> 01:42:03,179
and then the visuals are the visuals but
 

5341
01:42:03,179 --> 01:42:05,149
and then the visuals are the visuals but
the emotional moment of stepping out of

5342
01:42:05,149 --> 01:42:05,159
the emotional moment of stepping out of
 

5343
01:42:05,159 --> 01:42:06,890
the emotional moment of stepping out of
the Vault you feel like you lived your

5344
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:06,900
the Vault you feel like you lived your
 

5345

01:43:26,699 --> 01:43:27,950
a lot of the meaningful experience of a
role-playing game is not just the

role-playing game is not just the
 

5419
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:29,629
role-playing game is not just the
development of the character throughout

5420
01:43:29,629 --> 01:43:29,639
development of the character throughout
 

5421
01:43:29,639 --> 01:43:31,370
development of the character throughout
the game but the initial character

5422
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:31,380
the game but the initial character
 

5423
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,590
the game but the initial character
creation like you said is there

5424
01:43:33,590 --> 01:43:33,600
creation like you said is there
 

5425
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:35,629
creation like you said is there
something to that process

5426
01:43:35,629 --> 01:43:35,639
something to that process
 

5427
01:43:35,639 --> 01:43:39,290
something to that process
that um you found to be powerful

5428

that um you found to be powerful
 

5429
01:43:39,300 --> 01:43:41,450
that um you found to be powerful
like the design of that process because

5430
01:43:41,450 --> 01:43:41,460
like the design of that process because
 

5431
01:43:41,460 --> 01:43:43,790
like the design of that process because
you think so much about that beginning

5432
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:43,800
you think so much about that beginning
 

5433
01:43:43,800 --> 01:43:46,609
you think so much about that beginning
what how much should be controlled

5434
01:43:46,609 --> 01:43:46,619
what how much should be controlled
 

5435
01:43:46,619 --> 01:43:48,830
what how much should be controlled
how much should be defined

5436
01:43:48,830 --> 01:43:48,840
how much should be defined
 

5437
01:43:48,840 --> 01:43:51,410
how much should be defined
the interface itself the visual

5438
01:43:51,410 --> 01:43:51,420
the interface itself the visual
 

5439
01:43:51,420 --> 01:43:53,689
the interface itself the visual
appearance of the character too because

5440
01:43:53,689 --> 01:43:53,699
appearance of the character too because
 

5441

01:44:04,250 --> 01:44:04,260
yeah we think about it a lot it's a
 

5451
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:06,590
yeah we think about it a lot it's a
really really good uh comment and

really really good uh comment and
 

5453
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:10,850
really really good uh comment and
question and it's more than

5454
01:44:10,850 --> 01:44:10,860
question and it's more than
 

5455
01:44:10,860 --> 01:44:12,890
question and it's more than
it has to set the whole stage has to

5456
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:12,900
it has to set the whole stage has to

like pique your interest for the world

5458
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:14,760
like pique your interest for the world
 

5459
01:44:14,760 --> 01:44:16,550
like pique your interest for the world
you're going to enter

5460
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:16,560
you're going to enter
 

5461
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,310
you're going to enter
and

5462
01:44:19,310 --> 01:44:19,320
and
 

5463
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:22,189
and
we've done it so many different ways

5464
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:22,199
we've done it so many different ways
 

5465
01:44:22,199 --> 01:44:25,430
we've done it so many different ways
in terms of when you actually go to make

5466
01:44:25,430 --> 01:44:25,440
in terms of when you actually go to make
 

5467
01:44:25,440 --> 01:44:28,010
in terms of when you actually go to make
your character when you're making the

5468
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:28,020
your character when you're making the
 

5469
01:44:28,020 --> 01:44:30,189
your character when you're making the
choice

5470
01:44:30,189 --> 01:44:30,199
choice
 

5471
01:44:30,199 --> 01:44:34,189
choice
and one of the things over time that

5472
01:44:34,189 --> 01:44:34,199
and one of the things over time that
 

5473
01:44:34,199 --> 01:44:37,910
and one of the things over time that
we've wanted to avoid is people starting

5474
01:44:37,910 --> 01:44:37,920
we've wanted to avoid is people starting
 

5475
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:39,649
we've wanted to avoid is people starting
over

5476
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:39,659
over
 

5477
01:44:39,659 --> 01:44:42,050
over
so there's a lot of intentionality

5478
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:42,060
so there's a lot of intentionality
 

5479
01:44:42,060 --> 01:44:44,990
so there's a lot of intentionality
around the types of choices you have

5480
01:44:44,990 --> 01:44:45,000
around the types of choices you have
 

5481
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:47,990
around the types of choices you have
that can be undone or not undone

5482
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:48,000
that can be undone or not undone
 

5483
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,149
that can be undone or not undone
because what you what game players want

5484
01:44:50,149 --> 01:44:50,159
because what you what game players want
 

5485
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:51,709
because what you what game players want
to is I'll play it and then I'll make a

5486
01:44:51,709 --> 01:44:51,719
to is I'll play it and then I'll make a
 

5487
01:44:51,719 --> 01:44:53,030
to is I'll play it and then I'll make a
new character

5488
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:53,040
new character
 

5489
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:55,490
new character
but sometimes they do that because they

5490
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:55,500
but sometimes they do that because they
 

5491
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,169
but sometimes they do that because they
realize they made the wrong type of

5492
01:44:57,169 --> 01:44:57,179
realize they made the wrong type of
 

5493
01:44:57,179 --> 01:44:58,129
realize they made the wrong type of
character

5494
01:44:58,129 --> 01:44:58,139
character
 

5495
01:44:58,139 --> 01:45:01,430
character
and as a designer you don't want that to

5496
01:45:01,430 --> 01:45:01,440
and as a designer you don't want that to
 

5497
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,350
and as a designer you don't want that to
happen

5498
01:45:03,350 --> 01:45:03,360
happen
 

5499
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:05,030
happen
so

5500
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:05,040
so
 

5501
01:45:05,040 --> 01:45:06,950
so
some people let me get this comment

5502
01:45:06,950 --> 01:45:06,960
some people let me get this comment

01:48:32,689 --> 01:48:32,699
uh
 

5681
01:48:32,699 --> 01:48:34,370
uh
you know some of them have very good

5685
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:39,770

5687
01:48:39,780 --> 01:48:43,370

task and then uh you'll go through a

5688
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:43,380
task and then uh you'll go through a
 

5689
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:46,129
task and then uh you'll go through a

more handcrafted experience that
 

5691

01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,930

01:48:58,550 --> 01:48:58,560
you know multiple options that the
 

5701
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:00,590

5707
01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,350

actually were

5708
01:49:06,350 --> 01:49:06,360
actually were
 

5709
01:49:06,360 --> 01:49:09,830
actually were
all of that was far more open-ended the

5710
01:49:09,830 --> 01:49:09,840
all of that was far more open-ended the
 

5711
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:14,390
all of that was far more open-ended the
how I am going to accomplish this task

5712
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:14,400

 

5713
01:49:14,400 --> 01:49:16,550

is

5714
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:16,560
is
 

5715
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:19,310
is
completely up to me and I'm gonna find

5716
01:49:19,310 --> 01:49:19,320
completely up to me and I'm gonna find
 

5717
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:22,910
completely up to me and I'm gonna find
some ingenious solution a silly that

01:49:22,910 --> 01:49:22,920
some ingenious solution a silly that
 

5719
01:49:22,920 --> 01:49:24,590

this was like this sounds very basic

5720
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:24,600
this was like this sounds very basic
 

5721
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:26,450
this was like this sounds very basic
it's going to sound quite cliche and

5722
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:26,460
it's going to sound quite cliche and
 

5723
01:49:26,460 --> 01:49:30,590
it's going to sound quite cliche and
silly go find me five danger cards or

5724
01:49:30,590 --> 01:49:30,600
silly go find me five danger cards or
 

5725
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,030
silly go find me five danger cards or
whatever like find me X of something

that's hard to get

5728
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:34,020
that's hard to get
 

5729
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:36,229
that's hard to get
that's a very simple set you can give a

5730
01:49:36,229 --> 01:49:36,239
that's a very simple set you can give a
 

5731
01:49:36,239 --> 01:49:38,510
that's a very simple set you can give a
simple story set up for that

5732
01:49:38,510 --> 01:49:38,520
simple story set up for that
 

5733
01:49:38,520 --> 01:49:40,250
simple story set up for that
and we're not telling the player where

5734
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:40,260
and we're not telling the player where
 

5735
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:41,810
and we're not telling the player where

I get those
 

5739
01:49:43,860 --> 01:49:46,490
I get those
and I've actually find those

5740
01:49:46,490 --> 01:49:46,500
and I've actually find those
 

5741
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:49,510

um as they say with even if you walk by

5790
01:50:48,229 --> 01:50:48,239
um as they say with even if you walk by
 

5791
01:50:48,239 --> 01:50:50,209
um as they say with even if you walk by
like a little T intersection that

like a little T intersection that
 

5793
01:50:50,219 --> 01:50:52,010
like a little T intersection that
becomes like a decision point in the

becomes like a decision point in the
 

5795
01:50:52,020 --> 01:50:53,330
becomes like a decision point in the
player's head like oh I didn't go down

5796
01:50:53,330 --> 01:50:53,340
player's head like oh I didn't go down
 

5797
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:55,550
player's head like oh I didn't go down
that way but the more you do that it

5798
01:50:55,550 --> 01:50:55,560
that way but the more you do that it
 

5799
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:57,109
that way but the more you do that it
looks easy on paper but when you're

01:50:58,380 --> 01:51:01,250
playing a game
you actually kind of want to limit those

01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:01,260
you actually kind of want to limit those
 

5805
01:51:01,260 --> 01:51:03,530
you actually kind of want to limit those

5807
01:51:03,540 --> 01:51:06,830
because he's trying to keep track of all
these decision points then they get lost

enough clutter and then we will over
 

5855
01:51:56,159 --> 01:51:58,310
enough clutter and then we will over
clutter and then there's too much stuff

5856

clutter and then there's too much stuff
 

5857
01:51:58,320 --> 01:52:00,709
clutter and then there's too much stuff
everywhere and then we declutter every

5858
01:52:00,709 --> 01:52:00,719
everywhere and then we declutter every
 

5859
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:02,689
everywhere and then we declutter every
single game I wish we got better at it

5860
01:52:02,689 --> 01:52:02,699
single game I wish we got better at it

um this Indiana Jones game that's being
 

7267
02:18:21,960 --> 02:18:23,450
um this Indiana Jones game that's being
developed at machine games we have to

7268
02:18:23,450 --> 02:18:23,460
developed at machine games we have to
 

7269
02:18:23,460 --> 02:18:24,589
developed at machine games we have to
look at that

7270
02:18:24,589 --> 02:18:24,599
look at that
 

7271
02:18:24,599 --> 02:18:28,490
look at that
um but you know the best really day or

um but you know the best really day or
 

7273
02:18:28,500 --> 02:18:33,230
um but you know the best really day or
before I feel is fulfilling is

7274
02:18:33,230 --> 02:18:33,240

 

7275
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:35,750

um get to play some of a game the game

7276
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:35,760
um get to play some of a game the game
 

7277
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:37,129
um get to play some of a game the game
will say star field get to play some of

7278
02:18:37,129 --> 02:18:37,139
will say star field get to play some of
 

7279
02:18:37,139 --> 02:18:40,490
will say star field get to play some of
Starfield look at the problem set of

7280
02:18:40,490 --> 02:18:40,500
Starfield look at the problem set of
 

7281
02:18:40,500 --> 02:18:42,290
Starfield look at the problem set of
what it is doing

7282
02:18:42,290 --> 02:18:42,300
what it is doing
 

7283
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:44,690
what it is doing
and then get in a room with

7284
02:18:44,690 --> 02:18:44,700
and then get in a room with
 

7285
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:47,030
and then get in a room with
the other developers that I work closely

7286
02:18:47,030 --> 02:18:47,040
the other developers that I work closely
 

7287
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,549
the other developers that I work closely
with and we solve that problem together

7288
02:18:49,549 --> 02:18:49,559
with and we solve that problem together
 

7289
02:18:49,559 --> 02:18:51,290
with and we solve that problem together
so

7290
02:18:51,290 --> 02:18:51,300
so
 

7291
02:18:51,300 --> 02:18:53,690
so
that's the most rewarding thing when you

7292
02:18:53,690 --> 02:18:53,700
that's the most rewarding thing when you
 

7293
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:55,429
that's the most rewarding thing when you
can say okay what do we want this to do

7294
02:18:55,429 --> 02:18:55,439
can say okay what do we want this to do
 

7295
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:57,410
can say okay what do we want this to do
what's the what's the Real Player

7296
02:18:57,410 --> 02:18:57,420
what's the what's the Real Player
 

7297
02:18:57,420 --> 02:18:59,389
what's the what's the Real Player
experience we want what are all the

7298
02:18:59,389 --> 02:18:59,399
experience we want what are all the
 

7299
02:18:59,399 --> 02:19:01,370
experience we want what are all the
pieces in front of us where you you know

7300
02:19:01,370 --> 02:19:01,380
pieces in front of us where you you know
 

7301
02:19:01,380 --> 02:19:03,349
pieces in front of us where you you know
the actual tangible pieces as opposed to

7302
02:19:03,349 --> 02:19:03,359
the actual tangible pieces as opposed to
 

7303
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:05,929
the actual tangible pieces as opposed to
the beginning the pie and the sky part

7304
02:19:05,929 --> 02:19:05,939
the beginning the pie and the sky part
 

7305
02:19:05,939 --> 02:19:08,030
the beginning the pie and the sky part
is always fun

7306
02:19:08,030 --> 02:19:08,040
is always fun
 

7307
02:19:08,040 --> 02:19:09,709
is always fun
but it's like anything is possible

7308
02:19:09,709 --> 02:19:09,719
but it's like anything is possible
 

7309
02:19:09,719 --> 02:19:12,310
but it's like anything is possible
that's fun but it's not

7310
02:19:12,310 --> 02:19:12,320
that's fun but it's not
 

7311
02:19:12,320 --> 02:19:14,450
that's fun but it's not
rewarding in the same way because you

7312
02:19:14,450 --> 02:19:14,460
rewarding in the same way because you
 

7313
02:19:14,460 --> 02:19:16,610
rewarding in the same way because you
haven't solved something whereas these

7314
02:19:16,610 --> 02:19:16,620
haven't solved something whereas these
 

7315
02:19:16,620 --> 02:19:18,770
haven't solved something whereas these
are the elements you have to play with

7316
02:19:18,770 --> 02:19:18,780
are the elements you have to play with
 

7317
02:19:18,780 --> 02:19:20,330
are the elements you have to play with
how do we make this all work together

7318
02:19:20,330 --> 02:19:20,340
how do we make this all work together
 

7319
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:22,129
how do we make this all work together
and you come out of at the end of the

7320
02:19:22,129 --> 02:19:22,139
and you come out of at the end of the
 

7321
02:19:22,139 --> 02:19:26,629
and you come out of at the end of the
day like now that feels great

7322
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:26,639

 

7323
02:19:26,639 --> 02:19:29,690

so brainstorming about specific big

7324
02:19:29,690 --> 02:19:29,700
so brainstorming about specific big
 

7325
02:19:29,700 --> 02:19:32,290
so brainstorming about specific big
picture both big picture and and very

7326
02:19:32,290 --> 02:19:32,300
picture both big picture and and very
 

7327
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:34,969
picture both big picture and and very
specific detail of a game that's not

7328
02:19:34,969 --> 02:19:34,979
specific detail of a game that's not
 

7329
02:19:34,979 --> 02:19:36,349
specific detail of a game that's not
working something's not working you want

7330
02:19:36,349 --> 02:19:36,359
working something's not working you want
 

7331
02:19:36,359 --> 02:19:37,969
working something's not working you want
to fix it that kind of stuff

7332
02:19:37,969 --> 02:19:37,979
to fix it that kind of stuff
 

7333
02:19:37,979 --> 02:19:40,009
to fix it that kind of stuff
because you feel like okay you've made

7334
02:19:40,009 --> 02:19:40,019
because you feel like okay you've made
 

7335
02:19:40,019 --> 02:19:42,290
because you feel like okay you've made
tangible progress on the actual build of

7336
02:19:42,290 --> 02:19:42,300
tangible progress on the actual build of
 

7337
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:44,089
tangible progress on the actual build of
the game it was something you played in

7338
02:19:44,089 --> 02:19:44,099
the game it was something you played in
 

7339
02:19:44,099 --> 02:19:45,349
the game it was something you played in
the beginning of the day didn't feel

7340
02:19:45,349 --> 02:19:45,359
the beginning of the day didn't feel
 

7341
02:19:45,359 --> 02:19:46,429
the beginning of the day didn't feel
great

7342
02:19:46,429 --> 02:19:46,439
great
 

7343
02:19:46,439 --> 02:19:48,710
great
you've figured out a solution with a

7344
02:19:48,710 --> 02:19:48,720
you've figured out a solution with a
 

7345
02:19:48,720 --> 02:19:50,510
you've figured out a solution with a
group of people like it's always with a

7346
02:19:50,510 --> 02:19:50,520
group of people like it's always with a
 

7347
02:19:50,520 --> 02:19:51,349
group of people like it's always with a
group

7348

group
 

7349
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:52,670
group
and then the next day you're like yeah

7350
02:19:52,670 --> 02:19:52,680
and then the next day you're like yeah
 

7351
02:19:52,680 --> 02:19:54,349
and then the next day you're like yeah
that was

7352
02:19:54,349 --> 02:19:54,359
that was
 

7353
02:19:54,359 --> 02:19:56,630
that was
that worked out who's on the team is it

7354
02:19:56,630 --> 02:19:56,640
that worked out who's on the team is it
 

7355
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:59,330
that worked out who's on the team is it

artists voice over so internal to the
 

7359
02:20:03,540 --> 02:20:04,969
artists voice over so internal to the
studio it's you know a lot of

7360
02:20:04,969 --> 02:20:04,979
studio it's you know a lot of
 

7361
02:20:04,979 --> 02:20:07,190
studio it's you know a lot of
programming a lot of art you have design

7362
02:20:07,190 --> 02:20:07,200
programming a lot of art you have design
 

7363
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,170
programming a lot of art you have design
which breaks into some you know Quest

7364
02:20:09,170 --> 02:20:09,180
which breaks into some you know Quest
 

7365
02:20:09,180 --> 02:20:11,750
which breaks into some you know Quest
design writing systems design who are

7366
02:20:11,750 --> 02:20:11,760
design writing systems design who are
 

7367
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:13,610
design writing systems design who are
like doing all the treasure and the loot

7368
02:20:13,610 --> 02:20:13,620
like doing all the treasure and the loot
 

7369
02:20:13,620 --> 02:20:15,770
like doing all the treasure and the loot
and the syst and the skill systems yeah

7370
02:20:15,770 --> 02:20:15,780
and the syst and the skill systems yeah
 

7371
02:20:15,780 --> 02:20:18,290
and the syst and the skill systems yeah
and then level design is making the

7372
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:18,300
and then level design is making the
 

7373
02:20:18,300 --> 02:20:19,550
and then level design is making the
spaces like those that you'll play

7374
02:20:19,550 --> 02:20:19,560
spaces like those that you'll play
 

7375
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:22,010
spaces like those that you'll play
through production is a big part of it

7376
02:20:22,010 --> 02:20:22,020
through production is a big part of it
 

7377
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:24,710
through production is a big part of it
the producers who organize everything

7378
02:20:24,710 --> 02:20:24,720
the producers who organize everything
 

7379
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:26,090
the producers who organize everything

let's go at it now it's a now it's a

7786
02:28:32,510 --> 02:28:32,520
let's go at it now it's a now it's a

but those kind of ups and downs for the
 

7791
02:28:36,060 --> 02:28:38,270
but those kind of ups and downs for the
length of developments that we have you

7792
02:28:38,270 --> 02:28:38,280
length of developments that we have you
 

7793
02:28:38,280 --> 02:28:40,250
length of developments that we have you
know people don't see them but we have

7794

know people don't see them but we have
them you know all the time
