pieces of the pie and taking others um
 

181
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,710
pieces of the pie and taking others um
i think that those people have to be

182
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:10,720
i think that those people have to be
 

183
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,949
i think that those people have to be
very opposed to any sort of thinking

that could restructure

186
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:16,840
that could restructure
 

187
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,149
that could restructure
society are conventions about who

society are conventions about who
 

189
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,149
society are conventions about who
should succeed and so firstly

should succeed and so firstly
 

191
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,070
should succeed and so firstly
i mean by that that it becomes much more

192
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,080
i mean by that that it becomes much more
 

193
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,789
i mean by that that it becomes much more
dangerous

194
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:28,799
dangerous
 

195
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,229
dangerous
dangerous for a person to think

196
00:03:32,229 --> 00:03:32,239
dangerous for a person to think
 

197
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,270
dangerous for a person to think
deeply and question during a time

deeply and question during a time
 

199
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,910

know one example of this would be

206
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:42,720
know one example of this would be
 

207
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,309
know one example of this would be
like socrates and his execution because

208
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:46,319
like socrates and his execution because
 

209
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,910
like socrates and his execution because
everyone was happy enough to sit through

210
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:47,920
everyone was happy enough to sit through
 

211
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,509
everyone was happy enough to sit through
his questions before

212
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:49,519
his questions before
 

213
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,430
his questions before
uh there was war and poverty and

214
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:51,440
uh there was war and poverty and
 

215
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,750
uh there was war and poverty and
distress and afterwards it just became

216
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:53,760
distress and afterwards it just became
 

217
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,910
distress and afterwards it just became
too dangerous the other thing i mean by

218
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:55,920
too dangerous the other thing i mean by
 

219
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,949
too dangerous the other thing i mean by
that is that

220
00:03:56,949 --> 00:03:56,959
that is that
 

221
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,350
that is that
the consequences of thinking deeply

222
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:01,360
the consequences of thinking deeply
 

223
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,750
the consequences of thinking deeply
carry much greater potential for real

224
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:03,760
carry much greater potential for real
 

225
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,030
carry much greater potential for real
catastrophe

226
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,040
catastrophe
 

227
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,390
catastrophe
when everyone is desperate so

228
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:08,400
when everyone is desperate so

like for example you know the communist

230
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:10,959
like for example you know the communist
 

231
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,869
like for example you know the communist
manifesto was probably much more

232
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:12,879
manifesto was probably much more
 

233
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,789
manifesto was probably much more
dangerous

234
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:14,799

i think people were in much worse shape

00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:24,240
i think people were in much worse shape
 

241
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,030
i think people were in much worse shape
and desperate people are very willing to

242
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,040
and desperate people are very willing to
 

243
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,070
and desperate people are very willing to
dive into anything

244
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:28,080
dive into anything
 

245
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,909

consequences or risks
 

251
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,390
consequences or risks
might be so it is both more dangerous

252
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:38,400
might be so it is both more dangerous
 

253
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,150
might be so it is both more dangerous
for a person to have

when when times are tough
 

261
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,070
when when times are tough
and by dangerous you mean it challenges

262
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,080
and by dangerous you mean it challenges
 

263
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,350

the people with power who don't who want

creativity all that kind of stuff right

272
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:02,240
creativity all that kind of stuff right
 

273
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,189
creativity all that kind of stuff right
and we know

274
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:03,199
and we know
 

275
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,390
and we know
that if nothing new is created people

276
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,400
that if nothing new is created people
 

277
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,790
that if nothing new is created people
have promises that they've made about

what will be paid to whom
 

281
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,350
what will be paid to whom
what debt structure is the only

282
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:15,360
what debt structure is the only
 

283
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,070
what debt structure is the only
possibility if stagnation lasts for

00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,080
possibility if stagnation lasts for
 

285
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,790
possibility if stagnation lasts for
long enough is really some kind of great

286
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:22,800
long enough is really some kind of great
 

287
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,670
long enough is really some kind of great
conflict

288
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:23,680
conflict
 

289
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,350

great war because people have to take

290
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
great war because people have to take
 

291
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,990
great war because people have to take
from others to make good on their own

from others to make good on their own
 

293
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,870
from others to make good on their own
promises so we know that by denying any

294
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:30,880
promises so we know that by denying any
 

295
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,230
promises so we know that by denying any
sort of

296
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:32,240
sort of
 

297
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,310
sort of
grand ideation we are accepting that

298
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,320
grand ideation we are accepting that
 

299
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,150
grand ideation we are accepting that
there will be some kind of great

catastrophe
 

303
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,230
catastrophe
and so we have to understand that

304
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:42,240
and so we have to understand that
 

305
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,110
and so we have to understand that
philosophy is

306
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,120
philosophy is
 

307
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,230
philosophy is
the most important uh

308
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:46,240
the most important uh
 

309
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,550
the most important uh
when we've seen too much stagnation for

310
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:48,560
when we've seen too much stagnation for
 

311
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,510
when we've seen too much stagnation for
too long

312
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:49,520
too long
 

313
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,110
too long
it is also very dangerous

314
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
it is also very dangerous
 

315
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,469
it is also very dangerous
and it's dangerous for the people who

316
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:54,479
and it's dangerous for the people who
 

317
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,150
and it's dangerous for the people who
are doing it and it's dangerous

318
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,160
are doing it and it's dangerous
 

319
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,230
are doing it and it's dangerous
for the people who believe it but it's

kind of our only way out

322
00:05:59,749 --> 00:05:59,759
kind of our only way out
 

323
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,870
kind of our only way out
ever and again by philosophy you mean

324
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:02,880
ever and again by philosophy you mean
 

325
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,550
ever and again by philosophy you mean
the bigger this is not academic

326
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:04,560
the bigger this is not academic
 

327
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,710

games played in the in the space of just
 

331
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,430
games played in the in the space of just
like moral philosophy and all those

332

metaphysics all that kind of stuff you
 

335
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,950
metaphysics all that kind of stuff you
mean just thinking deeply about this

336
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:14,960
mean just thinking deeply about this
 

337
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:15,510

first principles
 

349
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,790
first principles
so that's that's fundamentally what uh

350
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:26,800
so that's that's fundamentally what uh

and that's
 

355
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,309
and that's
where the people who are thinking deeply

356
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:32,319
where the people who are thinking deeply
 

357
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,189
where the people who are thinking deeply
about this world are the ones who are

about this world are the ones who are
feeding who are the catalysts of this

360
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:37,199

growth in society and so on

362
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:39,199
growth in society and so on
 

363
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,990
growth in society and so on
yeah i i mean i also think that the real

00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:42,000
yeah i i mean i also think that the real
 

365
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,950
yeah i i mean i also think that the real
implication

366
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:42,960
implication
 

367
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,790
implication
of moral philosophy

368
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:46,800
of moral philosophy
 

369
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,870
of moral philosophy
can be something that most would

370
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:48,880
can be something that most would
 

371
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,189
can be something that most would
consider like a real political

consider like a real political
 

373
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,670
consider like a real political
uh implication so i think all philosophy

374
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:53,680
uh implication so i think all philosophy
 

375
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,390
uh implication so i think all philosophy
really

some sort of
 

381
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,790
some sort of
grand structure to all thought and how

382
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:00,800
grand structure to all thought and how
 

383
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,589
grand structure to all thought and how
it relates

384
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:01,599
it relates
 

385
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,189
it relates

386
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:05,199
do you think this growth
 

387
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,550
do you think this growth
and innovation and improvement can last

388
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:08,560
and innovation and improvement can last
 

389

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,469
i think the only way that we can keep
growing this way is if we give

growing this way is if we give

growing this way is if we give
power to real thinkers and there's no

power to real thinkers and there's no
guarantee that that will work but we

448
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:11,280
guarantee that that will work but we
 

449
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,790
guarantee that that will work but we
sort of don't have

450
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:12,800
sort of don't have
 

451
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,390
sort of don't have
any other choice and i think you're

452
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:14,400
any other choice and i think you're
 

453
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,390
any other choice and i think you're
entirely right that this

454
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:16,400
entirely right that this
 

455
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,350

we've never seen anything
 

477
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,670
we've never seen anything
like this and i think a lot of our

479
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,269

a lot of our promises rest on

a lot of our promises rest on
 

481
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,910
a lot of our promises rest on
this sort of thing continuing i think

482

this sort of thing continuing i think
 

483
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,550
this sort of thing continuing i think
that's very

484

that's very dangerous but the one thing

that's very dangerous but the one thing
 

487
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,550
that's very dangerous but the one thing
that can get us out of this is

488
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:56,560
that can get us out of this is
 

489
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,470
that can get us out of this is

happens to be in the room
 

517
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,550
happens to be in the room
but uh the mics can't pick him up so he

518
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:28,560
but uh the mics can't pick him up so he
 

519
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,990
but uh the mics can't pick him up so he
can uh heckle it doesn't even matter

520
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:32,000
can uh heckle it doesn't even matter
 

521
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,509
can uh heckle it doesn't even matter
but do you have disagreements with him

522
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:33,519
but do you have disagreements with him
 

523
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,430
but do you have disagreements with him
on this point let me

524
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:35,440
on this point let me
 

525
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,230
on this point let me
um try to summarize this argument that

526
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:38,240
um try to summarize this argument that
 

527
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,509
um try to summarize this argument that
we were actually

528
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:39,519
we were actually
 

529
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,790
we were actually
based a lot of our american society

530
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:42,800
based a lot of our american society
 

531
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,230
based a lot of our american society
on the belief that things will keep

532
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:44,240
on the belief that things will keep
 

533
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,829
on the belief that things will keep
growing and yet

534
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:47,839
growing and yet
 

535
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,470
growing and yet
it seems that however you break it apart

536
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,480
it seems that however you break it apart
 

537
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,710
it seems that however you break it apart
maybe from an economics perspective

538
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:52,720
maybe from an economics perspective
 

539
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,110
maybe from an economics perspective
that they're not growing currently and

540
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:55,120
that they're not growing currently and
 

541
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,630
that they're not growing currently and
so that's where a lot of our troubles

542
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:56,640
so that's where a lot of our troubles
 

543
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,030
so that's where a lot of our troubles
are

544
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,040
are
 

545
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,870
are
at do you have the same sense that

546
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:58,880
at do you have the same sense that
 

547
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,710
at do you have the same sense that
things there's a stagnation period

548
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:00,720
things there's a stagnation period
 

549
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,310
things there's a stagnation period
that we're living through over the past

550
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,320
that we're living through over the past
 

551
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,230
that we're living through over the past
couple of decades i think

552
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,240
couple of decades i think
 

553
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,630
couple of decades i think
stagnation modern stagnation is

554
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:06,640
stagnation modern stagnation is
 

555
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,829
stagnation modern stagnation is
completely

556
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:07,839
completely
 

557
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,030
completely
undeniable particularly scientifically

558
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,040
undeniable particularly scientifically
 

559
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,110
undeniable particularly scientifically
and i think there have been a few fields

560
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:13,120
and i think there have been a few fields
 

561
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,949
and i think there have been a few fields
where tremendous

562
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:14,959
where tremendous
 

563
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,069
where tremendous
progress has been made very recently i

564
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:18,079
progress has been made very recently i
 

565
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,750
progress has been made very recently i
think

566
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:19,760
think
 

567
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,230
think
my dad might feel that uh

568
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:24,240
my dad might feel that uh
 

569
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,430
my dad might feel that uh
there is sort of an inevitability to

570
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,440
there is sort of an inevitability to
 

571
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,550
there is sort of an inevitability to
the ending of this period and

572
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,560
the ending of this period and
 

573
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,190
the ending of this period and
i'm not so certain so certain that uh

574
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:35,200
i'm not so certain so certain that uh
 

575
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,949
i'm not so certain so certain that uh
the fall of this great time is

576
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:36,959
the fall of this great time is
 

577
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,110
the fall of this great time is
completely inevitable because i don't

578
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,120
completely inevitable because i don't
 

579
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,670
completely inevitable because i don't
know

580
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:39,680
know
 

581
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,389
know
what thoughts we're capable of producing

582
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
what thoughts we're capable of producing
 

583
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,030
what thoughts we're capable of producing
what we're

584
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:43,040
what we're
 

585
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,750
what we're
able to reconsider i think we really

586
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:45,760
able to reconsider i think we really
 

587
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,829
able to reconsider i think we really
have to be open to the

588
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:47,839
have to be open to the
 

589
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,150
have to be open to the
possibility that uh all of our standard

590
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,160
possibility that uh all of our standard
 

591
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,310
possibility that uh all of our standard
frameworks where you know like he will

592
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,320
frameworks where you know like he will
 

593
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,829
frameworks where you know like he will
talk about

594
00:10:55,829 --> 00:10:55,839
talk about
 

595
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,750
talk about
embedded growth obligations if we

596
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:57,760
embedded growth obligations if we
 

597
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,430
embedded growth obligations if we
continue within the same

598
00:10:59,430 --> 00:10:59,440
continue within the same
 

599
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,509
continue within the same
framework then we're very susceptible to

600
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:01,519
framework then we're very susceptible to
 

601
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,949
framework then we're very susceptible to
the dangers of whatever these

602
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:02,959
the dangers of whatever these
 

603
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:05,430
the dangers of whatever these
embedded growth obligations are i think

604
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:05,440
embedded growth obligations are i think
 

605
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,269
embedded growth obligations are i think
if we break the frameworks we have no

606
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:07,279
if we break the frameworks we have no
 

607
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,870
if we break the frameworks we have no
reason to believe that the problems

608
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:08,880
reason to believe that the problems
 

609
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,069
reason to believe that the problems
we're experiencing

610
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:10,079
we're experiencing
 

611
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,069
we're experiencing
with our current frameworks will will

612
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:12,079
with our current frameworks will will
 

613
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,910
with our current frameworks will will
follow us and i think that's the

614
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:13,920
follow us and i think that's the
 

615
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,069
follow us and i think that's the
importance of radical thought is

616
00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:16,079
importance of radical thought is
 

617
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,910
importance of radical thought is
we don't know what the solution is but

618
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:17,920
we don't know what the solution is but
 

619
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,829
we don't know what the solution is but
if there is a solution it will be born

620
00:11:19,829 --> 00:11:19,839
if there is a solution it will be born
 

621
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,829
if there is a solution it will be born
from some very fundamental

622
00:11:21,829 --> 00:11:21,839
from some very fundamental
 

623
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,550
from some very fundamental
thinking and so i've i have great hope

624
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:24,560
thinking and so i've i have great hope
 

625
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,509
thinking and so i've i have great hope
so you have

626
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:25,519
so you have
 

627
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,750
so you have
optimism about sort of the power of a

628
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:27,760
optimism about sort of the power of a
 

629
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,069
optimism about sort of the power of a
single radical idea or a single radical

630
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:30,079
single radical idea or a single radical
 

631
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,030
single radical idea or a single radical
thinker

632
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:31,040
thinker
 

633
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,389
thinker
to break our frameworks and

634
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
to break our frameworks and
 

635
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,990
to break our frameworks and
uh break us out of this like uh spiral

636
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:38,000
uh break us out of this like uh spiral
 

637
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,870
uh break us out of this like uh spiral
down

638
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
down
 

639
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,509
down
due to whatever the the economic forces

640
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:41,519
due to whatever the the economic forces
 

641
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,230
due to whatever the the economic forces
that are

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:42,240
that are
 

643
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,590
that are
creating uh this current stagnation yeah

644
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:45,600
creating uh this current stagnation yeah
 

645
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,470
creating uh this current stagnation yeah
i'm very very hopeful the optimism of

646
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:48,480
i'm very very hopeful the optimism of
 

647
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:48,790
i'm very very hopeful the optimism of
youth

thoughts
 

661
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,069
thoughts
you could just tell how deeply you think

662
00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:04,079
you could just tell how deeply you think
 

663

i think that the internet can be very
 

703
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,670
i think that the internet can be very
intolerant of inconsistency and

704
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:45,680
intolerant of inconsistency and
 

705
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,470
intolerant of inconsistency and
i am entirely prepared to be very

i am entirely prepared to be very
 

707
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,829
i am entirely prepared to be very
inconsistent because

708
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:49,839
inconsistent because
 

709
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,230
inconsistent because
i know that whatever beliefs i have

710
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:54,240
i know that whatever beliefs i have
 

711

i know that whatever beliefs i have
when subjected to scrutiny may change

when subjected to scrutiny may change
 

713
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,750
when subjected to scrutiny may change
because

714
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:57,760
because
 

715
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,389
because
that's that's really the only way to to

716
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:00,399
that's that's really the only way to to
 

717
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,150
that's that's really the only way to to
form your truest

718
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:02,160
form your truest
 

719
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,190
form your truest
most fundamental conceptions about the

720
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,200
most fundamental conceptions about the
 

721
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,629
most fundamental conceptions about the
world around you

722
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:06,639
world around you
 

723
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,949
world around you
and it would take an infinite amount of

00:13:08,949 --> 00:13:08,959
and it would take an infinite amount of
 

725
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,509
and it would take an infinite amount of
time to subject every single one of your

00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:11,519
time to subject every single one of your
 

727
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,310
time to subject every single one of your
beliefs to scrutiny and so that's a a

728
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:14,320
beliefs to scrutiny and so that's a a
 

729
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,190
beliefs to scrutiny and so that's a a
process that

the thinkers i think it's crucial
that my generation uh

850
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:31,279
that my generation uh
 

851
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,870
that my generation uh
take up a hand in this fight and i think

852
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:34,880
take up a hand in this fight and i think
 

853
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,470
take up a hand in this fight and i think
it's important that i'm

854
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:36,480
it's important that i'm
 

855
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,550
it's important that i'm
a part of that because i know that i

856
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
a part of that because i know that i
 

857
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,310
a part of that because i know that i
have some opportunity

858
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:40,320
have some opportunity
 

859
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,310
have some opportunity
to um

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:44,320

 

861
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,590

there is i think it is my obligation as

there is i think it is my obligation as
 

863
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,710

00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:51,680
generation whose only real hope is to
 

867
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,189
generation whose only real hope is to
think outside of a system

868
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:53,199
think outside of a system
 

869
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:56,310
think outside of a system
because whatever systems exist are

870
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:56,320
because whatever systems exist are
 

871
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,710
because whatever systems exist are

are you uh as a young mind do you have a
sense of fear

882
00:16:10,949 --> 00:16:10,959
sense of fear
 

883
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,749
sense of fear
about just like how afraid were you to

884
00:16:13,749 --> 00:16:13,759
about just like how afraid were you to
 

885
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,310

do this
 

887
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,990
do this
podcast conversation do you have a sense

888
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:16,000
podcast conversation do you have a sense
 

889
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,350
podcast conversation do you have a sense
of fear of thinking publicly

890
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:19,360
of fear of thinking publicly
 

891
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,670
of fear of thinking publicly
yeah i i don't even think that that fear

892
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:21,680
yeah i i don't even think that that fear
 

893
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,269
yeah i i don't even think that that fear
is irrational

894
00:16:23,269 --> 00:16:23,279
is irrational
 

895
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,470
is irrational
it's very difficult to exist publicly in

896
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:26,480
it's very difficult to exist publicly in
 

897
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,550
it's very difficult to exist publicly in
any form

898
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:28,560
any form
 

899
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,910
any form
now because it's very easy for anyone to

900
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
now because it's very easy for anyone to
 

901
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:32,470
now because it's very easy for anyone to
take

902
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:32,480
take
 

903
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,110
take
cheap shots at something which is

904
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,120
cheap shots at something which is
 

905
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,230
cheap shots at something which is
difficult

906
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:36,240
difficult
 

907
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,030
difficult
and as i said the people who are

908
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,040
and as i said the people who are
 

909
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,350
and as i said the people who are
trying to have the difficult ideas and

910
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:43,360
trying to have the difficult ideas and
 

911
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,110
trying to have the difficult ideas and
conversations

912
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:45,120
conversations
 

913
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,030
conversations
are perhaps putting others in in actual

914
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,040
are perhaps putting others in in actual
 

915
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,350
are perhaps putting others in in actual
danger because everyone is so desperate

916
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:51,360
danger because everyone is so desperate
 

917
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,310
danger because everyone is so desperate
that they're they're

918
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:52,320
that they're they're
 

919
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,150
that they're they're
they might be they might be willing to

920
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160
they might be they might be willing to
 

921
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,350
they might be they might be willing to
to try anything

922
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:55,360
to try anything
 

923
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,949
to try anything
so um there's a certain amount of

924
00:16:57,949 --> 00:16:57,959
so um there's a certain amount of
 

925
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,670
so um there's a certain amount of
responsibility which

926
00:16:59,670 --> 00:16:59,680
responsibility which
 

927
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,350
responsibility which
one has to take going before the public

928
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:03,360
one has to take going before the public
 

929
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,870
one has to take going before the public
and there is a certain amount of uh

930
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:06,880
and there is a certain amount of uh
 

931
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,669
and there is a certain amount of uh
ridicule which will be completely

932
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:09,679
ridicule which will be completely
 

933
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,189
ridicule which will be completely
unwarranted that

934
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:11,199
unwarranted that
 

935
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,470
unwarranted that
anyone must endure for it

936
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,480
anyone must endure for it
 

937
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,789
anyone must endure for it
um and i think that it means that the

938
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:18,799
um and i think that it means that the
 

939
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,630
um and i think that it means that the
one has to be afraid because they could

940
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:20,640
one has to be afraid because they could
 

941
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,110
one has to be afraid because they could
both

942
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:21,120
both
 

943
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,949
both
ruin the world and be ruined by the

944
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:22,959
ruin the world and be ruined by the
 

945
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,710
ruin the world and be ruined by the
world in in

946
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:24,720
world in in
 

947
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,470
world in in
an unwarranted and undeserved fashion

948
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:28,480
an unwarranted and undeserved fashion
 

949
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,990
an unwarranted and undeserved fashion
um i would like

950
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,000
um i would like
 

951
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,630
um i would like
to believe in myself enough to try to

952
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:34,640
to believe in myself enough to try to
 

953
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,909
to believe in myself enough to try to
accept this as a task

954
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:35,919
accept this as a task
 

955
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,750
accept this as a task
because i think people need to try or

956
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:39,760
because i think people need to try or
 

957
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,350
because i think people need to try or
there's no getting out of this and

958
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:41,360
there's no getting out of this and
 

959
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,350
there's no getting out of this and
we will end in some kind of crazy

960
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:43,360
we will end in some kind of crazy
 

961
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,630
we will end in some kind of crazy
brilliant war

962
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:44,640
brilliant war
 

963
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,950
brilliant war
awfully put you've said also that uh in

964
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:46,960
awfully put you've said also that uh in
 

965
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,710
awfully put you've said also that uh in
these times we can't have labels because

966
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:48,720
these times we can't have labels because
 

967
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,590
these times we can't have labels because
it holds us

968
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:49,600
it holds us
 

969
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,470
it holds us
holds us back maybe we've already talked

970
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:52,480
holds us back maybe we've already talked
 

971
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,430
holds us back maybe we've already talked
about a little bit

972
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:53,440
about a little bit
 

973
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,430
about a little bit
but this idea of labels is really

974
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:55,440
but this idea of labels is really
 

975
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,430
but this idea of labels is really
interesting uh why do you think

976
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:57,440
interesting uh why do you think
 

977
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,470
interesting uh why do you think
labels hold us back well

978
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
labels hold us back well
 

979
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,150
labels hold us back well
i think many underestimate the extent to

980
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:04,160
i think many underestimate the extent to
 

981
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,029
i think many underestimate the extent to
which

982
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:05,039
which
 

983
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,230
which
language and communication

984
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:08,240
language and communication
 

985
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,909
language and communication
really impacts and shapes the ideas

986
00:18:11,909 --> 00:18:11,919
really impacts and shapes the ideas
 

987
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,430
really impacts and shapes the ideas
and thoughts which are being

988
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:13,440
and thoughts which are being
 

989
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,310
and thoughts which are being
communicated and i think

990
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:16,320
communicated and i think
 

991
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,830
communicated and i think
if we're willing to accept uh imperfect

992
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:19,840
if we're willing to accept uh imperfect
 

993
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,110
if we're willing to accept uh imperfect
labels

994
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
labels
 

995
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,990
labels
uh to categorize particular people or

996
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
uh to categorize particular people or
 

997
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,870
uh to categorize particular people or
thoughts

998
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:24,880
thoughts
 

999
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,990
thoughts
in some sense we are corrupting

1000
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:28,000
in some sense we are corrupting
 

1001
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,710
in some sense we are corrupting
an abstraction in order to represent it

1002
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:30,720
an abstraction in order to represent it
 

1003
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,230
an abstraction in order to represent it
and communicate about it

1004
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:32,240
and communicate about it
 

1005
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,510
and communicate about it
and i think as we've discussed those

1006
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:35,520
and i think as we've discussed those
 

1007
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,750
and i think as we've discussed those
abstractions are particularly

1008
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:37,760
abstractions are particularly
 

1009
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,830
abstractions are particularly
important when everything is on fire um

1010
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:43,840
important when everything is on fire um
 

1011
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,590
important when everything is on fire um
we should not be sacrificing

1012
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:47,600
we should not be sacrificing
 

1013
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,830
we should not be sacrificing
uh grand thought for the ability to

1014
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:51,840
uh grand thought for the ability to
 

1015
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,830
uh grand thought for the ability to
express it i think everyone should work

1016
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:55,840
express it i think everyone should work
 

1017
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,909
express it i think everyone should work
much harder including myself to really

1018
00:18:57,909 --> 00:18:57,919
much harder including myself to really
 

1019
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,750
much harder including myself to really
be thinking abstractly in

1020
00:18:59,750 --> 00:18:59,760
be thinking abstractly in
 

1021
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,470
be thinking abstractly in
abstract terms instead of using concrete

1022
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:02,480
abstract terms instead of using concrete
 

1023
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,070
abstract terms instead of using concrete
terms to

1024
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,080
terms to
 

1025
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,390
terms to
discuss abstraction while ruining it

1026
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:06,400
discuss abstraction while ruining it
 

1027
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,590
discuss abstraction while ruining it
slightly

1028
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:07,600
slightly
 

1029
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,750
slightly
yeah it's uh it's kind of a skill

1030
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:09,760
yeah it's uh it's kind of a skill
 

1031
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,029
yeah it's uh it's kind of a skill
actually so one

1032
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:11,039
actually so one
 

1033
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,470
actually so one
one really difficult example

1034
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:14,480
one really difficult example
 

1035
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,590
one really difficult example
of in this uh in the recent time that

1036
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:17,600
of in this uh in the recent time that
 

1037

of in this uh in the recent time that
maybe you can comment on

1038
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:19,039
maybe you can comment on
 

1039
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,669

it takes a lot of skill to be able to
 

1049

set of conversations i'm sure there's
 

1111
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,149
set of conversations i'm sure there's
other dangerous labels that could be

other dangerous labels that could be
 

1113

avoiding that right now
 

1119
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,070
avoiding that right now
it might not be anyone's best effort to

1120
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:46,080
it might not be anyone's best effort to
 

1121

it might not be anyone's best effort to
really try i think the thing i can say

most speak to that which i truly believe
is that participating

find terrible outlets if new spectrums
 

1195
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,590

00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,549
helpful thing to do and i think
it's it's very easy for anyone with

1351
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,390
uh ideas about how everything is is
broken to become

00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
broken to become
 

1353
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,549

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,389
everything that uh
that went on around him and i think he

1500
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:14,399
that went on around him and i think he
 

1501
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,310
that went on around him and i think he
never really

1502
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
never really
 

1503
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,789
never really
recovered from it i think that's because

1504
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:20,799
recovered from it i think that's because
 

1505
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,830
recovered from it i think that's because
if you think about nietzsche's

1506
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:23,840
if you think about nietzsche's
 

1507
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,710
if you think about nietzsche's
philosophy he was very opposed to any

sort of
 

1511
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,070
sort of
acceptance of what one had one should

acceptance of what one had one should
 

1513
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,070
acceptance of what one had one should
always envy those who have more

00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:35,520
and use that envy to uh to fuel their

and use that envy to uh to fuel their
their growth and become you know

the thing which you pride yourself most
 

1537
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:04,710
the thing which you pride yourself most
on

on
 

1539
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,470
on
is uh never being satisfied and i think

1540
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:08,480
is uh never being satisfied and i think
 

1541
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,070
is uh never being satisfied and i think
nietzsche was never satisfied and that

1542
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,080
nietzsche was never satisfied and that
 

1543
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,710
nietzsche was never satisfied and that
was the

1544
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
was the
 

1545
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,110
was the
the danger of his philosophy i think

1546
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:13,120
the danger of his philosophy i think
 

1547
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,549
the danger of his philosophy i think
also with his

1548
00:29:14,549 --> 00:29:14,559
also with his
 

1549
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,190
also with his
immoralism you know there is no good or

1550
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:17,200
immoralism you know there is no good or
 

1551
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,549
immoralism you know there is no good or
evil

1552
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:18,559
evil
 

1553
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,110
evil
i sort of disagree with that on a pretty

1554
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:21,120
i sort of disagree with that on a pretty
 

1555
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,549
i sort of disagree with that on a pretty
fundamental

1556
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:22,559
fundamental
 

1557
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,070
fundamental
basis i think that um

1558
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:26,080
basis i think that um
 

1559
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,669
basis i think that um
our notion of morality is by no means

1560
00:29:29,669 --> 00:29:29,679
our notion of morality is by no means
 

1561
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,110
our notion of morality is by no means
subjective it's really the proxy for

1562
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:33,120
subjective it's really the proxy for
 

1563
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,190
subjective it's really the proxy for
the fitness of a society i think

1564
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:37,200
the fitness of a society i think
 

1565
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,230
the fitness of a society i think
whatever we consider ethical like don't

1566
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:40,240
whatever we consider ethical like don't
 

1567
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,789
whatever we consider ethical like don't
steal

1568
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:40,799
steal
 

1569
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,950
steal
don't murder don't do this

1570
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:44,960

 

1571
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,269

societies have a very difficult time

1572
00:29:47,269 --> 00:29:47,279
societies have a very difficult time
 

1573
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,549
societies have a very difficult time
running it's very hard to run a

1574
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:48,559
running it's very hard to run a
 

1575
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,990
running it's very hard to run a
civilization when

1576
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:50,000
civilization when
 

1577
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,230
civilization when
everyone is stealing from everyone else

1578
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:52,240
everyone is stealing from everyone else
 

1579
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,430
everyone is stealing from everyone else
and people are

1580
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:53,440
and people are
 

1581
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,630
and people are
murdering each other and committing

1582
00:29:56,630 --> 00:29:56,640
murdering each other and committing
 

1583
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,230
murdering each other and committing
these things which

1584
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:58,240
these things which
 

1585
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,510
these things which
we would consider uh atrocities so

1586
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:01,520
we would consider uh atrocities so
 

1587
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,710
we would consider uh atrocities so
i think we also we know this because

1588
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:04,720
i think we also we know this because
 

1589
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,669
i think we also we know this because
i think very similar notions of morality

1590
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:07,679
i think very similar notions of morality
 

1591
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,070
i think very similar notions of morality
have

1592
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,080

 

1593
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,549

evolved convergently from different

1594
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:12,559
evolved convergently from different
 

1595
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:16,630
evolved convergently from different
traditions i think

1596
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:16,640

 

1597
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,789

good is a proxy for a

1598
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:19,799
good is a proxy for a
 

1599
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:23,269
good is a proxy for a
civilization's fitness and

1600
00:30:23,269 --> 00:30:23,279
civilization's fitness and
 

1601
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,470
civilization's fitness and
the good news is that that means that

1602
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:26,480
the good news is that that means that
 

1603
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:30,789
the good news is that that means that
evil in being anathema to that good

1604
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:30,799
evil in being anathema to that good
 

1605
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,070
evil in being anathema to that good
uh must therefore be uh

1606
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:34,080
uh must therefore be uh
 

1607
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,750
uh must therefore be uh
the opposite of stable in whatever way

1608
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:37,760
the opposite of stable in whatever way
 

1609
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,950
the opposite of stable in whatever way
that it's evil

1610
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:38,960
that it's evil
 

1611
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,950
that it's evil
and that means that good will always be

1612
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:40,960
and that means that good will always be
 

1613
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,470
and that means that good will always be
more stable than

1614
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:42,480
more stable than
 

1615
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,269
more stable than
evil and the only way evil can really

1616
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:45,279
evil and the only way evil can really
 

1617
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,430
evil and the only way evil can really
win is like if everyone dies

1618
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:47,440
win is like if everyone dies
 

1619
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,789
win is like if everyone dies
so um so wait uh can you say can you say

1620
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:50,799
so um so wait uh can you say can you say
 

1621
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,269
so um so wait uh can you say can you say
that again good is a proxy for society's

1622
00:30:53,269 --> 00:30:53,279
that again good is a proxy for society's
 

1623
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:53,669
that again good is a proxy for society's
uh

1624
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
uh
 

1625
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,470
uh
what good is a proxy for the stability

1626
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:56,480
what good is a proxy for the stability
 

1627
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,230
what good is a proxy for the stability
and fitness of the civilization i

1628
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:58,240
and fitness of the civilization i
 

1629
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,110
and fitness of the civilization i
believe

1630

believe
and you know that's a good definition

1632
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:00,880
and you know that's a good definition
 

1633
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,470

flow there but just a good damn good one

1642
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:12,720

thank you
uh so in that sense that's kind of

1646
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:17,279
uh so in that sense that's kind of
 

1647
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,549
uh so in that sense that's kind of
optimistic view that

1648
00:31:18,549 --> 00:31:18,559
optimistic view that
 

1649
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,470
optimistic view that
if by definition good is a proxy for

1650
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:20,480
if by definition good is a proxy for
 

1651
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,870
if by definition good is a proxy for
stability then it's going to be stable

1652
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:22,880
stability then it's going to be stable
 

1653
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,630
stability then it's going to be stable
unless the entire world just blows

1654
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:24,640
unless the entire world just blows
 

1655
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,350
unless the entire world just blows
itself up so good wins in the end by

1656
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:27,360
itself up so good wins in the end by
 

1657
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,310
itself up so good wins in the end by
definition

1658
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:28,320
definition
 

1659
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,990
definition
yeah or uh no actually well

1660
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:32,000
yeah or uh no actually well
 

1661
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,789
yeah or uh no actually well
good wins unless it all goes to

1662
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:36,799
good wins unless it all goes to
 

1663
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,430
good wins unless it all goes to

you've said that uh more broadly than

1674
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:52,320
you've said that uh more broadly than
 

1675
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,750
you've said that uh more broadly than
that about truth

1676
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:53,760
that about truth
 

1677
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,509
that about truth
that it is easier in some ways to be

1678
00:31:55,509 --> 00:31:55,519
that it is easier in some ways to be
 

1679
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,789
that it is easier in some ways to be
unified under truth

1680
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:56,799
unified under truth
 

1681
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,190
unified under truth
because it is universal than it is to be

1682
00:31:59,190 --> 00:31:59,200
because it is universal than it is to be
 

1683
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,190
because it is universal than it is to be
unified under belief which at times can

1684
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:01,200
unified under belief which at times can
 

1685
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,870
unified under belief which at times can
be completely subjective

1686
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:02,880
be completely subjective
 

1687
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,470
be completely subjective
so what is the nature of truth to you

1688
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:06,480
so what is the nature of truth to you
 

1689
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,950
so what is the nature of truth to you
can can we understand the world

1690
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:08,960
can can we understand the world
 

1691
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,710
can can we understand the world
objectively or is

1692
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:10,720
objectively or is
 

1693
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,549
objectively or is
most of what we can understand about the

1694
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:12,559
most of what we can understand about the
 

1695
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,149
most of what we can understand about the
world is just

1696
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:14,159
world is just
 

1697
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,350
world is just
uh subjective opinions that we kind of

1698
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
uh subjective opinions that we kind of
 

1699
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:17,669
uh subjective opinions that we kind of
all

1700
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:17,679
all
 

1701
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,549
all
agree on in these little collectives and

1702
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
agree on in these little collectives and
 

1703
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,990
agree on in these little collectives and
over time it kind of evolves

1704
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,000
over time it kind of evolves
 

1705
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,669
over time it kind of evolves
completely detached from objective

1706
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:25,679
completely detached from objective
 

1707
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,269
completely detached from objective
reality i think

1708
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:27,279
reality i think
 

1709
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,990
reality i think
this is the greatest argument for

00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,000
this is the greatest argument for
 

1711
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,350
this is the greatest argument for
objectivity

objectivity
 

1713
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,389
objectivity
uh is that something that is

1715
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:37,350
uh is that something that is
objectively true cannot be true to me

1716
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
objectively true cannot be true to me
 

1717
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,389
objectively true cannot be true to me
and

1718
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:38,399
and
 

1719
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,430

untrue to to you you can feel that it's

1720
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:41,440
untrue to to you you can feel that it's
 

1721
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,310
untrue to to you you can feel that it's
that it's untrue but that would be uh

that it's untrue but that would be uh
 

1723
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,509
that it's untrue but that would be uh
unproductive

and conflict i think this is

1728
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:52,399
and conflict i think this is
 

1729
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,830
and conflict i think this is
one reason for the importance of science

1730
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:55,840
one reason for the importance of science
 

1731
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,669
one reason for the importance of science
as a tool for

1732
00:32:57,669 --> 00:32:57,679
as a tool for
 

1733
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,110
as a tool for
stability if science is

00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,120
stability if science is
 

1735
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,389

the search for truth
 

1737
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,590
the search for truth
um and truth can never really be

1738
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:07,600
um and truth can never really be
 

1739
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,509
um and truth can never really be
i shouldn't say that truth should never

00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
i shouldn't say that truth should never
 

1741
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,830
i shouldn't say that truth should never
be an engine

00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:11,840
be an engine
 

1743
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,630
be an engine
of conflict because no two people should

search for truth
 

1751
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,470

is searching for a common ground
 

1753
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,750
is searching for a common ground
where we can all exist and

where we can all exist and
 

1755

do you ever hope that there is a lot of

do you ever hope that there is a lot of
 

1761
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,230
do you ever hope that there is a lot of
common ground to be discovered

common ground to be discovered
 

1763
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,990
common ground to be discovered
sure i mean if we continue

1764
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,000
sure i mean if we continue
 

1765
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,590

scientifically
 

1767
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,269
scientifically
uh we are discovering truth and in that

00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:43,279
uh we are discovering truth and in that
 

1769
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,430
uh we are discovering truth and in that
discovering common ground on which we

discovering common ground on which we
 

1771
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,509
discovering common ground on which we
can all agree that's that's one reason

1772
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:47,519
can all agree that's that's one reason

why i think
 

1775
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:51,830
why i think
uh caring about science if you have a

uh caring about science if you have a
 

1777
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,750

more danger than uh truth or
 

1857
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,310
more danger than uh truth or
uh if if they don't it's very important

1858

uh if if they don't it's very important
 

1859
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,270
uh if if they don't it's very important
to have

1860
00:35:23,270 --> 00:35:23,280
to have
 

1861
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,790
to have
fundamental thinkers who exist outside

1862
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:26,800
fundamental thinkers who exist outside
 

1863
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,589
fundamental thinkers who exist outside
of

1864
00:35:27,589 --> 00:35:27,599
of
 

1865
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,710
of
a conventional framework so

1866
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:30,720
a conventional framework so
 

1867
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,829
a conventional framework so
do i think that he's dangerous

1868
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
do i think that he's dangerous
 

1869
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,630
do i think that he's dangerous
i think by existing outside of

1870
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:38,640
i think by existing outside of
 

1871
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,230
i think by existing outside of
a system which is known he is dangerous

1872
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:42,240
a system which is known he is dangerous
 

1873
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,750
a system which is known he is dangerous
and i think we have to

1874
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:45,760
and i think we have to
 

1875
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,630
and i think we have to
in some sense we have to welcome danger

1876
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:48,640
in some sense we have to welcome danger
 

1877
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,270
in some sense we have to welcome danger
in that

1878
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:49,280
in that
 

1879
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,550
in that
capacity because it will be our only way

1880
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:52,560
capacity because it will be our only way
 

1881
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,470
capacity because it will be our only way
out of this so i'm

1882
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:56,480
out of this so i'm
 

1883
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,109
out of this so i'm
regardless of whether his beliefs are

1884

00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:04,560
right or wrong i am
 

1887
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,310
right or wrong i am
pretty adamant about the fact that we

1888
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:06,320
pretty adamant about the fact that we
 

1889
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,829
pretty adamant about the fact that we
need to support

1890
00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:07,839
need to support
 

1891
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,310
need to support
um thought which may rescue us and that

1892
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,320
um thought which may rescue us and that
 

1893
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,670
um thought which may rescue us and that
thought can

1894
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:13,680
thought can
 

1895
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,710
thought can
appear radical or dangerous at times but

1896
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:16,720
appear radical or dangerous at times but
 

1897
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,069
appear radical or dangerous at times but
ultimately if you allow for it

1898
00:36:20,069 --> 00:36:20,079
ultimately if you allow for it
 

1899
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,510
ultimately if you allow for it
this is kind of the difficult discussion

1900
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:21,520
this is kind of the difficult discussion
 

1901
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,510
this is kind of the difficult discussion
of free speech and so on

1902
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:23,520
of free speech and so on
 

1903
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,870
of free speech and so on
is ultimately difficult

1904
00:36:26,870 --> 00:36:26,880
is ultimately difficult
 

1905
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,550
is ultimately difficult
ideas will pave the way for progress

1906
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:30,560
ideas will pave the way for progress
 

1907
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,270
ideas will pave the way for progress
yeah and i'd actually i'd like to to

1908
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:33,280
yeah and i'd actually i'd like to to
 

1909
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,270
yeah and i'd actually i'd like to to
slow you down there because

1910
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:35,280
slow you down there because
 

1911
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,910
slow you down there because
i think like one of the issues we were

1912
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:37,920
i think like one of the issues we were
 

1913
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,829
i think like one of the issues we were
discussing

1914
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:38,839
discussing
 

1915
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:42,230
discussing
previously was the fact that language

1916
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:42,240
previously was the fact that language
 

1917
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,750
previously was the fact that language
often destroys our ability to

1918
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:45,760
often destroys our ability to
 

1919
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,190
often destroys our ability to
think um when we're talking about

1920
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:49,200
think um when we're talking about
 

1921
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:49,910
think um when we're talking about
whether his

1922
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:49,920
whether his
 

1923
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,430
whether his
ideas are a radical i don't know if we

1924
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:53,440
ideas are a radical i don't know if we
 

1925
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,430
ideas are a radical i don't know if we
if we mean radical in the traditional

1926
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:55,440
if we mean radical in the traditional
 

1927
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,109
if we mean radical in the traditional
sense of having to

1928
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
sense of having to
 

1929
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:00,710
sense of having to
to do with the root of a problem or

1930
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:00,720
to do with the root of a problem or
 

1931
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,230
to do with the root of a problem or
in the more modern sense of being um

1932
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,240
in the more modern sense of being um
 

1933
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,829
in the more modern sense of being um
very extreme and i think that's

1934
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:06,839
very extreme and i think that's
 

1935
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,069
very extreme and i think that's
completely

1936
00:37:08,069 --> 00:37:08,079
completely
 

1937
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,150
completely
by design i think

1938
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:12,160

 

1939
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,349

fundamental thought which

1940
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:15,359
fundamental thought which
 

1941
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,589
fundamental thought which
semantically would once be considered

1942
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:17,599
semantically would once be considered
 

1943
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,790
semantically would once be considered
radical thought

1944
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:18,800
radical thought
 

1945
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,030
radical thought
became very dangerous and now it's

1946
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,040
became very dangerous and now it's
 

1947
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,550
became very dangerous and now it's
become synonymous with

1948
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:22,560
become synonymous with
 

1949
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:25,510
become synonymous with
extreme or dangerous thought which means

1950
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:25,520
extreme or dangerous thought which means
 

1951
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,109
extreme or dangerous thought which means
that anyone who considers themself a

1952
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:27,119
that anyone who considers themself a
 

1953
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,069
that anyone who considers themself a
radical

1954

radical
 

1955
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,670
radical
thinker is semantically also a dangerous

1956
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:33,680
thinker is semantically also a dangerous
 

1957
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:37,349
thinker is semantically also a dangerous
or extreme thinker these are not helpful

1958
00:37:37,349 --> 00:37:37,359

thinker then you're just uh
 

1967
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,750

you're not helping
the public discourse exchange of ideas

1972
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:52,560
the public discourse exchange of ideas
 

1973
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,870
the public discourse exchange of ideas
but through no fault of our own the

1974
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:54,880
but through no fault of our own the
 

1975
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,430
but through no fault of our own the
concept of radical as having to do with

1976
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
concept of radical as having to do with
 

1977
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,829
concept of radical as having to do with
a root is uh it's a it's an obvious

1978
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:01,839
a root is uh it's a it's an obvious
 

1979
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,790
a root is uh it's a it's an obvious
concept for which there must be language

1980
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:04,800
concept for which there must be language
 

1981
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,430
concept for which there must be language
and

1982
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:05,440
and
 

1983
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,390
and
a lot of the attack on thought has to do

1984
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:08,400
a lot of the attack on thought has to do
 

1985
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,750
a lot of the attack on thought has to do
with attacking

1986
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:09,760
with attacking
 

1987
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,349
with attacking
language which communicates

1988
00:38:13,349 --> 00:38:13,359
language which communicates
 

1989
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:16,630
language which communicates
conceptually so like this is an example

1990
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:16,640
conceptually so like this is an example
 

1991
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,270
conceptually so like this is an example
of how

1992
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:17,280
of how
 

1993
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,510

we invented
 

2299
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:03,030
we invented
not a system which evolved and

2319
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:35,030

it makes sense to me why many are much

00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,040
it makes sense to me why many are much
 

2321
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,150
it makes sense to me why many are much
more compelled to

2322
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:36,160
more compelled to
 

2323
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,870
more compelled to
listen to podcasts for example than they

2324
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:38,880
listen to podcasts for example than they
 

2325
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:39,190
listen to podcasts for example than they
are

2326
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:39,200
are
 

2327
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,550
are
to read books it could be that

2328
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:42,560
to read books it could be that
 

2329
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:46,870
to read books it could be that
this is simply a technological uh

2330
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:46,880
this is simply a technological uh
 

2331
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:52,069
this is simply a technological uh
progression which has displaced uh

2332
00:44:52,069 --> 00:44:52,079
progression which has displaced uh
 

2333
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,430
progression which has displaced uh
reading conventionally instead of

2334
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:55,440
reading conventionally instead of
 

2335
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,950
reading conventionally instead of
some sort of maladaptation of our minds

2336
00:44:58,950 --> 00:44:58,960
some sort of maladaptation of our minds
 

2337
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,470
some sort of maladaptation of our minds
which has

2338
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:00,480
which has
 

2339
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,190
which has
corrupted our attention spans and likely

2340
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:03,200
corrupted our attention spans and likely
 

2341
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,109
corrupted our attention spans and likely
there's some combination

2342
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:05,119
there's some combination
 

2343
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,670
there's some combination
which determines why people spend much

2344
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:07,680
which determines why people spend much
 

2345
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,550
which determines why people spend much
less time

2346
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:08,560
less time
 

2347
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,309
less time
reading but i don't think it's

2348
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
reading but i don't think it's
 

2349
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,390
reading but i don't think it's
necessarily because we're all broken it

2350
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:12,400
necessarily because we're all broken it
 

2351
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,790
necessarily because we're all broken it
may

2352
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:12,800
may
 

2353
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,790
may
simply have to do with the fact that we

2354
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:14,800
simply have to do with the fact that we
 

2355
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,390
simply have to do with the fact that we
are designed to

are designed to
 

2357
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,550

in our current time so people are both
hungry for

00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:42,640
hungry for
 

2381
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,069
hungry for
the visual stimulation of internet humor

2382
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:46,079
the visual stimulation of internet humor
 

2383
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,430
the visual stimulation of internet humor
and memes a huge fan of and also

slow moving deep conversations
and that might you know it's there's a

2388
00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:55,839
and that might you know it's there's a

lot of i mean it's part of your
generation to define what that looks

2392
00:45:58,870 --> 00:45:58,880
generation to define what that looks
 

2393
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,230
generation to define what that looks
like moving forward where

2394
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:00,240
like moving forward where
 

2395
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,390
like moving forward where
a lot of people like joe rogan is one of

2396
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:02,400
a lot of people like joe rogan is one of
 

2397
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,510
a lot of people like joe rogan is one of
the people that kind of

2398
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,520
the people that kind of
 

2399
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,870
the people that kind of
uh started accidentally stumbled

2400
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:06,880
uh started accidentally stumbled
 

2401
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,270
uh started accidentally stumbled
into the discovery that this is like a

2402
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:09,280
into the discovery that this is like a
 

2403
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,230
into the discovery that this is like a
thing yeah

2404
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:10,240
thing yeah
 

2405
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,270
thing yeah
and now people are kind of scrambling to

2406
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:13,280
and now people are kind of scrambling to
 

2407
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,270
and now people are kind of scrambling to
figure out why is this a thing

2408
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:15,280
figure out why is this a thing
 

2409
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:16,870
figure out why is this a thing
like why is there so much hunger for

2410
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:16,880
like why is there so much hunger for
 

2411
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,710
like why is there so much hunger for
long-form conversations

2412
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:18,720
long-form conversations
 

2413
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,270
long-form conversations
and how do we optimize that medium for

2414
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:21,280
and how do we optimize that medium for
 

2415
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,349
and how do we optimize that medium for
further further expression of deep ideas

2416
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:23,359
further further expression of deep ideas
 

2417
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,550
further further expression of deep ideas
and all that kind of stuff

2418
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:24,560
and all that kind of stuff
 

2419
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,950
and all that kind of stuff
and youtube is a really interesting

2420
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:26,960
and youtube is a really interesting
 

2421
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,790
and youtube is a really interesting
medium for that as well

2422
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:28,800
medium for that as well
 

2423
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,829
medium for that as well
like video sharing of videos

2424
00:46:31,829 --> 00:46:31,839
like video sharing of videos
 

2425
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,150
like video sharing of videos
mostly youtube is used with the spirit

2426
00:46:34,150 --> 00:46:34,160
mostly youtube is used with the spirit
 

2427
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,109
mostly youtube is used with the spirit
of like

2428
00:46:35,109 --> 00:46:35,119
of like
 

2429
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:37,030
of like
the tick tock spirit if i can put in

2430
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:37,040
the tick tock spirit if i can put in
 

2431
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,230
the tick tock spirit if i can put in
that way which is like

2432
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:38,240
that way which is like
 

2433
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,190
that way which is like
how do i have quick moving things that

2434
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:41,200
how do i have quick moving things that
 

2435
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,630
how do i have quick moving things that
even if you're expressing difficult

2436
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:42,640
even if you're expressing difficult
 

2437
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,550
even if you're expressing difficult
ideas they should be quick and exciting

2438
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:44,560
ideas they should be quick and exciting
 

2439
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,309
ideas they should be quick and exciting
and visual and switching

2440
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:46,319
and visual and switching
 

2441
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:48,069
and visual and switching
but there's a lot of exploration there

2442
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:48,079
but there's a lot of exploration there
 

2443
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,990
but there's a lot of exploration there
to see what can we do something

2444
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:50,000
to see what can we do something
 

2445
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,190
to see what can we do something
deeper and nobody knows and you're part

2446
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:53,200
deeper and nobody knows and you're part
 

2447
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,630
deeper and nobody knows and you're part
of the

2448
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:54,640
of the
 

2449
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,109
of the
you have a youtube channel uh releasing

2450
00:46:57,109 --> 00:46:57,119
you have a youtube channel uh releasing
 

2451
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,270
you have a youtube channel uh releasing
one video every few years

2452
00:46:59,270 --> 00:46:59,280
one video every few years
 

2453
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,630
one video every few years
um so so your momentum is currently

2454
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:02,640
um so so your momentum is currently
 

2455
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:04,309
um so so your momentum is currently
quite slow but uh perhaps it'll

2456
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:04,319
quite slow but uh perhaps it'll
 

2457
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:05,190
quite slow but uh perhaps it'll
accelerate but

2458
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:05,200
accelerate but
 

2459
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:07,030
accelerate but
you're you're uh you're one of the

2460
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:07,040
you're you're uh you're one of the
 

2461
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,710
you're you're uh you're one of the
people that gets to define that medium

2462
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:08,720
people that gets to define that medium
 

2463
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,510
people that gets to define that medium
is that do you enjoy that the visual the

me
um i will read a book on it i would

2484
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:36,000
um i will read a book on it i would
 

2485
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,829
um i will read a book on it i would
listen to a podcast on it i would watch

2486
00:47:37,829 --> 00:47:37,839
listen to a podcast on it i would watch
 

2487
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,309
listen to a podcast on it i would watch
a video

2488
00:47:40,309 --> 00:47:40,319
a video
 

2489
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,069
a video
on it i think if i'm very curious about

2490
00:47:42,069 --> 00:47:42,079
on it i think if i'm very curious about
 

2491
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,750
on it i think if i'm very curious about
something

2492
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:43,760
something
 

2493
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,470
something
i will consume it however possible i

2494
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:46,480
i will consume it however possible i
 

2495
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,069
i will consume it however possible i
think when i have to consume

2496
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:48,079
think when i have to consume
 

2497
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:50,309
think when i have to consume
things which really don't interest me

2498
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:50,319
things which really don't interest me
 

2499
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:51,430
things which really don't interest me
very much

2500
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:51,440
very much
 

2501
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,950
very much
uh i'm indeed much more ready to

2502
00:47:54,950 --> 00:47:54,960
uh i'm indeed much more ready to
 

2503
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,950
uh i'm indeed much more ready to
consume them through some sort of video

2504
00:47:56,950 --> 00:47:56,960
consume them through some sort of video
 

2505
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,710
consume them through some sort of video
or discussion than i am through

2506
00:47:58,710 --> 00:47:58,720
or discussion than i am through
 

2507
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:01,750
or discussion than i am through
like a long tedious book

2508
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:01,760
like a long tedious book
 

2509
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,630
like a long tedious book
so for the the for the breadth of uh

2510
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:04,640

acquiring knowledge video is good

2512
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:06,800

2513
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,030
acquiring knowledge video is good
for the depth the medium doesn't matter

2514
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:11,040
for the depth the medium doesn't matter

i think it'd be fun to ask you about

2516
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:12,880
i think it'd be fun to ask you about
 

2517
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,710
i think it'd be fun to ask you about
some

2518
00:48:14,710 --> 00:48:14,720
some
 

2519
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,470
some
big philosophical questions to see if

2520
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:16,480
big philosophical questions to see if
 

2521
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,349
big philosophical questions to see if
you have an opinion on that

2522
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:19,359
you have an opinion on that
 

2523
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,670
you have an opinion on that
do you think there's a free will or is

2524
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:21,680
do you think there's a free will or is
 

2525
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:22,710
do you think there's a free will or is
free will

free will
 

2527
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:26,069
free will
just an illusion well i think

2528
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:26,079
just an illusion well i think
 

2529
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,030
just an illusion well i think
classical mechanics would tell us that

about a system and understand the rules

we would be completely able to predict

00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:27,359
uh within a system that has no freedom
 

2581
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,430
uh within a system that has no freedom
we're making legitimate systems within a

00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:29,440
we're making legitimate systems within a
 

2583
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,109
we're making legitimate systems within a
system that has no freedom can you

2584
00:49:31,109 --> 00:49:31,119
system that has no freedom can you
 

2585
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:31,750
system that has no freedom can you
explain

2586
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:31,760
explain
 

2587
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,790
explain
what you mean by that yeah so

2588
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:34,800
what you mean by that yeah so
 

2589
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,790
what you mean by that yeah so
if we were to have uh just a simple

2590
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:38,800
if we were to have uh just a simple
 

2591
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:42,710
if we were to have uh just a simple
pendulum and i told you how long the

2592
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:42,720
pendulum and i told you how long the
 

2593
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,510
pendulum and i told you how long the
the rope was i i we froze it at a

2594
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:45,520
the rope was i i we froze it at a
 

2595
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:46,549
the rope was i i we froze it at a
particular

2596
00:49:46,549 --> 00:49:46,559
particular
 

2597
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,750
particular
uh point and i told you how high high

2598
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:49,760
uh point and i told you how high high
 

2599
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,030
uh point and i told you how high high
above the ground

2600
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:51,040
above the ground
 

2601
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,150
above the ground
the weight was and uh

2602
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:54,160
the weight was and uh
 

2603
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:56,150
the weight was and uh
you know the motion of a of a pendulum

2604
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:56,160
you know the motion of a of a pendulum
 

2605
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,349
you know the motion of a of a pendulum
is something which is

2606
00:49:57,349 --> 00:49:57,359
is something which is
 

2607
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,190
is something which is
it's easy for everyone to imagine um

2608
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:01,200
it's easy for everyone to imagine um
 

2609
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:03,910
it's easy for everyone to imagine um
i could if we had all of that

2610
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:03,920
i could if we had all of that
 

2611
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:04,790
i could if we had all of that
information

2612
00:50:04,790 --> 00:50:04,800
information
 

2613
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,030
information
you could ask me where will the what

2614
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:07,040
you could ask me where will the what
 

2615
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,549
you could ask me where will the what
will the pendulum do

2616
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:08,559
will the pendulum do
 

2617
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,390
will the pendulum do
six and a half minutes from now and we

2618
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:10,400
six and a half minutes from now and we
 

2619
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,990
six and a half minutes from now and we
would have a precise

2620
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,000
would have a precise
 

2621
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,910
would have a precise
answer that's like a that's an example

2622
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:13,920
answer that's like a that's an example
 

2623
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,270
answer that's like a that's an example
of a very simple

2624
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:15,280
of a very simple
 

2625
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,190
of a very simple
system with a very simple lagrangian um

2626
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:19,200
system with a very simple lagrangian um
 

2627
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,710
system with a very simple lagrangian um
and we could completely predict the the

2628
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:22,720
and we could completely predict the the
 

2629
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,710
and we could completely predict the the
future that the pendulum has no

2630
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:24,720
future that the pendulum has no
 

2631
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,109
future that the pendulum has no
ability to do anything that would

2632
00:50:27,109 --> 00:50:27,119
ability to do anything that would
 

2633
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,470
ability to do anything that would
surprise us

2634
00:50:28,470 --> 00:50:28,480
surprise us
 

2635
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:33,430
surprise us
weirdly that's true of whatever this

2636
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:33,440
weirdly that's true of whatever this
 

2637
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,069
weirdly that's true of whatever this
four-dimensional crazy world we live in

2638
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:38,079
four-dimensional crazy world we live in
 

2639
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,190
four-dimensional crazy world we live in
looks like if we were to if we were to

2640
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:41,200
looks like if we were to if we were to
 

2641
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:42,790
looks like if we were to if we were to
understand where every piece of this

2642
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:42,800
understand where every piece of this
 

2643
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,630
understand where every piece of this
system was at any given time

2644
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:44,640
system was at any given time
 

2645
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,790
system was at any given time
and we we understand the the laws of

2646
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:46,800
and we we understand the the laws of
 

2647
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,470
and we we understand the the laws of
motion how everything

2648
00:50:48,470 --> 00:50:48,480
motion how everything
 

2649
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:51,270
motion how everything
worked if we could compute all of that

2650
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:51,280
worked if we could compute all of that
 

2651
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,109
worked if we could compute all of that
information somehow which we won't never

2652
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:53,119
information somehow which we won't never
 

2653
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,309
information somehow which we won't never
be able to do

2654
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:54,319
be able to do
 

2655
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,910
be able to do
uh we would

2656
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:57,920

 

2657
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:00,390

every decision you you will ever make

2658
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:00,400
every decision you you will ever make
 

2659
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,069
every decision you you will ever make
could be predicted by that

2660
00:51:02,069 --> 00:51:02,079
could be predicted by that
 

2661
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,910
could be predicted by that
computer that doesn't mean that your

2662
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:03,920
computer that doesn't mean that your
 

2663
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,750
computer that doesn't mean that your
decisions are illegitimate you are

2664
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:05,760
decisions are illegitimate you are
 

2665
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,030
decisions are illegitimate you are
really making those

2666
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:07,040
really making those
 

2667
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:09,349
really making those
decisions but with a completely

00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:09,359
decisions but with a completely
 

2669
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:10,150

predictable

2670
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:10,160
predictable
 

2671
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,349
predictable
outcome so i'm just uh sort of a little

2672
00:51:13,349 --> 00:51:13,359
outcome so i'm just uh sort of a little
 

2673
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,589
outcome so i'm just uh sort of a little
bit high at the moment on the uh

2674
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:15,599
bit high at the moment on the uh
 

2675
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,710
bit high at the moment on the uh
on this on the poetry of a system within

2676
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:18,720
on this on the poetry of a system within
 

2677
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,190
on this on the poetry of a system within
a system that has no freedom

2678
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:21,200
a system that has no freedom
 

2679
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,990
a system that has no freedom
so the human experience is the system

2680
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:24,000
so the human experience is the system
 

2681
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,510
so the human experience is the system
we've created

2682
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:25,520
we've created
 

2683
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:27,270
we've created
within the system there's no freedom but

2684
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,280
within the system there's no freedom but
 

2685
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:30,150
within the system there's no freedom but
that system that we've created

2686
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,160
that system that we've created
 

2687
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,270
that system that we've created
has a feeling of freedom

2688
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:33,280
has a feeling of freedom
 

2689
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,109
has a feeling of freedom
that to us ants

2690
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:37,119
that to us ants
 

2691
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,230

feels as uh

00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:40,240

2693
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,270

like base system so it's almost like not

00:51:50,950 --> 00:51:50,960
like base system so it's almost like not
 

2701
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,470

nature of the human experience
 

2709
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,390
nature of the human experience
is uh there is a free will

2710
00:52:02,390 --> 00:52:02,400
is uh there is a free will
 

2711
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,870
is uh there is a free will
or there's something that feels uh close

2712
00:52:04,870 --> 00:52:04,880
or there's something that feels uh close
 

2713
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,470
or there's something that feels uh close
enough to a free will

2714
00:52:06,470 --> 00:52:06,480
enough to a free will
 

2715
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,829
enough to a free will
that it may not be uh

2716
00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:09,839
that it may not be uh
 

2717
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:14,790
that it may not be uh
worth uh spending too much time on

2718
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:14,800
worth uh spending too much time on
 

2719
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:16,470
worth uh spending too much time on
the fact that it's something of an

2720
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:16,480
the fact that it's something of an
 

2721
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,309
the fact that it's something of an
illusion we will never build a computer

2722
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:18,319
illusion we will never build a computer
 

2723
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:20,069
illusion we will never build a computer
that knows everything about every

2724
00:52:20,069 --> 00:52:20,079
that knows everything about every
 

2725
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,190
that knows everything about every
piece of the universe at a given time uh

2726
00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:23,200
piece of the universe at a given time uh
 

2727
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,470
piece of the universe at a given time uh
and so for all intensive purposes uh

2728
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,480
and so for all intensive purposes uh
 

2729
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,109
and so for all intensive purposes uh
our decisions are up to us we just

2730
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:29,119
our decisions are up to us we just
 

2731
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,950
our decisions are up to us we just
happen to know that their outcomes could

2732
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:30,960
happen to know that their outcomes could
 

2733
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,349
happen to know that their outcomes could
be predicted with enough information

2734
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:33,359
be predicted with enough information
 

2735
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:36,309
be predicted with enough information
so um speaking of super computers they

2736
00:52:36,309 --> 00:52:36,319
so um speaking of super computers they
 

2737
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,230
so um speaking of super computers they
can predict every single thing about the

2738
00:52:38,230 --> 00:52:38,240
can predict every single thing about the
 

2739
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,030
can predict every single thing about the
uh

2740
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:39,040
uh
 

2741
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:41,750
uh
what's going to ever happen uh what do

2742
00:52:41,750 --> 00:52:41,760
what's going to ever happen uh what do
 

2743
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,270
what's going to ever happen uh what do
you think about

2744
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:43,280
you think about
 

2745
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,390
you think about
the philosophical thought experiment

2746
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:46,400
the philosophical thought experiment
 

2747
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,069
the philosophical thought experiment
of us living in a simulation do you

2748
00:52:50,069 --> 00:52:50,079
of us living in a simulation do you
 

2749
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,390
of us living in a simulation do you
often find yourself pondering of us

2750
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:52,400
often find yourself pondering of us
 

2751
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,910
often find yourself pondering of us
living in a simulation

2752
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:53,920
living in a simulation
 

2753
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,750
living in a simulation
of this question do you think it is at

2754
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
of this question do you think it is at
 

2755
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,910
of this question do you think it is at
all a useful thought experiment

2756
00:52:57,910 --> 00:52:57,920
all a useful thought experiment
 

2757
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,870
all a useful thought experiment
i think it's very easy to become

2758
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:00,880
i think it's very easy to become
 

2759
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,990
i think it's very easy to become
fascinated

2760
00:53:01,990 --> 00:53:02,000
fascinated
 

2761
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:03,910
fascinated
with all of these possibilities and

2762
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:03,920
with all of these possibilities and
 

2763
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,829
with all of these possibilities and
they're completely legitimate

2764
00:53:05,829 --> 00:53:05,839
they're completely legitimate
 

2765
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,069
they're completely legitimate
uh possibilities you know like do i

2766
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:10,079
uh possibilities you know like do i
 

2767
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:13,109
uh possibilities you know like do i
is there some validity to

2768
00:53:13,109 --> 00:53:13,119
is there some validity to
 

2769
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,150
is there some validity to
like solipsism uh while it can never be

2770
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:16,160
like solipsism uh while it can never be
 

2771
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,510
like solipsism uh while it can never be
falsified or disproven so i mean

2772
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:19,520
falsified or disproven so i mean
 

2773
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:22,710
falsified or disproven so i mean
sure you could be a figment of my uh

2774
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
sure you could be a figment of my uh
 

2775
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,990
sure you could be a figment of my uh
imagination uh it doesn't mean that

2776
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:26,000
imagination uh it doesn't mean that
 

2777
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,870
imagination uh it doesn't mean that
i will act according to this possibility

2778
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:28,880
i will act according to this possibility
 

2779
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,589
i will act according to this possibility
i'm not going to

2780
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:29,599
i'm not going to
 

2781
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,349
i'm not going to
call you mean names and just to test the

2782
00:53:33,349 --> 00:53:33,359
call you mean names and just to test the
 

2783
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,910
call you mean names and just to test the
system uh to see how robust it is to

2784
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:35,920
system uh to see how robust it is to
 

2785
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,430
system uh to see how robust it is to
distortions yeah so i mean all of these

2786
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:39,440
distortions yeah so i mean all of these
 

2787
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:40,549
distortions yeah so i mean all of these
existential

00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:40,559
existential
 

2789
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,069
existential
thought experiments are completely

00:53:42,069 --> 00:53:42,079
thought experiments are completely
 

2791
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:45,430
thought experiments are completely
possible we could be brains and jars

2792
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:45,440
possible we could be brains and jars
 

2793
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,470
possible we could be brains and jars
it doesn't mean that our experience

2794
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:48,480
it doesn't mean that our experience
 

2795
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,990
it doesn't mean that our experience
will feel any less valid and so it

2796
00:53:51,990 --> 00:53:52,000
will feel any less valid and so it
 

2797
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,829
will feel any less valid and so it
doesn't make a difference to me

2798
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:53,839
doesn't make a difference to me
 

2799
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,589
doesn't make a difference to me
if uh you were some

2800
00:53:57,589 --> 00:53:57,599
if uh you were some
 

2801
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,230
if uh you were some

you know if we take this this previous

um i could i could decide

2824
00:54:29,190 --> 00:54:29,200
um i could i could decide
 

2825
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:32,630
um i could i could decide
that because i have no

2826
00:54:32,630 --> 00:54:32,640
that because i have no
 

2827
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,150
that because i have no
choice in my life if i

2828
00:54:36,150 --> 00:54:36,160
choice in my life if i
 

2829
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:39,270
choice in my life if i
lie around in bed all day and eat chips

2830
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:39,280
lie around in bed all day and eat chips
 

2831
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,349
lie around in bed all day and eat chips
i was destined to do that thing and if i

2832
00:54:41,349 --> 00:54:41,359
i was destined to do that thing and if i
 

2833
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:42,950
i was destined to do that thing and if i
make that decision then i was destined

2834
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:42,960
make that decision then i was destined
 

2835
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:43,990
make that decision then i was destined
to do that thing

2836
00:54:43,990 --> 00:54:44,000
to do that thing
 

2837
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,230
to do that thing
it would be a really poor decision uh

2838
00:54:46,230 --> 00:54:46,240
it would be a really poor decision uh
 

2839
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:47,670
it would be a really poor decision uh
for me to make i have

2840
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:47,680
for me to make i have
 

2841
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,030
for me to make i have
school and a a dozen commitments uh

2842
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:51,040
school and a a dozen commitments uh
 

2843
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,270
school and a a dozen commitments uh
there's somebody listening to this right

2844
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:53,280
there's somebody listening to this right
 

2845
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,390
there's somebody listening to this right
now probably

2846
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:54,400
now probably

quotable from zev weinstein okay uh
 

2873
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,069
quotable from zev weinstein okay uh
but you don't think of it as a useful

00:55:22,069 --> 00:55:22,079
but you don't think of it as a useful

of thinking how we can create further

00:55:30,069 --> 00:55:30,079
of thinking how we can create further
 

2883
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,829

and further immersive worlds

2884
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:31,839
and further immersive worlds
 

2885
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,750
and further immersive worlds
like would it be possible to create

2886
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:33,760
like would it be possible to create
 

2887
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,910
like would it be possible to create
worlds that are so immersive that

worlds that are so immersive that
 

2889
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,309
worlds that are so immersive that
we would rather live in that world

2890
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:38,319
we would rather live in that world
 

2891
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:39,670
we would rather live in that world
versus the real world

versus the real world
 

2893
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,270
versus the real world
i mean that's another possible

2894
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
i mean that's another possible
 

2895
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,109
i mean that's another possible
trajectory of the world that you're

2896

growing up in

00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:44,559
growing up in
 

2899
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,390
growing up in
is where more and more immersing

2900
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:48,400
is where more and more immersing
 

2901
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,030
is where more and more immersing
ourselves

2902

ourselves
 

2903
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:51,109
ourselves
into the digital world for now it's

2904
00:55:51,109 --> 00:55:51,119
into the digital world for now it's
 

2905
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,870
into the digital world for now it's
screens and looking the screens and

2906
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
screens and looking the screens and
 

2907
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,549
screens and looking the screens and
socializing the screens

2908
00:55:54,549 --> 00:55:54,559
socializing the screens
 

2909
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,309
socializing the screens
but it's possible to potentially create

2910
00:55:56,309 --> 00:55:56,319
but it's possible to potentially create
 

2911
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,549
but it's possible to potentially create
a world that's also visually for all of

00:55:58,549 --> 00:55:58,559
a world that's also visually for all of
 

2913
00:55:58,559 --> 00:55:59,109
a world that's also visually for all of
our

2914
00:55:59,109 --> 00:55:59,119
our
 

2915
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,150
our
human senses as immersive as the

physical world
 

2919
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:06,390
physical world
and then you know it's to me it's an

2920
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:06,400
and then you know it's to me it's an
 

2921
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,470
and then you know it's to me it's an
engineering question of how difficult is

2922
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:08,480
engineering question of how difficult is
 

2923
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,670
engineering question of how difficult is
it to create a

2924
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:09,680
it to create a
 

2925
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:13,109
it to create a
world that's as immersive and more fun

2926

world that's as immersive and more fun
 

2927
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,829
world that's as immersive and more fun
than uh the world would currently live

2928
00:56:15,829 --> 00:56:15,839
than uh the world would currently live
 

2929
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,589
than uh the world would currently live
in it's a terrifying concept and i hate

2930
00:56:17,589 --> 00:56:17,599
in it's a terrifying concept and i hate
 

2931
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:18,309
in it's a terrifying concept and i hate
to say it

2932
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:18,319
to say it
 

2933
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,789
to say it
we might live happier lives in a virtual

2934
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:20,799
we might live happier lives in a virtual
 

2935

00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:26,799
then we are currently living this future

00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:30,069
then we are currently living this future
the digital future worries you it

world that we don't
 

2955
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,870
world that we don't
yet know is virtual so embrace the

yet know is virtual so embrace the

we've been talking a lot about thinkers

2960
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:56,839

 

2961
00:56:56,839 --> 00:56:59,670

now in the broad definition of

00:56:59,670 --> 00:56:59,680
now in the broad definition of
 

2963
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,190
now in the broad definition of
philosophy you kind of included

2964
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:01,200
philosophy you kind of included
 

2965
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,710
philosophy you kind of included
innovators of all

2966
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:02,720
innovators of all
 

2967
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,910
innovators of all
forms do you find it useful to draw a

2968
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:05,920
forms do you find it useful to draw a
 

2969
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:06,870
forms do you find it useful to draw a
distinction between

2970
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:06,880
distinction between
 

2971
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,309
distinction between
thinkers and doers i think that

observe the universe and think
deductively

2980
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:20,480
deductively
 

2981
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,190
deductively
about whatever principles transcend

2982
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
about whatever principles transcend
 

2983
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,150

humanity
 

2985
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,510
humanity
because you know as we discussed that's

2986
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:27,520
because you know as we discussed that's
 

2987
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,670
because you know as we discussed that's
that's the closest thing we will ever

2988
00:57:29,670 --> 00:57:29,680
that's the closest thing we will ever
 

2989
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,710
that's the closest thing we will ever
have to

2990
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:30,720
have to
 

2991
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,710
have to
um a universal experience is

2992
00:57:32,710 --> 00:57:32,720
um a universal experience is
 

2993
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,910
um a universal experience is
understanding things which

2994
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:33,920
understanding things which
 

2995
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:37,270
understanding things which
must be true um everywhere

2996
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:37,280
must be true um everywhere
 

2997
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,309
must be true um everywhere
in order for that so

2998
00:57:40,309 --> 00:57:40,319
in order for that so
 

2999
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,870
in order for that so
i think if if we're if we're deciding

3000
00:57:42,870 --> 00:57:42,880
i think if if we're if we're deciding
 

3001
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,910
i think if if we're if we're deciding
that that life is

3002
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:43,920
that that life is
 

3003
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:46,390
that that life is
is meaningful and the human experience

3004
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:46,400
is meaningful and the human experience
 

3005
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,589
is meaningful and the human experience
is meaningful

3006
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:47,599
is meaningful
 

3007
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,910
is meaningful
uh you could make a very convincing

3008
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:49,920
uh you could make a very convincing
 

3009
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,910
uh you could make a very convincing
argument that

3010
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:51,920
argument that
 

3011
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,589
argument that
its greatest meaning will be

3012
00:57:53,589 --> 00:57:53,599
its greatest meaning will be
 

3013
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:54,950
its greatest meaning will be
understanding whatever

3014
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:54,960
understanding whatever
 

3015
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:58,549
understanding whatever
transcends it um

3016
00:57:58,549 --> 00:57:58,559
transcends it um
 

3017
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,309
transcends it um
i think that's only sustainable if

3018
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:02,319
i think that's only sustainable if
 

3019
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,750
i think that's only sustainable if
people are happy

3020
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:05,760
people are happy
 

3021
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:08,789
people are happy
and well fed and

3022
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:08,799
and well fed and
 

3023
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,950
and well fed and
things of of market value are

3024
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:12,960
things of of market value are
 

3025
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:17,109
things of of market value are
invented and so i think we really need

3026
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:17,119
invented and so i think we really need
 

3027
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,549
invented and so i think we really need
both to live meaningful and

3028
00:58:20,549 --> 00:58:20,559
both to live meaningful and
 

3029
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:24,150
both to live meaningful and
successful and possible lives

3030
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:24,160
successful and possible lives
 

3031
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,510

but he is he is of his own kind

3138
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:48,160
but he is he is of his own kind
 

3139
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:52,150
but he is he is of his own kind
he is radically individualistic and

3140
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:52,160
he is radically individualistic and
 

3141
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,390
he is radically individualistic and
those are the people who will allow us

3142
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:54,400
those are the people who will allow us
 

3143
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,630
those are the people who will allow us
to continue uh

3144
01:00:56,630 --> 01:00:56,640
to continue uh
 

3145
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:59,430
to continue uh
as as humans i'm very happy that that we

3146
01:00:59,430 --> 01:00:59,440
as as humans i'm very happy that that we
 

3147
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:01,109
as as humans i'm very happy that that we
have people like that in this world

3148
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:01,119
have people like that in this world
 

3149
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:04,390
have people like that in this world
you said this thing about if

3150
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:04,400
you said this thing about if
 

3151
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,630
you said this thing about if
we are to say that life has meaning

3152
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:08,640
we are to say that life has meaning
 

3153
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:11,829
we are to say that life has meaning
our life is meaningful then you could

3154
01:01:11,829 --> 01:01:11,839
our life is meaningful then you could
 

3155
01:01:11,839 --> 01:01:13,349
our life is meaningful then you could
argue

3156
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:13,359
argue
 

3157
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,870
argue
that it is a worthy pursuit to transcend

3158
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:16,880
that it is a worthy pursuit to transcend
 

3159
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,910
that it is a worthy pursuit to transcend
life do you see

3160
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:19,920
life do you see
 

3161
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:23,190
life do you see
that another just i'm gonna have to

3162
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:23,200
that another just i'm gonna have to
 

3163
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,510
that another just i'm gonna have to
i'm gonna have to go back um and sleep

3164
01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:25,520
i'm gonna have to go back um and sleep
 

3165
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:28,230
i'm gonna have to go back um and sleep
on that one

3166
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:28,240

 

3167
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:31,190

uh do you do you draw some speaking of

3168
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:31,200
uh do you do you draw some speaking of
 

3169
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,549
uh do you do you draw some speaking of
elon

elon
 

3171
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,750

some inspiration

3172
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:35,760
some inspiration
 

3173
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:39,030
some inspiration
of us uh

3174
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:39,040
of us uh
 

3175
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,190
of us uh
transcending earth of us moving outside

3176
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:43,200
transcending earth of us moving outside
 

3177
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,390
transcending earth of us moving outside
of uh this particular planet

3178
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:46,400
of uh this particular planet
 

3179
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,069
of uh this particular planet
that we've called home for a long time

3180
01:01:48,069 --> 01:01:48,079
that we've called home for a long time
 

3181
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:50,230
that we've called home for a long time
and colonizing other planets

3182
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:50,240
and colonizing other planets
 

3183
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,390
and colonizing other planets
and perhaps one day expanding outside

3184
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:52,400
and perhaps one day expanding outside
 

3185
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:53,829
and perhaps one day expanding outside
the solar system

3186
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:53,839
the solar system
 

3187
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,109

honestly i know very little about space

3192
01:02:00,630 --> 01:02:00,640
honestly i know very little about space
 

3193
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:01,750
honestly i know very little about space
exploration

3194
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:01,760
exploration
 

3195
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,829
exploration
i think it makes complete sense to me

3196
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:05,839
i think it makes complete sense to me
 

3197
01:02:05,839 --> 01:02:06,950
i think it makes complete sense to me
why

3198
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:06,960
why
 

3199
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,950
why
we are starting to think very seriously

3200
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:08,960
we are starting to think very seriously
 

3201
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,470
we are starting to think very seriously
about it it's

3202
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:10,480
about it it's
 

3203
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,549
about it it's
an amazing and baffling and innovative

3204
01:02:14,549 --> 01:02:14,559
an amazing and baffling and innovative
 

3205
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,309
an amazing and baffling and innovative
solution to a lot of problems we see

3206
01:02:18,309 --> 01:02:18,319
solution to a lot of problems we see
 

3207
01:02:18,319 --> 01:02:21,829
solution to a lot of problems we see
as a world population i can't really

3208
01:02:21,829 --> 01:02:21,839
as a world population i can't really
 

3209
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:22,549
as a world population i can't really
offer

very much uh of interest on

3212
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:25,839
very much uh of interest on
 

3213
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:28,789
very much uh of interest on
the topic i think when i i'm talking

3214
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:28,799
the topic i think when i i'm talking
 

3215
01:02:28,799 --> 01:02:29,510
the topic i think when i i'm talking
about

3216
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:29,520
about
 

3217
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,990
about
like transcending humanity and

3218
01:02:31,990 --> 01:02:32,000
like transcending humanity and
 

3219
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,630
like transcending humanity and
transcending earth

3220
01:02:34,630 --> 01:02:34,640
transcending earth
 

3221
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:39,109
transcending earth
i'm talking usually about

3222
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:39,119
i'm talking usually about
 

3223
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:41,589
i'm talking usually about
deriving truth and that's one of the

3224
01:02:41,589 --> 01:02:41,599
deriving truth and that's one of the
 

3225
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,430
deriving truth and that's one of the
things that makes like theoretical math

3226
01:02:43,430 --> 01:02:43,440
things that makes like theoretical math
 

3227
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,750
things that makes like theoretical math
and physics

3228
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:45,760
and physics
 

3229
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,309
and physics
so interesting it's like i i really

3230
01:02:48,309 --> 01:02:48,319
so interesting it's like i i really
 

3231
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,950
so interesting it's like i i really
really love

3232
01:02:48,950 --> 01:02:48,960
really love
 

3233
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,990
really love
biology for example but

3234
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:52,000
biology for example but
 

3235
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,510
biology for example but
biology is a combination

3236
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:55,520
biology is a combination
 

3237
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:58,710
biology is a combination
of whatever principles ensure evolution

3238
01:02:58,710 --> 01:02:58,720
of whatever principles ensure evolution
 

3239
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:01,670
of whatever principles ensure evolution
and whatever weird coincidences happened

3240
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:01,680
and whatever weird coincidences happened
 

3241
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,430
and whatever weird coincidences happened
billions of years ago

3242
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:03,440
billions of years ago
 

3243
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,349
billions of years ago
um so g is more interesting to

3244
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:05,359
um so g is more interesting to
 

3245
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:07,190
um so g is more interesting to
understand the fundamental mechanisms of

3246
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
understand the fundamental mechanisms of
 

3247
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:09,589
understand the fundamental mechanisms of
evolution for example than it is

3248
01:03:09,589 --> 01:03:09,599
evolution for example than it is
 

3249
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,069
evolution for example than it is
the results the messy results of its

3250
01:03:12,069 --> 01:03:12,079
the results the messy results of its
 

3251
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:12,950
the results the messy results of its
processes

3252
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:12,960
processes
 

3253
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,789
processes
i can't say which is more interesting i

3254
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:14,799
i can't say which is more interesting i
 

3255
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:16,630
i can't say which is more interesting i
can say which i think is more

3256
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:16,640
can say which i think is more
 

3257
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:19,990
can say which i think is more
is more deep i think theory

3258
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:20,000
is more deep i think theory
 

3259
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,430
is more deep i think theory
and abstraction which can be achieved

3260
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:23,440
and abstraction which can be achieved
 

3261
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,470
and abstraction which can be achieved
completely deductively

3262
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:26,480
completely deductively
 

3263
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,190
completely deductively
is deeper because it has nothing to do

3264
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:29,200
is deeper because it has nothing to do
 

3265
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,829
is deeper because it has nothing to do
with circumstance and everything to do

3266
01:03:31,829 --> 01:03:31,839
with circumstance and everything to do
 

3267
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,190
with circumstance and everything to do
with uh logic and thought

3268
01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:35,200
with uh logic and thought
 

3269
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:39,589
with uh logic and thought
uh so like if we were ever to

3270
01:03:39,589 --> 01:03:39,599
uh so like if we were ever to
 

3271
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,109
uh so like if we were ever to
to interact with aliens for example uh

3272
01:03:43,109 --> 01:03:43,119
to interact with aliens for example uh
 

3273
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,029
to interact with aliens for example uh
we would not have our biology in common

3274
01:03:47,029 --> 01:03:47,039
we would not have our biology in common
 

3275
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:50,390
we would not have our biology in common
if if these were or some sort of really

life form uh we would have

3280
01:03:55,029 --> 01:03:55,039
life form uh we would have
 

3281
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,390
life form uh we would have
math and physics in common because uh

3282
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:58,400
math and physics in common because uh
 

3283
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:01,430
math and physics in common because uh
the laws of physics will be the same

3284

01:04:24,630 --> 01:04:24,640
experiments like these
 

3303
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,870
experiments like these
i try to keep a very abstract

3304
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:28,880
i try to keep a very abstract
 

3305
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,789
i try to keep a very abstract
mindset and i notice that whenever

3306
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:32,799
mindset and i notice that whenever
 

3307
01:04:32,799 --> 01:04:36,870
mindset and i notice that whenever
i try to instantiate these abstractions

3308
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:36,880
i try to instantiate these abstractions
 

3309
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:40,230
i try to instantiate these abstractions
i i corrupt whatever thoughts

3310
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:40,240
i i corrupt whatever thoughts
 

3311
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,589
i i corrupt whatever thoughts
uh there are for which they're useful so

3312
01:04:43,589 --> 01:04:43,599
uh there are for which they're useful so
 

3313
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:45,270
uh there are for which they're useful so
it's kind of like the labels discussion

3314
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:45,280
it's kind of like the labels discussion
 

3315
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:46,870
it's kind of like the labels discussion
so like the moment you try to

3316
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:46,880
so like the moment you try to
 

3317
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:48,950
so like the moment you try to
make it concrete it's probably gonna

3318
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:48,960
make it concrete it's probably gonna
 

3319
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,430
make it concrete it's probably gonna
look like some cute version of a human

it's interesting so you prefer to
 

3337
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,109
it's interesting so you prefer to
step away and think and abstract notions

step away and think and abstract notions
 

3339
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,630

thought experiments like these because i
 

3359
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,029
thought experiments like these because i
know that

3360
01:05:31,029 --> 01:05:31,039
know that
 

3361
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,829

i will impede my ability to
 

3367
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,670
i will impede my ability to
think as deeply as possible because once

think as deeply as possible because once
 

3369
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,190
think as deeply as possible because once
again it's

again it's
 

3371
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:51,190
again it's
the thing which shallows our thought can

the thing which shallows our thought can
 

3373
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:53,349
the thing which shallows our thought can
be the incorporation of circumstance and

3467
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:38,950
and the communication of
deep thought because as i said i think

3468
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:38,960
deep thought because as i said i think
 

3469
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,150
deep thought because as i said i think
communication

3470
01:07:40,150 --> 01:07:40,160
communication
 

3471
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,710
communication
frequently compromises thought uh by

3472
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:42,720
frequently compromises thought uh by
 

3473
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:43,589
frequently compromises thought uh by
intention

3474
01:07:43,589 --> 01:07:43,599
intention
 

3475
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:47,430
intention
or by just uh theoretical

3476
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:47,440
or by just uh theoretical
 

3477
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,910
or by just uh theoretical
inadequacy so in this topic actually

3478
01:07:49,910 --> 01:07:49,920
inadequacy so in this topic actually
 

3479
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,349
inadequacy so in this topic actually
it'd be fun to see what your thoughts

3480
01:07:51,349 --> 01:07:51,359
it'd be fun to see what your thoughts
 

3481
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:51,670
it'd be fun to see what your thoughts
are

3482
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:51,680
are
 

3483
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:55,270
are
uh do you think math is uh

3484
01:07:55,270 --> 01:07:55,280
uh do you think math is uh
 

3485
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:57,510
uh do you think math is uh
invented or discovered so you said that

3486
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:57,520
invented or discovered so you said that
 

3487
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,750
invented or discovered so you said that
math we might share

3488
01:07:59,750 --> 01:07:59,760
math we might share
 

3489
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,190
math we might share
ideas in mathematics and physics

01:08:12,710 --> 01:08:12,720
what uh do you think this thing that we
 

3499
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,789
what uh do you think this thing that we
call mathematics

01:08:14,789 --> 01:08:14,799
call mathematics
 

3501
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:17,510
call mathematics
is uh something that's kind of

3502
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:17,520
is uh something that's kind of
 

3503
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:19,510
is uh something that's kind of
fundamental to the world we live in or

fundamental to the world we live in or
 

3505
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:21,269
fundamental to the world we live in or
is it just some kind of uh

01:08:21,269 --> 01:08:21,279
is it just some kind of uh
 

3507
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,789
is it just some kind of uh
pretty axioms and theorems have come up

3508
01:08:24,789 --> 01:08:24,799
pretty axioms and theorems have come up
 

3509
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:26,390
pretty axioms and theorems have come up
with to try to describe the

3510
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:26,400
with to try to describe the
 

3511
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:28,709
with to try to describe the
the patterns we see in the world uh i

3512
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:28,719
the patterns we see in the world uh i
 

3513
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:29,829
the patterns we see in the world uh i
think it's

3514
01:08:29,829 --> 01:08:29,839
think it's
 

3515
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:32,470
think it's
completely discovered and completely

3516
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:32,480
completely discovered and completely
 

3517
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:33,510

01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:35,520
to all experience i think the only
 

3521
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,550
to all experience i think the only

3523
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,430
component
of mathematics that has been invented is

3524
01:08:39,430 --> 01:08:39,440
of mathematics that has been invented is
 

3525
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,630
of mathematics that has been invented is
the expression

3526
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:40,640
the expression
 

3527
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,550
the expression
of it and i think in some sense there's

3528
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:44,560
of it and i think in some sense there's
 

3529
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,669
of it and i think in some sense there's
almost

3530
01:08:45,669 --> 01:08:45,679
almost
 

3531
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,110
almost
uh an arrogance required to

3532
01:08:49,110 --> 01:08:49,120
uh an arrogance required to
 

3533
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:53,430
uh an arrogance required to
believe that whatever aspect

3534
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:53,440

 

3535
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:57,990

we invent having to do with

3536
01:08:57,990 --> 01:08:58,000
we invent having to do with
 

3537
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,870
we invent having to do with
math and physics and theory there is an

3538
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:00,880
math and physics and theory there is an
 

3539
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:01,669
math and physics and theory there is an
arrogance

3540
01:09:01,669 --> 01:09:01,679
arrogance
 

3541
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:05,349
arrogance
required to truly believe that that

3542
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:05,359
required to truly believe that that
 

3543
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:07,269
required to truly believe that that
belongs on any sort of stage

3544
01:09:07,269 --> 01:09:07,279
belongs on any sort of stage
 

3545
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:10,149
belongs on any sort of stage
with the actual beauty of the matters

3546
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:10,159
with the actual beauty of the matters
 

3547
01:09:10,159 --> 01:09:10,709
with the actual beauty of the matters

being
 

3549
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,550
being
discovered so um

3550
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:16,560

 

3551
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:20,229

we need our minds and in some sense are

3552
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:20,239
we need our minds and in some sense are
 

3553
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:24,070
we need our minds and in some sense are
our pens to be able to play with these

3554
01:09:24,070 --> 01:09:24,080
our pens to be able to play with these
 

3555
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:27,110
our pens to be able to play with these
things and communicate

3556
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:27,120
things and communicate
 

3557
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:31,269
things and communicate
about them and those hands and those are

3558
01:09:31,269 --> 01:09:31,279
about them and those hands and those are
 

3559
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,390
about them and those hands and those are
and those pens are the things which

3560
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,400
and those pens are the things which
 

3561
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,470
and those pens are the things which
smudge the most beautiful thing that

3562
01:09:36,470 --> 01:09:36,480
smudge the most beautiful thing that
 

3563
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:38,070
smudge the most beautiful thing that
humanity can ever

3564
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:38,080
humanity can ever
 

3565
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:42,630
humanity can ever
um experience and

3566
01:09:42,630 --> 01:09:42,640

 

3567
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,470

maybe if we interact with some

3568
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:44,480
maybe if we interact with some
 

3569
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:47,110
maybe if we interact with some
intelligent life form

3570
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:47,120
intelligent life form
 

3571
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,590
intelligent life form
uh they will have their own unique

3572
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:49,600
uh they will have their own unique
 

3573
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:50,870
uh they will have their own unique
smudges

3574
01:09:50,870 --> 01:09:50,880
smudges
 

3575
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:55,030
smudges
but the canvas uh which is beautiful

3576
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:55,040
but the canvas uh which is beautiful
 

3577
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,950
but the canvas uh which is beautiful
must be identical because that is

3578
01:09:56,950 --> 01:09:56,960
must be identical because that is
 

3579
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:58,070
must be identical because that is
universal and

3580
01:09:58,070 --> 01:09:58,080
universal and
 

3581
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,910
universal and
ubiquitous truth and that's what makes

3582
01:09:59,910 --> 01:09:59,920
ubiquitous truth and that's what makes
 

3583
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,750
ubiquitous truth and that's what makes
it deep and and meaningful is that it's

3584
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:01,760
it deep and and meaningful is that it's
 

3585
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:01,990
it deep and and meaningful is that it's
so

3586
01:10:01,990 --> 01:10:02,000
so
 

3587
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,110
so
much more important than uh

3588
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:05,120
much more important than uh
 

3589
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:07,669
much more important than uh
whatever we're programmed to enjoy as an

3590
01:10:07,669 --> 01:10:07,679
whatever we're programmed to enjoy as an
 

3591
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:08,550
whatever we're programmed to enjoy as an
aspect of

3592
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:08,560
aspect of
 

3593
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:11,750
aspect of
human experience yeah that um

3594
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:11,760
human experience yeah that um
 

3595
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,590
human experience yeah that um
that's really beautifully put and that's

3596
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:13,600
that's really beautifully put and that's
 

3597
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:16,229
that's really beautifully put and that's
the human language is

3598
01:10:16,229 --> 01:10:16,239
the human language is
 

3599
01:10:16,239 --> 01:10:18,709
the human language is
these messy smudges of trying to express

3600
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:18,719
these messy smudges of trying to express
 

3601
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:21,110
these messy smudges of trying to express
something underlying that is

3602
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:21,120
something underlying that is
 

3603
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:24,709
something underlying that is
beautiful speaking of that

3604
01:10:24,709 --> 01:10:24,719
beautiful speaking of that
 

3605
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,750
beautiful speaking of that
uh on the physics side do you think

3606
01:10:27,750 --> 01:10:27,760
uh on the physics side do you think
 

3607
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,030
uh on the physics side do you think
the pursuit of a theory of everything in

3608
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:31,040
the pursuit of a theory of everything in
 

3609
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:31,750
the pursuit of a theory of everything in
physics

3610
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:31,760
physics
 

3611
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,390
physics
as we may call it in our current times

3612
01:10:34,390 --> 01:10:34,400
as we may call it in our current times
 

3613
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,630
as we may call it in our current times
of understanding the basic

3614
01:10:36,630 --> 01:10:36,640
of understanding the basic
 

3615
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,550

perspective
 

3619
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,630
perspective
is an important pursuit i think it's

3620
01:10:42,630 --> 01:10:42,640
is an important pursuit i think it's
 

3621
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:44,470
is an important pursuit i think it's
essential

3622
01:10:44,470 --> 01:10:44,480
essential
 

3623
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:47,590
essential
as i've said i think ideation is

3624
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:47,600
as i've said i think ideation is
 

3625
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:51,750
as i've said i think ideation is
our only escape from the

3626
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:51,760
our only escape from the
 

3627
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,950
our only escape from the
constraints of human condition and

3628
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:54,960
constraints of human condition and
 

3629
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,669
constraints of human condition and
i think that it's important that all

3630
01:10:57,669 --> 01:10:57,679
i think that it's important that all
 

3631
01:10:57,679 --> 01:10:59,590
i think that it's important that all
great thoughts and ideas

3632
01:10:59,590 --> 01:10:59,600

i suppose one thing i could say is that
um i think

4284
01:23:59,750 --> 01:23:59,760
um i think
 

4285
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,590
um i think
idealism and what could almost be

4286
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:03,600
idealism and what could almost be
 

4287
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,910
idealism and what could almost be

of maturity but instead
 

4293
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:20,229
of maturity but instead
an obligation to those

4294
01:24:20,229 --> 01:24:20,239
an obligation to those
 

4295
01:24:20,239 --> 01:24:23,270
an obligation to those
older than us who have

4296
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:23,280
older than us who have
 

4297
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,669
older than us who have
lived lived and seen too much

4298
01:24:27,669 --> 01:24:27,679
lived lived and seen too much
 

4299
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,990
lived lived and seen too much
to fully believe

4300
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:32,000
to fully believe
 

4301
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,430
to fully believe
in what is naive and right without

4302
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:35,440
in what is naive and right without
 

4303
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,629
in what is naive and right without
um

4304
01:24:38,629 --> 01:24:38,639

 

4305
01:24:38,639 --> 01:24:41,910

without the assistance of the young

4306
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:41,920
without the assistance of the young
 

4307
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,270
without the assistance of the young
to re-inspire uh

4308
01:24:45,270 --> 01:24:45,280
to re-inspire uh
 

4309
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,870
to re-inspire uh
traditional idealism and so perhaps

4310
01:24:48,870 --> 01:24:48,880
traditional idealism and so perhaps
 

4311
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,790
traditional idealism and so perhaps
instead of trying to be uh more mature

4312
01:24:52,790 --> 01:24:52,800
instead of trying to be uh more mature
 

4313
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:55,430
instead of trying to be uh more mature
all the time i should spend some time

4314
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:55,440
all the time i should spend some time
 

4315
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:56,950
all the time i should spend some time
trying to be

4316
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:56,960
trying to be
 

4317
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,149
trying to be
an idealistic form of hope in

4318
01:25:00,149 --> 01:25:00,159
an idealistic form of hope in
 

4319
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:03,510
an idealistic form of hope in
the lives of people who maybe have seen

4320
01:25:03,510 --> 01:25:03,520
the lives of people who maybe have seen
 

4321
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:04,149
the lives of people who maybe have seen
too much

4322
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:04,159
too much
 

4323
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:07,669
too much
to retain all of that original hope

4324
01:25:07,669 --> 01:25:07,679
to retain all of that original hope
 

4325
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,550
to retain all of that original hope
so that's something that's that's

4326
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:10,560
so that's something that's that's
 

4327
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:11,510
so that's something that's that's
difficult

4328
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:11,520
difficult
 

4329
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,550
difficult
but you know especially appearing in

4330
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:14,560
but you know especially appearing in
 

4331
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:15,910
but you know especially appearing in
public as someone as

public as someone as
 

4333
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:19,350
public as someone as
as young as i am i think anything i do

01:25:19,350 --> 01:25:19,360
as young as i am i think anything i do
 

4335
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,990
as young as i am i think anything i do
which is juvenile by choice will be held

4336
01:25:21,990 --> 01:25:22,000
which is juvenile by choice will be held
 

4337
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:23,110
which is juvenile by choice will be held
against me

4338

against me
 

4339
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,149
against me
so but maybe that's the sacrifice that i

4340
01:25:26,149 --> 01:25:26,159
so but maybe that's the sacrifice that i
 

4341
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,830
so but maybe that's the sacrifice that i
i have to make i have to retain some

uh i tried instead to
learn what made music work and the the

4576
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:51,040
learn what made music work and the the
 

4577
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,950
learn what made music work and the the
wonderful thing about that was i'm

4578
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:52,960
wonderful thing about that was i'm
 

4579
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:54,310
wonderful thing about that was i'm
pretty sure that

4580
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:54,320
pretty sure that
 

4581
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:58,310
pretty sure that
any instrument with discreet notes is

4582
01:29:58,310 --> 01:29:58,320
any instrument with discreet notes is
 

4583
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:00,310
any instrument with discreet notes is
mined for the taking within a day or so

4584
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:00,320
mined for the taking within a day or so
 

4585
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,830
mined for the taking within a day or so
of having the ability to

4586
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:01,840
of having the ability to
 

4587
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,270
of having the ability to
to play with it so i think

4588
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:05,280
to play with it so i think
 

4589
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:08,390
to play with it so i think
approaching music abstractly gave me the

4590
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:08,400
approaching music abstractly gave me the
 

4591
01:30:08,400 --> 01:30:10,070
approaching music abstractly gave me the
ability to

4592
01:30:10,070 --> 01:30:10,080
ability to
 

4593
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:13,830
ability to
instantiate it uh everywhere

4594
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:13,840
instantiate it uh everywhere
 

4595
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,629
instantiate it uh everywhere
and i think it also taught me something

4596
01:30:16,629 --> 01:30:16,639
and i think it also taught me something
 

4597
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:18,070
and i think it also taught me something
about self-teaching

4598
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:18,080
about self-teaching
 

4599
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,709
about self-teaching
like recently i've tried getting into

into classical music because
 

4603
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,270
into classical music because
at least traditionally this is the thing

4604
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:25,280
at least traditionally this is the thing
 

4605
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,590
at least traditionally this is the thing
which is thought to require

4606
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:27,600
which is thought to require
 

4607
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,709
which is thought to require
the most rigor um

4608
01:30:30,709 --> 01:30:30,719
the most rigor um
 

4609
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,430
the most rigor um
and traditional uh teaching

4610
01:30:35,430 --> 01:30:35,440
and traditional uh teaching
 

4611
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,990
and traditional uh teaching
i think it's essentially taught me even

4612
01:30:37,990 --> 01:30:38,000
i think it's essentially taught me even
 

4613
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:38,950
i think it's essentially taught me even
if i'll never be

4614
01:30:38,950 --> 01:30:38,960
if i'll never be
 

4615
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:42,629
if i'll never be
a great classical performer that

4616
01:30:42,629 --> 01:30:42,639
a great classical performer that
 

4617
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:45,590
a great classical performer that
there is nothing one can't really teach

4618
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:45,600
there is nothing one can't really teach
 

4619
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,590
there is nothing one can't really teach
themself in this

4620
01:30:47,590 --> 01:30:47,600
themself in this
 

4621
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,750
themself in this
in this era so i've been i've been

in this era so i've been i've been
enjoying

01:30:55,590 --> 01:30:55,600
music the other thing i'll say
 

4629
01:30:55,600 --> 01:30:57,270
music the other thing i'll say
about it is that it's a it's a very

01:30:57,270 --> 01:30:57,280
about it is that it's a it's a very
 

4631
01:30:57,280 --> 01:30:58,870
about it is that it's a it's a very

01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:32,960
dopamine loops and so you don't really
 

4663
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:34,070

need to motive

motivate yourself with music because you
 

4667
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:37,750
motivate yourself with music because you
know like you're giving your

rigorous process of practice so is there

4722
01:32:34,790 --> 01:32:34,800
rigorous process of practice so is there
 

4723
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,629
rigorous process of practice so is there
something about my dopamine loops for

4724
01:32:36,629 --> 01:32:36,639
something about my dopamine loops for
 

4725
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:37,350
something about my dopamine loops for
example

4726
01:32:37,350 --> 01:32:37,360
example
 

4727
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:39,110

01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:39,120
that enjoys doing the same thing over
 

4729
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,870
that enjoys doing the same thing over

myself
 

4733
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,550
myself
improve i think that's because

4734
01:32:44,550 --> 01:32:44,560
improve i think that's because
 

4735
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:47,830
improve i think that's because
music is more effective at accessing us

4736
01:32:47,830 --> 01:32:47,840
music is more effective at accessing us
 

4737
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:48,709
music is more effective at accessing us
when it's played

4738
01:32:48,709 --> 01:32:48,719
when it's played
 

4739
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:51,910
when it's played
correctly and i think you play

4740
01:32:51,910 --> 01:32:51,920
correctly and i think you play
 

4741
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:53,990
correctly and i think you play
i'm positive that you play music much

4742
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:54,000
i'm positive that you play music much
 

4743
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:55,990
i'm positive that you play music much
more correctly than i do

4744
01:32:55,990 --> 01:32:56,000
more correctly than i do
 

4745
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,790
more correctly than i do
so if you are going to sit down and play

4746
01:32:58,790 --> 01:32:58,800
so if you are going to sit down and play
 

4747
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,470
so if you are going to sit down and play
something that you've learned

4748
01:33:00,470 --> 01:33:00,480
something that you've learned
 

4749
01:33:00,480 --> 01:33:03,350
something that you've learned
that piece will be much more satisfying

4750
01:33:03,350 --> 01:33:03,360
that piece will be much more satisfying
 

4751
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:05,189
that piece will be much more satisfying
to your ears and to your

4752
01:33:05,189 --> 01:33:05,199
to your ears and to your
 

4753
01:33:05,199 --> 01:33:07,669
to your ears and to your
brain than if i were to play that piece

4754
01:33:07,669 --> 01:33:07,679
brain than if i were to play that piece
 

4755
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:09,270
brain than if i were to play that piece
just sitting down within

4756
01:33:09,270 --> 01:33:09,280
just sitting down within
 

4757
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,790
just sitting down within
with an instrument uh but it's sort of a

4758
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:12,800
with an instrument uh but it's sort of a
 

4759
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:14,310
with an instrument uh but it's sort of a
trade-off with

4760
01:33:14,310 --> 01:33:14,320
trade-off with
 

4761
01:33:14,320 --> 01:33:17,830
trade-off with
freedom and and rigor

4762
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:17,840
freedom and and rigor
 

4763
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:21,270
freedom and and rigor
uh because even if i should be spending

4764
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:21,280
uh because even if i should be spending
 

4765
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:21,669
uh because even if i should be spending
more

4766
01:33:21,669 --> 01:33:21,679
more
 

4767
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:24,950
more
more of my time practicing rigorously i

4768
01:33:24,950 --> 01:33:24,960
more of my time practicing rigorously i
 

4769
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,790
more of my time practicing rigorously i
know i don't have to to make me

the saying

4774
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:31,199
the saying
 

4775
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:34,470
the saying
uh the discipline is freedom so maybe uh

4776
01:33:34,470 --> 01:33:34,480
uh the discipline is freedom so maybe uh
 

4777
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:36,070
uh the discipline is freedom so maybe uh
maybe the repetition

4778
01:33:36,070 --> 01:33:36,080
maybe the repetition
 

4779
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:39,590
maybe the repetition
of uh the disciplined repetition

4780
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:39,600
of uh the disciplined repetition
 

4781
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:41,910
of uh the disciplined repetition
is actually one of the mechanisms of

4782
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:41,920
is actually one of the mechanisms of
 

4783
01:33:41,920 --> 01:33:42,870
is actually one of the mechanisms of
achieving freedom

4784
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:42,880
achieving freedom
 

4785
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:45,510
achieving freedom
it's another way to get to freedom that

4786
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:45,520
it's another way to get to freedom that
 

4787
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,590
it's another way to get to freedom that
it doesn't have to be a constraint

4788
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:47,600
it doesn't have to be a constraint
 

4789
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,189
it doesn't have to be a constraint
but in in a sense unlocks greater sets

4790
01:33:51,189 --> 01:33:51,199
but in in a sense unlocks greater sets
 

4791
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,629
but in in a sense unlocks greater sets
of opportunity

4792
01:33:52,629 --> 01:33:52,639
of opportunity
 

4793
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:55,590
of opportunity
than results in a deeper experience of

4794
01:33:55,590 --> 01:33:55,600
than results in a deeper experience of
 

4795
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:56,229
than results in a deeper experience of
freedom

4796
01:33:56,229 --> 01:33:56,239
freedom
 

4797
01:33:56,239 --> 01:33:58,070
freedom
maybe i mean particularly if you're

4798
01:33:58,070 --> 01:33:58,080
maybe i mean particularly if you're
 

4799
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,229
maybe i mean particularly if you're
thinking about uh

4800
01:34:00,229 --> 01:34:00,239
thinking about uh
 

4801
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:04,470
thinking about uh
discipline and uh

4802
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:04,480
discipline and uh
 

4803
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:07,750
discipline and uh
method for improvisation right

4804
01:34:07,750 --> 01:34:07,760
method for improvisation right
 

4805
01:34:07,760 --> 01:34:09,189
method for improvisation right
there are a million pieces that you

4806
01:34:09,189 --> 01:34:09,199
there are a million pieces that you
 

4807
01:34:09,199 --> 01:34:11,990
there are a million pieces that you
could improvise with the same

4808
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:12,000
could improvise with the same
 

4809
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,790
could improvise with the same
discipline and how to approach that

4810
01:34:14,790 --> 01:34:14,800
discipline and how to approach that
 

4811
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,149
discipline and how to approach that
improvisation

4812
01:34:16,149 --> 01:34:16,159
improvisation
 

4813
01:34:16,159 --> 01:34:19,270
improvisation
so i think

4814
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:19,280
so i think
 

4815
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:22,629
so i think
i think that's it's true that discipline

4816
01:34:22,629 --> 01:34:22,639
i think that's it's true that discipline
 

4817
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:26,229
i think that's it's true that discipline
promotes freedom if you uh

4818
01:34:26,229 --> 01:34:26,239
promotes freedom if you uh
 

4819
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:29,430
promotes freedom if you uh
insert a layer of of indirection because

4820
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:29,440
insert a layer of of indirection because
 

4821
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:31,990
insert a layer of of indirection because
i think i think if you're if you're

4822
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:32,000
i think i think if you're if you're
 

4823
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,350
i think i think if you're if you're
trying to learn one piece that was

4824
01:34:33,350 --> 01:34:33,360
trying to learn one piece that was
 

4825
01:34:33,360 --> 01:34:35,350
trying to learn one piece that was
written 400 years ago

4826

written 400 years ago
 

4827
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,669
written 400 years ago
um and you're playing it over and over

4828
01:34:37,669 --> 01:34:37,679
um and you're playing it over and over
 

4829

01:37:01,679 --> 01:37:05,430
important
force i think already we're important as

4936
01:37:05,430 --> 01:37:05,440
force i think already we're important as
 

4937
01:37:05,440 --> 01:37:07,430
force i think already we're important as
a demographic to particular markets but

4938
01:37:07,430 --> 01:37:07,440
a demographic to particular markets but
 

4939
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,149
a demographic to particular markets but
i

4940
01:37:08,149 --> 01:37:08,159
i
 

4941
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:09,590
i
i should hope that our voices will

4942
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:09,600
i should hope that our voices will
 

4943
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,189
i should hope that our voices will
matter as well uh

4944
01:37:11,189 --> 01:37:11,199
matter as well uh
 

4945
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:14,310
matter as well uh
starting very soon so

4946
01:37:14,310 --> 01:37:14,320
starting very soon so
 

4947
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:16,070
starting very soon so
i would i would try to think about that

4948
01:37:16,070 --> 01:37:16,080
i would i would try to think about that
 

4949
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:18,470
i would i would try to think about that
that would be my advice

4950
01:37:18,470 --> 01:37:18,480
that would be my advice
 

4951
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,709
that would be my advice
do you uh it's a silly question to ask

4952
01:37:20,709 --> 01:37:20,719
do you uh it's a silly question to ask
 

4953
01:37:20,719 --> 01:37:21,590
do you uh it's a silly question to ask
perhaps

4954
01:37:21,590 --> 01:37:21,600
perhaps
 

4955
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,030
perhaps
but um and a bit of a russian one

4956
01:37:25,030 --> 01:37:25,040
but um and a bit of a russian one
 

4957
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:28,229
but um and a bit of a russian one
it's silly because you're young but

4958
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:28,239
it's silly because you're young but
 

4959
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,310
it's silly because you're young but
i don't think it's actually silly

4960
01:37:30,310 --> 01:37:30,320
i don't think it's actually silly
 

4961
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,669
i don't think it's actually silly
because you're young

4962
01:37:31,669 --> 01:37:31,679
because you're young
 

4963
01:37:31,679 --> 01:37:35,669
because you're young
do you ponder your mortality and

4964
01:37:35,669 --> 01:37:35,679
do you ponder your mortality and
 

4965
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:40,070
do you ponder your mortality and
are you just afraid of death in general

4966
01:37:40,070 --> 01:37:40,080
are you just afraid of death in general
 

4967
01:37:40,080 --> 01:37:44,870
are you just afraid of death in general
so tying us back to our

4968
01:37:44,870 --> 01:37:44,880
so tying us back to our
 

4969
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,830
so tying us back to our
previous conversations about abstraction

4970
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:47,840
previous conversations about abstraction
 

4971
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,189
previous conversations about abstraction
versus

4972
01:37:49,189 --> 01:37:49,199
versus
 

4973
01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:53,430
versus
uh experience

4974
01:37:53,430 --> 01:37:53,440
uh experience
 

4975
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:56,229
uh experience
which is determining our our notions of

4976
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:56,239
which is determining our our notions of
 

4977
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:56,629
which is determining our our notions of
our

4978
01:37:56,629 --> 01:37:56,639
our
 

4979
01:37:56,639 --> 01:37:59,750
our
life and our our world death

4980
01:37:59,750 --> 01:37:59,760
life and our our world death
 

4981
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,350
life and our our world death
is interesting in that it is

4982
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:03,360
is interesting in that it is
 

4983
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:06,950
is interesting in that it is
obviously hyper important to a person's

4984
01:38:06,950 --> 01:38:06,960
obviously hyper important to a person's
 

4985
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,470
obviously hyper important to a person's
life and it is something that for the

4986
01:38:08,470 --> 01:38:08,480
life and it is something that for the
 

4987
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:10,390
life and it is something that for the
most part no human will really

4988
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:10,400
most part no human will really
 

4989
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,350
most part no human will really
experience

4990
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:11,360
experience
 

4991
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:15,590
experience
and be able to um to reflect upon

4992
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:15,600
and be able to um to reflect upon
 

4993
01:38:15,600 --> 01:38:19,109
and be able to um to reflect upon
so our notions of death

4994
01:38:19,109 --> 01:38:19,119
so our notions of death
 

4995
01:38:19,119 --> 01:38:21,109
so our notions of death
are sort of proof that if we want to

4996
01:38:21,109 --> 01:38:21,119
are sort of proof that if we want to
 

4997
01:38:21,119 --> 01:38:22,709
are sort of proof that if we want to
make the most of our lives

4998
01:38:22,709 --> 01:38:22,719
make the most of our lives
 

4999
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:26,870
make the most of our lives
we have to think abstractly and

5000
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:26,880
we have to think abstractly and
 

5001
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,750
we have to think abstractly and
relying not at all at times on

5002
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:31,760
relying not at all at times on
 

5003
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:34,870
relying not at all at times on
experiential

5004
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:34,880

 

5005
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:37,910

thought and understandings because

5006
01:38:37,910 --> 01:38:37,920
thought and understandings because
 

5007
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:40,709
thought and understandings because
we can't really experience death and

5008
01:38:40,709 --> 01:38:40,719
we can't really experience death and
 

5009
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,550
we can't really experience death and
reflect upon it hence and use it to

5010
01:38:42,550 --> 01:38:42,560
reflect upon it hence and use it to
 

5011
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,430
reflect upon it hence and use it to
motivate us

5012
01:38:43,430 --> 01:38:43,440
motivate us
 

5013
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:44,790
motivate us
it has to remain some sort of

5014
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:44,800
it has to remain some sort of
 

5015
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:47,430
it has to remain some sort of
abstraction and i think

5016
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:47,440
abstraction and i think
 

5017
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:50,870
abstraction and i think
if we have trouble comprehending

5018
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:50,880
if we have trouble comprehending
 

5019
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:54,310
if we have trouble comprehending
uh true abstraction we tend to view our

5020
01:38:54,310 --> 01:38:54,320
uh true abstraction we tend to view our
 

5021
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:54,950
uh true abstraction we tend to view our
lives

5022
01:38:54,950 --> 01:38:54,960
lives
 

5023
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:57,189
lives
as you know we tend to view ourselves as

5024
01:38:57,189 --> 01:38:57,199
as you know we tend to view ourselves as
 

5025
01:38:57,199 --> 01:38:58,310
as you know we tend to view ourselves as
nearly immortal

5026
01:38:58,310 --> 01:38:58,320
nearly immortal
 

5027
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,790
nearly immortal
and i think that's very dangerous so

5028
01:39:02,790 --> 01:39:02,800

 

5029
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:05,590

one concrete implication for my belief

5030
01:39:05,590 --> 01:39:05,600
one concrete implication for my belief
 

5031
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,950
one concrete implication for my belief
in abstraction

5032
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:06,960
in abstraction
 

5033
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,709
in abstraction
would be that we all need to be aware

5034
01:39:10,709 --> 01:39:10,719
would be that we all need to be aware
 

5035
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:14,629
would be that we all need to be aware
of our our own deaths

5036
01:39:14,629 --> 01:39:14,639
of our our own deaths
 

5037
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,470
of our our own deaths
and we need to we need to understand

5038
01:39:18,470 --> 01:39:18,480
and we need to we need to understand
 

5039
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,350
and we need to we need to understand
concretely the the boundaries of our

5040
01:39:21,350 --> 01:39:21,360
concretely the the boundaries of our
 

5041
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:22,629
concretely the the boundaries of our
lifetimes

5042
01:39:22,629 --> 01:39:22,639
lifetimes
 

5043
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:26,070
lifetimes
and no amount of experience can really

5044
01:39:26,070 --> 01:39:26,080
and no amount of experience can really
 

5045
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,629
and no amount of experience can really
motivate that it has to be driven by

5046
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:28,639
motivate that it has to be driven by
 

5047
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:29,510
motivate that it has to be driven by
thought and

5048
01:39:29,510 --> 01:39:29,520
thought and
 

5049
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:32,229
thought and
abstraction in theory that's one of the

5050
01:39:32,229 --> 01:39:32,239
abstraction in theory that's one of the
 

5051
01:39:32,239 --> 01:39:34,390
abstraction in theory that's one of the
deepest

5052
01:39:34,390 --> 01:39:34,400
deepest
 

5053
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:36,149
deepest
elements of what it means to be human is

5054
01:39:36,149 --> 01:39:36,159
elements of what it means to be human is
 

5055
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:38,070
elements of what it means to be human is
our ability to form abstractions about

5056
01:39:38,070 --> 01:39:38,080
our ability to form abstractions about
 

5057
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:39,430
our ability to form abstractions about
our mortality

5058
01:39:39,430 --> 01:39:39,440
our mortality
 

5059
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,830
our mortality
versus animals i think there's just

5060
01:39:41,830 --> 01:39:41,840
versus animals i think there's just
 

5061
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:44,470
versus animals i think there's just
something really fundamental

5062
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:44,480
something really fundamental
 

5063
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,030
something really fundamental
about our interaction with the

5064
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:47,040
about our interaction with the
 

5065
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:48,390
about our interaction with the
abstractions of

5066
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:48,400
abstractions of
 

5067
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,430
abstractions of
death and uh you know there's a lot of

5068
01:39:51,430 --> 01:39:51,440
death and uh you know there's a lot of
 

5069
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,430
death and uh you know there's a lot of
philosophers

5070
01:39:53,430 --> 01:39:53,440
philosophers
 

5071
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:56,709
philosophers
uh that say that that's actually

5072
01:39:56,709 --> 01:39:56,719
uh that say that that's actually
 

5073
01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:00,629
uh that say that that's actually
core to everything we create in this

5074
01:40:00,629 --> 01:40:00,639
core to everything we create in this
 

5075
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:01,830
core to everything we create in this
world

5076
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:01,840
world
 

5077
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:04,390
world
which is like us struggling with this

5078
01:40:04,390 --> 01:40:04,400
which is like us struggling with this
 

5079
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,830
which is like us struggling with this
impossible to

5080
01:40:06,830 --> 01:40:06,840
impossible to
 

5081
01:40:06,840 --> 01:40:10,870
impossible to
understand idea of mortality

5082
01:40:10,870 --> 01:40:10,880
understand idea of mortality
 

5083
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:13,430
understand idea of mortality
and i mean i'm i'm drawn to this idea

5084
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
and i mean i'm i'm drawn to this idea
 

5085
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,709
and i mean i'm i'm drawn to this idea
because um

5086
01:40:14,709 --> 01:40:14,719
because um
 

5087
01:40:14,719 --> 01:40:17,830
because um
both the the mystery of it but also just

5088
01:40:17,830 --> 01:40:17,840
both the the mystery of it but also just
 

5089
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:19,669
both the the mystery of it but also just
from the human experience perspective

5090
01:40:19,669 --> 01:40:19,679
from the human experience perspective
 

5091
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,229
from the human experience perspective
it seems that you get a lot of meaning

5092
01:40:22,229 --> 01:40:22,239
it seems that you get a lot of meaning
 

5093
01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:23,030
it seems that you get a lot of meaning
from

5094
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:23,040
from
 

5095
01:40:23,040 --> 01:40:26,550
from
stuff ending it's kind of sad the flip

5096
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:26,560
stuff ending it's kind of sad the flip
 

5097
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:28,709
stuff ending it's kind of sad the flip
side of that to think that

5098
01:40:28,709 --> 01:40:28,719
side of that to think that
 

5099
01:40:28,719 --> 01:40:30,950
side of that to think that
stuff won't be as meaningful if it

5100
01:40:30,950 --> 01:40:30,960
stuff won't be as meaningful if it
 

5101
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:33,109
stuff won't be as meaningful if it
doesn't end if it's not finite

5102
01:40:33,109 --> 01:40:33,119
doesn't end if it's not finite
 

5103
01:40:33,119 --> 01:40:36,229
doesn't end if it's not finite
it seems like resources gain value from

5104
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:36,239
it seems like resources gain value from
 

5105
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:38,229
it seems like resources gain value from
being finite

5106
01:40:38,229 --> 01:40:38,239
being finite
 

5107
01:40:38,239 --> 01:40:41,109
being finite
and that's true for time that's true for

5108
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:41,119
and that's true for time that's true for
 

5109
01:40:41,119 --> 01:40:43,030
and that's true for time that's true for
the deliciousness of ice cream that's

5110
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:43,040
the deliciousness of ice cream that's
 

5111
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:44,070
the deliciousness of ice cream that's
true for love

5112
01:40:44,070 --> 01:40:44,080
true for love
 

5113
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,350
true for love
for everything from music and so on

5114
01:40:47,350 --> 01:40:47,360
for everything from music and so on
 

5115
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:50,629
for everything from music and so on
and uh yeah it's uh it seems

5116
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:50,639
and uh yeah it's uh it seems
 

5117
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,910
and uh yeah it's uh it seems
deeply human to to try to

5118
01:40:53,910 --> 01:40:53,920
deeply human to to try to
 

5119
01:40:53,920 --> 01:40:56,629
deeply human to to try to
uh as you said concretize the

5120
01:40:56,629 --> 01:40:56,639
uh as you said concretize the
 

5121
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:58,470
uh as you said concretize the
abstractions of mortality even though we

5122
01:40:58,470 --> 01:40:58,480
abstractions of mortality even though we
 

5123
01:40:58,480 --> 01:40:59,510
abstractions of mortality even though we
can never truly

5124
01:40:59,510 --> 01:40:59,520
can never truly
 

5125
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,510
can never truly
experience it because that's the whole

5126
01:41:01,510 --> 01:41:01,520
experience it because that's the whole
 

5127
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,430
experience it because that's the whole
point of it once it ends you can't

5128
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:03,440
point of it once it ends you can't
 

5129
01:41:03,440 --> 01:41:03,990
point of it once it ends you can't
experience

5130
01:41:03,990 --> 01:41:04,000
experience
 

5131
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,430
experience
it yeah again another ridiculous

5132
01:41:07,430 --> 01:41:07,440
it yeah again another ridiculous
 

5133
01:41:07,440 --> 01:41:10,790
it yeah again another ridiculous
question okay

5134
01:41:10,790 --> 01:41:10,800

 

5135
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:12,149

what do you think is the meaning of it

5136
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:12,159
what do you think is the meaning of it
 

5137

deep thinking about this world is there
 

5143
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:22,310
deep thinking about this world is there
a good way to answer

5144
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:22,320
a good way to answer
 

5145
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,390
a good way to answer
any of the why questions about this

5146
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:24,400
any of the why questions about this
 

5147
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,629
any of the why questions about this
existence here on earth

5148
01:41:26,629 --> 01:41:26,639
existence here on earth
 

5149
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:28,310
existence here on earth
and as i said we're here in part by

5150
01:41:28,310 --> 01:41:28,320
and as i said we're here in part by
 

5151
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:30,149
and as i said we're here in part by
prince spawn in part by

5152
01:41:30,149 --> 01:41:30,159
prince spawn in part by
 

5153
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:33,590
prince spawn in part by
accident and a lot of the things which

5154
01:41:33,590 --> 01:41:33,600
accident and a lot of the things which
 

5155
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:37,189
accident and a lot of the things which
bring us joy uh are

5156
01:41:37,189 --> 01:41:37,199
bring us joy uh are
 

5157
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:39,510
bring us joy uh are
programmed to bring us joy to ensure our

5158
01:41:39,510 --> 01:41:39,520
programmed to bring us joy to ensure our
 

5159
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:41,109
programmed to bring us joy to ensure our
evolutionary

5160
01:41:41,109 --> 01:41:41,119
evolutionary
 

5161
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:46,790
evolutionary
success and so

5162
01:41:46,790 --> 01:41:46,800
success and so
 

5163
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:51,109
success and so
i would not necessarily consider uh

5164
01:41:51,109 --> 01:41:51,119
i would not necessarily consider uh
 

5165
01:41:51,119 --> 01:41:53,990
i would not necessarily consider uh
all of the things which bring us joy uh

5166
01:41:53,990 --> 01:41:54,000
all of the things which bring us joy uh
 

5167
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:54,950
all of the things which bring us joy uh
to be

5168
01:41:54,950 --> 01:41:54,960
to be
 

5169
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:58,070
to be
meaningful i think they

5170
01:41:58,070 --> 01:41:58,080
meaningful i think they
 

5171
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,510
meaningful i think they
they play a very uh a very obvious role

5172
01:42:01,510 --> 01:42:01,520
they play a very uh a very obvious role
 

5173
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,709
they play a very uh a very obvious role
in a clear pattern and we don't have

5174
01:42:04,709 --> 01:42:04,719
in a clear pattern and we don't have
 

5175
01:42:04,719 --> 01:42:06,149
in a clear pattern and we don't have
much choice in that

5176
01:42:06,149 --> 01:42:06,159
much choice in that
 

5177
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:09,590
much choice in that
i think that out rules the idea

5178
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
i think that out rules the idea
 

5179
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:13,030
i think that out rules the idea
of joy being the meaning of life

5180
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:13,040
of joy being the meaning of life
 

5181
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,109
of joy being the meaning of life
i think it's um i think it's a nice

5182
01:42:17,109 --> 01:42:17,119
i think it's um i think it's a nice
 

5183
01:42:17,119 --> 01:42:20,310
i think it's um i think it's a nice
it's a nice thing we get to have even if

5184
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:20,320
it's a nice thing we get to have even if
 

5185
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:22,390
it's a nice thing we get to have even if
it's not inherently meaningful

5186
01:42:22,390 --> 01:42:22,400
it's not inherently meaningful
 

5187
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:26,830
it's not inherently meaningful
i think the most

5188
01:42:26,830 --> 01:42:26,840
i think the most
 

5189
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:30,070
i think the most
uh the most wonderful

5190
01:42:30,070 --> 01:42:30,080
uh the most wonderful
 

5191
01:42:30,080 --> 01:42:32,709
uh the most wonderful
thing that we will ever that we have

5192
01:42:32,709 --> 01:42:32,719
thing that we will ever that we have
 

5193
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:33,830
thing that we will ever that we have
ever been

5194
01:42:33,830 --> 01:42:33,840
ever been
 

5195
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:37,590
ever been
given um has been

5196
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:37,600
given um has been
 

5197
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,510
given um has been
our ability to uh

5198
01:42:41,510 --> 01:42:41,520
our ability to uh
 

5199
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:44,950
our ability to uh
as i said observe observe what

5200
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:44,960
as i said observe observe what
 

5201
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:48,229
as i said observe observe what
transcends us as as humans and

5202
01:42:48,229 --> 01:42:48,239
transcends us as as humans and
 

5203
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:50,870
transcends us as as humans and
i think to live a meaningful life is to

5204
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:50,880
i think to live a meaningful life is to
 

5205
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,149
i think to live a meaningful life is to
see that

5206
01:42:52,149 --> 01:42:52,159
see that
 

5207
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:56,149
see that
and hopefully contribute to that so

5208
01:42:56,149 --> 01:42:56,159
and hopefully contribute to that so
 

5209
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,550
and hopefully contribute to that so
so to try to understand what makes us

5210
01:42:58,550 --> 01:42:58,560
so to try to understand what makes us
 

5211
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,189
so to try to understand what makes us
human to transcend that

5212
01:43:01,189 --> 01:43:01,199
human to transcend that
 

5213
01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:03,510
human to transcend that
and in some small way contribute to it

5214
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:03,520
and in some small way contribute to it
 

5215
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:04,470
and in some small way contribute to it
in the finite

5216
01:43:04,470 --> 01:43:04,480
in the finite
 

5217
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:08,830
in the finite
time we have here

5218
01:43:08,830 --> 01:43:08,840

 

5219
01:43:08,840 --> 01:43:13,270
