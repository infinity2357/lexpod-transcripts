radical markets and they and they had
 

189
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:23,570
radical markets and they and they had
economics so there the idea with radical

190
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:23,580
economics so there the idea with radical
 

191
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,950
economics so there the idea with radical
markets is like can you come

192
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:25,960
markets is like can you come
 

193
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,340
markets is like can you come
up with new market-based mechanisms -

194
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:31,350
up with new market-based mechanisms -
 

195
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:33,900
up with new market-based mechanisms -
you know I think we have this we're

196
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:33,910
you know I think we have this we're
 

197
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,909
you know I think we have this we're
having this debate right now like does

198
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:35,919
having this debate right now like does
 

199
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,330
having this debate right now like does
capitalism work like free markets work

200
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:39,340
capitalism work like free markets work
 

201
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,110
capitalism work like free markets work
can the incentive structures that are

202
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:43,120
can the incentive structures that are
 

203
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
can the incentive structures that are
built into these systems produce

204
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,130
built into these systems produce
 

205
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,249
built into these systems produce
outcomes that are creating sort of

206
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:49,259
outcomes that are creating sort of
 

207
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,020
outcomes that are creating sort of
equitably distributed benefits for every

208
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,030
equitably distributed benefits for every
 

209
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:55,830
equitably distributed benefits for every
member of society you know and I think

210
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
member of society you know and I think
 

211
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,629
member of society you know and I think
it's a reasonable reasonable set of

212
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:57,639
it's a reasonable reasonable set of
 

213
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,560
it's a reasonable reasonable set of
questions to be asking and so what Glenn

214
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,570
questions to be asking and so what Glenn
 

215
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,850
questions to be asking and so what Glenn
and so like you know one motor thought

216
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:02,860
and so like you know one motor thought
 

217
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,740
and so like you know one motor thought
they're like if you have doubts that the

218
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:04,750
they're like if you have doubts that the
 

219
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,510
they're like if you have doubts that the
that the markets are actually working

220
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,520
that the markets are actually working
 

221
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,490
that the markets are actually working
you can sort of like tip towards like

222
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:08,500
you can sort of like tip towards like
 

223
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,529
you can sort of like tip towards like
okay let's let's become more socialist

224
00:05:10,529 --> 00:05:10,539
okay let's let's become more socialist
 

225
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,779
okay let's let's become more socialist
and you know like have central planning

226
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:12,789
and you know like have central planning
 

227
00:05:12,789 --> 00:05:14,670
and you know like have central planning
and you know governments or some other

228
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:14,680
and you know governments or some other
 

229
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,499
and you know governments or some other
central organization it's like making a

230
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:16,509
central organization it's like making a
 

231
00:05:16,509 --> 00:05:19,620
central organization it's like making a
bunch of decisions about how you know

232
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:19,630
bunch of decisions about how you know
 

233
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,399
bunch of decisions about how you know
sort of work gets done and you know like

234
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:23,409
sort of work gets done and you know like
 

235
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,350
sort of work gets done and you know like
where the you know where the investments

236
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:25,360
where the you know where the investments
 

237
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,520
where the you know where the investments
and where the outputs of those

238
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:26,530
and where the outputs of those
 

239
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,159
and where the outputs of those
investments get distributed Glenn's

240
00:05:29,159 --> 00:05:29,169
investments get distributed Glenn's
 

241
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:34,439
investments get distributed Glenn's
notion is like lean more into like the

242
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:34,449
notion is like lean more into like the
 

243
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:36,330
notion is like lean more into like the
market-based mechanism so like for

244
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:36,340
market-based mechanism so like for
 

245
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,370
market-based mechanism so like for
instance you know this is one of the

246
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,380
instance you know this is one of the
 

247
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,930
instance you know this is one of the
more radical ideas like suppose that you

248
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:42,940
more radical ideas like suppose that you
 

249
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,360
more radical ideas like suppose that you
had a radical pricing mechanism for

250
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,370
had a radical pricing mechanism for
 

251
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,670
had a radical pricing mechanism for
assets like real estate where you were

252
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:49,680
assets like real estate where you were
 

253
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,129
assets like real estate where you were
you could be bid out of your position

254
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:53,139
you could be bid out of your position
 

255
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:58,200
you could be bid out of your position
and in in your home you know for

256
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,210
and in in your home you know for
 

257
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,149
and in in your home you know for
instance so like if somebody came along

258
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:00,159
instance so like if somebody came along
 

259
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,730
instance so like if somebody came along
and said you know like I've I can find

260
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:02,740
and said you know like I've I can find
 

261
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,040
and said you know like I've I can find
higher economic utility for this piece

262
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,050
higher economic utility for this piece
 

263
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:06,450
higher economic utility for this piece
of real estate that you're running your

264
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:06,460
of real estate that you're running your
 

265
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,760
of real estate that you're running your
your business and like then like you

266
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:11,770
your business and like then like you
 

267
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,999
your business and like then like you
either have to you know sort of bid to

268
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:15,009
either have to you know sort of bid to
 

269
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:17,580
either have to you know sort of bid to
sort of stay or like the thing that's

270
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:17,590
sort of stay or like the thing that's
 

271
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,159
sort of stay or like the thing that's
got the higher economic utility you know

272
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,169
got the higher economic utility you know
 

273
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:21,629
got the higher economic utility you know
sort of takes over the asset and which

274
00:06:21,629 --> 00:06:21,639
sort of takes over the asset and which
 

275
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,020
sort of takes over the asset and which
would make it very difficult to have the

276
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,030
would make it very difficult to have the
 

277
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,689
would make it very difficult to have the
same sort of rent seeking behaviors that

278
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:27,699
same sort of rent seeking behaviors that
 

279
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:31,709
same sort of rent seeking behaviors that
you've got right now because like if you

280
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:31,719
you've got right now because like if you
 

281
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:37,670
you've got right now because like if you
did speculative bidding like you would

282
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:37,680
did speculative bidding like you would
 

283
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,770
did speculative bidding like you would
you very quickly like lose a whole lot

284
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:39,780
you very quickly like lose a whole lot
 

285
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,780
you very quickly like lose a whole lot
of money and so like the prices of the

286
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:41,790
of money and so like the prices of the
 

287
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,180
of money and so like the prices of the
assets would be sort of like very

288
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,190
assets would be sort of like very
 

289
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,750
assets would be sort of like very
closely index to like the value that

290
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:47,760
closely index to like the value that
 

291
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,140
closely index to like the value that
they can produce and like because like

292
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,150
they can produce and like because like
 

293
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,370
they can produce and like because like
you'd have this sort of real-time

294
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:52,380
you'd have this sort of real-time
 

295
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,230
you'd have this sort of real-time
mechanism that would force you to sort

296
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,240
mechanism that would force you to sort
 

297
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,270
mechanism that would force you to sort
of mark the value of the asset to the

298
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:56,280
of mark the value of the asset to the
 

299
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,560
of mark the value of the asset to the
market then it could be taxed

300
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:57,570
market then it could be taxed
 

301
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:59,390
market then it could be taxed
appropriately like you couldn't sort of

302
00:06:59,390 --> 00:06:59,400
appropriately like you couldn't sort of
 

303
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,860
appropriately like you couldn't sort of
sit on this thing and say oh like this

304
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:00,870
sit on this thing and say oh like this
 

305
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,840
sit on this thing and say oh like this
house is only worth ten thousand bucks

306
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:02,850
house is only worth ten thousand bucks
 

307
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,580
house is only worth ten thousand bucks
when like everything around it is worth

308
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:04,590
when like everything around it is worth
 

309
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,740
when like everything around it is worth
ten million

310
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:05,750
ten million
 

311
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,300
ten million
let's finish so it's an incentive

312
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,310
let's finish so it's an incentive
 

313
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,120
let's finish so it's an incentive
structure that where the prices matched

314
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,130
structure that where the prices matched
 

315
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,550
structure that where the prices matched
the value much better yeah

316
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:13,560
the value much better yeah
 

317
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,350
the value much better yeah
so the Anglin does a much much better

318
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,360
so the Anglin does a much much better
 

319
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,180
so the Anglin does a much much better
job than I do at selling and I probably

320
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,190
job than I do at selling and I probably
 

321
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,070
job than I do at selling and I probably
picked the world's worst example you

322
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,080
picked the world's worst example you
 

323
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,730
picked the world's worst example you
know and and in but like in its it's

324
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:21,740
know and and in but like in its it's
 

325
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:24,710
know and and in but like in its it's
intentionally provocative you know so

326
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:24,720
intentionally provocative you know so
 

327
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,420
intentionally provocative you know so
like this whole notion like I you know

328
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:26,430
like this whole notion like I you know
 

329
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:28,310
like this whole notion like I you know
like I I'm not sure whether I like this

330
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:28,320
like I I'm not sure whether I like this
 

331
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,380
like I I'm not sure whether I like this
notion that like we could have a set of

332
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:30,390
notion that like we could have a set of
 

333
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,820
notion that like we could have a set of
market mechanisms where I could get bit

334
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:31,830
market mechanisms where I could get bit
 

335
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,460
market mechanisms where I could get bit
out of faith that was my property you

336
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:34,470
out of faith that was my property you
 

337
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:36,620
out of faith that was my property you
know but but you know like if you're

338
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:36,630
know but but you know like if you're
 

339
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:39,830
know but but you know like if you're
thinking about something like Elizabeth

340
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:39,840
thinking about something like Elizabeth
 

341
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,620
thinking about something like Elizabeth
Warren's wealth tax for instance like

342
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:42,630
Warren's wealth tax for instance like
 

343
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,780
Warren's wealth tax for instance like
you would have I mean you'd be really

344
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:44,790
you would have I mean you'd be really
 

345
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:46,550
you would have I mean you'd be really
interesting in like how you would

346
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:46,560
interesting in like how you would
 

347
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,030
interesting in like how you would
actually set the the price on the assets

348
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:50,040
actually set the the price on the assets
 

349
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,050
actually set the the price on the assets
and like you might have to have a

350
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:51,060
and like you might have to have a
 

351
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,670
and like you might have to have a
mechanism like that if you put a tax

352
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:52,680
mechanism like that if you put a tax
 

353
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,470
mechanism like that if you put a tax
like that in place it's really

354
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,480
like that in place it's really
 

355
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,910
like that in place it's really
interesting that that kind of research

356
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:55,920
interesting that that kind of research
 

357
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,010
interesting that that kind of research
at least tangentially is touching

358
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,020
at least tangentially is touching
 

359
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,200
at least tangentially is touching
Microsoft Research yeah

360
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,210
Microsoft Research yeah
 

361
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:02,510
Microsoft Research yeah
the years really thinking broadly that

362
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:02,520
the years really thinking broadly that
 

363
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,730
the years really thinking broadly that
maybe you can speak to this connects to

364
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:07,740
maybe you can speak to this connects to
 

365
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,860
maybe you can speak to this connects to
AI so we have a candidate Andrew yang

366
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:09,870
AI so we have a candidate Andrew yang
 

367
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:12,350
AI so we have a candidate Andrew yang
who kind of talks about artificial

368
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,360
who kind of talks about artificial
 

369
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,330
who kind of talks about artificial
intelligence and the concern that people

370
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:14,340
intelligence and the concern that people
 

371
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,150
intelligence and the concern that people
have about art you know automations

372
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:17,160
have about art you know automations
 

373
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,510
have about art you know automations
impact on society and arguably Microsoft

374
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:20,520
impact on society and arguably Microsoft
 

375
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,420
impact on society and arguably Microsoft
is at the cutting edge of innovation in

376
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:23,430
is at the cutting edge of innovation in
 

377
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,520
is at the cutting edge of innovation in
all these kinds of ways and so it's

378
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,530
all these kinds of ways and so it's
 

379
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,590
all these kinds of ways and so it's
pushing AI forward how do you think

380
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:27,600
pushing AI forward how do you think
 

381
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,930
pushing AI forward how do you think
about combining all our conversations

382
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:29,940
about combining all our conversations
 

383
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,790
about combining all our conversations
together here with radical markets and

384
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:31,800
together here with radical markets and
 

385
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,410
together here with radical markets and
socialism and innovation in a item that

386
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:36,420
socialism and innovation in a item that
 

387
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,330
socialism and innovation in a item that
Microsoft is doing and then Andrew

388
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:38,340
Microsoft is doing and then Andrew
 

389
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:43,850
Microsoft is doing and then Andrew
Yang's worried that that that will that

390
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:43,860
Yang's worried that that that will that
 

391
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,160
Yang's worried that that that will that
will result in job loss for the low and

392
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,170
will result in job loss for the low and
 

393
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,720
will result in job loss for the low and
so on how do you think about that I

394
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:47,730
so on how do you think about that I
 

395
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,550
so on how do you think about that I
think it's sort of one of the most

396
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:49,560
think it's sort of one of the most
 

397
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,630
think it's sort of one of the most
important

398
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:50,640
important
 

399
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,390
important
shins and Technology like maybe even in

400
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:53,400
shins and Technology like maybe even in
 

401
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,310
shins and Technology like maybe even in
society right now about how is AI going

402
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:58,320
society right now about how is AI going
 

403
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,950
society right now about how is AI going
to develop over the course of the next

404
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:00,960
to develop over the course of the next
 

405
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,660
to develop over the course of the next
several decades and like what's it going

406
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:02,670
several decades and like what's it going
 

407
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,270
several decades and like what's it going
to be used for and like what what

408
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:05,280
to be used for and like what what
 

409
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,770
to be used for and like what what
benefits will it produce and what

410
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:06,780
benefits will it produce and what
 

411
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,440
benefits will it produce and what
negative impacts will it produce and you

412
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:09,450
negative impacts will it produce and you
 

413
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,230
negative impacts will it produce and you
know how who gets to steer this whole

414
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,240
know how who gets to steer this whole
 

415
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,870
know how who gets to steer this whole
thing you know I'll say it at the

416
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:14,880
thing you know I'll say it at the
 

417
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,180
thing you know I'll say it at the
highest level one of the real joys of

418
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,190
highest level one of the real joys of
 

419
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,030
highest level one of the real joys of
getting to do what I do at Microsoft is

420
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,040
getting to do what I do at Microsoft is
 

421
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,610
getting to do what I do at Microsoft is
Microsoft has this heritage as a

422
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:25,620
Microsoft has this heritage as a
 

423
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,520
Microsoft has this heritage as a
platform company and so you know like

424
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:28,530
platform company and so you know like
 

425
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,430
platform company and so you know like
Bill Bill's has this thing that he said

426
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:31,440
Bill Bill's has this thing that he said
 

427
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,080
Bill Bill's has this thing that he said
a you know a bunch of years ago where

428
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,090
a you know a bunch of years ago where
 

429
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,480
a you know a bunch of years ago where
you know the the measure of a successful

430
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:35,490
you know the the measure of a successful
 

431
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,420
you know the the measure of a successful
platform is that it produces far more

432
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:38,430
platform is that it produces far more
 

433
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,610
platform is that it produces far more
economic value for the people who build

434
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:40,620
economic value for the people who build
 

435
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,220
economic value for the people who build
on top of the platform than is creative

436
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:43,230
on top of the platform than is creative
 

437
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,700
on top of the platform than is creative
for the the platform owner or builder

438
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:46,710
for the the platform owner or builder
 

439
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,340
for the the platform owner or builder
and I think we have to think about AI

440
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,350
and I think we have to think about AI
 

441
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,700
and I think we have to think about AI
that way like satellite form yeah it has

442
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:52,710
that way like satellite form yeah it has
 

443
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,800
that way like satellite form yeah it has
to like it has to be a platform that

444
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:54,810
to like it has to be a platform that
 

445
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:58,280
to like it has to be a platform that
other people can use to build businesses

446
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:58,290
other people can use to build businesses
 

447
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:01,430
other people can use to build businesses
to fulfill their creative objectives to

448
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:01,440
to fulfill their creative objectives to
 

449
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,040
to fulfill their creative objectives to
be entrepreneurs to solve problems that

450
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,050
be entrepreneurs to solve problems that
 

451
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,200
be entrepreneurs to solve problems that
they have in their work and in their

452
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:06,210
they have in their work and in their
 

453
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:09,980
they have in their work and in their
lives it can't be a thing where there

454
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:09,990
lives it can't be a thing where there
 

455
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,620
lives it can't be a thing where there
are a handful of companies sitting in a

456
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:12,630
are a handful of companies sitting in a
 

457
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:15,310
are a handful of companies sitting in a
very small handful of city cities

458
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:15,320
very small handful of city cities
 

459
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,110
very small handful of city cities
geographically who are making all the

460
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:18,120
geographically who are making all the
 

461
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,950
geographically who are making all the
decisions about what goes into the AIA

462
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:21,960
decisions about what goes into the AIA
 

463
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,700
decisions about what goes into the AIA
and and and like and then on top of like

464
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:25,710
and and and like and then on top of like
 

465
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,650
and and and like and then on top of like
all this infrastructure then build all

466
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:27,660
all this infrastructure then build all
 

467
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:30,650
all this infrastructure then build all
of the commercially valuable uses for it

468
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:30,660
of the commercially valuable uses for it
 

469
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,800
of the commercially valuable uses for it
so like I think like that's bad from a

470
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:33,810
so like I think like that's bad from a
 

471
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:36,620
so like I think like that's bad from a
you know sort of you know economics and

472
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:36,630
you know sort of you know economics and
 

473
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,900
you know sort of you know economics and
sort of equitable distribution of value

474
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:38,910
sort of equitable distribution of value
 

475
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,490
sort of equitable distribution of value
perspective like you know sort of back

476
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:40,500
perspective like you know sort of back
 

477
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,620
perspective like you know sort of back
to this whole notion of you know like do

478
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:42,630
to this whole notion of you know like do
 

479
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,110
to this whole notion of you know like do
the markets work but I think it's also

480
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:45,120
the markets work but I think it's also
 

481
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,940
the markets work but I think it's also
bad from an innovation perspective

482
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:46,950
bad from an innovation perspective
 

483
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,990
bad from an innovation perspective
because like I have infinite amounts of

484
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:51,000
because like I have infinite amounts of
 

485
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,690
because like I have infinite amounts of
faith in human beings that if you you

486
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:53,700
faith in human beings that if you you
 

487
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,940
faith in human beings that if you you
know give folks powerful tools they will

488
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:55,950
know give folks powerful tools they will
 

489
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,030
know give folks powerful tools they will
go do interesting things and it's more

490
00:10:59,030 --> 00:10:59,040
go do interesting things and it's more
 

491
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,850
go do interesting things and it's more
than just a few tens of thousands of

492
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:01,860
than just a few tens of thousands of
 

493
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,410
than just a few tens of thousands of
people with the interesting tools it

494
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:03,420
people with the interesting tools it
 

495
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,430
people with the interesting tools it
should be millions of

496
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
should be millions of
 

497
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,870
should be millions of
people with the tools so sort of like

498
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:05,880
people with the tools so sort of like
 

499
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,620
people with the tools so sort of like
you know you think about the the steam

500
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:09,630
you know you think about the the steam
 

501
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,740
you know you think about the the steam
engine and the late 18th century like it

502
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:12,750
engine and the late 18th century like it
 

503
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,810
engine and the late 18th century like it
was you know maybe the first large-scale

504
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:14,820
was you know maybe the first large-scale
 

505
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,030
was you know maybe the first large-scale
substitute for human labor that we've

506
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,040
substitute for human labor that we've
 

507
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,110
substitute for human labor that we've
built like a machine and you know in the

508
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,120
built like a machine and you know in the
 

509
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,670
built like a machine and you know in the
beginning when these things are getting

510
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:22,680
beginning when these things are getting
 

511
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,480
beginning when these things are getting
deployed the folks who got most of the

512
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,490
deployed the folks who got most of the
 

513
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,910
deployed the folks who got most of the
value from the steam engines were the

514
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:28,920
value from the steam engines were the
 

515
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,560
value from the steam engines were the
folks who had capital so they could

516
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:30,570
folks who had capital so they could
 

517
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,840
folks who had capital so they could
afford to build them and like they built

518
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,850
afford to build them and like they built
 

519
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:34,790
afford to build them and like they built
factories around them in businesses and

520
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:34,800
factories around them in businesses and
 

521
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,670
factories around them in businesses and
the experts who knew how to build and

522
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:37,680
the experts who knew how to build and
 

523
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,250
the experts who knew how to build and
maintain them but access to that

524
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:40,260
maintain them but access to that
 

525
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,010
maintain them but access to that
technology democratized over time like

526
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,020
technology democratized over time like
 

527
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,120
technology democratized over time like
now like like an engine is not a it's

528
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,130
now like like an engine is not a it's
 

529
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:48,920
now like like an engine is not a it's
not like a differentiated thing like

530
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:48,930
not like a differentiated thing like
 

531
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,360
not like a differentiated thing like
there isn't one engine company that

532
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:50,370
there isn't one engine company that
 

533
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,980
there isn't one engine company that
builds all the engines and all of the

534
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:51,990
builds all the engines and all of the
 

535
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:53,570
builds all the engines and all of the
things that use engines are made by this

536
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:53,580
things that use engines are made by this
 

537
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,100
things that use engines are made by this
company and like they get all the

538
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,110
company and like they get all the
 

539
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,800
company and like they get all the
economics from all of that like never

540
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:57,810
economics from all of that like never
 

541
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,510
economics from all of that like never
like fully democratize like they're

542
00:11:59,510 --> 00:11:59,520
like fully democratize like they're
 

543
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,190
like fully democratize like they're
probably you know we're sitting here in

544
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:01,200
probably you know we're sitting here in
 

545
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,050
probably you know we're sitting here in
this room and like even though they

546
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,060
this room and like even though they
 

547
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,090
this room and like even though they
don't that they're probably things you

548
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:05,100
don't that they're probably things you
 

549
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,030
don't that they're probably things you
know like the the MEMS gyroscope that

550
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:08,040
know like the the MEMS gyroscope that
 

551
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,380
know like the the MEMS gyroscope that
are in both of our float like there's

552
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,390
are in both of our float like there's
 

553
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,690
are in both of our float like there's
like little engines you know sort of

554
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:11,700
like little engines you know sort of
 

555
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,480
like little engines you know sort of
everywhere they they're just a component

556
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,490
everywhere they they're just a component
 

557
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,370
everywhere they they're just a component
and how we build the modern world like

558
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:16,380
and how we build the modern world like
 

559
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,650
and how we build the modern world like
AI DS to get there yeah so that's a

560
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:18,660
AI DS to get there yeah so that's a
 

561
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,660
AI DS to get there yeah so that's a
really powerful way to think if we think

562
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:20,670
really powerful way to think if we think
 

563
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:25,250
really powerful way to think if we think
of AI is a platform versus a tool that

564
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,260
of AI is a platform versus a tool that
 

565
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,680
of AI is a platform versus a tool that
Microsoft owns as a platform that

566
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:27,690
Microsoft owns as a platform that
 

567
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,840
Microsoft owns as a platform that
enables creation yeah on top of it

568
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:29,850
enables creation yeah on top of it
 

569
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,730
enables creation yeah on top of it
that's a way to democratize it that's

570
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:31,740
that's a way to democratize it that's
 

571
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
that's a way to democratize it that's
really absolutely interesting actually

572
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:33,750
really absolutely interesting actually
 

573
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,410
really absolutely interesting actually
and Microsoft in its history has been

574
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:36,420
and Microsoft in its history has been
 

575
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,750
and Microsoft in its history has been
positioned well to do that and the you

576
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:38,760
positioned well to do that and the you
 

577
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,940
positioned well to do that and the you
know the tie back to the to this radical

578
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:40,950
know the tie back to the to this radical
 

579
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,110
know the tie back to the to this radical
markets thing like the so my team has

580
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:45,120
markets thing like the so my team has
 

581
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,220
markets thing like the so my team has
been working with Glenn on this and

582
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,230
been working with Glenn on this and
 

583
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,740
been working with Glenn on this and
Jaron Lanier actually did just so Jaron

584
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:51,750
Jaron Lanier actually did just so Jaron
 

585
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,710
Jaron Lanier actually did just so Jaron
is the like the sort of father of

586
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:54,720
is the like the sort of father of
 

587
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,829
is the like the sort of father of
virtual reality like he's one of the

588
00:12:57,829 --> 00:12:57,839
virtual reality like he's one of the
 

589
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,690
virtual reality like he's one of the
most interesting human beings on the

590
00:12:59,690 --> 00:12:59,700
most interesting human beings on the
 

591
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:03,440
most interesting human beings on the
planet like a sweet sweet guy and so

592
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,450
planet like a sweet sweet guy and so
 

593
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:07,190
planet like a sweet sweet guy and so
Jaron and Glen and folks in my team have

594
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:07,200
Jaron and Glen and folks in my team have
 

595
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,620
Jaron and Glen and folks in my team have
been working on this notion of data as

596
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:09,630
been working on this notion of data as
 

597
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,590
been working on this notion of data as
labor or like they call it data dignity

598
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:12,600
labor or like they call it data dignity
 

599
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,860
labor or like they call it data dignity
as well and so the the idea is that if

600
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:15,870
as well and so the the idea is that if
 

601
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,010
as well and so the the idea is that if
you you know again going back to this

602
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:18,020
you you know again going back to this
 

603
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,560
you you know again going back to this
you know sort of industrial analogy if

604
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:20,570
you know sort of industrial analogy if
 

605
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:23,170
you know sort of industrial analogy if
you think about data is the raw material

606
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,180
you think about data is the raw material
 

607
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,670
you think about data is the raw material
that is consumed by the machine of AI in

608
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:27,680
that is consumed by the machine of AI in
 

609
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,420
that is consumed by the machine of AI in
order to do useful things then like

610
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:31,430
order to do useful things then like
 

611
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,820
order to do useful things then like
we're not doing a really great job right

612
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:33,830
we're not doing a really great job right
 

613
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,760
we're not doing a really great job right
now and having transparent marketplaces

614
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:36,770
now and having transparent marketplaces
 

615
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:39,880
now and having transparent marketplaces

what value you're getting in return like

638
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:00,620
what value you're getting in return like
 

639
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,280
what value you're getting in return like
service is free you know like it's low

640
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,290
service is free you know like it's low
 

641
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,990
service is free you know like it's low
amount of like procedure and then you've

642
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:05,000
amount of like procedure and then you've
 

643
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,760
amount of like procedure and then you've
got all this indirect contribution that

644
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:06,770
got all this indirect contribution that
 

645
00:14:06,770 --> 00:14:08,079
got all this indirect contribution that
you're making just by virtue of

646
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:08,089
you're making just by virtue of
 

647
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:09,910
you're making just by virtue of
interacting with all of the technology

648
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:09,920
interacting with all of the technology
 

649
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,380
interacting with all of the technology
that's in your daily life and so like

650
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,390
that's in your daily life and so like
 

651
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,079
that's in your daily life and so like
what Glen and Jaron and and this data

652
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:17,089
what Glen and Jaron and and this data
 

653
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:19,120
what Glen and Jaron and and this data
Dignity team are trying to do is like

654
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,130
Dignity team are trying to do is like
 

655
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,760
Dignity team are trying to do is like
can we figure out a set of mechanisms

656
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:21,770
can we figure out a set of mechanisms
 

657
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:24,310
can we figure out a set of mechanisms
that let us value those data

658
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:24,320
that let us value those data
 

659
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,980
that let us value those data
contributions so that you could create

660
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:26,990
contributions so that you could create
 

661
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,769
contributions so that you could create
an economy and like a set of controls

662
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:29,779
an economy and like a set of controls
 

663
00:14:29,779 --> 00:14:33,060
an economy and like a set of controls
and incentives that would allow people

664
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,070
and incentives that would allow people
 

665
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,000
and incentives that would allow people
to like maybe even in the limit like

666
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,010
to like maybe even in the limit like
 

667
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,550
to like maybe even in the limit like
earn part of their living through the

data that they're creating and like you
 

671
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,610
data that they're creating and like you
can sort of see it in explicit ways

672
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:42,620
can sort of see it in explicit ways
 

673
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:45,670
can sort of see it in explicit ways
they're these companies like scale AI

674
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:45,680
they're these companies like scale AI
 

675
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
they're these companies like scale AI
and like they're a whole bunch of them

676
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:47,450
and like they're a whole bunch of them
 

677
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,680
and like they're a whole bunch of them
in in China right now that are basically

678
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:50,690
in in China right now that are basically
 

679
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,050
in in China right now that are basically
data labeling companies so like you

680
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:53,060
data labeling companies so like you
 

681
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,250
data labeling companies so like you
you're doing supervised machine learning

682
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:54,260
you're doing supervised machine learning
 

683
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,470
you're doing supervised machine learning
you need you need lots and lots of label

684
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:56,480
you need you need lots and lots of label
 

685
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,530
you need you need lots and lots of label
training data and like those people are

686
00:14:59,530 --> 00:14:59,540
training data and like those people are
 

687
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
training data and like those people are
getting competent like who worked for

688
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:01,550
getting competent like who worked for
 

689
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:03,130
getting competent like who worked for
those companies are getting compensated

690
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,140
those companies are getting compensated
 

691
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,319
those companies are getting compensated
for their data contributions into the

692
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:05,329
for their data contributions into the
 

693
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:08,769
for their data contributions into the
system and so that's easier to put a

694
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:08,779
system and so that's easier to put a
 

695
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,329
system and so that's easier to put a
number on their contribution because

696
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:10,339
number on their contribution because
 

697
00:15:10,339 --> 00:15:11,949
number on their contribution because
they're explicitly labeling they're

698
00:15:11,949 --> 00:15:11,959
they're explicitly labeling they're
 

699
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:13,389
they're explicitly labeling they're
correct but you're saying that we're all

700
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:13,399
correct but you're saying that we're all
 

701
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,100
correct but you're saying that we're all
contributing data in all kinds of ways

702
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,110
contributing data in all kinds of ways
 

703
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:18,210
contributing data in all kinds of ways
and it's fascinating to start to

704
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:18,220
and it's fascinating to start to
 

705
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,980
and it's fascinating to start to
explicitly try to put a number on it do

706
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:20,990
explicitly try to put a number on it do
 

707
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:22,630
explicitly try to put a number on it do
you think that's you that's possible I

708
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:22,640
you think that's you that's possible I
 

709
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,870
you think that's you that's possible I
don't know it's hard it really is

710
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:24,880
don't know it's hard it really is
 

711
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,949
don't know it's hard it really is
because you know we don't have as much

712
00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:29,959
because you know we don't have as much
 

713
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:32,020
because you know we don't have as much
transparency as

714
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,030
transparency as
 

715
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:36,010
transparency as
is I think we need in like how the data

716
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:36,020
is I think we need in like how the data
 

717
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,110
is I think we need in like how the data
is getting used and it's you know super

718
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:38,120
is getting used and it's you know super
 

719
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,960
is getting used and it's you know super
complicated like you know we we you know

720
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:40,970
complicated like you know we we you know
 

721
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,160
complicated like you know we we you know
I think it's technologists sort of

722
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,170
I think it's technologists sort of
 

723
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,840
I think it's technologists sort of
appreciate like some of the subtlety

724
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:43,850
appreciate like some of the subtlety
 

725
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,480
appreciate like some of the subtlety
there it's like you know the data the

726
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:46,490
there it's like you know the data the
 

727
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,910
there it's like you know the data the
data gets created and then it gets you

728
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:48,920
data gets created and then it gets you
 

729
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,440
data gets created and then it gets you
know it's not valuable like the the data

730
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:53,450
know it's not valuable like the the data
 

731
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:56,860
know it's not valuable like the the data
exhaust that you give off or the you

732
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:56,870
exhaust that you give off or the you
 

733
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,220
exhaust that you give off or the you
know the explicit data that I am putting

734
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:00,230
know the explicit data that I am putting
 

735
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,980
know the explicit data that I am putting
into the system isn't value valuable

736
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:02,990
into the system isn't value valuable
 

737
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,770
into the system isn't value valuable
it's super valuable atomically like it's

738
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:05,780
it's super valuable atomically like it's
 

739
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,600
it's super valuable atomically like it's
only valuable when you sort of aggregate

740
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:07,610
only valuable when you sort of aggregate
 

741
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:10,060
only valuable when you sort of aggregate
it together and you know sort of large

742
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,070
it together and you know sort of large
 

743
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,620
it together and you know sort of large
numbers it's true even for these like

744
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:11,630
numbers it's true even for these like
 

745
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,690
numbers it's true even for these like
folks who are getting compensated for

746
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:13,700
folks who are getting compensated for
 

747
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,640
folks who are getting compensated for
like labeling things like for supervised

748
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:15,650
like labeling things like for supervised
 

749
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,710
like labeling things like for supervised
machine learning now like you need lots

750
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:17,720
machine learning now like you need lots
 

751
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,380
machine learning now like you need lots
of labels to train a you know a model

752
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:20,390
of labels to train a you know a model
 

753
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,990
of labels to train a you know a model
that performs well and so you know I

754
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,000
that performs well and so you know I
 

755
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,580
that performs well and so you know I
think that's one of the challenges it's

756
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:24,590
think that's one of the challenges it's
 

757
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,740
think that's one of the challenges it's
like how do you you know how do you sort

758
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:26,750
like how do you you know how do you sort
 

759
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,840
like how do you you know how do you sort
of figure out like because this data is

760
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:28,850
of figure out like because this data is
 

761
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,660
of figure out like because this data is
getting combined in so many ways like

762
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:31,670
getting combined in so many ways like
 

763
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,270
getting combined in so many ways like
through these combinations like how the

764
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,280
through these combinations like how the
 

765
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,910
through these combinations like how the
value is flowing yeah that's that's

766
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:36,920
value is flowing yeah that's that's
 

767
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,610
value is flowing yeah that's that's
that's tough yeah and it's fascinating

768
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:39,620
that's tough yeah and it's fascinating
 

769
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,190
that's tough yeah and it's fascinating
that you're thinking about this and I

770
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:42,200
that you're thinking about this and I
 

771
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,690
that you're thinking about this and I
wish I wasn't even going to this

772
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:43,700
wish I wasn't even going to this
 

773
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,870
wish I wasn't even going to this

basically about democratizing access to
 

819
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,990
basically about democratizing access to
this new personal computing technology

820
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:50,000
this new personal computing technology
 

821
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,320
this new personal computing technology
which when Bill started the company

822
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,330
which when Bill started the company
 

823
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,789
which when Bill started the company
integrated circuit micro processors were

824
00:17:54,789 --> 00:17:54,799
integrated circuit micro processors were
 

825
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,480
integrated circuit micro processors were
a brand-new thing and like people were

826
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,490
a brand-new thing and like people were
 

827
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:02,529
a brand-new thing and like people were
building you know homebrew computers you

828
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:02,539
building you know homebrew computers you
 

829
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,810
building you know homebrew computers you
know from kits like the way people build

830
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:04,820
know from kits like the way people build
 

831
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,100
know from kits like the way people build
ham radios right now yeah and I think

832
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:09,110
ham radios right now yeah and I think
 

833
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,570
ham radios right now yeah and I think
this is sort of the interesting thing

Bill saw the opportunity there and what
 

839
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,060

personal computers could do and it was
 

841
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,769
personal computers could do and it was
like it was sort of a reach like you

842

like it was sort of a reach like you
 

843
00:18:20,779 --> 00:18:22,180
like it was sort of a reach like you
just sort of imagined like where things

844
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:22,190
just sort of imagined like where things
 

845
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:24,430
just sort of imagined like where things
were you know when they started the

platform it just sort of vanishes into
 

853
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,779
platform it just sort of vanishes into
the platform you don't pay attention to

854

the platform you don't pay attention to
 

855
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,879
the platform you don't pay attention to
it anymore like operating systems aren't

00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:33,889
it anymore like operating systems aren't
 

857
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:36,310
it anymore like operating systems aren't
a thing anymore like they're super

a thing anymore like they're super
 

859
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
a thing anymore like they're super
important like completely critical and

waiting for you know the next operating
 

871
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,250
waiting for you know the next operating
system thing in the same way that you

872
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:51,260
system thing in the same way that you
 

873
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,769
system thing in the same way that you
were in 1995 right that's like in 1995

874
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:53,779
were in 1995 right that's like in 1995

success is that it's sort of it becomes
 

893
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:14,019
success is that it's sort of it becomes
ubiquitous it's like everywhere and like

894
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:14,029
ubiquitous it's like everywhere and like
 

895
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:15,639
ubiquitous it's like everywhere and like
human beings when their technology

896

human beings when their technology
 

897
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,139
human beings when their technology
becomes ubiquitous they just sort of

898
00:19:17,139 --> 00:19:17,149
becomes ubiquitous they just sort of
 

899
00:19:17,149 --> 00:19:18,940
becomes ubiquitous they just sort of
start taking it for granted so the

900
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:18,950

the way that we do it now is is
 

917
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:47,680
the way that we do it now is is
different it's like we have a hyper

918

sort of very particular thing and like
 

951
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,380
sort of very particular thing and like
now like we live in this world where

952
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:29,390
now like we live in this world where
 

953
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:32,220
now like we live in this world where
technology is so powerful and it's like

954
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:32,230
technology is so powerful and it's like
 

955
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:37,660
technology is so powerful and it's like
such a basic fact of life that it you

956
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:37,670
such a basic fact of life that it you
 

957
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:40,420
such a basic fact of life that it you
know that it it both exist and is going

958
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:40,430
know that it it both exist and is going
 

959
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,880
know that it it both exist and is going
to get better and better over time or at

960
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:42,890
to get better and better over time or at
 

961
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,150
to get better and better over time or at
least more and more powerful over time

962
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,160
least more and more powerful over time
 

963
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,320
least more and more powerful over time
so like you know what you have to do is

964
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:47,330
so like you know what you have to do is
 

965
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:49,360
so like you know what you have to do is
a platform player is just much bigger

966
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:49,370
a platform player is just much bigger
 

967
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,730
a platform player is just much bigger
right there's so many directions in

968
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:51,740
right there's so many directions in
 

969
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,380
right there's so many directions in
which you can transform you didn't

970
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:53,390
which you can transform you didn't
 

971
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,360
which you can transform you didn't
mention mixed reality yeah you know

972
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:55,370
mention mixed reality yeah you know
 

973
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:57,850
mention mixed reality yeah you know
that's yep that's that's probably early

974
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:57,860
that's yep that's that's probably early
 

975
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,760
that's yep that's that's probably early
days or depends how you think of it but

976
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:00,770
days or depends how you think of it but
 

977
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,290
days or depends how you think of it but
if we think on a scale of centuries just

978
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:02,300
if we think on a scale of centuries just
 

979
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,820
if we think on a scale of centuries just
the early days of mixed reality

980
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:03,830
the early days of mixed reality
 

981
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,410
the early days of mixed reality
oh for sure and so yeah with hololens

982
00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:07,420
oh for sure and so yeah with hololens
 

983
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,490
oh for sure and so yeah with hololens
the Microsoft is doing some really

984
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:09,500
the Microsoft is doing some really
 

985
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,820
the Microsoft is doing some really
interesting work there do you touch that

986
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:11,830
interesting work there do you touch that
 

987
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:14,260
interesting work there do you touch that
part of the effort what's the thinking

988
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:14,270
part of the effort what's the thinking
 

989
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,600
part of the effort what's the thinking
do you think of mixed reality as a

990
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:16,610
do you think of mixed reality as a
 

991
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,820
do you think of mixed reality as a
platform to know sure when we look at

992
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:18,830
platform to know sure when we look at
 

993
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,410
platform to know sure when we look at
what the platform's of the future could

994
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:20,420
what the platform's of the future could
 

995
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,810
what the platform's of the future could
be so like fairly obvious that like AI

996
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:22,820
be so like fairly obvious that like AI
 

997
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,480
be so like fairly obvious that like AI
is one like you don't have to I mean

998
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:25,490
is one like you don't have to I mean
 

999
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,760
is one like you don't have to I mean
like that's you know you sort of say it

1000
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:27,770
like that's you know you sort of say it
 

1001
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:30,670
like that's you know you sort of say it
like someone and you know like they get

1002
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:30,680
like someone and you know like they get
 

1003
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:34,630
like someone and you know like they get
it but like we also think of the like

1004
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:34,640
it but like we also think of the like
 

1005
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,780
it but like we also think of the like
mixed reality and quantum is like these

1006
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:37,790
mixed reality and quantum is like these
 

1007
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:40,650
mixed reality and quantum is like these
two interesting you know potential

1008
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:40,660
two interesting you know potential
 

1009
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,870
two interesting you know potential
computing yeah okay so let's get crazy

1010
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:43,880
computing yeah okay so let's get crazy
 

1011
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,110
computing yeah okay so let's get crazy
then so so you're talking about some

1012
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,120
then so so you're talking about some
 

1013
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,760
then so so you're talking about some
futuristic things here

1014
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:48,770
futuristic things here
 

1015
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,530
futuristic things here
well the mixed reality Microsoft is

1016
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:50,540
well the mixed reality Microsoft is
 

1017
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,060
well the mixed reality Microsoft is
really it's not even feature a stick is

1018
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:52,070
really it's not even feature a stick is
 

1019
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:54,220
really it's not even feature a stick is
here it is incredible stuff and it in

1020
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,230
here it is incredible stuff and it in
 

1021
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,600
here it is incredible stuff and it in
look and it's heaven and it's having

1022
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:55,610
look and it's heaven and it's having
 

1023
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:57,640
look and it's heaven and it's having
impact right now like one of the one of

1024
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:57,650
impact right now like one of the one of
 

1025
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,780
impact right now like one of the one of
the more interesting things this

1026
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:58,790
the more interesting things this
 

1027
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,450
the more interesting things this
happened with NYX reality over the past

1028
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:00,460
happened with NYX reality over the past
 

1029
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:03,400
happened with NYX reality over the past
couple of years that I didn't clearly

1030
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:03,410
couple of years that I didn't clearly
 

1031
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:07,510
couple of years that I didn't clearly
see is that it's become the computing

1032
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:07,520
see is that it's become the computing
 

1033
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,760
see is that it's become the computing
device for for folks who for doing their

1034
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:12,770
device for for folks who for doing their
 

1035
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:15,100
device for for folks who for doing their
work who haven't used any computing

1036
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,110
work who haven't used any computing
 

1037
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,980
work who haven't used any computing
device at all to do their work before so

1038
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:16,990
device at all to do their work before so
 

1039
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:21,430
device at all to do their work before so
technicians and service folks and people

1040
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:21,440
technicians and service folks and people
 

1041
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,680
technicians and service folks and people
who are doing like machine maintenance

1042
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:23,690
who are doing like machine maintenance
 

1043
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:26,770
who are doing like machine maintenance
some factory floors so like they you

1044
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:26,780
some factory floors so like they you
 

1045
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,990
some factory floors so like they you
know but because they're mobile and like

1046
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:29,000
know but because they're mobile and like
 

1047
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,940
know but because they're mobile and like
they're out in the world and they're

1048
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:30,950
they're out in the world and they're
 

1049
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,830
they're out in the world and they're
working with their hands and you know

1050
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:32,840
working with their hands and you know
 

1051
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,450
working with their hands and you know
sort of servicing these like very

1052
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:34,460
sort of servicing these like very
 

1053
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,750
sort of servicing these like very
complicated things they're they don't

1054
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:37,760
complicated things they're they don't
 

1055
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,820
complicated things they're they don't
use their mobile phone and like they

1056
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:39,830
use their mobile phone and like they
 

1057
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:41,860
use their mobile phone and like they
don't carry a laptop with them and you

1058
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:41,870
don't carry a laptop with them and you
 

1059
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,600
don't carry a laptop with them and you
know they're not tethered to a desk and

1060
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:43,610
know they're not tethered to a desk and
 

1061
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,750
know they're not tethered to a desk and
so mixed reality like where it's getting

1062
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:46,760
so mixed reality like where it's getting
 

1063
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,400
so mixed reality like where it's getting
traction right now where hololens is

1064
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,410
traction right now where hololens is
 

1065
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,880
traction right now where hololens is
selling a lot of a lot of units is for

1066
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:51,890
selling a lot of a lot of units is for
 

1067
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:54,190
selling a lot of a lot of units is for
these sorts of applications for these

1068
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:54,200
these sorts of applications for these
 

1069
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,840
these sorts of applications for these
workers and it's become like I mean like

1070
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:55,850
workers and it's become like I mean like
 

1071
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:58,480
workers and it's become like I mean like
the people love it they're like oh my

1072
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:58,490
the people love it they're like oh my
 

1073
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,420
the people love it they're like oh my
god like this is like for them like the

1074
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,430
god like this is like for them like the
 

1075
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,370
god like this is like for them like the
same sort of productivity boost that you

1076
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:03,380
same sort of productivity boost that you
 

1077
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,830
same sort of productivity boost that you
know like an office worker had when they

1078
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:05,840
know like an office worker had when they
 

1079
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,380
know like an office worker had when they
got their first personal computer yeah

1080
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:08,390
got their first personal computer yeah
 

1081
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,900
got their first personal computer yeah
but you did mention it's really obvious

1082
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:10,910
but you did mention it's really obvious
 

1083
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,260
but you did mention it's really obvious
AI as a platform but can we dig into it

1084
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:14,270
AI as a platform but can we dig into it
 

1085
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,990
AI as a platform but can we dig into it
a little bit red how does a I begin to

1086
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,000
a little bit red how does a I begin to
 

1087
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,210
a little bit red how does a I begin to
infuse some of the products in Microsoft

1088
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:19,220
infuse some of the products in Microsoft
 

1089
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:24,700
infuse some of the products in Microsoft

works yep well how do you think of AI

1102
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:41,510
works yep well how do you think of AI
 

1103
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:44,590
works yep well how do you think of AI
infusing the as a platform that

1104

designing a community around then you

1264
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:23,570
designing a community around then you
 

1265
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,289
designing a community around then you
don't have as many dimensions to your

1266
00:27:26,289 --> 00:27:26,299
don't have as many dimensions to your
 

1267
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:30,340
don't have as many dimensions to your
sort of content safety problem as you

1268
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:30,350
sort of content safety problem as you
 

1269
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,369
sort of content safety problem as you
know as you do in a general purpose I

1270
00:27:33,369 --> 00:27:33,379
know as you do in a general purpose I
 

1271
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:37,899
know as you do in a general purpose I
mean so like on on LinkedIn like the

1272
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:37,909

like that is I mean in like in some ways

1294
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:09,710
like that is I mean in like in some ways
 

1295
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,859
like that is I mean in like in some ways
like that's very very broad but in other

1296
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:11,869
like that's very very broad but in other
 

1297
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:14,080
like that's very very broad but in other
ways it's sort of you know it's narrow

1298
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:14,090
ways it's sort of you know it's narrow
 

1299
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,190
ways it's sort of you know it's narrow
and so like you can build a eyes

1300
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
and so like you can build a eyes
 

1301
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,240
and so like you can build a eyes
like machine learning systems that are

1302
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,250
like machine learning systems that are
 

1303
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,129
like machine learning systems that are
you know capable with those boundaries

1304
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:25,139
you know capable with those boundaries
 

1305
00:28:25,139 --> 00:28:27,889
you know capable with those boundaries
of making better automated decisions

1306
00:28:27,889 --> 00:28:27,899
of making better automated decisions
 

1307
00:28:27,899 --> 00:28:30,049
of making better automated decisions
about like what is you know sort of

1308
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:30,059
about like what is you know sort of
 

1309
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:31,820

when you have some constraints you know
 

1315
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:41,180
when you have some constraints you know
same thing with the same thing with like

1316

the gaming gaming social network
sufferance it's like it's about playing

00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:02,460
happen and yeah I but I think it's it's
 

1335
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,070
happen and yeah I but I think it's it's
sort of a tough problem in general it's

1336
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
sort of a tough problem in general it's
 

1337
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,480
sort of a tough problem in general it's
one where I think you know eventually

1338
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:05,490
one where I think you know eventually
 

1339
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:10,120
one where I think you know eventually
we're gonna have to have some sort of

1340
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:10,130
we're gonna have to have some sort of
 

1341
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:13,549
we're gonna have to have some sort of
clarification from our policymakers

1342
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:13,559
clarification from our policymakers
 

1343
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:17,120
clarification from our policymakers
about what it is that we should be doing

1344

about what it is that we should be doing
 

1345
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,430
about what it is that we should be doing
like where the lines are because it's

00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:31,190
sort of democratic involvement like
people should have a say in like where

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:31,200
people should have a say in like where
 

1355
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,970
people should have a say in like where
where the lines lines are drawn like you

where the lines lines are drawn like you
 

1357
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,810
where the lines lines are drawn like you
don't want a bunch of people making like

1358
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:37,820
don't want a bunch of people making like
 

1359
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,730
don't want a bunch of people making like
unilateral decisions and like we are in

1360
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:40,740
unilateral decisions and like we are in
 

1361
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,580
unilateral decisions and like we are in
a we're in a state right now for some of

1362
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:43,590
a we're in a state right now for some of
 

1363
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,840
a we're in a state right now for some of
these platforms where you actually do

1364
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:44,850
these platforms where you actually do
 

1365
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,340
these platforms where you actually do
have to make unilateral decisions where

1366
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:46,350
have to make unilateral decisions where
 

1367
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,690
have to make unilateral decisions where
the policy-making isn't gonna happen

1368
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:47,700
the policy-making isn't gonna happen
 

1369
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,210
the policy-making isn't gonna happen
fast enough in order to like prevent

1370
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:50,220
fast enough in order to like prevent
 

1371
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,879
fast enough in order to like prevent
very bad things from happening but like

1372
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:52,889
very bad things from happening but like
 

1373
00:29:52,889 --> 00:29:55,070
very bad things from happening but like
we need the policy-making side of that

1374
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,080
we need the policy-making side of that
 

1375
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,830
we need the policy-making side of that
to catch up I think is as quickly as

1376
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:57,840
to catch up I think is as quickly as
 

1377
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,080
to catch up I think is as quickly as
possible because you want that whole

1378
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,090
possible because you want that whole
 

1379
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:02,379
possible because you want that whole
process to be a democratic thing not a

1380
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:02,389
process to be a democratic thing not a
 

1381
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,639
process to be a democratic thing not a
you know not not some sort of weird

1382
00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:04,649
you know not not some sort of weird
 

1383
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,950
you know not not some sort of weird
thing where you've got a non

1384
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:06,960
thing where you've got a non
 

1385
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,570
thing where you've got a non
representative group of people making

1386
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:08,580
representative group of people making
 

1387
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,580
representative group of people making
decisions that have you know like

1388
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:10,590
decisions that have you know like
 

1389
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,560
decisions that have you know like
national and global impact as

1390
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:12,570
national and global impact as
 

1391
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:14,810
national and global impact as
fascinating because the digital space is

1392
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:14,820
fascinating because the digital space is
 

1393
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,600
fascinating because the digital space is
different than the physical space and

1394
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:17,610
different than the physical space and
 

1395
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:18,950
different than the physical space and
which nations and governments were

1396
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:18,960
which nations and governments were
 

1397
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,769
which nations and governments were
established and so what policy looks

1398
00:30:21,769 --> 00:30:21,779
established and so what policy looks
 

1399
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:25,070
established and so what policy looks
like globally what bullying looks like

1400
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:25,080
like globally what bullying looks like
 

1401
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,139
like globally what bullying looks like
globally what healthy communication

1402
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:27,149
globally what healthy communication
 

1403
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:28,940
globally what healthy communication
looks like global is there's open

1404
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:28,950
looks like global is there's open
 

1405
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,190
looks like global is there's open
question and we're offering and freaking

1406
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:31,200
question and we're offering and freaking
 

1407
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:31,710
question and we're offering and freaking
it out

1408
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:31,720
it out
 

1409
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,669
it out
yeah I mean with you know sort of fake

1410
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:35,679
yeah I mean with you know sort of fake
 

1411
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,629
yeah I mean with you know sort of fake
news for instance and deep fakes and

1412
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:39,639

fake news generated by humans yeah so

1414
00:30:43,019 --> 00:30:43,029
fake news generated by humans yeah so
 

1415
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:44,789
fake news generated by humans yeah so
even we can talk about defects like I

1416
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:44,799
even we can talk about defects like I
 

1417
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,350
even we can talk about defects like I
think that is another like you know sort

1418
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:46,360
think that is another like you know sort
 

1419
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,210
think that is another like you know sort
of very interesting level of complexity

1420
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:48,220
of very interesting level of complexity
 

1421
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,830
of very interesting level of complexity
but like if you think about just the

1422
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:49,840
but like if you think about just the
 

1423
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,159
but like if you think about just the
written word right like we have you know

1424
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:53,169
written word right like we have you know
 

1425
00:30:53,169 --> 00:30:54,960
written word right like we have you know
we invented papyrus what's three

1426
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:54,970
we invented papyrus what's three
 

1427
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,820
we invented papyrus what's three
thousand years ago where we you know you

1428
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:56,830
thousand years ago where we you know you
 

1429
00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:00,389
thousand years ago where we you know you
could sort of put put word on on paper

1430
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,399
could sort of put put word on on paper
 

1431
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,159
could sort of put put word on on paper
and then five hundred years ago like we

1432
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:05,169
and then five hundred years ago like we
 

1433
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,039
and then five hundred years ago like we
we get the printing press like where the

1434
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:08,049
we get the printing press like where the
 

1435
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,129
we get the printing press like where the
word gets a little bit more ubiquitous

1436
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:11,139
word gets a little bit more ubiquitous
 

1437
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:13,860
word gets a little bit more ubiquitous
and then like you really really didn't

1438
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:13,870
and then like you really really didn't
 

1439
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:16,799
and then like you really really didn't
get ubiquitous printed word until the

1440
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:16,809
get ubiquitous printed word until the
 

1441
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,960
get ubiquitous printed word until the
end of the nineteenth century when the

1442
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:18,970
end of the nineteenth century when the
 

1443
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:21,210
end of the nineteenth century when the
offset press was invented and then you

1444
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:21,220
offset press was invented and then you
 

1445
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,860
offset press was invented and then you
know just sort of explodes and like you

1446
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:22,870
know just sort of explodes and like you
 

1447
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:26,129
know just sort of explodes and like you
know the cross-product of that and the

1448
00:31:26,129 --> 00:31:26,139
know the cross-product of that and the
 

1449
00:31:26,139 --> 00:31:30,119
know the cross-product of that and the
industrial revolutions need for educated

1450
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:30,129
industrial revolutions need for educated
 

1451
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:33,600
industrial revolutions need for educated
citizens resulted in like this rapid

1452
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:33,610
citizens resulted in like this rapid
 

1453
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:35,249
citizens resulted in like this rapid
expansion of literacy and the rapid

1454
00:31:35,249 --> 00:31:35,259
expansion of literacy and the rapid
 

1455
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,480
expansion of literacy and the rapid
expansion of the word but like we had

1456
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:36,490
expansion of the word but like we had
 

1457
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,840
expansion of the word but like we had
three thousand years up to that point to

1458
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:39,850
three thousand years up to that point to
 

1459
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,409
three thousand years up to that point to
figure out like how to you know like

1460
00:31:43,409 --> 00:31:43,419
figure out like how to you know like
 

1461
00:31:43,419 --> 00:31:45,330
figure out like how to you know like
what's what's journalism what's

1462
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:45,340
what's what's journalism what's
 

1463
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,940
what's what's journalism what's
editorial integrity like what's you know

1464
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:47,950
editorial integrity like what's you know
 

1465
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,430
editorial integrity like what's you know
what's scientific peer review and so

1466
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:50,440
what's scientific peer review and so
 

1467
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,950
what's scientific peer review and so
like he built all of this mechanism to

1468
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:52,960
like he built all of this mechanism to
 

1469
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,259
like he built all of this mechanism to
like try to filter through all of the

1470
00:31:55,259 --> 00:31:55,269
like try to filter through all of the
 

1471
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:59,669
like try to filter through all of the
noise that the technology made possible

1472
00:31:59,669 --> 00:31:59,679
noise that the technology made possible
 

1473
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,200
noise that the technology made possible
to like you know sort of getting to

1474
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,210
to like you know sort of getting to
 

1475
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,119
to like you know sort of getting to
something that society could cope with

1476
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:03,129
something that society could cope with
 

1477
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,149
something that society could cope with
and like if you think about just the

1478
00:32:06,149 --> 00:32:06,159
and like if you think about just the
 

1479
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,610
and like if you think about just the
piece the PC didn't exist fifty years

1480
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:08,620
piece the PC didn't exist fifty years
 

1481
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,730
piece the PC didn't exist fifty years
ago and so in like this span of you know

1482
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:11,740
ago and so in like this span of you know
 

1483
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,119
ago and so in like this span of you know
like half a century like we've gone from

1484
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:14,129
like half a century like we've gone from
 

1485
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:17,129
like half a century like we've gone from
no digital you know no ubiquitous

no digital you know no ubiquitous
digital technology to like having a

1488
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:19,299
digital technology to like having a
 

1489
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:21,240
digital technology to like having a
device that sits in your pocket where

1490
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:21,250
device that sits in your pocket where
 

1491
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,129
device that sits in your pocket where
you can sort of say whatever is on your

1492
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:23,139
you can sort of say whatever is on your
 

1493
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:26,820
you can sort of say whatever is on your
mind to like what would it Mary Heaven

1494
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:26,830
mind to like what would it Mary Heaven
 

1495
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,320
mind to like what would it Mary Heaven
or mary meeker just released her new

1496
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,330
or mary meeker just released her new
 

1497
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:32,970
or mary meeker just released her new
like slide deck last week you know we've

1498
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:32,980
like slide deck last week you know we've
 

1499
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,119
like slide deck last week you know we've
got 50 percent penetration of the the

1500
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:36,129
got 50 percent penetration of the the
 

1501
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:38,580
got 50 percent penetration of the the
internet to the global population like

1502
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:38,590
internet to the global population like
 

1503
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,690
internet to the global population like
they're like three and a half billion

1504
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:39,700
they're like three and a half billion
 

1505
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,909
they're like three and a half billion
people who are connected now it's it's

1506
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:41,919
people who are connected now it's it's
 

1507
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,950
people who are connected now it's it's
like it's crazy crazy croelick

1508
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:43,960
like it's crazy crazy croelick
 

1509
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,460
like it's crazy crazy croelick
inconceivable like how

1510
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,470
inconceivable like how
 

1511
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:47,860
inconceivable like how
all of this happens so you know it's not

1512
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:47,870
all of this happens so you know it's not
 

1513
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,419
all of this happens so you know it's not
surprising that we haven't figured out

1514
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:49,429
surprising that we haven't figured out
 

1515
00:32:49,429 --> 00:32:52,240
surprising that we haven't figured out
what to do yet but like I gotta like we

1516
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:52,250
what to do yet but like I gotta like we
 

1517
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:55,119
what to do yet but like I gotta like we
got a really like lean into this set of

1518
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,129
got a really like lean into this set of
 

1519
00:32:55,129 --> 00:32:56,950
got a really like lean into this set of
problems because like we basically have

1520
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
problems because like we basically have
 

1521
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,639
problems because like we basically have
three millennia worth of work to do

1522
00:33:00,639 --> 00:33:00,649
three millennia worth of work to do
 

1523
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:02,649
three millennia worth of work to do
about how to deal with all of this and

1524
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:02,659
about how to deal with all of this and
 

1525
00:33:02,659 --> 00:33:05,139
about how to deal with all of this and
like probably what yeah amounts to the

1526
00:33:05,139 --> 00:33:05,149
like probably what yeah amounts to the
 

1527
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,990
like probably what yeah amounts to the
next decade worth of time so since were

1528
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,000
next decade worth of time so since were
 

1529
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,850
next decade worth of time so since were
on the topic of tough tough you know

1530
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:09,860
on the topic of tough tough you know
 

1531
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,570
on the topic of tough tough you know
tough challenging problems let's look at

1532
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:12,580
tough challenging problems let's look at
 

1533
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:15,340
tough challenging problems let's look at
more on the tooling side in AI that

1534
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:15,350
more on the tooling side in AI that
 

1535
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,389
more on the tooling side in AI that
Microsoft is looking at space

1536
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:16,399
Microsoft is looking at space
 

1537
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,509
Microsoft is looking at space
recognition software so there's there's

1538
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:19,519
recognition software so there's there's
 

1539
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:21,039
recognition software so there's there's
a lot of powerful positive use cases

1540
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:21,049
a lot of powerful positive use cases
 

1541
00:33:21,049 --> 00:33:23,289
a lot of powerful positive use cases
yeah for face recognition but there's

1542
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:23,299
yeah for face recognition but there's
 

1543
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:24,669
yeah for face recognition but there's
some negative ones and we're seeing

1544
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:24,679
some negative ones and we're seeing
 

1545
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:27,399
some negative ones and we're seeing
those in different governments in the

1546
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:27,409
those in different governments in the
 

1547
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,980
those in different governments in the
world so how do you how does Microsoft

1548
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:29,990
world so how do you how does Microsoft
 

1549
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,039
world so how do you how does Microsoft
think about the use of face recognition

1550
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:32,049
think about the use of face recognition
 

1551
00:33:32,049 --> 00:33:36,519
think about the use of face recognition
software as a platform in governments

1552
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:36,529
software as a platform in governments
 

1553
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:40,600
software as a platform in governments
and companies yeah how do we strike an

1554
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:40,610
and companies yeah how do we strike an
 

1555
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:43,389
and companies yeah how do we strike an
ethical balance here yeah I think we've

1556
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:43,399
ethical balance here yeah I think we've
 

1557
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,769
ethical balance here yeah I think we've
articulated a clear point of view so

1558
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:47,779
articulated a clear point of view so
 

1559
00:33:47,779 --> 00:33:51,970
articulated a clear point of view so

00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,430
know I think we believe that there are
certain uses to which face recognition

1570
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:03,440
certain uses to which face recognition
 

1571
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,100
certain uses to which face recognition
should not be put and we believe again

1572
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,110
should not be put and we believe again
 

1573
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,800
should not be put and we believe again
that there's a need for regulation there

1574
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:08,810
that there's a need for regulation there
 

1575
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:11,260
that there's a need for regulation there
like the the government should like

1576
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:11,270
like the the government should like
 

1577
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,300
like the the government should like
really come in and say that you know

1578
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:13,310
really come in and say that you know
 

1579
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:17,050
really come in and say that you know
this is this is where the lines are and

1580
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,060
this is this is where the lines are and
 

1581
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,180
this is this is where the lines are and
like we very much wanted to like

1582
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,190
like we very much wanted to like
 

1583
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,740
like we very much wanted to like
figuring out where the lines are should

1584
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:20,750
figuring out where the lines are should
 

1585
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,329
figuring out where the lines are should
be a democratic process but in the short

1586
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:22,339
be a democratic process but in the short
 

1587
00:34:22,339 --> 00:34:24,430
be a democratic process but in the short
term like we've drawn some lines where

1588
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:24,440
term like we've drawn some lines where
 

1589
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,839
term like we've drawn some lines where
you know we push back against uses of

1590
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:27,849
you know we push back against uses of
 

1591
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,329
you know we push back against uses of
face recognition technology you know

1592
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:31,339
face recognition technology you know
 

1593
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:33,099
face recognition technology you know
like this city of San Francisco for

1594
00:34:33,099 --> 00:34:33,109
like this city of San Francisco for
 

1595
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:35,589
like this city of San Francisco for
instance I think is completely outlawed

1596
00:34:35,589 --> 00:34:35,599
instance I think is completely outlawed
 

1597
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,740
instance I think is completely outlawed
any government agency from using face

1598
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:38,750
any government agency from using face
 

1599
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:42,819
any government agency from using face
recognition tech and like that may prove

1600
00:34:42,819 --> 00:34:42,829
recognition tech and like that may prove
 

1601
00:34:42,829 --> 00:34:47,079
recognition tech and like that may prove
to be a little bit overly broad but for

1602
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:47,089
to be a little bit overly broad but for
 

1603
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:49,000
to be a little bit overly broad but for
like certain law enforcement things like

1604
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,010
like certain law enforcement things like
 

1605
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,109
like certain law enforcement things like
you you really III would personally

1606
00:34:53,109 --> 00:34:53,119
you you really III would personally
 

1607
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,119
you you really III would personally
rather be overly sort of cautious in

1608
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:55,129
rather be overly sort of cautious in
 

1609
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:57,609
rather be overly sort of cautious in
terms of restricting use of it until

1610
00:34:57,609 --> 00:34:57,619
terms of restricting use of it until
 

1611
00:34:57,619 --> 00:34:59,050
terms of restricting use of it until
like we have you know

1612
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,060
like we have you know
 

1613
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,920
like we have you know
to find a reasonable democratically

1614
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:02,930
to find a reasonable democratically
 

1615
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:06,070
to find a reasonable democratically
determined regulatory framework for like

1616
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,080
determined regulatory framework for like
 

1617
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,740
determined regulatory framework for like
where we we could and should use it and

1618
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:08,750
where we we could and should use it and
 

1619
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:10,450
where we we could and should use it and
you know the the other thing there is

1620
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:10,460
you know the the other thing there is
 

1621
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:13,390
you know the the other thing there is
like we've got a bunch of research that

1622
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:13,400
like we've got a bunch of research that
 

1623
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,040
like we've got a bunch of research that
we're doing and a bunch of progress that

1624
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:15,050
we're doing and a bunch of progress that
 

1625
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:18,640
we're doing and a bunch of progress that
we've made on on bias there and like

1626
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:18,650
we've made on on bias there and like
 

1627
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,530
we've made on on bias there and like
there all sorts of like weird biases

1628
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,540
there all sorts of like weird biases
 

1629
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,440
there all sorts of like weird biases
that these models can have like all the

1630
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:23,450
that these models can have like all the
 

1631
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,390
that these models can have like all the
way from like the most noteworthy one

1632
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:25,400
way from like the most noteworthy one
 

1633
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,430
way from like the most noteworthy one
where you know you may have

1634
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:29,440

 

1635
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,350

underrepresented minorities who are like

1636
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:32,360
underrepresented minorities who are like
 

1637
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,060
underrepresented minorities who are like
underrepresented in the training data

1638
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:34,070
underrepresented in the training data
 

1639
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:37,750
underrepresented in the training data
and then you start learning like strange

1640
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:37,760
and then you start learning like strange
 

1641
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,320
and then you start learning like strange
things but like they're they're even you

1642
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:41,330
things but like they're they're even you
 

1643
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,420
things but like they're they're even you
know other weird things like we've I

1644
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:43,430
know other weird things like we've I
 

1645
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,120
know other weird things like we've I
think we've seen in the public research

1646
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,130
think we've seen in the public research
 

1647
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:48,760
think we've seen in the public research
like models can learn strange things

1648
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:48,770
like models can learn strange things
 

1649
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:53,440
like models can learn strange things
like all doctors or men for instance

1650
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:53,450
like all doctors or men for instance
 

1651
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,880
like all doctors or men for instance
just yeah i mean so like it really is a

1652
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:57,890
just yeah i mean so like it really is a
 

1653
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:02,650
just yeah i mean so like it really is a
thing where it's very important for

1654
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:02,660
thing where it's very important for
 

1655
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,750
thing where it's very important for
everybody who is working on these things

1656
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:04,760
everybody who is working on these things
 

1657
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,980
everybody who is working on these things
before they push publish they launch the

1658
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:08,990
before they push publish they launch the
 

1659
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,630
before they push publish they launch the
experiment they you know push the code

1660
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:12,640
experiment they you know push the code
 

1661
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,480
experiment they you know push the code
you know online or they even publish the

1662
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:16,490
you know online or they even publish the
 

1663
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,750
you know online or they even publish the
paper that they are at least starting to

1664
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:19,760
paper that they are at least starting to
 

1665
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,070
paper that they are at least starting to
think about what some of the potential

1666
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:23,080
think about what some of the potential
 

1667
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,570
think about what some of the potential
negative consequences are some of this

1668
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:25,580
negative consequences are some of this
 

1669
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,070
negative consequences are some of this
stuff i mean this is where you know like

1670
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:27,080
stuff i mean this is where you know like
 

1671
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,410
stuff i mean this is where you know like
the deep fake stuff I find very

1672
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:29,420
the deep fake stuff I find very
 

1673
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:35,740
the deep fake stuff I find very
worrisome just because there gonna be

1674
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:35,750
worrisome just because there gonna be
 

1675
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:41,050
worrisome just because there gonna be
some very good beneficial uses of like

1676
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:41,060
some very good beneficial uses of like
 

1677
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,840
some very good beneficial uses of like
Gann generated imagery and I and funny

1678
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:46,850
Gann generated imagery and I and funny
 

1679
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,700
Gann generated imagery and I and funny
enough like one of the places where it's

1680
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:48,710
enough like one of the places where it's
 

1681
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:52,240
enough like one of the places where it's
actually useful is we're using the

1682
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,250
actually useful is we're using the
 

1683
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:53,740
actually useful is we're using the
technology right now to generate

1684
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:53,750
technology right now to generate
 

1685
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,810
technology right now to generate
synthetic synthetic visual data for

1686
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:58,820
synthetic synthetic visual data for
 

1687
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,400
synthetic synthetic visual data for
training some of the face recognition

1688
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:00,410
training some of the face recognition
 

1689
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:03,580
training some of the face recognition
models to get rid of the bias right so

1690
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:03,590
models to get rid of the bias right so
 

1691
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,260
models to get rid of the bias right so
like that's one like super good use of

1692
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,270
like that's one like super good use of
 

1693
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:07,300
like that's one like super good use of
the tech but like

1694
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:07,310
the tech but like
 

1695
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,460
the tech but like
you know it's getting good enough now

1696
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:09,470
you know it's getting good enough now
 

1697
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,990
you know it's getting good enough now
where you know it's gonna sort of

1698
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:11,000
where you know it's gonna sort of
 

1699
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,140
where you know it's gonna sort of
challenge normal human beings ability to

1700
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:14,150
challenge normal human beings ability to
 

1701
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,910
challenge normal human beings ability to
like now you're just sort of say like

1702
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
like now you're just sort of say like
 

1703
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,480
like now you're just sort of say like
it's it's very expensive for someone to

1704
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:19,490
it's it's very expensive for someone to
 

1705
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:21,550
it's it's very expensive for someone to
fabricate a photorealistic

1706
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:21,560
fabricate a photorealistic
 

1707
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:25,540
fabricate a photorealistic
fake video and like ganzar gonna make it

1708
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:25,550
fake video and like ganzar gonna make it
 

1709
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,670
fake video and like ganzar gonna make it
fantastically cheap to fabricate a

1710
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:27,680
fantastically cheap to fabricate a
 

1711
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,750
fantastically cheap to fabricate a
photorealistic

1712
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:28,760
photorealistic
 

1713
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:32,020
photorealistic
fake video and so like what you assume

1714
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,030
fake video and so like what you assume
 

1715
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,960
fake video and so like what you assume
you can sort of trust as true versus

1716
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:34,970
you can sort of trust as true versus
 

1717
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,060
you can sort of trust as true versus
like be skeptical about is about to

1718
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,070
like be skeptical about is about to
 

1719
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,780
like be skeptical about is about to
change

1720
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:37,790
change
 

1721
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,580
change
yeah and like we're not ready for it I

1722
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:39,590
yeah and like we're not ready for it I
 

1723
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,590
yeah and like we're not ready for it I
don't think the nature of truth right

1724
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:41,600
don't think the nature of truth right
 

1725
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,890
don't think the nature of truth right
that's uh it's also exciting because I

1726
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:44,900
that's uh it's also exciting because I
 

1727
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,230
that's uh it's also exciting because I
think both you and I probably would

1728
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:47,240
think both you and I probably would
 

1729
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,050
think both you and I probably would
agree that the way to solve to take on

1730
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:50,060
agree that the way to solve to take on
 

1731
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:52,210
agree that the way to solve to take on
that challenge is with technology yeah

1732
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:52,220
that challenge is with technology yeah
 

1733
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,490
that challenge is with technology yeah
right there's probably going to be ideas

1734
00:37:54,490 --> 00:37:54,500
right there's probably going to be ideas
 

1735
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:58,240
right there's probably going to be ideas
of ways to verify which which kind of

1736
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:58,250
of ways to verify which which kind of
 

1737
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,130
of ways to verify which which kind of
video is legitimate which kind of is not

1738
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,140
video is legitimate which kind of is not
 

1739
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,370
video is legitimate which kind of is not
so to me that's an exciting possibility

1740
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:03,380
so to me that's an exciting possibility
 

1741
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,490
so to me that's an exciting possibility
most most likely for just the comedic

1742
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:06,500
most most likely for just the comedic
 

1743
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,190
most most likely for just the comedic
genius that the internet usually creates

1744
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:09,200
genius that the internet usually creates
 

1745
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,990
genius that the internet usually creates
with these kinds of videos yeah and

1746
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:11,000
with these kinds of videos yeah and
 

1747
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,660
with these kinds of videos yeah and
hopefully will not result in any serious

1748
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:13,670
hopefully will not result in any serious
 

1749
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:17,260
hopefully will not result in any serious
harm yeah and it could be you know like

1750
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:17,270
harm yeah and it could be you know like
 

1751
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:21,340
harm yeah and it could be you know like
I think we will have technology too that

1752
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:21,350
I think we will have technology too that
 

1753
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:23,470
I think we will have technology too that
may be able to detect whether or not

1754
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:23,480
may be able to detect whether or not
 

1755
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,550
may be able to detect whether or not
something's fake a real although yeah

1756
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:26,560
something's fake a real although yeah
 

1757
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,460
something's fake a real although yeah
the the fakes are pretty convincing even

1758
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:30,470
the the fakes are pretty convincing even
 

1759
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,740
the the fakes are pretty convincing even
like when you subject them to machine

1760
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:32,750
like when you subject them to machine
 

1761
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:36,280
like when you subject them to machine
scrutiny but you know that we we also

1762
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:36,290
scrutiny but you know that we we also
 

1763
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,530
scrutiny but you know that we we also
have these increasingly interesting

1764
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:38,540
have these increasingly interesting
 

1765
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,140
have these increasingly interesting
social networks you know that are under

1766
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:41,150
social networks you know that are under
 

1767
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,000
social networks you know that are under
fire right now

1768
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,010
fire right now
 

1769
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,000
fire right now
for some of the bad things that they do

1770
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,010
for some of the bad things that they do
 

1771
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,320
for some of the bad things that they do
like one of the things you could choose

1772
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,330
like one of the things you could choose
 

1773
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:50,230
like one of the things you could choose
to do with a social network is like you

1774
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:50,240
to do with a social network is like you
 

1775
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,580
to do with a social network is like you
could you could use crypto and the

1776
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:54,590
could you could use crypto and the
 

1777
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,400
could you could use crypto and the
networks to like have content signed

1778
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,410
networks to like have content signed
 

1779
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:00,580
networks to like have content signed
where you could have a like full chain

1780
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:00,590
where you could have a like full chain
 

1781
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:03,160
where you could have a like full chain
of custody that accompanied every piece

1782
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,170
of custody that accompanied every piece
 

1783
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,290
of custody that accompanied every piece
of content so like when you're viewing

1784
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:05,300
of content so like when you're viewing
 

1785
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,720
of content so like when you're viewing
something and like you want to ask

1786
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:07,730
something and like you want to ask
 

1787
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,060
something and like you want to ask
yourself like how you know how much can

1788
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:10,070
yourself like how you know how much can
 

1789
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,710
yourself like how you know how much can
I trust this like you can click

1790
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:11,720
I trust this like you can click
 

1791
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,380
I trust this like you can click
something and like have a verified chain

1792
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,390
something and like have a verified chain
 

1793
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,030
something and like have a verified chain
of custody that shows like oh this is

1794
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:16,040
of custody that shows like oh this is
 

1795
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,640
of custody that shows like oh this is
coming from you know from this source

1796
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:18,650
coming from you know from this source
 

1797
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:20,520
coming from you know from this source
and it's like sign

1798
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:20,530
and it's like sign
 

1799
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,160
and it's like sign
I like someone whose identity I trust

1800
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:23,170
I like someone whose identity I trust
 

1801
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,260
I like someone whose identity I trust
yeah yeah I think having that you know

1802
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:25,270
yeah yeah I think having that you know
 

1803
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:26,940
yeah yeah I think having that you know
having that Chain of Custody like being

1804
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:26,950
having that Chain of Custody like being
 

1805
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,040
having that Chain of Custody like being
able to like say oh here's this video

1806
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:29,050
able to like say oh here's this video
 

1807
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:31,200
able to like say oh here's this video
like it may or may not have been

1808
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:31,210
like it may or may not have been
 

1809
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,030
like it may or may not have been
produced using some of this deep fake

1810
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,040
produced using some of this deep fake
 

1811
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,860
produced using some of this deep fake
technology but if you've got a verified

1812
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:34,870
technology but if you've got a verified
 

1813
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:36,240
technology but if you've got a verified
Chain of Custody where you can sort of

1814
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:36,250
Chain of Custody where you can sort of
 

1815
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,280
Chain of Custody where you can sort of
trace it all the way back to an identity

1816
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:38,290
trace it all the way back to an identity
 

1817
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,230
trace it all the way back to an identity
and you can decide whether or not like I

1818
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:40,240
and you can decide whether or not like I
 

1819
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,240
and you can decide whether or not like I
trust this identity like oh no this is

1820
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:42,250
trust this identity like oh no this is
 

1821
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,740
trust this identity like oh no this is
really from the White House or like this

1822
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:43,750
really from the White House or like this
 

1823
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,930
really from the White House or like this
is really from the you know the office

1824
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:45,940
is really from the you know the office
 

1825
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,910
is really from the you know the office
of this particular presidential

1826
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:47,920
of this particular presidential
 

1827
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,880
of this particular presidential
candidate or it's really from you know

1828
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:50,890
candidate or it's really from you know
 

1829
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,940

Jeff Weiner CEO of of LinkedIn or Satya

1830
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:53,950
Jeff Weiner CEO of of LinkedIn or Satya
 

1831
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,250
Jeff Weiner CEO of of LinkedIn or Satya
Nadella CEO Microsoft like that might

1832
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:56,260
Nadella CEO Microsoft like that might
 

1833
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,800
Nadella CEO Microsoft like that might
that might be like one way that you can

1834
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:58,810
that might be like one way that you can
 

1835
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:00,270
that might be like one way that you can
solve some of the problems and so like

1836
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:00,280
solve some of the problems and so like
 

1837
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,920
solve some of the problems and so like
that's not the super high tech like

1838
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:01,930
that's not the super high tech like
 

1839
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,980
that's not the super high tech like
we've had all of this technology forever

1840
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:03,990
we've had all of this technology forever
 

1841
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,810
we've had all of this technology forever
and back but I think you're right like

1842
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:06,820
and back but I think you're right like
 

1843
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,710
and back but I think you're right like
it has to it has to be some sort of

1844
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:09,720
it has to it has to be some sort of
 

1845
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,020
it has to it has to be some sort of
technological thing because the the

1846
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,030
technological thing because the the
 

1847
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:15,540
technological thing because the the
underlying tech that is used to create

1848
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:15,550
underlying tech that is used to create
 

1849
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:17,460
underlying tech that is used to create
this isn't not going to do anything but

1850
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:17,470
this isn't not going to do anything but
 

1851
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,380
this isn't not going to do anything but
get better over time and the genie is

1852
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:19,390
get better over time and the genie is
 

1853
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,910
get better over time and the genie is
sort of out of the bottle

1854
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:20,920
sort of out of the bottle
 

1855
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,740
sort of out of the bottle
there's no stuffing it back in and

1856
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:22,750
there's no stuffing it back in and
 

1857
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:24,810
there's no stuffing it back in and
there's a social component which i think

1858
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:24,820
there's a social component which i think
 

1859
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,730
there's a social component which i think
is really healthy for a democracy where

1860
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:26,740
is really healthy for a democracy where
 

1861
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,220
is really healthy for a democracy where
people be skeptical about the thing they

1862
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:29,230
people be skeptical about the thing they
 

1863
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,630
people be skeptical about the thing they
watch yeah in general so you know which

1864
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:33,640
watch yeah in general so you know which
 

1865
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,760
watch yeah in general so you know which
is good skepticism in general is good

1866
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:35,770
is good skepticism in general is good
 

1867
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,400
is good skepticism in general is good
and it's good content so deep fakes in

1868
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,410
and it's good content so deep fakes in
 

1869
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:41,760
and it's good content so deep fakes in
that sense of creating global skepticism

1870
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:41,770
that sense of creating global skepticism
 

1871
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:44,640
that sense of creating global skepticism
about can they trust what they read it

1872
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:44,650
about can they trust what they read it
 

1873
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,310
about can they trust what they read it
encourages further research I come from

1874
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:47,320
encourages further research I come from
 

1875
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:51,720
encourages further research I come from
the Soviet Union where basically nobody

1876
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:51,730
the Soviet Union where basically nobody
 

1877
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,150
the Soviet Union where basically nobody
trusted the media because you knew it

1878
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:54,160
trusted the media because you knew it
 

1879
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
trusted the media because you knew it
was propaganda and that encouraged that

1880
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:56,170
was propaganda and that encouraged that

interesting things like the auto
response stuffs getting better and

2038
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:08,940
response stuffs getting better and
 

2039
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,759
response stuffs getting better and
better and it's like getting to the

2040
00:44:10,759 --> 00:44:10,769
better and it's like getting to the
 

2041
00:44:10,769 --> 00:44:13,880
better and it's like getting to the
point where you know it can auto respond

2042
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:13,890
point where you know it can auto respond
 

2043
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:16,549
point where you know it can auto respond
with like okay let you know this person

00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:32,279
interesting like we we have this notion
 

2055
00:44:32,279 --> 00:44:34,160
interesting like we we have this notion
of Microsoft search where it's like not

2065
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:47,240
office 365 tenant and like you know
potentially in other products and like

2066
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:47,250
potentially in other products and like
 

2067
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:48,950
potentially in other products and like
we have this thing called the Microsoft

2068
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:48,960
we have this thing called the Microsoft
 

2069
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,980
we have this thing called the Microsoft
graph that is basically a API federated

2070
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:51,990
graph that is basically a API federated
 

2071
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:55,730
graph that is basically a API federated
at you know sort of like gets you hooked

2072
00:44:55,730 --> 00:44:55,740
at you know sort of like gets you hooked
 

2073
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,609
at you know sort of like gets you hooked
up across the entire breadth of like all

up across the entire breadth of like all
 

2075
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:00,410
up across the entire breadth of like all
of the you know like what were

information silos before they got woven

2078
00:45:02,779 --> 00:45:02,789
information silos before they got woven
 

2079
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:06,349
information silos before they got woven
together with the graph like that is

2080
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:06,359
together with the graph like that is
 

2081
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:08,359
together with the graph like that is
like getting increasing with increasing

2082
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:08,369
like getting increasing with increasing
 

2083
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:10,539
like getting increasing with increasing
effectiveness sort of plumbed into the

2084
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:10,549
effectiveness sort of plumbed into the
 

2085
00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:13,009
effectiveness sort of plumbed into the
into some of these auto-response things

2086
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:13,019
into some of these auto-response things
 

2087
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:15,259
into some of these auto-response things
where you're gonna be able to see the

2088
00:45:15,259 --> 00:45:15,269
where you're gonna be able to see the
 

2089
00:45:15,269 --> 00:45:16,999
where you're gonna be able to see the
system like automatically retrieve

2090
00:45:16,999 --> 00:45:17,009
system like automatically retrieve
 

2091
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,039
system like automatically retrieve
information for you like if you know

2092
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:19,049
information for you like if you know
 

2093
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:21,410
information for you like if you know
like I frequently send out you know

2094
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:21,420
like I frequently send out you know
 

2095
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,599
like I frequently send out you know
emails to folks were like I can't find a

2096
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:23,609
emails to folks were like I can't find a
 

2097
00:45:23,609 --> 00:45:25,490
emails to folks were like I can't find a
paper or a document or whatnot there's

2098
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:25,500
paper or a document or whatnot there's
 

2099
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,779
paper or a document or whatnot there's
no reason why the system won't be able

2100
00:45:26,779 --> 00:45:26,789
no reason why the system won't be able
 

2101
00:45:26,789 --> 00:45:28,670
no reason why the system won't be able
to do that for you and like I think the

2102
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:28,680
to do that for you and like I think the
 

2103
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:32,509
to do that for you and like I think the
the its building towards like having

2104
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:32,519
the its building towards like having
 

2105
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:34,880
the its building towards like having
things that look more like like a fully

2106
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:34,890
things that look more like like a fully
 

2107
00:45:34,890 --> 00:45:38,240
things that look more like like a fully
integrated you know assistant but like

2108
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:38,250
integrated you know assistant but like
 

2109
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,940
integrated you know assistant but like
you'll have a bunch of steps that you

2110
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:40,950
you'll have a bunch of steps that you
 

2111
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:43,670
you'll have a bunch of steps that you
will see before you like it will not be

2112
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:43,680
will see before you like it will not be
 

2113
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:45,289
will see before you like it will not be
this like Big Bang thing where like

2114
00:45:45,289 --> 00:45:45,299
this like Big Bang thing where like
 

2115
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:46,910
this like Big Bang thing where like
Clippy comes back and you've got this

2116
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:46,920
Clippy comes back and you've got this
 

2117
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,309
Clippy comes back and you've got this
like you know manifestation of you know

2118
00:45:49,309 --> 00:45:49,319
like you know manifestation of you know
 

2119
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:52,670
like you know manifestation of you know
like a fully fully powered assistant

2120
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:52,680
like a fully fully powered assistant
 

2121
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,329
like a fully fully powered assistant
so I think that's that's definitely

2122
00:45:56,329 --> 00:45:56,339
so I think that's that's definitely
 

2123
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:57,859
so I think that's that's definitely
coming in like all of the you know

2124
00:45:57,859 --> 00:45:57,869
coming in like all of the you know
 

2125
00:45:57,869 --> 00:45:59,510
coming in like all of the you know
collaboration co-authoring stuff's

2126
00:45:59,510 --> 00:45:59,520
collaboration co-authoring stuff's
 

2127
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,700
collaboration co-authoring stuff's
getting better you know it's like really

2128
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:01,710
getting better you know it's like really
 

2129
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:04,640
getting better you know it's like really
interested like if you look at how we

2130
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:04,650
interested like if you look at how we
 

2131
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,420
interested like if you look at how we
use like the office product portfolio at

2132
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:08,430
use like the office product portfolio at
 

2133
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,250
use like the office product portfolio at
Microsoft like more and more of it is

2134
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:10,260
Microsoft like more and more of it is
 

2135
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:13,240
Microsoft like more and more of it is
happening inside of like teams as a

2136
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:13,250
happening inside of like teams as a
 

2137
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,490
happening inside of like teams as a
canvas and like it's this thing where

2138
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:16,500
canvas and like it's this thing where
 

2139
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:19,250
canvas and like it's this thing where
you know you've got collaboration is

2140
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:19,260
you know you've got collaboration is
 

2141
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,539
you know you've got collaboration is
like at the center of the product and

2142
00:46:22,539 --> 00:46:22,549
like at the center of the product and
 

2143
00:46:22,549 --> 00:46:26,240
like at the center of the product and
like we we built some like really cool

2144
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,250
like we we built some like really cool
 

2145
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,250
like we we built some like really cool
stuff that's some of which is about to

2146
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:28,260
stuff that's some of which is about to
 

2147
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:30,019
stuff that's some of which is about to
be open source that are sort of

2148
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:30,029
be open source that are sort of
 

2149
00:46:30,029 --> 00:46:33,260
be open source that are sort of
framework level things for doing for

2150
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:33,270
framework level things for doing for
 

2151
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:37,460
framework level things for doing for
doing co-authoring so in is there a

2152
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:37,470
doing co-authoring so in is there a
 

2153
00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:40,430
doing co-authoring so in is there a
cloud component to that so on the web or

2154
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:40,440
cloud component to that so on the web or
 

2155
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:42,769
cloud component to that so on the web or
is it I forgive me if I don't already

2156
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:42,779
is it I forgive me if I don't already
 

2157
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:46,130
is it I forgive me if I don't already
know this but with office 365 we still

2158
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,140
know this but with office 365 we still
 

2159
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,809
know this but with office 365 we still
the collaboration would do if you're

2160
00:46:47,809 --> 00:46:47,819
the collaboration would do if you're
 

2161
00:46:47,819 --> 00:46:49,339
the collaboration would do if you're
doing word which still send the file

2162
00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:49,349
doing word which still send the file
 

2163
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:53,029
doing word which still send the file
around no advice yeah this is it

2164
00:46:53,029 --> 00:46:53,039
around no advice yeah this is it
 

2165
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:54,920
around no advice yeah this is it
we're already a little bit better than

2166
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:54,930
we're already a little bit better than
 

2167
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,809
we're already a little bit better than
that and like you know so the fact that

2168
00:46:56,809 --> 00:46:56,819
that and like you know so the fact that
 

2169
00:46:56,819 --> 00:46:57,950
that and like you know so the fact that
you're unaware of it means we've got a

2170
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:57,960
you're unaware of it means we've got a
 

2171
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:59,779
you're unaware of it means we've got a
better job to do feel like helping you

2172
00:46:59,779 --> 00:46:59,789
better job to do feel like helping you
 

2173
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:03,230
better job to do feel like helping you
discover discover this stuff but yeah I

2174
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:03,240
discover discover this stuff but yeah I
 

2175
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,559
discover discover this stuff but yeah I
mean it's already like got a huge huge

2176
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:06,569
mean it's already like got a huge huge
 

2177
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:08,240
mean it's already like got a huge huge
clock but and like part of you know part

2178
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:08,250
clock but and like part of you know part
 

2179
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:09,980
clock but and like part of you know part
of this framework stuff I think we're

2180
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:09,990
of this framework stuff I think we're
 

2181
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,980
of this framework stuff I think we're
calling it like I like we've been

2182
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:12,990
calling it like I like we've been
 

2183
00:47:12,990 --> 00:47:14,720
calling it like I like we've been
working on it for a couple years so like

2184
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:14,730
working on it for a couple years so like
 

2185
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,180
working on it for a couple years so like
I know the the internal code name for it

2186
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:17,190
I know the the internal code name for it
 

2187
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,410
I know the the internal code name for it
but I think when we launched it a bill

2188
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:18,420
but I think when we launched it a bill
 

2189
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:23,390
but I think when we launched it a bill
is called a fluid framework and but like

2190

you don't have to be like super specific
 

2325
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,930
you don't have to be like super specific
about it but like the biggest miseries

2326
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:08,940
about it but like the biggest miseries
 

2327
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,700
about it but like the biggest miseries
that I've ever seen as an engineering

2328
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:10,710
that I've ever seen as an engineering
 

2329
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,310
that I've ever seen as an engineering
leader are in places where you didn't

2330
00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:13,320
leader are in places where you didn't
 

2331
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,900
leader are in places where you didn't
have a clear enough opinion about those

2332
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:14,910
have a clear enough opinion about those
 

2333
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,480
have a clear enough opinion about those
things soon enough and then you just

2334
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:17,490
things soon enough and then you just
 

2335
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:19,790
things soon enough and then you just
sort of go create a bunch of technical

2336
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:19,800
sort of go create a bunch of technical
 

2337
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,100
sort of go create a bunch of technical
debt

2338
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,110
debt
 

2339
00:50:20,110 --> 00:50:22,250
debt
and like culture debt that is

2340
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:22,260
and like culture debt that is
 

2341
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,620
and like culture debt that is
excruciating ly painful to to clean up

2342
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:25,630
excruciating ly painful to to clean up
 

2343
00:50:25,630 --> 00:50:28,860
excruciating ly painful to to clean up
so like that's one bundle of things like

2344
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:28,870

engineering teams like you you can you
 

2381
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,460
engineering teams like you you can you
can just brute force things when you're

know like a bunch of technical people
 

2403
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,720
know like a bunch of technical people
will sort of balk at the idea that like

and thank God we do
 

2431
00:52:29,349 --> 00:52:31,949

but like they are there they're just

2432
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:31,959
but like they are there they're just
 

2433
00:52:31,959 --> 00:52:33,689
but like they are there they're just
abstract things like they're just words

abstract things like they're just words
 

2435
00:52:33,699 --> 00:52:35,069
abstract things like they're just words
it's like we don't believe in them

2436
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:35,079
it's like we don't believe in them
 

2437
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:35,880
it's like we don't believe in them
they're nothing

2438

they're nothing
 

2439
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:38,400
they're nothing
and in some sense those stories are

2440
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:38,410
and in some sense those stories are
 

2441
00:52:38,410 --> 00:52:41,670

00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:01,660
technology for devices do you have crazy
 

2459
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,829
technology for devices do you have crazy
ideas about the future of the world yeah

2460
00:53:04,829 --> 00:53:04,839
ideas about the future of the world yeah
 

2461
00:53:04,839 --> 00:53:07,170
ideas about the future of the world yeah
look I think we you know we're entering

2462
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:07,180
look I think we you know we're entering
 

2463
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,859
look I think we you know we're entering
this time where we've got we have

2464
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:10,869
this time where we've got we have
 

2465
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:13,680
this time where we've got we have
technology that is progressing at the

2466
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:13,690
technology that is progressing at the
 

2467
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,109
technology that is progressing at the
fastest rate that it ever has and you've

2468
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:16,119
fastest rate that it ever has and you've
 

2469
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:20,519
fastest rate that it ever has and you've
got you get some really big social

2470
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:20,529
got you get some really big social
 

2471
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:23,339
got you get some really big social
problems like society scale problems

2472
00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:23,349
problems like society scale problems
 

2473
00:53:23,349 --> 00:53:26,609
problems like society scale problems
that we have to we have to tackle and so

2474
00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:26,619
that we have to we have to tackle and so
 

2475
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:28,229
that we have to we have to tackle and so
you know I think we're gonna rise to the

2476
00:53:28,229 --> 00:53:28,239
you know I think we're gonna rise to the
 

2477
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:29,519
you know I think we're gonna rise to the
challenge and like figure out how to

2478
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:29,529
challenge and like figure out how to
 

2479
00:53:29,529 --> 00:53:31,589
challenge and like figure out how to
intersect like all of the power of this

2480
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:31,599
intersect like all of the power of this
 

2481
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,089
intersect like all of the power of this
technology with all of the big

technology with all of the big
 

2483
00:53:33,099 --> 00:53:35,459
technology with all of the big
challenges that are facing us whether

2484
00:53:35,459 --> 00:53:35,469
challenges that are facing us whether
 

2485
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:37,979
challenges that are facing us whether
it's you know global warming whether

2486
00:53:37,979 --> 00:53:37,989
it's you know global warming whether
 

2487
00:53:37,989 --> 00:53:40,410
it's you know global warming whether
it's like the biggest remainder of the

2488
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:40,420
it's like the biggest remainder of the
 

2489
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:44,459
it's like the biggest remainder of the
population boom is in Africa for the

2490
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:44,469
population boom is in Africa for the
 

2491
00:53:44,469 --> 00:53:47,370
population boom is in Africa for the
next 50 years or so and like global

2492
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:47,380
next 50 years or so and like global
 

2493
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,660
next 50 years or so and like global
warming is gonna make it increasingly

2494
00:53:48,660 --> 00:53:48,670
warming is gonna make it increasingly
 

2495
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:51,930
warming is gonna make it increasingly
difficult to feed global population in

2496
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:51,940
difficult to feed global population in
 

2497
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,459
difficult to feed global population in
particular like in this place where

2498
00:53:53,459 --> 00:53:53,469
particular like in this place where
 

2499
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:54,859
particular like in this place where
