00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,929
people's ELO rating so what do you think
just by looking at my face deep into my

60
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:14,939
just by looking at my face deep into my
 

61
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:15,590
just by looking at my face deep into my
eyes

63
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,289

uh what's my ELO rating

64
00:01:18,289 --> 00:01:18,299
uh what's my ELO rating
 

65
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,170
uh what's my ELO rating
here I'll help you I'll I'll do E4 for

66
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,180
here I'll help you I'll I'll do E4 for
 

67
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,310
here I'll help you I'll I'll do E4 for
the listener

68
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:22,320

I actually read that stockfish prefers

70
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:25,500
I actually read that stockfish prefers
 

71
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,249
I actually read that stockfish prefers
E4 does it really

72
00:01:28,249 --> 00:01:28,259
E4 does it really
 

73
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:30,050
E4 does it really
I actually didn't know that because it

74
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:30,060
I actually didn't know that because it
 

75
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,929
I actually didn't know that because it
maximizes the number of tactical options

76
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:32,939
maximizes the number of tactical options
 

77
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,030
maximizes the number of tactical options
so that makes sense the variety answer

78
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,040
so that makes sense the variety answer
 

79
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,210
so that makes sense the variety answer
is 3400 which is I believe stockfish

80
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:38,220
is 3400 which is I believe stockfish

what what's that take how hard is it to
do that and like how would you actually

86
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:44,400
do that and like how would you actually
 

87
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,030
do that and like how would you actually
do that like what are telltale signs of

do that like what are telltale signs of
 

89
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,710

is there something you look for yeah I
think you can separate it something like

96
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:54,840
think you can separate it something like
 

97
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,230
think you can separate it something like
the very first the zero to about eight

98
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:57,240
the very first the zero to about eight
 

99

nine hundred for simplicity's sake I'm
 

101
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,130
nine hundred for simplicity's sake I'm
gonna use the trust.com rating system

105
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,130
because leeches is slightly different it
tends to go to 300 points higher than

110
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:10,560
hundred points higher but then it
 

111
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,309
hundred points higher but then it
catches up they catch up around 22 2300

squeezing juice out of the fruit so
 

563
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,009
squeezing juice out of the fruit so
that's the way I would describe it so

564
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:34,019
that's the way I would describe it so
 

565
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,990
that's the way I would describe it so
that's not good source of information if

566
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:36,000
that's not good source of information if
 

567
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,810
that's not good source of information if
you no within the first 15 moves

568
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:38,820
you no within the first 15 moves
 

569
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:41,570
you no within the first 15 moves
generally you can tell because you can

570
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:41,580
generally you can tell because you can
 

571
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,430
generally you can tell because you can
tell how well they played the opening so

572
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:43,440
tell how well they played the opening so
 

573
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,230
tell how well they played the opening so
how well they knew

574
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,240
how well they knew
 

575
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,210
how well they knew
what they were supposed to memorize what

576
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:47,220
what they were supposed to memorize what
 

577
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,190
what they were supposed to memorize what
they were supposed to play and then how

578
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:49,200
they were supposed to play and then how
 

579
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,470

they react to peace interactions
 

581
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,090
they react to peace interactions
so if they are faced with a move that a

582
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:56,100
so if they are faced with a move that a
 

583
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,009
so if they are faced with a move that a
more advanced player would deal with

584
00:10:58,009 --> 00:10:58,019
more advanced player would deal with
 

585
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:00,110
more advanced player would deal with
very swiftly because there's kind of a

586
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:00,120
very swiftly because there's kind of a
 

587
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,329
very swiftly because there's kind of a
natural response that gives you

588
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:02,339
natural response that gives you
 

589
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,430
natural response that gives you
information if they move their King when

590
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:04,440
information if they move their King when
 

591
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,810
information if they move their King when
they're in check when they didn't have

592
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:05,820
they're in check when they didn't have
 

593
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,210
they're in check when they didn't have
to that's a massive giveaway

594
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:08,220
to that's a massive giveaway
 

595
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,769
to that's a massive giveaway
some people just think oh I'm in check

596
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:09,779
some people just think oh I'm in check
 

597
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:12,110
some people just think oh I'm in check
so I have to move my king okay so it's

pieces are like tied together in
 

609
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,970
pieces are like tied together in
interesting ways and then okay

610
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:28,980
interesting ways and then okay
 

611
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,610
interesting ways and then okay
okay like what about like uh what about

612
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:31,620

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,610
gonna play some crap and
you can't play the way you you memorize

634
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:55,620
you can't play the way you you memorize
 

635
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,829
you can't play the way you you memorize
them because I have to respond to you in

636
00:11:57,829 --> 00:11:57,839
them because I have to respond to you in
 

637
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,810
them because I have to respond to you in
certain ways so you will either respond

638
00:11:59,810 --> 00:11:59,820
certain ways so you will either respond
 

639
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,069
certain ways so you will either respond
the way you think you're supposed to

640
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:01,079
the way you think you're supposed to
 

641
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,750
the way you think you're supposed to
respond and that will probably be

642
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:02,760
respond and that will probably be
 

643
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,569
respond and that will probably be
incorrect or now you have to figure out

644
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:05,579
incorrect or now you have to figure out
 

645
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,269
incorrect or now you have to figure out
how to deal with the fresh position oh

646
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:08,279
how to deal with the fresh position oh
 

647
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,509
how to deal with the fresh position oh
so the 900 will reflect itself in both

648
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:11,519
so the 900 will reflect itself in both
 

649
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,590
so the 900 will reflect itself in both
cases yeah yeah I wonder if actually so

650
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:15,600
cases yeah yeah I wonder if actually so
 

651
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,449
cases yeah yeah I wonder if actually so

or your top rating what was your topic I
know both my current

656
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:21,480
know both my current
 

657
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:25,250
know both my current
ELO like over the board now is 23 20 my

666
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:38,640
given that you've guessed a lot of Elo
 

667
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,050
given that you've guessed a lot of Elo

it's kind of an interesting question

670
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:43,800
it's kind of an interesting question
 

671
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,889
it's kind of an interesting question
yeah yeah of course before I was doing

672
00:12:45,889 --> 00:12:45,899
yeah yeah of course before I was doing
 

673

890
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:00,660
Move It I didn't see it it's that I
 

891
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,590
Move It I didn't see it it's that I
misevaluated it I saw the move could be

892
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:03,600
misevaluated it I saw the move could be
 

893
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,449
misevaluated it I saw the move could be
played but I missed something three or

894
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:05,459
played but I missed something three or
 

895
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,490

four moves deeper you play that move and

896
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:07,500
four moves deeper you play that move and
 

897
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,289
four moves deeper you play that move and
suddenly you're excited and I'm nervous

899
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:12,110
suddenly you're excited and I'm nervous
but all of a sudden you make an

900
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,120
but all of a sudden you make an
 

901
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,850
but all of a sudden you make an
inaccuracy and now the tide shifts right

902
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:13,860
inaccuracy and now the tide shifts right
 

903
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,530
inaccuracy and now the tide shifts right
we could be on totally different planes

904
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:15,540
we could be on totally different planes
 

905
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,449
we could be on totally different planes
throughout the game or we could be on

906
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:17,459
throughout the game or we could be on
 

907
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:18,590
throughout the game or we could be on
the same plane throughout the game so

908
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:18,600
the same plane throughout the game so
 

909
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,870
the same plane throughout the game so
it's it's really fascinating it yeah so

910
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:20,880
it's it's really fascinating it yeah so
 

911
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,329
it's it's really fascinating it yeah so
your thought is when you see a move that

we start to try to make sense of that

920
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:29,880
we start to try to make sense of that
 

921
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,789
we start to try to make sense of that

anti-young player strategy what's that
 

955
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,169
anti-young player strategy what's that
mean it means that by move seven or

956
00:18:12,169 --> 00:18:12,179
mean it means that by move seven or
 

957
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:15,049
mean it means that by move seven or
eight you go to the database no games

so there have been games that if you put

you put Magnus as one of the aggressors

1022
00:19:30,049 --> 00:19:30,059
you put Magnus as one of the aggressors
 

1023
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:31,310
you put Magnus as one of the aggressors
in that game

1024
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:31,320
in that game
 

1025
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,830
in that game
suddenly the chance of Victory doubles

1026
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:33,840
suddenly the chance of Victory doubles
 

1027
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,049
suddenly the chance of Victory doubles
from five percent to ten percent weird

from five percent to ten percent weird
 

1029
00:19:36,059 --> 00:19:38,330
from five percent to ten percent weird
what's that about because it was a game

1030
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:38,340
what's that about because it was a game
 

1031
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,909
what's that about because it was a game
six against netball league right uh

six against netball league right uh
isn't stockfish say that it's supposed

1034
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:42,600
isn't stockfish say that it's supposed
 

1035
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,669
isn't stockfish say that it's supposed
to be a draw so 0.00 does mean a draw

1036
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:46,679
to be a draw so 0.00 does mean a draw

can you explain the joke and can you
 

1045
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,710
can you explain the joke and can you
explain 0.00 yes so when so stockfish

1046
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:57,720
explain 0.00 yes so when so stockfish
 

1047

explain 0.00 yes so when so stockfish
will show an evaluation

1048

will show an evaluation
which determines whether the position is

which determines whether the position is
equal slightly better for one side

you can

1058
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:09,260
you can
 

1059
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,250
you can
0.00.2 minus 0.2 that's all within a

0.00.2 minus 0.2 that's all within a

white has that but if it's zero zero

it could be literally a dead draw
 

1071
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,150
it could be literally a dead draw
meaning theoretically just impossible to

1072
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:26,160
meaning theoretically just impossible to
 

1073
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,830
meaning theoretically just impossible to
win but oftentimes what that means is

1074
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:27,840
win but oftentimes what that means is
 

1075
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,770

remaining it wasn't a dead draw he
 

1093
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,510

continued to ask questions over the

course of six or seven hours he would
 

1097
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,350
course of six or seven hours he would
sacrifice a pawn he would sacrifice

1098

sacrifice a pawn he would sacrifice
 

1099

00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:07,440
that's the truth especially when the
 

1165
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,430
that's the truth especially when the
game itself is not that exciting when

1166
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:10,440
game itself is not that exciting when
 

1167
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,610
game itself is not that exciting when
Magnus plays a strange move on move nine

1168
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:13,620
Magnus plays a strange move on move nine

and then Jan has to try to exploit it
 

1173
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,529
and then Jan has to try to exploit it

that's my as a as a person who's just a
 

1187
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:33,649
that's my as a as a person who's just a
spectator just like

1188
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:33,659
spectator just like
 

1189
00:22:33,659 --> 00:22:35,330
spectator just like
that's that's interesting because then

1190
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:35,340
that's that's interesting because then
 

1191
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,310
that's that's interesting because then
you the most interesting part is about

1192
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,320

1196
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:41,640
guess themselves might be Grandmasters
 

1197
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,710
guess themselves might be Grandmasters
uh all yeah they are trying to I guess

1198
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:45,720
uh all yeah they are trying to I guess
 

1199
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,990
uh all yeah they are trying to I guess
just like nepo just like Magnus tried to

1200
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
just like nepo just like Magnus tried to
 

1201
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,289
just like nepo just like Magnus tried to
figure out what's the idea here what are

1202
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:51,299
figure out what's the idea here what are
 

1203
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:53,210
figure out what's the idea here what are
you thinking that's cool that's that's

1204
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,220
you thinking that's cool that's that's
 

1205
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,529
you thinking that's cool that's that's
that's an interesting part of the game

1206
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:54,539
that's an interesting part of the game
 

1207
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,450
that's an interesting part of the game
but other than that

1208
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:56,460
but other than that
 

1209
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,149
but other than that
it's it seemed um

1210
00:22:59,149 --> 00:22:59,159
it's it seemed um
 

1211
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:02,149
it's it seemed um
yeah I was sure this is just gonna keep

1212
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:02,159
yeah I was sure this is just gonna keep
 

1213
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,830
yeah I was sure this is just gonna keep
being a draw especially in that

1214
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:03,840
being a draw especially in that
 

1215
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,649
being a draw especially in that
situation so it's almost it seems almost

1216
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:06,659
situation so it's almost it seems almost
 

1217
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,649
situation so it's almost it seems almost
remarkable that his uh Magnus was able

1218
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:09,659
remarkable that his uh Magnus was able
 

1219
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:13,430
remarkable that his uh Magnus was able
to put pull out a win in game six and

1220
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:13,440
to put pull out a win in game six and
 

1221
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,690
to put pull out a win in game six and
after that

1222
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:14,700
after that
 

1223
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,570
after that
at least Magnus said that that that ends

1224
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:17,580
at least Magnus said that that that ends
 

1225
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,490
at least Magnus said that that that ends
it because now Knapp was gonna have to

1226
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:19,500
it because now Knapp was gonna have to
 

1227
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,770
it because now Knapp was gonna have to
take more risks and that opens it up to

1228
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:21,780
take more risks and that opens it up to
 

1229
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,890
take more risks and that opens it up to
Pure chest and then

1230
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:24,900

 

1231
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,649

um who was it uh Steve Prefontaine said

like whenever it's whenever there's a
 

1235
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,730
like whenever it's whenever there's a
race is down to like pure guts then

1236
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:31,740
race is down to like pure guts then
 

1237
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,149
race is down to like pure guts then

1238
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:35,159
that's when I win it there was also a
 

1239
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:38,029
that's when I win it there was also a

00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:44,760
fire you could even say he was out
 

1247
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,370

to step up and try to figure that out

1736
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:44,640
to step up and try to figure that out
 

1737
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,269
to step up and try to figure that out
which is great ultimately

1738
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:47,279
which is great ultimately

one of the folks that's like I mean

1758
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:09,659
one of the folks that's like I mean
 

1759
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:11,870
one of the folks that's like I mean
capablanca was brilliant you can argue

1760
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:11,880
capablanca was brilliant you can argue
 

1761
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,470
capablanca was brilliant you can argue
steinits was brilliant but as

1762
00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:14,480
steinits was brilliant but as
 

1763
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,230
steinits was brilliant but as
uh I think I think it was it's probably

00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:18,240
uh I think I think it was it's probably
 

1765
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,690
uh I think I think it was it's probably
Kasparov and Magnus has a chance to

1766
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:20,700
Kasparov and Magnus has a chance to
 

1767
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,130
Kasparov and Magnus has a chance to
overtake it

1768
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:22,140
overtake it
 

1769
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,470
overtake it
so the longevity is really important to

1770
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:24,480
so the longevity is really important to
 

1771
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,090
so the longevity is really important to
you when you're thinking about this yes

1772
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,100
you when you're thinking about this yes
 

1773
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,250
you when you're thinking about this yes
I think so I think Magnus is very very

close like it's it's extremely close
what would be the magic

1778
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:32,820
what would be the magic
 

1779
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,049
what would be the magic
you gotta get that sixth one

1780
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:35,059
you gotta get that sixth one
 

1781
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:37,430
you gotta get that sixth one
I'm just kidding so the World

it's kind of like basketball right Rings
 

1787
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:42,769
it's kind of like basketball right Rings
it's all comes down to how many rings

1788
00:33:42,769 --> 00:33:42,779
it's all comes down to how many rings
 

1789
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:44,690
it's all comes down to how many rings
did this person win what about well

did this person win what about well
basketball doesn't have this the number

1792
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:46,559
basketball doesn't have this the number
 

1793
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,769
basketball doesn't have this the number
of years is number one

1794
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:48,779
of years is number one
 

1795
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:53,810
of years is number one
right like uh rating sorry yeah uh like

1796
00:33:53,810 --> 00:33:53,820
right like uh rating sorry yeah uh like
 

1797
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,750
right like uh rating sorry yeah uh like
there's a there is a which is what

1798
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:56,760
there's a there is a which is what
 

1799
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,389

Magnus really likes is like there is a

1800
00:33:59,389 --> 00:33:59,399
Magnus really likes is like there is a
 

1801
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,090
Magnus really likes is like there is a
nice system of raiding of who is ranked

1802
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:02,100
nice system of raiding of who is ranked
 

1803
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,549
nice system of raiding of who is ranked
number one and has to do not with some

1804
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:04,559
number one and has to do not with some
 

1805
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,130
number one and has to do not with some
championships or low sample tournaments

1806
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:07,140
championships or low sample tournaments
 

1807
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,010
championships or low sample tournaments
it has to do with General game after

1808
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,020
it has to do with General game after
 

1809
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,369
it has to do with General game after
game after game helps estimate more

1810
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:13,379
game after game helps estimate more
 

1811
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:15,649
game after game helps estimate more
accurately the ELO rating so yeah he's

1812
00:34:15,649 --> 00:34:15,659
accurately the ELO rating so yeah he's
 

1813
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:17,210
accurately the ELO rating so yeah he's
been world number one for I think 11

1814
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:17,220
been world number one for I think 11
 

1815
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,190
been world number one for I think 11
years right which is still less than

1816
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:19,200
years right which is still less than
 

1817
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,169
years right which is still less than
because Gary was world number one for 20

1818
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:21,179
because Gary was world number one for 20
 

1819
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,869
because Gary was world number one for 20
years yeah which is which is quite wild

1820
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:23,879
years yeah which is which is quite wild
 

1821
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:26,389
years yeah which is which is quite wild
but still lower rating I think than

1822
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:26,399
but still lower rating I think than
 

1823
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,609
but still lower rating I think than
Magnus now right yeah I think rating in

1824
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:28,619
Magnus now right yeah I think rating in
 

1825
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:31,369
Magnus now right yeah I think rating in
general has sort of allegedly it got

1826
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:31,379
general has sort of allegedly it got
 

1827
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:33,109
general has sort of allegedly it got
inflated yeah is that true is this true

1828
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:33,119
inflated yeah is that true is this true
 

1829
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,349
inflated yeah is that true is this true
to that I think so I don't I can't speak

1830
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:36,359
to that I think so I don't I can't speak
 

1831
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:38,089
to that I think so I don't I can't speak
to how exactly it happened but it also

1832
00:34:38,089 --> 00:34:38,099
to how exactly it happened but it also
 

1833
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:40,250
to how exactly it happened but it also
happens online if you go back just three

1834
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:40,260
happens online if you go back just three
 

1835
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,629
happens online if you go back just three
or four years I think some of the best

1836
00:34:41,629 --> 00:34:41,639
or four years I think some of the best
 

1837
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,909
or four years I think some of the best
Blitz players on let's say shows.com

1838
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:43,919
Blitz players on let's say shows.com
 

1839
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,869
Blitz players on let's say shows.com
were 27 2800 and now they're 3200 I

1840
00:34:47,869 --> 00:34:47,879
were 27 2800 and now they're 3200 I
 

1841
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:49,250
were 27 2800 and now they're 3200 I
think it's just sort of what happens but

1842
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:49,260
think it's just sort of what happens but
 

1843
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,329
think it's just sort of what happens but
I

1844
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:50,339
I
 

1845
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:52,909
I
I don't exactly know uh I will mention

1846
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:52,919
I don't exactly know uh I will mention
 

1847
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,570
I don't exactly know uh I will mention
that there was a very strange change not

1848
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:56,580
that there was a very strange change not
 

1849
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,849
that there was a very strange change not
exactly sure when the year was in fide

1850
00:34:58,849 --> 00:34:58,859
exactly sure when the year was in fide
 

1851
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:01,670
exactly sure when the year was in fide
so over the board chess where if you

1852
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
so over the board chess where if you
 

1853
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,170
so over the board chess where if you
were

1854
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:03,180
were
 

1855
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,810
were
under the age of 16 or 18 years old one

1856
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:05,820
under the age of 16 or 18 years old one
 

1857
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,010
under the age of 16 or 18 years old one
of those two

1858
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:07,020
of those two
 

1859
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:10,130
of those two
and you were below 2300

1860
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:10,140
and you were below 2300
 

1861
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,030
and you were below 2300
okay your rating change Factor was three

1862
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,040
okay your rating change Factor was three
 

1863
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,069
okay your rating change Factor was three
to four times higher

1864
00:35:16,069 --> 00:35:16,079
to four times higher
 

1865
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,410
to four times higher
so just imagine that means Magnus has a

1866
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:18,420
so just imagine that means Magnus has a
 

1867
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,010
so just imagine that means Magnus has a
rating change factor of of let's say one

1868
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:22,020
rating change factor of of let's say one
 

1869
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,569
rating change factor of of let's say one
I have a reading change Factor also of

1870
00:35:23,569 --> 00:35:23,579
I have a reading change Factor also of
 

1871
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,410
I have a reading change Factor also of
one anybody over the rating 2400 has the

1872
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:27,420
one anybody over the rating 2400 has the
 

1873
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,810
one anybody over the rating 2400 has the
same rating change Factor uh what is uh

1874
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:29,820
same rating change Factor uh what is uh
 

1875
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,550
same rating change Factor uh what is uh
the rating change Factor so if you win

1876
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:31,560
the rating change Factor so if you win
 

1877
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,829
the rating change Factor so if you win
yeah there's a formula and basically

1878
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:33,839
yeah there's a formula and basically
 

1879
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,810
yeah there's a formula and basically
let's say at the very base level five

1880
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:35,820
let's say at the very base level five
 

1881
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,730
let's say at the very base level five
point change if your rating change

1882
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:37,740
point change if your rating change
 

1883
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,609
point change if your rating change
factor is one you beat somebody you gain

1884
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:40,619

about yourself about about the internet
I think first and foremost I learned

3278
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:55,200
I think first and foremost I learned
 

3279
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,569
I think first and foremost I learned
that

3280
01:02:56,569 --> 01:02:56,579

3284
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:02,160
you are live or broadcasting can be
 

3285
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,069
you are live or broadcasting can be
completely blown out of proportion you

3286

completely blown out of proportion you
 

3287
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,130
completely blown out of proportion you
have to be real careful and

have to be real careful and
 

3289
01:03:07,140 --> 01:03:09,049
have to be real careful and
I can't actively think about that

3290
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:09,059
I can't actively think about that
 

3291
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:10,490
I can't actively think about that

your personality to shine through and
 

3311

you want to entertain
 

3313
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,130
you want to entertain
at least you're thinking at what cost

3314
01:03:34,130 --> 01:03:34,140
at least you're thinking at what cost
 

3315
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:36,170
at least you're thinking at what cost
if I make a joke to a viewer that

3316
01:03:36,170 --> 01:03:36,180
if I make a joke to a viewer that
 

3317
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,609
if I make a joke to a viewer that
suddenly the whole chat is laughing at

01:03:37,609 --> 01:03:37,619
suddenly the whole chat is laughing at
 

3319
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:38,690
suddenly the whole chat is laughing at
them

3320
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:38,700
them
 

3321
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:40,370
them
what if that puts them in a deep dark

3322
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:40,380
what if that puts them in a deep dark
 

3323
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,410
what if that puts them in a deep dark
place and again so it all comes back to

3324
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:42,420
place and again so it all comes back to
 

3325
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:44,390
place and again so it all comes back to
this one-on-one thing for me because I'm

3326
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:44,400
this one-on-one thing for me because I'm
 

3327
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,650
this one-on-one thing for me because I'm
a human I would hate to put another

3328
01:03:45,650 --> 01:03:45,660
a human I would hate to put another
 

3329
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:49,309
a human I would hate to put another
person into that situation if I would

3330
01:03:49,309 --> 01:03:49,319
person into that situation if I would
 

3331
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:50,690
person into that situation if I would
much rather get a drink with somebody

than then but it's all kind of part of
 

3335
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:56,870
than then but it's all kind of part of
this act and you want to make jokes and

think let time go by
it makes me sad because I think that

3348
01:04:09,230 --> 01:04:09,240
it makes me sad because I think that
 

3349
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:10,609
it makes me sad because I think that
kind of stuff can destroy good people

3350
01:04:10,609 --> 01:04:10,619
kind of stuff can destroy good people
 

3351

of the things we discussed just here

3354
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:15,720
of the things we discussed just here
 

3355
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,690
of the things we discussed just here
before recording which I'm also I've

3356
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:17,700
before recording which I'm also I've
 

3357
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,010
before recording which I'm also I've
talked about this on stream I'm very

3358
01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:19,020
talked about this on stream I'm very
 

3359
01:04:19,020 --> 01:04:20,630
talked about this on stream I'm very
open with this type of stuff is over the

3360
01:04:20,630 --> 01:04:20,640
open with this type of stuff is over the
 

3361
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:22,730
open with this type of stuff is over the
I think for me a lot of that comes down

3362
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:22,740
I think for me a lot of that comes down
 

3363
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:25,190
I think for me a lot of that comes down
to just a lack of control of the of the

3364
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:25,200
to just a lack of control of the of the
 

3365
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,530
to just a lack of control of the of the
narrative that's that phrase is kind of

3366
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:27,540
narrative that's that phrase is kind of
 

3367
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:29,450
narrative that's that phrase is kind of
messy it can be used for political stuff

3368
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:29,460
messy it can be used for political stuff
 

3369
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:33,230
messy it can be used for political stuff
but I I hate when I say things and they

3370
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:33,240
but I I hate when I say things and they
 

3371
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:35,930
but I I hate when I say things and they
get completely misconstrued or they

3372
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:35,940
get completely misconstrued or they
 

3373
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,210
get completely misconstrued or they
are completely misinterpreted and I

3374
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:38,220

really you can clip me
saying something about a chess game out

01:04:46,069 --> 01:04:46,079
saying something about a chess game out
 

3383

maybe maybe I I either haven't said

3408
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:17,819
maybe maybe I I either haven't said
 

3409
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:19,730
maybe maybe I I either haven't said
enough of those things or there's no

3410
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:19,740
enough of those things or there's no

moments in I don't have three four hour

3412
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:21,900
moments in I don't have three four hour
 

3413
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,870
moments in I don't have three four hour
open conversations with other humans and

3414
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:23,880
open conversations with other humans and
 

3415
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,250
open conversations with other humans and
I'm pretty sure if I did there would be

3416
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:25,260
I'm pretty sure if I did there would be
 

3417
01:05:25,260 --> 01:05:28,549
I'm pretty sure if I did there would be
more of that that stuff out there but uh

3418
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:28,559
more of that that stuff out there but uh
 

3419
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,470
more of that that stuff out there but uh
that's probably what it is just the lack

3420
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:30,480
that's probably what it is just the lack
 

3421
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:31,789
that's probably what it is just the lack
of

3422
01:05:31,789 --> 01:05:31,799
of
 

3423
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,309
of
it's a lack of being able to kind of

3424
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:34,319
it's a lack of being able to kind of
 

3425
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,530
it's a lack of being able to kind of
control what is actually reality and and

3426
01:05:36,530 --> 01:05:36,540
control what is actually reality and and
 

3427
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:39,829
control what is actually reality and and
that that is very frustrating and uh

3428
01:05:39,829 --> 01:05:39,839
that that is very frustrating and uh
 

3429
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,750
that that is very frustrating and uh

just complex positions with all sorts of
 

3743
01:11:48,300 --> 01:11:50,270
just complex positions with all sorts of
calculation attacking defending like

3744
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:50,280
calculation attacking defending like
 

3745
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:51,890
calculation attacking defending like
very forcing lines

3746
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:51,900

like in this conversation I imagine this

3884
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:29,940
like in this conversation I imagine this

meditate on that
 

3891
01:14:36,179 --> 01:14:38,810
meditate on that
but then you also have to I think what

3892
01:14:38,810 --> 01:14:38,820
but then you also have to I think what

I mean because I've been reading a lot
on Hitler and and Stalin and so on and

in that community and it's like oof they

4276
01:22:10,970 --> 01:22:10,980
in that community and it's like oof they
 

4277
01:22:10,980 --> 01:22:12,290
in that community and it's like oof they
have a very different perspective on

01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:19,430
joke fun time and I I and I see that the
contrast of that with Call of Duty where

4284
01:22:19,430 --> 01:22:19,440
contrast of that with Call of Duty where
 

4285
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,669
contrast of that with Call of Duty where
you're where you're shooting and I I

4286
01:22:22,669 --> 01:22:22,679
you're where you're shooting and I I

video games but there's a slippery slope
 

4291
01:22:28,620 --> 01:22:31,250
video games but there's a slippery slope
there too because then just having

4292
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:31,260
there too because then just having
 

4293
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:33,950
there too because then just having
visited the front in Ukraine you get to

4294
01:22:33,950 --> 01:22:33,960
visited the front in Ukraine you get to
 

4295
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:36,830
visited the front in Ukraine you get to
see the real killing of people

4296
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:36,840
see the real killing of people
 

4297
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:39,229
see the real killing of people
and you see how one can lead to another

4298
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:39,239
and you see how one can lead to another
 

4299
01:22:39,239 --> 01:22:43,070
and you see how one can lead to another
it it's not an obvious but

4300
01:22:43,070 --> 01:22:43,080
it it's not an obvious but
 

4301
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:44,990
it it's not an obvious but
there's a

4302
01:22:44,990 --> 01:22:45,000
there's a
 

4303
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,550
there's a
there's something that happens in video

4304
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:46,560
there's something that happens in video
 

4305
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:48,649
there's something that happens in video
games where you're like well this is not

01:22:48,649 --> 01:22:48,659
games where you're like well this is not
 

4307
01:22:48,659 --> 01:22:50,090
games where you're like well this is not
reality

4308
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:50,100
reality
 

4309
01:22:50,100 --> 01:22:52,070
reality
the same kind of things happens in war

4310
01:22:52,070 --> 01:22:52,080
the same kind of things happens in war
 

4311
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,050
the same kind of things happens in war
well the people on the other side aren't

4312
01:22:54,050 --> 01:22:54,060
well the people on the other side aren't
 

4313
01:22:54,060 --> 01:22:56,810
well the people on the other side aren't
really human it does become a kind of

4314
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:56,820
really human it does become a kind of
 

4315
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:59,590
really human it does become a kind of
video game and that that same mechanism

4316
01:22:59,590 --> 01:22:59,600
video game and that that same mechanism
 

4317
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,990
video game and that that same mechanism
I feel like I want to be cautious about

4318
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:03,000
I feel like I want to be cautious about
 

4319
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,649
I feel like I want to be cautious about
our brain going down that road

4320
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:06,659
our brain going down that road
 

4321
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:08,390
our brain going down that road
so yeah I

4322
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:08,400
so yeah I
 

4323
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:11,030
so yeah I
I do worry about that Community

4324
01:23:11,030 --> 01:23:11,040
I do worry about that Community
 

4325
01:23:11,040 --> 01:23:12,590
I do worry about that Community
um

4326
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:12,600
um
 

4327
01:23:12,600 --> 01:23:14,750
um
but there are video games that don't

4328
01:23:14,750 --> 01:23:14,760
but there are video games that don't
 

4329
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:16,370
but there are video games that don't
have such communities around them I

4330
01:23:16,370 --> 01:23:16,380
have such communities around them I
 

4331
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:18,530
have such communities around them I
think Skyrim I don't think Skyrim is an

4332
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:18,540
think Skyrim I don't think Skyrim is an
 

4333
01:23:18,540 --> 01:23:20,689
think Skyrim I don't think Skyrim is an
online component of people Minecraft I

4334
01:23:20,689 --> 01:23:20,699
online component of people Minecraft I
 

4335
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:22,430
online component of people Minecraft I
think is relatively civil

4336
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:22,440
think is relatively civil
 

4337
01:23:22,440 --> 01:23:24,590
think is relatively civil
from what I've seen interesting a good

4338
01:23:24,590 --> 01:23:24,600
from what I've seen interesting a good
 

4339
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:26,149
from what I've seen interesting a good
Community I think it's a lot of a lot of

4340
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:26,159
Community I think it's a lot of a lot of
 

4341
01:23:26,159 --> 01:23:27,709
Community I think it's a lot of a lot of
right now it's booming it's a lot of

4342
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:27,719
right now it's booming it's a lot of
 

4343
01:23:27,719 --> 01:23:30,350
right now it's booming it's a lot of
young creators who are all seemingly

4344
01:23:30,350 --> 01:23:30,360
young creators who are all seemingly
 

4345
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,790
young creators who are all seemingly
quite close

4346
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:31,800
quite close
 

4347
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:34,070
quite close
and

4348
01:23:34,070 --> 01:23:34,080
and
 

4349
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,130
and
but I think the community then extends

4350
01:23:37,130 --> 01:23:37,140
but I think the community then extends
 

4351
01:23:37,140 --> 01:23:38,870
but I think the community then extends
to social media some of them are intense

4352
01:23:38,870 --> 01:23:38,880
to social media some of them are intense
 

4353
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,810
to social media some of them are intense
but who isn't

4354
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:40,820
but who isn't
 

4355
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:44,149
but who isn't
and I think I think they Foster a more

4356
01:23:44,149 --> 01:23:44,159
and I think I think they Foster a more
 

4357
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:46,970
and I think I think they Foster a more
or less kind of good group of folks but

4358
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:46,980

but then again I trust in the goodness
 

4407
01:24:37,980 --> 01:24:39,649
but then again I trust in the goodness
and the intelligence of people at the

01:24:39,649 --> 01:24:39,659
and the intelligence of people at the
 

4409
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:43,130
and the intelligence of people at the
end of the day and I think kids will

end of the day and I think kids will
 

4411
01:24:43,140 --> 01:24:45,649
end of the day and I think kids will
not sound like an old man but it's it's

4412
01:24:45,649 --> 01:24:45,659
not sound like an old man but it's it's

01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,629
and so what happens is
they play this tournament in Miami

5230

they play this tournament in Miami
 

5231

nothing
this is important because on the very

5236
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:47,760
this is important because on the very
 

5237
01:39:47,760 --> 01:39:49,070
this is important because on the very
next day it's not like Hans was

5238
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:49,080
next day it's not like Hans was

one versus Magnus in their best of four
and destroys him

5246
01:39:57,890 --> 01:39:57,900
and destroys him
 

5247
01:39:57,900 --> 01:40:01,129
and destroys him
like he destroyed him

5248
01:40:01,129 --> 01:40:01,139
like he destroyed him
 

5249
01:40:01,139 --> 01:40:02,810

made it look like I was playing in

5250
01:40:02,810 --> 01:40:02,820
made it look like I was playing in
 

5251
01:40:02,820 --> 01:40:04,310
made it look like I was playing in
magnus's shoes you know the level

5252
01:40:04,310 --> 01:40:04,320
magnus's shoes you know the level
 

5253
01:40:04,320 --> 01:40:05,870
magnus's shoes you know the level
difference it wouldn't have even leaky

5254
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:05,880
difference it wouldn't have even leaky
 

5255
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:07,790
difference it wouldn't have even leaky
it wasn't close

it wasn't close
 

5257
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:09,830
it wasn't close
of course we can argue it might be

5258
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:09,840
of course we can argue it might be
 

5259
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:12,709
of course we can argue it might be
because of the maybe Magnus knew

5260
01:40:12,709 --> 01:40:12,719
because of the maybe Magnus knew
 

5261
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:13,910
because of the maybe Magnus knew
something ahead of time there's

01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:16,430
something ahead of time there's
obviously the psychological element not

was the fact that it was different than
every other interview any human being

5760
01:49:09,350 --> 01:49:09,360
every other interview any human being
 

5761

ever gave at that level of trust
 

5763
01:49:11,340 --> 01:49:12,890

cheating insinuation which was one of
 

5803
01:49:52,320 --> 01:49:53,689
cheating insinuation which was one of
the theories another theory was someone

5804
01:49:53,689 --> 01:49:53,699
the theories another theory was someone
 

5805
01:49:53,699 --> 01:49:57,590
the theories another theory was someone
in team Magnus told Hans what Magnus was

5806
01:49:57,590 --> 01:49:57,600
in team Magnus told Hans what Magnus was
 

5807
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:00,169
in team Magnus told Hans what Magnus was
looking at and that's why Hans learned

5808
01:50:00,169 --> 01:50:00,179
looking at and that's why Hans learned
 

5809
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:02,750
looking at and that's why Hans learned
those first 15 moves which is so [\h__\h]

5810
01:50:02,750 --> 01:50:02,760
those first 15 moves which is so [\h__\h]
 

5811
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:05,149
those first 15 moves which is so [\h__\h]
stupid because Magnus knows like five

5812
01:50:05,149 --> 01:50:05,159
stupid because Magnus knows like five
 

5813
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:06,430
stupid because Magnus knows like five
people

01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,149
not in not in his life but his team is
fine that's very close in that group

5818
01:50:11,149 --> 01:50:11,159
fine that's very close in that group
 

5819
01:50:11,159 --> 01:50:12,890
fine that's very close in that group
right but to The Outsider that sounds

5820
01:50:12,890 --> 01:50:12,900
right but to The Outsider that sounds
 

5821
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:14,450
right but to The Outsider that sounds
like a very legitimate Theory how could

5822
01:50:14,450 --> 01:50:14,460
like a very legitimate Theory how could
 

5823
01:50:14,460 --> 01:50:16,790
like a very legitimate Theory how could
how else can you explain Han said he

5824
01:50:16,790 --> 01:50:16,800
how else can you explain Han said he
 

5825
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:18,290
how else can you explain Han said he
knew before the game what was going to

5826
01:50:18,290 --> 01:50:18,300
knew before the game what was going to
 

5827
01:50:18,300 --> 01:50:21,890
knew before the game what was going to
happen Magnus senses a mole he's not no

5828
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:21,900
happen Magnus senses a mole he's not no
 

5829
01:50:21,900 --> 01:50:25,010
happen Magnus senses a mole he's not no
by the way just uh just so uh I know

5830
01:50:25,010 --> 01:50:25,020
by the way just uh just so uh I know
 

5831
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:27,410
by the way just uh just so uh I know
like if that was forget the cheating

5832
01:50:27,410 --> 01:50:27,420
like if that was forget the cheating
 

5833
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:31,370
like if that was forget the cheating
aside if you knew doesn't matter how the

5834
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:31,380
aside if you knew doesn't matter how the
 

5835
01:50:31,380 --> 01:50:33,530
aside if you knew doesn't matter how the
opening your opponent is going to do

5836
01:50:33,530 --> 01:50:33,540
opening your opponent is going to do
 

5837
01:50:33,540 --> 01:50:36,109
opening your opponent is going to do
they prepared is that a significant help

5838
01:50:36,109 --> 01:50:36,119
they prepared is that a significant help
 

5839
01:50:36,119 --> 01:50:37,990
they prepared is that a significant help
to you

5840
01:50:37,990 --> 01:50:38,000
to you
 

5841
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:41,629
to you
if that opening is ultra sharp and

5842
01:50:41,629 --> 01:50:41,639
if that opening is ultra sharp and
 

5843
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:45,050
if that opening is ultra sharp and
requires basically the game to be on the

5844
01:50:45,050 --> 01:50:45,060
requires basically the game to be on the
 

5845
01:50:45,060 --> 01:50:47,510
requires basically the game to be on the
knife's edge yeah yes meaning one

5846
01:50:47,510 --> 01:50:47,520
knife's edge yeah yes meaning one
 

5847
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:49,669
knife's edge yeah yes meaning one
mistake from can be fatal

5848
01:50:49,669 --> 01:50:49,679
mistake from can be fatal
 

5849
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,169
mistake from can be fatal
because then you can look up what the

5850
01:50:51,169 --> 01:50:51,179
because then you can look up what the
 

5851
01:50:51,179 --> 01:50:53,209
because then you can look up what the
engine says you can know everything you

5852
01:50:53,209 --> 01:50:53,219
engine says you can know everything you
 

5853
01:50:53,219 --> 01:50:54,649
engine says you can know everything you
can know all the possibilities so even

5854
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:54,659
can know all the possibilities so even
 

5855
01:50:54,659 --> 01:50:56,030
can know all the possibilities so even
if your opponent goes off that engine

5856
01:50:56,030 --> 01:50:56,040
if your opponent goes off that engine
 

5857
01:50:56,040 --> 01:50:59,209
if your opponent goes off that engine
path you will know how to punish it in

5858
01:50:59,209 --> 01:50:59,219
path you will know how to punish it in
 

5859
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:01,370
path you will know how to punish it in
this case

5860
01:51:01,370 --> 01:51:01,380
this case
 

5861
01:51:01,380 --> 01:51:04,490
this case
what happened basically was Magnus

5862
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:04,500
what happened basically was Magnus
 

5863
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,590
what happened basically was Magnus
played a line that if completely

5864
01:51:06,590 --> 01:51:06,600
played a line that if completely
 

5865
01:51:06,600 --> 01:51:09,229
played a line that if completely
optimally punished would have given Hans

5866
01:51:09,229 --> 01:51:09,239
optimally punished would have given Hans
 

5867
01:51:09,239 --> 01:51:11,270
optimally punished would have given Hans
a slightly better position and that's

5868
01:51:11,270 --> 01:51:11,280
a slightly better position and that's
 

5869
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:13,330
a slightly better position and that's
what happened but then he also

5870
01:51:13,330 --> 01:51:13,340
what happened but then he also
 

5871
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:15,350
what happened but then he also
demolished him in that later phase of

5872
01:51:15,350 --> 01:51:15,360
demolished him in that later phase of
 

5873
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,510
demolished him in that later phase of
the game

5874
01:51:17,510 --> 01:51:17,520
the game
 

5875
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:22,669
the game
yes and then okay so uh Magnus designs

5876
01:51:22,669 --> 01:51:22,679
yes and then okay so uh Magnus designs
 

5877
01:51:22,679 --> 01:51:27,050
yes and then okay so uh Magnus designs
go silent the Chess World goes crazy uh

5878
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:27,060
go silent the Chess World goes crazy uh
 

5879

for what was going to happen in this

6016
01:53:59,090 --> 01:53:59,100
for what was going to happen in this
 

6017
01:53:59,100 --> 01:54:01,850
for what was going to happen in this
game Magnus plays one move

6018
01:54:01,850 --> 01:54:01,860
game Magnus plays one move
 

6019
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:04,070
game Magnus plays one move
and resigns

6020
01:54:04,070 --> 01:54:04,080
and resigns
 

6021
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,870
and resigns
actually I imagine he didn't want to

6022
01:54:05,870 --> 01:54:05,880
actually I imagine he didn't want to
 

6023
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:07,370
actually I imagine he didn't want to
play one move I imagine he would have

6024
01:54:07,370 --> 01:54:07,380
play one move I imagine he would have
 

6025
01:54:07,380 --> 01:54:09,470
play one move I imagine he would have
resigned the game as it was starting but

6026
01:54:09,470 --> 01:54:09,480
resigned the game as it was starting but
 

6027
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:11,149
resigned the game as it was starting but
I think some websites don't let you

6028
01:54:11,149 --> 01:54:11,159
I think some websites don't let you
 

6029
01:54:11,159 --> 01:54:12,890
I think some websites don't let you
resign before you make one move because

6030
01:54:12,890 --> 01:54:12,900
resign before you make one move because
 

6031
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:15,229
resign before you make one move because
then the game isn't counted yeah so I

6032
01:54:15,229 --> 01:54:15,239
then the game isn't counted yeah so I
 

6033
01:54:15,239 --> 01:54:16,729
then the game isn't counted yeah so I
think he didn't want to play at all but

6034
01:54:16,729 --> 01:54:16,739
think he didn't want to play at all but
 

6035
01:54:16,739 --> 01:54:18,169
think he didn't want to play at all but
he played one move and that made it even

6036
01:54:18,169 --> 01:54:18,179
he played one move and that made it even
 

6037
01:54:18,179 --> 01:54:19,729
he played one move and that made it even
more epic I suppose

6038
01:54:19,729 --> 01:54:19,739
more epic I suppose
 

6039
01:54:19,739 --> 01:54:22,790
more epic I suppose
and he resigned and that was that was

6040
01:54:22,790 --> 01:54:22,800

6041
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:25,129

him very appealing in that way yes so
right now late September 2022 the

6374
02:00:46,790 --> 02:00:46,800
right now late September 2022 the
 

6375
02:00:46,800 --> 02:00:48,430
right now late September 2022 the
current

6376
02:00:48,430 --> 02:00:48,440
current
 

6377
02:00:48,440 --> 02:00:51,530
current
environment is such that Hans hasn't

6378
02:00:51,530 --> 02:00:51,540
environment is such that Hans hasn't
 

6379
02:00:51,540 --> 02:00:53,209
environment is such that Hans hasn't
said anything in weeks

6380
02:00:53,209 --> 02:00:53,219
said anything in weeks
 

6381
02:00:53,219 --> 02:00:55,430
said anything in weeks
and

6382
02:00:55,430 --> 02:00:55,440
and
 

6383
02:00:55,440 --> 02:00:57,609
and
people are sort of

6384
02:00:57,609 --> 02:00:57,619
people are sort of
 

6385
02:00:57,619 --> 02:01:01,910
people are sort of
dissecting every bit of circumstantial

6386
02:01:01,910 --> 02:01:01,920
dissecting every bit of circumstantial
 

6387
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:03,350
dissecting every bit of circumstantial
evidence that they can and they're

6388
02:01:03,350 --> 02:01:03,360
evidence that they can and they're
 

6389
02:01:03,360 --> 02:01:05,510
evidence that they can and they're
trying to present the case

6390
02:01:05,510 --> 02:01:05,520
trying to present the case
 

6391
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:08,209
trying to present the case
I don't even know to who ultimately

6392
02:01:08,209 --> 02:01:08,219
I don't even know to who ultimately
 

6393
02:01:08,219 --> 02:01:10,550
I don't even know to who ultimately
I guess it would be the feed a cheating

6394
02:01:10,550 --> 02:01:10,560
I guess it would be the feed a cheating
 

6395
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,129
I guess it would be the feed a cheating
anti-sheating commission or whatever it

6396
02:01:13,129 --> 02:01:13,139
anti-sheating commission or whatever it
 

6397
02:01:13,139 --> 02:01:14,990
anti-sheating commission or whatever it
might be to you essentially I mean to

6398
02:01:14,990 --> 02:01:15,000
might be to you essentially I mean to
 

6399
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:16,970
might be to you essentially I mean to
people with the platform it could be to

6400
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:16,980
people with the platform it could be to
 

6401
02:01:16,980 --> 02:01:19,550
people with the platform it could be to
present convincing evidence to where the

6402
02:01:19,550 --> 02:01:19,560
present convincing evidence to where the
 

6403
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:21,350
present convincing evidence to where the
the people

6404
02:01:21,350 --> 02:01:21,360
the people
 

6405
02:01:21,360 --> 02:01:23,209
the people
the people are convinced of one way or

6406
02:01:23,209 --> 02:01:23,219
the people are convinced of one way or
 

6407
02:01:23,219 --> 02:01:24,950
the people are convinced of one way or
the other because you're for people who

6408
02:01:24,950 --> 02:01:24,960
the other because you're for people who
 

6409
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:25,910
the other because you're for people who
don't know and you should definitely

6410
02:01:25,910 --> 02:01:25,920
don't know and you should definitely
 

6411
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,189
don't know and you should definitely
follow Gotham chess you've been on this

6412
02:01:28,189 --> 02:01:28,199
follow Gotham chess you've been on this
 

6413
02:01:28,199 --> 02:01:30,649
follow Gotham chess you've been on this
you've covered it a lot and I'm sure if

6414
02:01:30,649 --> 02:01:30,659
you've covered it a lot and I'm sure if
 

6415
02:01:30,659 --> 02:01:32,149
you've covered it a lot and I'm sure if
anything comes out you'll cover it more

6416
02:01:32,149 --> 02:01:32,159
anything comes out you'll cover it more
 

6417
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:34,129
anything comes out you'll cover it more
but you've been quite balanced and

6418
02:01:34,129 --> 02:01:34,139
but you've been quite balanced and
 

6419
02:01:34,139 --> 02:01:35,510
but you've been quite balanced and
thoughtful and kind of objective about

6420
02:01:35,510 --> 02:01:35,520
thoughtful and kind of objective about
 

6421
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,390
thoughtful and kind of objective about
the whole thing yeah so the reason for

6422
02:01:38,390 --> 02:01:38,400
the whole thing yeah so the reason for
 

6423
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,089
the whole thing yeah so the reason for
that is

6424
02:01:40,089 --> 02:01:40,099
that is
 

6425
02:01:40,099 --> 02:01:45,770
that is
I understand the power that I wield with

6426
02:01:45,770 --> 02:01:45,780
I understand the power that I wield with
 

6427
02:01:45,780 --> 02:01:50,330
I understand the power that I wield with
anything and if I say one sentence the

6428
02:01:50,330 --> 02:01:50,340
anything and if I say one sentence the
 

6429
02:01:50,340 --> 02:01:52,970
anything and if I say one sentence the
wrong way I might be sending 10 000

6430
02:01:52,970 --> 02:01:52,980
wrong way I might be sending 10 000
 

6431
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:56,089
wrong way I might be sending 10 000
people or more to go do something yeah

6432
02:01:56,089 --> 02:01:56,099
people or more to go do something yeah
 

6433
02:01:56,099 --> 02:01:58,729
people or more to go do something yeah
and I hate that I want to present the

6434
02:01:58,729 --> 02:01:58,739
and I hate that I want to present the
 

6435
02:01:58,739 --> 02:02:00,350
and I hate that I want to present the
evidence and I want the video to end and

6436
02:02:00,350 --> 02:02:00,360
evidence and I want the video to end and
 

6437
02:02:00,360 --> 02:02:01,970
evidence and I want the video to end and
people go okay

6438
02:02:01,970 --> 02:02:01,980
people go okay
 

6439
02:02:01,980 --> 02:02:04,910
people go okay
I understand not I'm gonna go I'm gonna

6440
02:02:04,910 --> 02:02:04,920
I understand not I'm gonna go I'm gonna
 

6441
02:02:04,920 --> 02:02:06,470
I understand not I'm gonna go I'm gonna
go [\h__\h] someone up yeah you know what I

6442
02:02:06,470 --> 02:02:06,480
go [\h__\h] someone up yeah you know what I
 

6443
02:02:06,480 --> 02:02:09,350
go [\h__\h] someone up yeah you know what I
mean like because that's and I also

6444
02:02:09,350 --> 02:02:09,360
mean like because that's and I also
 

6445
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:13,370
mean like because that's and I also
believe that even if Han's even if Hans

6446
02:02:13,370 --> 02:02:13,380
believe that even if Han's even if Hans
 

6447
02:02:13,380 --> 02:02:15,109
believe that even if Han's even if Hans
is guilty

6448
02:02:15,109 --> 02:02:15,119
is guilty
 

6449
02:02:15,119 --> 02:02:17,209
is guilty
this goes all the way back

6450
02:02:17,209 --> 02:02:17,219
this goes all the way back
 

6451
02:02:17,219 --> 02:02:19,850
this goes all the way back
he's a human being yeah

6452
02:02:19,850 --> 02:02:19,860
he's a human being yeah
 

6453
02:02:19,860 --> 02:02:21,470
he's a human being yeah
and

6454
02:02:21,470 --> 02:02:21,480
and
 

6455
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:23,689
and
you can argue that cheater's got to be

6456
02:02:23,689 --> 02:02:23,699
you can argue that cheater's got to be
 

6457
02:02:23,699 --> 02:02:26,510
you can argue that cheater's got to be
punished and you can argue that people

6458
02:02:26,510 --> 02:02:26,520
punished and you can argue that people
 

6459
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:28,250
punished and you can argue that people
who do things wrong you shouldn't feel

6460
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:28,260
who do things wrong you shouldn't feel
 

6461
02:02:28,260 --> 02:02:29,810
who do things wrong you shouldn't feel
any sort of compassion

6462
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:29,820
any sort of compassion
 

6463
02:02:29,820 --> 02:02:31,609
any sort of compassion
but I would hate to have the whole world

6464
02:02:31,609 --> 02:02:31,619
but I would hate to have the whole world
 

6465
02:02:31,619 --> 02:02:33,470
but I would hate to have the whole world
pointing at their fingers at me the

6466
02:02:33,470 --> 02:02:33,480
pointing at their fingers at me the
 

6467
02:02:33,480 --> 02:02:35,089
pointing at their fingers at me the
entire world that I've known my entire

6468
02:02:35,089 --> 02:02:35,099
entire world that I've known my entire
 

6469
02:02:35,099 --> 02:02:38,689
entire world that I've known my entire
life and even if I if I messed up

6470
02:02:38,689 --> 02:02:38,699
life and even if I if I messed up
 

6471
02:02:38,699 --> 02:02:41,149
life and even if I if I messed up
there's still a world after chess there

6472
02:02:41,149 --> 02:02:41,159
there's still a world after chess there
 

6473
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:43,070
there's still a world after chess there
might still even be a world in chess I

6474
02:02:43,070 --> 02:02:43,080
might still even be a world in chess I
 

6475
02:02:43,080 --> 02:02:44,450
might still even be a world in chess I
don't know but

6476
02:02:44,450 --> 02:02:44,460
don't know but
 

6477
02:02:44,460 --> 02:02:47,450
don't know but
that stuff it doesn't make me it doesn't

6478
02:02:47,450 --> 02:02:47,460
that stuff it doesn't make me it doesn't
 

6479
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:50,570
that stuff it doesn't make me it doesn't
make me feel good to present all of the

6480
02:02:50,570 --> 02:02:50,580
make me feel good to present all of the
 

6481
02:02:50,580 --> 02:02:52,669
make me feel good to present all of the
circumstantial evidence in my videos and

6482
02:02:52,669 --> 02:02:52,679
circumstantial evidence in my videos and
 

6483
02:02:52,679 --> 02:02:55,010
circumstantial evidence in my videos and
start being like yeah it looks you know

6484
02:02:55,010 --> 02:02:55,020
start being like yeah it looks you know
 

6485
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:57,350
start being like yeah it looks you know
so but at the same time you deeply care

6486
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:57,360
so but at the same time you deeply care
 

6487
02:02:57,360 --> 02:02:59,570
so but at the same time you deeply care
about Chess and the chess community and

6488
02:02:59,570 --> 02:02:59,580
about Chess and the chess community and
 

6489
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:02,030
about Chess and the chess community and
there's some sense where

6490
02:03:02,030 --> 02:03:02,040
there's some sense where
 

6491
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,850
there's some sense where
was it you as a Magnus that said that

6492
02:03:04,850 --> 02:03:04,860
was it you as a Magnus that said that
 

6493
02:03:04,860 --> 02:03:07,689
was it you as a Magnus that said that
cheating poses an existential threat

6494
02:03:07,689 --> 02:03:07,699
cheating poses an existential threat
 

6495
02:03:07,699 --> 02:03:10,189
cheating poses an existential threat
I mean there is some aspect of Truth to

6496
02:03:10,189 --> 02:03:10,199
I mean there is some aspect of Truth to
 

6497
02:03:10,199 --> 02:03:11,629
I mean there is some aspect of Truth to
that which is like

6498
02:03:11,629 --> 02:03:11,639
that which is like
 

6499
02:03:11,639 --> 02:03:13,970
that which is like
you know we the chess is in a state

6500
02:03:13,970 --> 02:03:13,980
you know we the chess is in a state
 

6501
02:03:13,980 --> 02:03:17,450
you know we the chess is in a state
where Bots uh chess engines are much

6502
02:03:17,450 --> 02:03:17,460
where Bots uh chess engines are much
 

6503
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:19,550
where Bots uh chess engines are much
better than humans yeah and we're living

6504
02:03:19,550 --> 02:03:19,560
better than humans yeah and we're living
 

6505
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:21,470
better than humans yeah and we're living
in a world where technology becomes

6506
02:03:21,470 --> 02:03:21,480
in a world where technology becomes
 

6507
02:03:21,480 --> 02:03:23,629
in a world where technology becomes
easier and easier to integrate with with

6508
02:03:23,629 --> 02:03:23,639
easier and easier to integrate with with
 

6509
02:03:23,639 --> 02:03:25,850
easier and easier to integrate with with
human beings whether you put in some

6510
02:03:25,850 --> 02:03:25,860
human beings whether you put in some
 

6511
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:29,570
human beings whether you put in some
orifice or elsewhere and that that does

6512
02:03:29,570 --> 02:03:29,580
orifice or elsewhere and that that does
 

6513
02:03:29,580 --> 02:03:32,750
orifice or elsewhere and that that does
pose a threat to um to our ability to

6514
02:03:32,750 --> 02:03:32,760
pose a threat to um to our ability to
 

6515
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:34,430
pose a threat to um to our ability to
trust that a world champion is indeed a

6516
02:03:34,430 --> 02:03:34,440
trust that a world champion is indeed a
 

6517
02:03:34,440 --> 02:03:37,129
trust that a world champion is indeed a
world champion that somebody we think is

6518
02:03:37,129 --> 02:03:37,139
world champion that somebody we think is
 

6519
02:03:37,139 --> 02:03:40,070
world champion that somebody we think is
good is indeed good and so there is some

6520
02:03:40,070 --> 02:03:40,080
good is indeed good and so there is some
 

6521
02:03:40,080 --> 02:03:43,189
good is indeed good and so there is some
aspect to the ecosystem

6522
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:43,199
aspect to the ecosystem
 

6523
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:45,830
aspect to the ecosystem
that should punish cheating and perhaps

6524
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:45,840
that should punish cheating and perhaps
 

6525
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:47,870
that should punish cheating and perhaps
over punished cheating and the other

6526
02:03:47,870 --> 02:03:47,880
over punished cheating and the other
 

6527
02:03:47,880 --> 02:03:49,030
over punished cheating and the other
thing is

6528
02:03:49,030 --> 02:03:49,040
thing is
 

6529
02:03:49,040 --> 02:03:52,430
thing is
in sport you can take PDS and have

6530

still a chance you can lose
 

6539
02:04:03,420 --> 02:04:05,510

non-ped and ped user is significantly
 

6545
02:04:10,260 --> 02:04:12,770
non-ped and ped user is significantly
more noticeable but

6555
02:04:21,260 --> 02:04:24,290
yeah you decide when the game is over
you can fake bad moves

6556
02:04:24,290 --> 02:04:24,300
you can fake bad moves
 

6557
02:04:24,300 --> 02:04:26,750
you can fake bad moves
you can fake everything you can even if

to avoid getting detected so you can
 

6565
02:04:33,480 --> 02:04:37,250
to avoid getting detected so you can
create Bots that are 2800 like you can

6566
02:04:37,250 --> 02:04:37,260
create Bots that are 2800 like you can
 

6567
02:04:37,260 --> 02:04:39,290
create Bots that are 2800 like you can
also just not listen if you know all the

best moves but choose to play on your
 

6571
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,470
best moves but choose to play on your
own oh I made a mistake not a big deal

own oh I made a mistake not a big deal
 

6573
02:04:42,480 --> 02:04:44,750
own oh I made a mistake not a big deal
you could yes Bots are all at a

6574
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:44,760
you could yes Bots are all at a
 

6575
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:48,669
you could yes Bots are all at a
different level but if you were to cheat

6576
02:04:48,669 --> 02:04:48,679
different level but if you were to cheat
 

6577
02:04:48,679 --> 02:04:52,250
different level but if you were to cheat
that you you play God you can decide

that you you play God you can decide
 

6579
02:04:52,260 --> 02:04:54,470
that you you play God you can decide
when you make your move and when the

engine makes its movement if you know
 

6583
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:57,470
engine makes its movement if you know
the top four lines of the engine you

the top four lines of the engine you
 

6585
02:04:57,480 --> 02:04:59,990
the top four lines of the engine you
choose the fourth one so in hindsight

with a lot of criminals I feel like part
of like the ma like Mass murderers would

6648
02:06:12,050 --> 02:06:12,060
of like the ma like Mass murderers would
 

6649

be serial killers I feel like a lot of
 

6651
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,070
be serial killers I feel like a lot of
it is they can get away with it the the

6652
02:06:16,070 --> 02:06:16,080
it is they can get away with it the the
 

6653
02:06:16,080 --> 02:06:17,450
it is they can get away with it the the
fact that they

6654
02:06:17,450 --> 02:06:17,460
fact that they
 

6655
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:20,270

like they like everyone else is a sucker
and they figured out how to do this evil

6658
02:06:22,370 --> 02:06:22,380
and they figured out how to do this evil
 

6659
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:23,109
and they figured out how to do this evil
thing

6660
02:06:23,109 --> 02:06:23,119
thing
 

6661
02:06:23,119 --> 02:06:25,790
thing
and uh obviously cheating is nowhere

6662
02:06:25,790 --> 02:06:25,800
and uh obviously cheating is nowhere
 

6663
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:27,830
and uh obviously cheating is nowhere
close to that but the but there's still

6664
02:06:27,830 --> 02:06:27,840
close to that but the but there's still
 

6665
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:30,890
close to that but the but there's still
a feeling of getting away with it yeah I

6666
02:06:30,890 --> 02:06:30,900
a feeling of getting away with it yeah I
 

6667
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:31,910
a feeling of getting away with it yeah I
wonder

6668
02:06:31,910 --> 02:06:31,920
wonder
 

6669
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,649
wonder
and you're pretty objective on the whole

6670
02:06:33,649 --> 02:06:33,659
and you're pretty objective on the whole
 

6671
02:06:33,659 --> 02:06:37,010
and you're pretty objective on the whole
thing like where if you were

6672
02:06:37,010 --> 02:06:37,020
thing like where if you were
 

6673
02:06:37,020 --> 02:06:38,990
thing like where if you were
um a betting man what would you say is

6674
02:06:38,990 --> 02:06:39,000
um a betting man what would you say is
 

6675
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,189
um a betting man what would you say is
the probability

6676
02:06:40,189 --> 02:06:40,199
the probability
 

6677
02:06:40,199 --> 02:06:42,350
the probability
and are you changing day by day in your

6678
02:06:42,350 --> 02:06:42,360
and are you changing day by day in your
 

6679
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:43,850
and are you changing day by day in your
head what's the probability that Hans

6680
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:43,860
head what's the probability that Hans
 

6681
02:06:43,860 --> 02:06:45,729
head what's the probability that Hans
cheated

6682
02:06:45,729 --> 02:06:45,739
cheated
 

6683
02:06:45,739 --> 02:06:49,250

how it's possible to cheat like if you
 

7681
02:25:54,960 --> 02:25:56,809
how it's possible to cheat like if you
and I

7682
02:25:56,809 --> 02:25:56,819
and I
 

7683
02:25:56,819 --> 02:25:58,309

to figure out how can you beat them
 

7691
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:05,690

over the board chess what are the ways
 

7695
02:26:07,800 --> 02:26:09,050
over the board chess what are the ways
yeah

7696
02:26:09,050 --> 02:26:09,060
yeah
 

7697
02:26:09,060 --> 02:26:12,710
yeah
that's where I lose the thread because I

7698
02:26:12,710 --> 02:26:12,720
that's where I lose the thread because I
 

7699
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:13,730
that's where I lose the thread because I
don't know

7700
02:26:13,730 --> 02:26:13,740
don't know
 

7701
02:26:13,740 --> 02:26:16,309
don't know
that's what I immediately went to it's

7702
02:26:16,309 --> 02:26:16,319
that's what I immediately went to it's
 

7703
02:26:16,319 --> 02:26:18,050
that's what I immediately went to it's
like the engineering challenge of

7704
02:26:18,050 --> 02:26:18,060
like the engineering challenge of
 

7705
02:26:18,060 --> 02:26:19,309
like the engineering challenge of
cheating right well that's because

7706
02:26:19,309 --> 02:26:19,319
cheating right well that's because
 

7707
02:26:19,319 --> 02:26:20,450
cheating right well that's because
that's

7708
02:26:20,450 --> 02:26:20,460
that's
 

7709
02:26:20,460 --> 02:26:22,849
that's
like how good I mean you're not good at

like how good I mean you're not good at
 

7711
02:26:22,859 --> 02:26:24,770
like how good I mean you're not good at
creating cheating in over the world

7712
02:26:24,770 --> 02:26:24,780
creating cheating in over the world
 

7713
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:26,330
creating cheating in over the world
situation I'm just saying you your brain

7714
02:26:26,330 --> 02:26:26,340
situation I'm just saying you your brain
 

7715
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:28,070
situation I'm just saying you your brain
works differently I just choose to not

7716
02:26:28,070 --> 02:26:28,080
works differently I just choose to not
 

7717
02:26:28,080 --> 02:26:30,710

like immediately attracted to pulling at
 

7725
02:26:36,780 --> 02:26:38,750
like immediately attracted to pulling at
that thread of like how would you [\h__\h]

7726
02:26:38,750 --> 02:26:38,760
that thread of like how would you [\h__\h]
 

7727
02:26:38,760 --> 02:26:41,809
that thread of like how would you [\h__\h]
with the system yeah my mind stops at ah

7728
02:26:41,809 --> 02:26:41,819
with the system yeah my mind stops at ah
 

7729
02:26:41,819 --> 02:26:42,770
with the system yeah my mind stops at ah
that would have to be a really

7730
02:26:42,770 --> 02:26:42,780
that would have to be a really
 

7731
02:26:42,780 --> 02:26:44,510
that would have to be a really
sophisticated thing and that's it it

7732
02:26:44,510 --> 02:26:44,520
sophisticated thing and that's it it
 

7733
02:26:44,520 --> 02:26:46,849
sophisticated thing and that's it it
doesn't go any further my brain every

7734
02:26:46,849 --> 02:26:46,859
doesn't go any further my brain every
 

7735
02:26:46,859 --> 02:26:48,469
doesn't go any further my brain every
day thinks about the best way to

7736
02:26:48,469 --> 02:26:48,479
day thinks about the best way to
 

7737
02:26:48,479 --> 02:26:50,870
day thinks about the best way to
compartmentalize chess into a digestible

7738
02:26:50,870 --> 02:26:50,880
compartmentalize chess into a digestible
 

7739
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:54,170
compartmentalize chess into a digestible
format and put it out into content chess

7740
02:26:54,170 --> 02:26:54,180
format and put it out into content chess
 

7741
02:26:54,180 --> 02:26:55,429
format and put it out into content chess
that's what I think on the board chess

7742
02:26:55,429 --> 02:26:55,439
that's what I think on the board chess

the YouTube I just think about that
 

7749
02:27:01,439 --> 02:27:03,110
the YouTube I just think about that
that's currently where my mind is fully

7750
02:27:03,110 --> 02:27:03,120
that's currently where my mind is fully
 

7751
02:27:03,120 --> 02:27:04,910

so that's what you think yes see for me
 

7755
02:27:07,920 --> 02:27:10,670
so that's what you think yes see for me
because I've built chess engines that

7756
02:27:10,670 --> 02:27:10,680
because I've built chess engines that
 

7757
02:27:10,680 --> 02:27:13,610
because I've built chess engines that
without understanding chess much

7761
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:17,990
as like you know as anyone does who's
interested in AI you build all kinds of

7762
02:27:17,990 --> 02:27:18,000
interested in AI you build all kinds of
 

7763
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:19,610
interested in AI you build all kinds of
systems that do all kinds of stuff in

7764
02:27:19,610 --> 02:27:19,620
systems that do all kinds of stuff in
 

7765
02:27:19,620 --> 02:27:22,130

different AI algorithms

7774
02:27:31,790 --> 02:27:31,800
different AI algorithms
 

7775
02:27:31,800 --> 02:27:33,530
different AI algorithms
um from search to machine learning and

7776
02:27:33,530 --> 02:27:33,540
um from search to machine learning and
 

7777
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:36,530
um from search to machine learning and
so on but to me cheating is like it's

7778
02:27:36,530 --> 02:27:36,540
so on but to me cheating is like it's
 

7779
02:27:36,540 --> 02:27:39,950
so on but to me cheating is like it's
it's a similar kind of ideas well if I

7780
02:27:39,950 --> 02:27:39,960
it's a similar kind of ideas well if I
 

7781
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,510
it's a similar kind of ideas well if I
make it a board instead of eight by

7782
02:27:41,510 --> 02:27:41,520
make it a board instead of eight by
 

7783
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:44,330
make it a board instead of eight by
eight to ten by ten I caught us to

7784
02:27:44,330 --> 02:27:44,340
eight to ten by ten I caught us to
 

7785
02:27:44,340 --> 02:27:46,190
eight to ten by ten I caught us to
change things and with cheating it's

7786
02:27:46,190 --> 02:27:46,200
change things and with cheating it's
 

7787
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:48,170
change things and with cheating it's
almost like expanding the engineering

7788
02:27:48,170 --> 02:27:48,180
almost like expanding the engineering
 

7789
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:50,510

cheating is horrible and everything

7794
02:27:56,349 --> 02:27:56,359
cheating is horrible and everything
 

7795
02:27:56,359 --> 02:27:57,950
cheating is horrible and everything
but

7796
02:27:57,950 --> 02:27:57,960

AI engine and human working together in
 

7801
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:05,450
AI engine and human working together in
interesting ways it forgets us just

7802
02:28:05,450 --> 02:28:05,460
interesting ways it forgets us just
 

7803
02:28:05,460 --> 02:28:08,330
interesting ways it forgets us just
machine and human working together to

7804
02:28:08,330 --> 02:28:08,340
machine and human working together to
 

7805
02:28:08,340 --> 02:28:10,010
machine and human working together to
expand the capability of the human is

7806
02:28:10,010 --> 02:28:10,020
expand the capability of the human is
 

7807
02:28:10,020 --> 02:28:11,990
expand the capability of the human is
really fascinating and that's like a

7808
02:28:11,990 --> 02:28:12,000
really fascinating and that's like a
 

7809
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:14,570
really fascinating and that's like a
beautiful thing to me of course the

7810
02:28:14,570 --> 02:28:14,580
beautiful thing to me of course the
 

7811
02:28:14,580 --> 02:28:17,150
beautiful thing to me of course the
purely for the chess game it ruins the

7812
02:28:17,150 --> 02:28:17,160
purely for the chess game it ruins the
 

7813
02:28:17,160 --> 02:28:19,429
purely for the chess game it ruins the
game yeah but

7814
02:28:19,429 --> 02:28:19,439
game yeah but
 

7815
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:20,389
game yeah but
foreign

7816

I just like thinking of how AI can

7818
02:28:23,570 --> 02:28:23,580
I just like thinking of how AI can
 

7819
02:28:23,580 --> 02:28:25,670
I just like thinking of how AI can
interact with the human

7820
02:28:25,670 --> 02:28:25,680
interact with the human
 

7821
02:28:25,680 --> 02:28:28,790
interact with the human
uh in in ways that doesn't that it's

7822
02:28:28,790 --> 02:28:28,800
uh in in ways that doesn't that it's
 

7823
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:30,950
uh in in ways that doesn't that it's
frictionless like uh

7824
02:28:30,950 --> 02:28:30,960
frictionless like uh
 

7825
02:28:30,960 --> 02:28:32,809
frictionless like uh
you know like neural link brain computer

7826
02:28:32,809 --> 02:28:32,819
you know like neural link brain computer
 

7827
02:28:32,819 --> 02:28:35,330
you know like neural link brain computer
interfaces dream of directly connecting

7828
02:28:35,330 --> 02:28:35,340
interfaces dream of directly connecting
 

7829
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:39,050
interfaces dream of directly connecting
the human brain to AI system the problem

7830
02:28:39,050 --> 02:28:39,060
the human brain to AI system the problem
 

7831
02:28:39,060 --> 02:28:40,910
the human brain to AI system the problem
in this case is I don't think the human

7832
02:28:40,910 --> 02:28:40,920
in this case is I don't think the human
 

7833
02:28:40,920 --> 02:28:44,150
in this case is I don't think the human
and the AI are interacting together the

7834
02:28:44,150 --> 02:28:44,160
and the AI are interacting together the
 

7835
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:46,190
and the AI are interacting together the
AI dominates the human is just the

7836
02:28:46,190 --> 02:28:46,200
AI dominates the human is just the
 

7837
02:28:46,200 --> 02:28:48,290
AI dominates the human is just the
mechanism that makes the moves I

7838
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:48,300
mechanism that makes the moves I
 

7839
02:28:48,300 --> 02:28:51,110
mechanism that makes the moves I
actually played if I may I I don't maybe

7840
02:28:51,110 --> 02:28:51,120
actually played if I may I I don't maybe
 

7841
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:53,210
actually played if I may I I don't maybe
I need your advice on this I thought and

7842
02:28:53,210 --> 02:28:53,220
I need your advice on this I thought and
 

7843
02:28:53,220 --> 02:28:55,670
I need your advice on this I thought and
I told myself I won't do it and then a

7844
02:28:55,670 --> 02:28:55,680
I told myself I won't do it and then a
 

7845
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,910
I told myself I won't do it and then a
friend of mine said uh and the a couple

7846
02:28:58,910 --> 02:28:58,920
friend of mine said uh and the a couple
 

7847
02:28:58,920 --> 02:29:01,250
friend of mine said uh and the a couple
of friends and

7848
02:29:01,250 --> 02:29:01,260
of friends and
 

7849
02:29:01,260 --> 02:29:03,349
of friends and
both of them are previous guests in this

7850
02:29:03,349 --> 02:29:03,359
both of them are previous guests in this
 

7851
02:29:03,359 --> 02:29:05,570
both of them are previous guests in this
podcast so I definitely need to do it

7852
02:29:05,570 --> 02:29:05,580
podcast so I definitely need to do it
 

7853
02:29:05,580 --> 02:29:07,070
podcast so I definitely need to do it
which is

7854
02:29:07,070 --> 02:29:07,080
which is
 

7855
02:29:07,080 --> 02:29:07,790
which is
um

7856
02:29:07,790 --> 02:29:07,800
um
 

7857
02:29:07,800 --> 02:29:09,889
um
you know connect

7858
02:29:09,889 --> 02:29:09,899
you know connect
 

7859
02:29:09,899 --> 02:29:12,650
you know connect
so I already have for the chess arm that

7860
02:29:12,650 --> 02:29:12,660
so I already have for the chess arm that
 

7861
02:29:12,660 --> 02:29:14,150
so I already have for the chess arm that
I built

7862
02:29:14,150 --> 02:29:14,160
I built
 

7863
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:15,410
I built
um this computer vision on the

7864
02:29:15,410 --> 02:29:15,420
um this computer vision on the
 

7865
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:18,110
um this computer vision on the
chessboard is able to to uh extract from

7866
02:29:18,110 --> 02:29:18,120
chessboard is able to to uh extract from
 

7867
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:19,790
chessboard is able to to uh extract from
vision

7868
02:29:19,790 --> 02:29:19,800
vision
 

7869
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:20,870
vision
um

7870
02:29:20,870 --> 02:29:20,880
um
 

7871
02:29:20,880 --> 02:29:22,790
um
the way you do optical character

7872
02:29:22,790 --> 02:29:22,800
the way you do optical character
 

7873
02:29:22,800 --> 02:29:25,790
the way you do optical character
recognition extract the board so I was

7874
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:25,800
recognition extract the board so I was
 

7875
02:29:25,800 --> 02:29:28,070
recognition extract the board so I was
gonna just build that cheating system to

7876
02:29:28,070 --> 02:29:28,080
gonna just build that cheating system to
 

7877
02:29:28,080 --> 02:29:31,370
gonna just build that cheating system to
demonstrate it with the reason I thought

7878
02:29:31,370 --> 02:29:31,380
demonstrate it with the reason I thought
 

7879
02:29:31,380 --> 02:29:33,830
demonstrate it with the reason I thought
it was interesting so something we

7880
02:29:33,830 --> 02:29:33,840
it was interesting so something we
 

7881
02:29:33,840 --> 02:29:35,809
it was interesting so something we
didn't mention is I don't know who

7882
02:29:35,809 --> 02:29:35,819
didn't mention is I don't know who
 

7883
02:29:35,819 --> 02:29:37,490
didn't mention is I don't know who
started this rumor but the rumor started

7884

started this rumor but the rumor started
 

7885
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:39,110
started this rumor but the rumor started
there it might have been like anal beads

7886
02:29:39,110 --> 02:29:39,120
there it might have been like anal beads
 

7887
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:41,750
there it might have been like anal beads
that yeah I don't know who started this

7888
02:29:41,750 --> 02:29:41,760
that yeah I don't know who started this
 

7889
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,809
that yeah I don't know who started this
but I do know that Elon magnified it my

7890

Gotham chess says so every time that

7912
02:30:17,570 --> 02:30:17,580
Gotham chess says so every time that
 

7913

funny thing which I really love the the
 

7923
02:30:28,680 --> 02:30:30,770
funny thing which I really love the the
weirdest most entertaining thing

7924
02:30:30,770 --> 02:30:30,780
weirdest most entertaining thing
 

7925
02:30:30,780 --> 02:30:32,809
weirdest most entertaining thing
uh was that part of the same thing where

7926
02:30:32,809 --> 02:30:32,819
uh was that part of the same thing where

7939
02:30:48,680 --> 02:30:52,849

I will I quickly realized that there is

7940
02:30:52,849 --> 02:30:52,859
I will I quickly realized that there is
 

7941
02:30:52,859 --> 02:30:56,150
I will I quickly realized that there is
I I have to admit that I know not much

7942
02:30:56,150 --> 02:30:56,160
I I have to admit that I know not much
 

7943
02:30:56,160 --> 02:30:58,030

about sex toys
 

7945
02:30:58,040 --> 02:31:00,469
about sex toys
and then I quickly realized that there's

7946
02:31:00,469 --> 02:31:00,479
and then I quickly realized that there's
 

7947
02:31:00,479 --> 02:31:01,730
and then I quickly realized that there's
a lot of sex stories that have bluetooth

7951
02:31:04,979 --> 02:31:06,710
capability that you can interact with
so you can it's very easy to connect

7952
02:31:06,710 --> 02:31:06,720
so you can it's very easy to connect

are Bluetooth enabled so you can
 

7963
02:31:19,439 --> 02:31:20,750
are Bluetooth enabled so you can
communicate with them so this is

7964
02:31:20,750 --> 02:31:20,760
communicate with them so this is
 

7965
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:22,969
communicate with them so this is
actually pretty trivial to do not

well-being
in in the calculation yeah I actually

8466
02:40:52,610 --> 02:40:52,620
in in the calculation yeah I actually
 

8467
02:40:52,620 --> 02:40:54,530
in in the calculation yeah I actually
really hate the fact that they turned

8468
02:40:54,530 --> 02:40:54,540
really hate the fact that they turned
 

8469

doesn't hurt yeah
 

9009
02:50:33,780 --> 02:50:35,690
doesn't hurt yeah
it just does the damage and the damage

9010
02:50:35,690 --> 02:50:35,700
it just does the damage and the damage
 

9011
02:50:35,700 --> 02:50:38,150
it just does the damage and the damage
can materialize itself manifest itself

9012
02:50:38,150 --> 02:50:38,160
can materialize itself manifest itself
 

9013
02:50:38,160 --> 02:50:40,370
can materialize itself manifest itself
only years later yeah it's a weird one

9014
02:50:40,370 --> 02:50:40,380
only years later yeah it's a weird one
 

9015
02:50:40,380 --> 02:50:42,590
only years later yeah it's a weird one
but then we all die

9016
02:50:42,590 --> 02:50:42,600
but then we all die
 

9017
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:45,410
but then we all die
is there's that Braveheart speech

9018
02:50:45,410 --> 02:50:45,420
is there's that Braveheart speech
 

9019
02:50:45,420 --> 02:50:47,389
is there's that Braveheart speech
um I gotta ask you about Bots because it

9020
02:50:47,389 --> 02:50:47,399
um I gotta ask you about Bots because it
 

9021
02:50:47,399 --> 02:50:49,070
um I gotta ask you about Bots because it
to me it's like super interesting and

9022
02:50:49,070 --> 02:50:49,080
to me it's like super interesting and
 

9023
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:50,750
to me it's like super interesting and
you've played a lot of bots at different

9024
02:50:50,750 --> 02:50:50,760
you've played a lot of bots at different
 

9025
02:50:50,760 --> 02:50:53,030
you've played a lot of bots at different
levels

9026
02:50:53,030 --> 02:50:53,040
levels
 

9027
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:55,070
levels
uh you have a video called the advanced

9028
02:50:55,070 --> 02:50:55,080
uh you have a video called the advanced
 

9029
02:50:55,080 --> 02:50:58,309
uh you have a video called the advanced
chess Bots are terrifying uh so what's

9030
02:50:58,309 --> 02:50:58,319
chess Bots are terrifying uh so what's
 

9031
02:50:58,319 --> 02:50:59,870
chess Bots are terrifying uh so what's
the difference between playing humans

9032
02:50:59,870 --> 02:50:59,880
the difference between playing humans
 

9033
02:50:59,880 --> 02:51:02,510
the difference between playing humans
and Bots like you mentioned this Nelson

9034
02:51:02,510 --> 02:51:02,520
and Bots like you mentioned this Nelson
 

9035
02:51:02,520 --> 02:51:04,790
and Bots like you mentioned this Nelson
bot yeah that brings this queen out I

9036
02:51:04,790 --> 02:51:04,800
bot yeah that brings this queen out I
 

9037
02:51:04,800 --> 02:51:08,750
bot yeah that brings this queen out I
think rated 16. over 1400 okay at 12 40.

9038
02:51:08,750 --> 02:51:08,760
think rated 16. over 1400 okay at 12 40.
 

9039
02:51:08,760 --> 02:51:10,510
think rated 16. over 1400 okay at 12 40.
I think so like there's a style to those

9040
02:51:10,510 --> 02:51:10,520
I think so like there's a style to those
 

9041
02:51:10,520 --> 02:51:12,950
I think so like there's a style to those
what uh what's the difference between

9042
02:51:12,950 --> 02:51:12,960
what uh what's the difference between
 

9043
02:51:12,960 --> 02:51:14,870
what uh what's the difference between
the way Bots play and the way humans

9044
02:51:14,870 --> 02:51:14,880
the way Bots play and the way humans
 

9045
02:51:14,880 --> 02:51:17,809
the way Bots play and the way humans
play a lot of people prefer playing Bots

9046
02:51:17,809 --> 02:51:17,819
play a lot of people prefer playing Bots
 

9047
02:51:17,819 --> 02:51:19,370
play a lot of people prefer playing Bots
because they have anxiety playing other

9048
02:51:19,370 --> 02:51:19,380
because they have anxiety playing other
 

9049
02:51:19,380 --> 02:51:21,170
because they have anxiety playing other
humans it's a very legitimate thing

9050
02:51:21,170 --> 02:51:21,180
humans it's a very legitimate thing
 

9051
02:51:21,180 --> 02:51:22,969
humans it's a very legitimate thing
interesting a lot of beginners they

9052
02:51:22,969 --> 02:51:22,979
interesting a lot of beginners they
 

9053
02:51:22,979 --> 02:51:25,849
interesting a lot of beginners they
don't like live chess they get nervous

9054
02:51:25,849 --> 02:51:25,859
don't like live chess they get nervous
 

9055
02:51:25,859 --> 02:51:27,770
don't like live chess they get nervous
yellow anxiety you get close to your

9056
02:51:27,770 --> 02:51:27,780
yellow anxiety you get close to your
 

9057
02:51:27,780 --> 02:51:30,170
yellow anxiety you get close to your
highest ever rating you panic happens to

9058
02:51:30,170 --> 02:51:30,180
highest ever rating you panic happens to
 

9059
02:51:30,180 --> 02:51:32,929
highest ever rating you panic happens to
me too yeah happens to me even now

9060
02:51:32,929 --> 02:51:32,939
me too yeah happens to me even now
 

9061
02:51:32,939 --> 02:51:35,090
me too yeah happens to me even now
so definitely Bots they're somehow more

9062
02:51:35,090 --> 02:51:35,100
so definitely Bots they're somehow more
 

9063
02:51:35,100 --> 02:51:37,790
so definitely Bots they're somehow more
reliable or something yeah they're I

9064
02:51:37,790 --> 02:51:37,800
reliable or something yeah they're I
 

9065
02:51:37,800 --> 02:51:39,349
reliable or something yeah they're I
don't know but that's it's a big thing

9066
02:51:39,349 --> 02:51:39,359
don't know but that's it's a big thing
 

9067
02:51:39,359 --> 02:51:41,450
don't know but that's it's a big thing
it's a big thing and the popularity of

9068
02:51:41,450 --> 02:51:41,460
it's a big thing and the popularity of
 

9069
02:51:41,460 --> 02:51:43,070
it's a big thing and the popularity of
that video shows that people enjoy

9070
02:51:43,070 --> 02:51:43,080
that video shows that people enjoy
 

9071
02:51:43,080 --> 02:51:44,150
that video shows that people enjoy
watching

9072
02:51:44,150 --> 02:51:44,160
watching
 

9073
02:51:44,160 --> 02:51:46,610
watching
you play chess bots so

9074
02:51:46,610 --> 02:51:46,620
you play chess bots so
 

9075
02:51:46,620 --> 02:51:49,730
you play chess bots so
uh I'm gonna demystify this this might

9076
02:51:49,730 --> 02:51:49,740
uh I'm gonna demystify this this might
 

9077
02:51:49,740 --> 02:51:51,290
uh I'm gonna demystify this this might
be shocking

9078
02:51:51,290 --> 02:51:51,300
be shocking
 

9079
02:51:51,300 --> 02:51:53,630
be shocking
those Bots are all the same but for the

9080
02:51:53,630 --> 02:51:53,640
those Bots are all the same but for the
 

9081
02:51:53,640 --> 02:51:56,870
those Bots are all the same but for the
most part you could just program a bot

9082
02:51:56,870 --> 02:51:56,880
most part you could just program a bot
 

9083
02:51:56,880 --> 02:52:00,110
most part you could just program a bot
to make mistakes at a certain moment

9084
02:52:00,110 --> 02:52:00,120
to make mistakes at a certain moment
 

9085
02:52:00,120 --> 02:52:02,450
to make mistakes at a certain moment
you could program a bot to spend less

9086
02:52:02,450 --> 02:52:02,460
you could program a bot to spend less
 

9087
02:52:02,460 --> 02:52:06,110
you could program a bot to spend less
time on certain moves and it's gotten

9088
02:52:06,110 --> 02:52:06,120
time on certain moves and it's gotten
 

9089
02:52:06,120 --> 02:52:07,250
time on certain moves and it's gotten
sophisticated enough that you can

9090
02:52:07,250 --> 02:52:07,260
sophisticated enough that you can
 

9091
02:52:07,260 --> 02:52:08,769
sophisticated enough that you can
basically program it to play at whatever

9092
02:52:08,769 --> 02:52:08,779
basically program it to play at whatever
 

9093
02:52:08,779 --> 02:52:11,150
basically program it to play at whatever
more or less level

9094
02:52:11,150 --> 02:52:11,160
more or less level
 

9095
02:52:11,160 --> 02:52:13,130
more or less level
that a human plays at you say I'll play

9096
02:52:13,130 --> 02:52:13,140
that a human plays at you say I'll play
 

9097
02:52:13,140 --> 02:52:14,809
that a human plays at you say I'll play
it at 1800 level

9098
02:52:14,809 --> 02:52:14,819
it at 1800 level
 

9099
02:52:14,819 --> 02:52:17,389
it at 1800 level
so it's programmed to throw in mistakes

9100
02:52:17,389 --> 02:52:17,399
so it's programmed to throw in mistakes
 

9101
02:52:17,399 --> 02:52:19,550
so it's programmed to throw in mistakes
the problem is

9102
02:52:19,550 --> 02:52:19,560
the problem is
 

9103
02:52:19,560 --> 02:52:21,110
the problem is
and this is why it's all beginners to

9104
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:21,120
and this is why it's all beginners to
 

9105
02:52:21,120 --> 02:52:22,490
and this is why it's all beginners to
not play Bots

9106
02:52:22,490 --> 02:52:22,500
not play Bots
 

9107
02:52:22,500 --> 02:52:24,110
not play Bots
because Bots are programmed in the

9108
02:52:24,110 --> 02:52:24,120
because Bots are programmed in the
 

9109
02:52:24,120 --> 02:52:25,250
because Bots are programmed in the
following way

9110
02:52:25,250 --> 02:52:25,260
following way
 

9111
02:52:25,260 --> 02:52:28,610
following way
beginner Bots or like literal toddlers

9112
02:52:28,610 --> 02:52:28,620
beginner Bots or like literal toddlers
 

9113
02:52:28,620 --> 02:52:31,190
beginner Bots or like literal toddlers
they have no understanding whatsoever

9114
02:52:31,190 --> 02:52:31,200
they have no understanding whatsoever
 

9115
02:52:31,200 --> 02:52:32,690
they have no understanding whatsoever
they will literally lose all their

9116
02:52:32,690 --> 02:52:32,700
they will literally lose all their
 

9117
02:52:32,700 --> 02:52:33,950
they will literally lose all their
pieces but they won't lose all their

9118
02:52:33,950 --> 02:52:33,960
pieces but they won't lose all their
 

9119
02:52:33,960 --> 02:52:35,210
pieces but they won't lose all their
pieces and make mistakes they'll be

9120
02:52:35,210 --> 02:52:35,220
pieces and make mistakes they'll be
 

9121
02:52:35,220 --> 02:52:36,769
pieces and make mistakes they'll be
beginners the beginners actually know

9122
02:52:36,769 --> 02:52:36,779
beginners the beginners actually know
 

9123
02:52:36,779 --> 02:52:39,530
beginners the beginners actually know
how to start a game they just struggle

9124
02:52:39,530 --> 02:52:39,540
how to start a game they just struggle
 

9125
02:52:39,540 --> 02:52:42,410
how to start a game they just struggle
the first eight moves nine moves their

9126
02:52:42,410 --> 02:52:42,420
the first eight moves nine moves their
 

9127
02:52:42,420 --> 02:52:43,849
the first eight moves nine moves their
mistakes are very different than Bob

9141
02:52:54,420 --> 02:52:56,929
the board for no reason you can take it
yeah it's not even a blunder it's almost

9142
02:52:56,929 --> 02:52:56,939
yeah it's not even a blunder it's almost
 

9143
02:52:56,939 --> 02:52:58,969
yeah it's not even a blunder it's almost
like Randomness it's completely random

you know your openings very well you
 

9161
02:53:16,500 --> 02:53:18,170
you know your openings very well you
start navigating the middle game based

on already things that you remember and
 

9165
02:53:20,520 --> 02:53:22,429
on already things that you remember and
then basically once I chooses a bad plan

9166
02:53:22,429 --> 02:53:22,439
then basically once I chooses a bad plan
 

9167
02:53:22,439 --> 02:53:23,990
then basically once I chooses a bad plan
and the other side chooses a better plan

9168
02:53:23,990 --> 02:53:24,000
and the other side chooses a better plan
 

9169
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,330
and the other side chooses a better plan
and one thing leads to another nobody's

9170
02:53:26,330 --> 02:53:26,340
and one thing leads to another nobody's
 

9171
02:53:26,340 --> 02:53:27,769
and one thing leads to another nobody's
just recreationally hangs all their

9172
02:53:27,769 --> 02:53:27,779
just recreationally hangs all their
 

9173
02:53:27,779 --> 02:53:29,690
just recreationally hangs all their
pieces which is the way Bots are kind of

9174
02:53:29,690 --> 02:53:29,700
pieces which is the way Bots are kind of
 

9175
02:53:29,700 --> 02:53:31,250
pieces which is the way Bots are kind of
programmed to play but some of those

9176
02:53:31,250 --> 02:53:31,260
programmed to play but some of those
 

9177
02:53:31,260 --> 02:53:33,710
programmed to play but some of those
bots in that video were I remember

9178
02:53:33,710 --> 02:53:33,720
bots in that video were I remember
 

9179
02:53:33,720 --> 02:53:34,969
bots in that video were I remember
playing them

9180
02:53:34,969 --> 02:53:34,979
playing them
 

9181
02:53:34,979 --> 02:53:37,490
playing them
and uh they were they yeah they were

9182
02:53:37,490 --> 02:53:37,500
and uh they were they yeah they were
 

9183
02:53:37,500 --> 02:53:39,170
and uh they were they yeah they were
nuts uh they were out calculating me

9184
02:53:39,170 --> 02:53:39,180
nuts uh they were out calculating me
 

9185
02:53:39,180 --> 02:53:40,730
nuts uh they were out calculating me
every time I thought I had a trick in

9186
02:53:40,730 --> 02:53:40,740
every time I thought I had a trick in
 

9187
02:53:40,740 --> 02:53:43,550
every time I thought I had a trick in
two three second moment of thought it

9188
02:53:43,550 --> 02:53:43,560
two three second moment of thought it
 

9189
02:53:43,560 --> 02:53:45,230
two three second moment of thought it
would just play the best move and

9190
02:53:45,230 --> 02:53:45,240
would just play the best move and
 

9191
02:53:45,240 --> 02:53:46,670
would just play the best move and
sometimes that also happens it gets into

9192
02:53:46,670 --> 02:53:46,680
sometimes that also happens it gets into
 

9193
02:53:46,680 --> 02:53:49,309
sometimes that also happens it gets into
a dead Loop where it just starts

9194
02:53:49,309 --> 02:53:49,319
a dead Loop where it just starts
 

9195
02:53:49,319 --> 02:53:51,650
a dead Loop where it just starts
bulldozing you and it can't stop so it

9196
02:53:51,650 --> 02:53:51,660
bulldozing you and it can't stop so it
 

9197
02:53:51,660 --> 02:53:53,389
bulldozing you and it can't stop so it
made its mistakes already yeah it's

9198
02:53:53,389 --> 02:53:53,399
made its mistakes already yeah it's
 

9199
02:53:53,399 --> 02:53:55,130
made its mistakes already yeah it's
programmed to make only a few

9200
02:53:55,130 --> 02:53:55,140
programmed to make only a few
 

9201
02:53:55,140 --> 02:53:56,990
programmed to make only a few
and then it just bulldozes you the rest

9202
02:53:56,990 --> 02:53:57,000
and then it just bulldozes you the rest
 

9203
02:53:57,000 --> 02:53:58,309
and then it just bulldozes you the rest
of the way interesting I mean that's

9204
02:53:58,309 --> 02:53:58,319
of the way interesting I mean that's
 

9205
02:53:58,319 --> 02:54:01,670
of the way interesting I mean that's
that's why I I played with stockfish a

9206
02:54:01,670 --> 02:54:01,680
that's why I I played with stockfish a
 

9207
02:54:01,680 --> 02:54:03,590
that's why I I played with stockfish a
bunch

9208
02:54:03,590 --> 02:54:03,600
bunch
 

9209
02:54:03,600 --> 02:54:07,330
bunch
so I got um

9210
02:54:07,330 --> 02:54:07,340

 

9211
02:54:07,340 --> 02:54:10,070

I built for myself a bunch of different

9212
02:54:10,070 --> 02:54:10,080
I built for myself a bunch of different
 

9213
02:54:10,080 --> 02:54:11,630
I built for myself a bunch of different
chess experiments recently I had to do

9214
02:54:11,630 --> 02:54:11,640
chess experiments recently I had to do
 

9215
02:54:11,640 --> 02:54:13,250
chess experiments recently I had to do
with the chest plane bot

9216
02:54:13,250 --> 02:54:13,260
with the chest plane bot
 

9217
02:54:13,260 --> 02:54:15,170
with the chest plane bot
um but I also built the infinite

9218
02:54:15,170 --> 02:54:15,180
um but I also built the infinite
 

9219
02:54:15,180 --> 02:54:17,690
um but I also built the infinite
chessboard where it was stockfish was

9220
02:54:17,690 --> 02:54:17,700
chessboard where it was stockfish was
 

9221
02:54:17,700 --> 02:54:19,490
chessboard where it was stockfish was
playing like an infinite number of chess

9222
02:54:19,490 --> 02:54:19,500
playing like an infinite number of chess
 

9223
02:54:19,500 --> 02:54:20,690
playing like an infinite number of chess
games

9224
02:54:20,690 --> 02:54:20,700
games
 

9225
02:54:20,700 --> 02:54:23,510
games
and one of the parameters that was

9226
02:54:23,510 --> 02:54:23,520
and one of the parameters that was
 

9227
02:54:23,520 --> 02:54:25,790
and one of the parameters that was
interesting to play with is how long it

9228
02:54:25,790 --> 02:54:25,800
interesting to play with is how long it
 

9229
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:27,410
interesting to play with is how long it
gets to think about a move

9230
02:54:27,410 --> 02:54:27,420
gets to think about a move
 

9231
02:54:27,420 --> 02:54:29,269
gets to think about a move
and how that affects the rating of the

9232
02:54:29,269 --> 02:54:29,279
and how that affects the rating of the
 

9233
02:54:29,279 --> 02:54:31,969
and how that affects the rating of the
thing oh I've I did that a little bit so

9234
02:54:31,969 --> 02:54:31,979
thing oh I've I did that a little bit so
 

9235
02:54:31,979 --> 02:54:33,769
thing oh I've I did that a little bit so
that's a tricky one I'm sure people know

9236
02:54:33,769 --> 02:54:33,779
that's a tricky one I'm sure people know
 

9237
02:54:33,779 --> 02:54:35,510
that's a tricky one I'm sure people know
how to do that well but it's trick it's

9238
02:54:35,510 --> 02:54:35,520
how to do that well but it's trick it's
 

9239
02:54:35,520 --> 02:54:38,389
how to do that well but it's trick it's
not trivial to to understand like what

9240
02:54:38,389 --> 02:54:38,399
not trivial to to understand like what
 

9241
02:54:38,399 --> 02:54:41,510
not trivial to to understand like what
there must be a good formula for it but

9242
02:54:41,510 --> 02:54:41,520
there must be a good formula for it but
 

9243
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:42,950
there must be a good formula for it but
it's also interesting to think about

9244
02:54:42,950 --> 02:54:42,960
it's also interesting to think about
 

9245
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:46,870
it's also interesting to think about
like a controlled number of blunders

9246
02:54:46,870 --> 02:54:46,880
like a controlled number of blunders
 

9247
02:54:46,880 --> 02:54:50,389
like a controlled number of blunders
but it's probably better

9248
02:54:50,389 --> 02:54:50,399
but it's probably better
 

9249
02:54:50,399 --> 02:54:52,550
but it's probably better
the control number of blunders is not a

9250
02:54:52,550 --> 02:54:52,560
the control number of blunders is not a
 

9251
02:54:52,560 --> 02:54:54,950
the control number of blunders is not a
good way to build the bot yeah it's yeah

9252
02:54:54,950 --> 02:54:54,960
good way to build the bot yeah it's yeah
 

9253
02:54:54,960 --> 02:54:57,410
good way to build the bot yeah it's yeah
for training purposes at least the time

9254
02:54:57,410 --> 02:54:57,420
for training purposes at least the time
 

9255
02:54:57,420 --> 02:54:59,929
for training purposes at least the time
the time per move is probably better but

9256
02:54:59,929 --> 02:54:59,939
the time per move is probably better but
 

9257
02:54:59,939 --> 02:55:01,550
the time per move is probably better but
the craziest thing is I did that a

9258
02:55:01,550 --> 02:55:01,560
the craziest thing is I did that a
 

9259
02:55:01,560 --> 02:55:04,309
the craziest thing is I did that a
couple of my of my devs were helping me

9260
02:55:04,309 --> 02:55:04,319
couple of my of my devs were helping me
 

9261
02:55:04,319 --> 02:55:07,429
couple of my of my devs were helping me
with the build like uh I'm scaling my

9262
02:55:07,429 --> 02:55:07,439
with the build like uh I'm scaling my
 

9263
02:55:07,439 --> 02:55:08,990
with the build like uh I'm scaling my
courses into a better chess learning

9264
02:55:08,990 --> 02:55:09,000
courses into a better chess learning
 

9265
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:11,570
courses into a better chess learning
platform essentially we've done a lot of

9266
02:55:11,570 --> 02:55:11,580
platform essentially we've done a lot of
 

9267
02:55:11,580 --> 02:55:12,950
platform essentially we've done a lot of
different experiments with stockfish

9268
02:55:12,950 --> 02:55:12,960
different experiments with stockfish
 

9269
02:55:12,960 --> 02:55:16,670
different experiments with stockfish
which I'm even happy to get into here

9270
02:55:16,670 --> 02:55:16,680
which I'm even happy to get into here
 

9271
02:55:16,680 --> 02:55:19,190
which I'm even happy to get into here
um and uh stockfish making moves in 0.1

9272
02:55:19,190 --> 02:55:19,200
um and uh stockfish making moves in 0.1
 

9273
02:55:19,200 --> 02:55:20,630
um and uh stockfish making moves in 0.1
millisecond plays better than a human

9274
02:55:20,630 --> 02:55:20,640
millisecond plays better than a human
 

9275
02:55:20,640 --> 02:55:23,269
millisecond plays better than a human
which is disgusting and disturbing

9276
02:55:23,269 --> 02:55:23,279
which is disgusting and disturbing
 

9277
02:55:23,279 --> 02:55:25,370
which is disgusting and disturbing
frankly because that's crazy like you

9278
02:55:25,370 --> 02:55:25,380
frankly because that's crazy like you
 

9279
02:55:25,380 --> 02:55:27,530
frankly because that's crazy like you
can't react to a car stopping in front

9280
02:55:27,530 --> 02:55:27,540
can't react to a car stopping in front
 

9281
02:55:27,540 --> 02:55:30,469
can't react to a car stopping in front
of you anywhere near that fast and yeah

9282
02:55:30,469 --> 02:55:30,479
of you anywhere near that fast and yeah
 

9283
02:55:30,479 --> 02:55:32,870
of you anywhere near that fast and yeah
so the reason I was interested in that

9284
02:55:32,870 --> 02:55:32,880
so the reason I was interested in that
 

9285
02:55:32,880 --> 02:55:35,330
so the reason I was interested in that
is because when you have an a very large

9286
02:55:35,330 --> 02:55:35,340
is because when you have an a very large
 

9287
02:55:35,340 --> 02:55:36,769
is because when you have an a very large
chessboard you have

9288
02:55:36,769 --> 02:55:36,779
chessboard you have
 

9289
02:55:36,779 --> 02:55:38,750
chessboard you have
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands

9290
02:55:38,750 --> 02:55:38,760
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
 

9291
02:55:38,760 --> 02:55:40,730
tens of thousands hundreds of thousands
of game going on at the same time

9292
02:55:40,730 --> 02:55:40,740
of game going on at the same time
 

9293
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:44,269
of game going on at the same time
you have to the like think of the

9294
02:55:44,269 --> 02:55:44,279
you have to the like think of the
 

9295
02:55:44,279 --> 02:55:46,910
you have to the like think of the
minimum amount of thinking per move that

9296
02:55:46,910 --> 02:55:46,920
minimum amount of thinking per move that
 

9297
02:55:46,920 --> 02:55:49,550
minimum amount of thinking per move that
you can uh allow for and it does it does

9298
02:55:49,550 --> 02:55:49,560
you can uh allow for and it does it does
 

9299
02:55:49,560 --> 02:55:52,550
you can uh allow for and it does it does
seem it's damn good uh at least to my

9300
02:55:52,550 --> 02:55:52,560
seem it's damn good uh at least to my
 

9301
02:55:52,560 --> 02:55:55,250
seem it's damn good uh at least to my
eye basically at the lowest possible

9302
02:55:55,250 --> 02:55:55,260
eye basically at the lowest possible
 

9303
02:55:55,260 --> 02:55:58,130
eye basically at the lowest possible
setting you can give it so yeah it's

9304
02:55:58,130 --> 02:55:58,140
setting you can give it so yeah it's
 

9305
02:55:58,140 --> 02:55:59,450
setting you can give it so yeah it's
incredible it's incredible what boss

9306
02:55:59,450 --> 02:55:59,460
incredible it's incredible what boss
 

9307
02:55:59,460 --> 02:56:01,370
incredible it's incredible what boss
you're able to do now it's

9308
02:56:01,370 --> 02:56:01,380
you're able to do now it's
 

9309
02:56:01,380 --> 02:56:03,830
you're able to do now it's
as far as I know as primarily machine

9310
02:56:03,830 --> 02:56:03,840
as far as I know as primarily machine
 

9311
02:56:03,840 --> 02:56:06,230
as far as I know as primarily machine
learning based stockfish so stockfish

9312
02:56:06,230 --> 02:56:06,240
learning based stockfish so stockfish
 

9313
02:56:06,240 --> 02:56:08,150
learning based stockfish so stockfish
move to machine learning completely it's

9314
02:56:08,150 --> 02:56:08,160
move to machine learning completely it's
 

9315
02:56:08,160 --> 02:56:09,530
move to machine learning completely it's
not doing search

9316
02:56:09,530 --> 02:56:09,540
not doing search
 

9317
02:56:09,540 --> 02:56:12,769
not doing search
as far as I know yeah this is where you

9318
02:56:12,769 --> 02:56:12,779
as far as I know yeah this is where you
 

9319
02:56:12,779 --> 02:56:15,650
as far as I know yeah this is where you
you lose me a bit but the move Discovery

9320
02:56:15,650 --> 02:56:15,660
you lose me a bit but the move Discovery
 

9321
02:56:15,660 --> 02:56:17,630
you lose me a bit but the move Discovery
and evaluation is what's been changing

9322
02:56:17,630 --> 02:56:17,640
and evaluation is what's been changing
 

9323
02:56:17,640 --> 02:56:20,150
and evaluation is what's been changing
in in the way starfish works so it's

9324
02:56:20,150 --> 02:56:20,160
in in the way starfish works so it's
 

9325
02:56:20,160 --> 02:56:23,030
in in the way starfish works so it's
discovering of moves and then the way it

9326
02:56:23,030 --> 02:56:23,040
discovering of moves and then the way it
 

9327
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:24,290
discovering of moves and then the way it
looks forward and then evaluates

9328
02:56:24,290 --> 02:56:24,300
looks forward and then evaluates
 

9329
02:56:24,300 --> 02:56:27,050
looks forward and then evaluates
positions that has changed but Matthew

9330
02:56:27,050 --> 02:56:27,060
positions that has changed but Matthew

about Alpha zero yeah that that he

9334
02:56:32,929 --> 02:56:32,939
about Alpha zero yeah that that he
 

9335
02:56:32,939 --> 02:56:34,550
about Alpha zero yeah that that he
explains it significantly better but

9336
02:56:34,550 --> 02:56:34,560
explains it significantly better but
 

9337
02:56:34,560 --> 02:56:37,610
explains it significantly better but
that's the way I think it it works

9338
02:56:37,610 --> 02:56:37,620
that's the way I think it it works

what did that make you feel when you
 

9341
02:56:39,180 --> 02:56:41,450
what did that make you feel when you
first saw Alpha zero play I was excited

9342
02:56:41,450 --> 02:56:41,460
first saw Alpha zero play I was excited
 

9343
02:56:41,460 --> 02:56:44,349
first saw Alpha zero play I was excited
I I didn't have any any sort of

uh and it

9352
02:56:53,809 --> 02:56:53,819
uh and it
 

9353
02:56:53,819 --> 02:56:56,330
uh and it
it that experiment though has does have

9354
02:56:56,330 --> 02:56:56,340
it that experiment though has does have
 

9355
02:56:56,340 --> 02:56:58,550
it that experiment though has does have
some caveat in the sense that

9356
02:56:58,550 --> 02:56:58,560
some caveat in the sense that
 

9357
02:56:58,560 --> 02:57:00,469
some caveat in the sense that
I think Alpha zero was playing with a

9358
02:57:00,469 --> 02:57:00,479
I think Alpha zero was playing with a
 

9359
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:02,030
I think Alpha zero was playing with a
full tank of servers and I think

9360
02:57:02,030 --> 02:57:02,040
full tank of servers and I think
 

9361
02:57:02,040 --> 02:57:03,530
full tank of servers and I think
stockfish wasn't which I think is what

9362
02:57:03,530 --> 02:57:03,540
stockfish wasn't which I think is what
 

9363
02:57:03,540 --> 02:57:05,269
stockfish wasn't which I think is what
one of the things people point out they

9364
02:57:05,269 --> 02:57:05,279
one of the things people point out they
 

9365
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:06,950
one of the things people point out they
weren't playing since then they were

9366
02:57:06,950 --> 02:57:06,960
weren't playing since then they were
 

9367
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:09,650
weren't playing since then they were
able to demonstrate much less yeah

9368
02:57:09,650 --> 02:57:09,660
able to demonstrate much less yeah
 

9369
02:57:09,660 --> 02:57:11,050
able to demonstrate much less yeah
uh

9370
02:57:11,050 --> 02:57:11,060
uh
 

9371
02:57:11,060 --> 02:57:15,410
uh
but also Alpha zero stopped developing

9372
02:57:15,410 --> 02:57:15,420
but also Alpha zero stopped developing
 

9373
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:17,929
but also Alpha zero stopped developing
um they stopped developing it yes

9374
02:57:17,929 --> 02:57:17,939
um they stopped developing it yes
 

9375
02:57:17,939 --> 02:57:20,389
um they stopped developing it yes
which which sucks but again from their

9376
02:57:20,389 --> 02:57:20,399
which which sucks but again from their
 

9377
02:57:20,399 --> 02:57:22,010
which which sucks but again from their
perspective From deepmind's perspective

9378
02:57:22,010 --> 02:57:22,020
perspective From deepmind's perspective
 

9379
02:57:22,020 --> 02:57:23,870
perspective From deepmind's perspective
it's like all right well we took on this

9380
02:57:23,870 --> 02:57:23,880
it's like all right well we took on this
 

9381
02:57:23,880 --> 02:57:25,690
it's like all right well we took on this
really tricky game did something

9382
02:57:25,690 --> 02:57:25,700
really tricky game did something
 

9383
02:57:25,700 --> 02:57:29,150
really tricky game did something
honestly incredible they won

9384
02:57:29,150 --> 02:57:29,160
honestly incredible they won
 

9385
02:57:29,160 --> 02:57:32,090
honestly incredible they won
they won I mean well not just one I mean

9386
02:57:32,090 --> 02:57:32,100
they won I mean well not just one I mean
 

9387
02:57:32,100 --> 02:57:33,290
they won I mean well not just one I mean
they did it without any human

9388
02:57:33,290 --> 02:57:33,300
they did it without any human
 

9389
02:57:33,300 --> 02:57:35,690
they did it without any human
supervision so like uh without any

9390
02:57:35,690 --> 02:57:35,700
supervision so like uh without any
 

9391
02:57:35,700 --> 02:57:39,349
supervision so like uh without any
training on human expert games so only

9392
02:57:39,349 --> 02:57:39,359
training on human expert games so only
 

9393
02:57:39,359 --> 02:57:42,290
training on human expert games so only
through self-play which

9394
02:57:42,290 --> 02:57:42,300
through self-play which
 

9395
02:57:42,300 --> 02:57:43,849
through self-play which
I mean that's what learning is about

9396
02:57:43,849 --> 02:57:43,859
I mean that's what learning is about
 

9397
02:57:43,859 --> 02:57:45,590
I mean that's what learning is about
it's like it's what you think of as a

9398
02:57:45,590 --> 02:57:45,600
it's like it's what you think of as a
 

9399
02:57:45,600 --> 02:57:48,110
it's like it's what you think of as a
child a human child a toddler learning

9400
02:57:48,110 --> 02:57:48,120
child a human child a toddler learning
 

9401

9406
02:57:55,010 --> 02:57:55,020
capable human that's that's what we
 

9407
02:57:55,020 --> 02:57:56,630
capable human that's that's what we
think of when we think about

9408
02:57:56,630 --> 02:57:56,640
think of when we think about
 

9409
02:57:56,640 --> 02:57:58,969
think of when we think about
intelligence so the fact that it's able

9410
02:57:58,969 --> 02:57:58,979
intelligence so the fact that it's able

since most cheat detection relies on
humanness as a way to detect cheaters I

02:59:13,380 --> 02:59:15,050
I don't doubt Magnus is great but if
human this is our Benchmark what is the

9478
02:59:15,050 --> 02:59:15,060
human this is our Benchmark what is the
 

9479
02:59:15,060 --> 02:59:17,150
human this is our Benchmark what is the
ELO rating where your moves can start to

9480
02:59:17,150 --> 02:59:17,160
ELO rating where your moves can start to
 

9481
02:59:17,160 --> 02:59:18,950
ELO rating where your moves can start to
look like an engine without critique

9482
02:59:18,950 --> 02:59:18,960
look like an engine without critique
 

9483
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:20,750
look like an engine without critique
there's a bunch of questions in there

9484
02:59:20,750 --> 02:59:20,760
there's a bunch of questions in there
 

9485
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:23,630
there's a bunch of questions in there
they combine two of my quotes yes and

9486
02:59:23,630 --> 02:59:23,640
they combine two of my quotes yes and
 

9487
02:59:23,640 --> 02:59:26,210
they combine two of my quotes yes and
into one so one thing that I like to say

9488
02:59:26,210 --> 02:59:26,220
into one so one thing that I like to say
 

9489
02:59:26,220 --> 02:59:29,030
into one so one thing that I like to say
is sometimes in a chess game moves look

9490
02:59:29,030 --> 02:59:29,040
is sometimes in a chess game moves look
 

9491
02:59:29,040 --> 02:59:31,790
is sometimes in a chess game moves look
or an opening looks so ridiculous that

9492
02:59:31,790 --> 02:59:31,800
or an opening looks so ridiculous that
 

9493
02:59:31,800 --> 02:59:33,710
or an opening looks so ridiculous that
if a viewer played it I would make fun

9494
02:59:33,710 --> 02:59:33,720
if a viewer played it I would make fun
 

9495
02:59:33,720 --> 02:59:35,389
if a viewer played it I would make fun
of them or slap them that's always the

9496
02:59:35,389 --> 02:59:35,399
of them or slap them that's always the
 

9497
02:59:35,399 --> 02:59:36,950
of them or slap them that's always the
joke if I was your chess coach I'd smack

9498
02:59:36,950 --> 02:59:36,960
joke if I was your chess coach I'd smack
 

9499
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:39,650
joke if I was your chess coach I'd smack
you but yeah when Magnus plays it which

9500
02:59:39,650 --> 02:59:39,660
you but yeah when Magnus plays it which
 

9501
02:59:39,660 --> 02:59:42,110
you but yeah when Magnus plays it which
oh wow you know it's a very different so

9502
02:59:42,110 --> 02:59:42,120
oh wow you know it's a very different so
 

9503
02:59:42,120 --> 02:59:44,269
oh wow you know it's a very different so
they mixed up this quote with another

9504
02:59:44,269 --> 02:59:44,279
they mixed up this quote with another
 

9505
02:59:44,279 --> 02:59:48,050
they mixed up this quote with another
quote which is uh

9506
02:59:48,050 --> 02:59:48,060
quote which is uh
 

9507
02:59:48,060 --> 02:59:50,929
quote which is uh
you know if if ice if

9508
02:59:50,929 --> 02:59:50,939
you know if if ice if
 

9509
02:59:50,939 --> 02:59:52,429
you know if if ice if
I'll be explaining something and I'll

9510
02:59:52,429 --> 02:59:52,439
I'll be explaining something and I'll
 

9511
02:59:52,439 --> 02:59:53,809
I'll be explaining something and I'll
say oh and here the engine says you

9512
02:59:53,809 --> 02:59:53,819
say oh and here the engine says you
 

9513
02:59:53,819 --> 02:59:55,429
say oh and here the engine says you
should play like this yeah if one of

9514
02:59:55,429 --> 02:59:55,439
should play like this yeah if one of
 

9515
02:59:55,439 --> 02:59:57,230
should play like this yeah if one of
your opponents plays like this report

9516
02:59:57,230 --> 02:59:57,240
your opponents plays like this report
 

9517
02:59:57,240 --> 02:59:59,570
your opponents plays like this report
them for cheating they say they fuse two

9518
02:59:59,570 --> 02:59:59,580
them for cheating they say they fuse two
 

9519
02:59:59,580 --> 03:00:01,790
them for cheating they say they fuse two
quotes they said oh human can't play

9520
03:00:01,790 --> 03:00:01,800
quotes they said oh human can't play
 

9521
03:00:01,800 --> 03:00:03,889
quotes they said oh human can't play
like that but because it's an engine

9522
03:00:03,889 --> 03:00:03,899
like that but because it's an engine
 

9523
03:00:03,899 --> 03:00:05,929
like that but because it's an engine
move but because Magnus is playing so

9524
03:00:05,929 --> 03:00:05,939
move but because Magnus is playing so
 

9525
03:00:05,939 --> 03:00:07,969
move but because Magnus is playing so
they they mixed kind of two things but

9526
03:00:07,969 --> 03:00:07,979
they they mixed kind of two things but
 

9527
03:00:07,979 --> 03:00:09,590
they they mixed kind of two things but
there's interesting

9528
03:00:09,590 --> 03:00:09,600
there's interesting
 

9529
03:00:09,600 --> 03:00:13,849
there's interesting
levels of humor and uh insight there on

9530
03:00:13,849 --> 03:00:13,859
levels of humor and uh insight there on
 

9531
03:00:13,859 --> 03:00:15,410
levels of humor and uh insight there on
both of those yeah the difference

9532
03:00:15,410 --> 03:00:15,420
both of those yeah the difference
 

9533
03:00:15,420 --> 03:00:17,690
both of those yeah the difference
between human move and engine and like

9534
03:00:17,690 --> 03:00:17,700
between human move and engine and like
 

9535
03:00:17,700 --> 03:00:19,250
between human move and engine and like
what an engine move is

9536
03:00:19,250 --> 03:00:19,260
what an engine move is
 

9537
03:00:19,260 --> 03:00:22,250
what an engine move is
is I think two things number one a

9538
03:00:22,250 --> 03:00:22,260
is I think two things number one a
 

9539
03:00:22,260 --> 03:00:24,349
is I think two things number one a
computer move

9540
03:00:24,349 --> 03:00:24,359
computer move
 

9541
03:00:24,359 --> 03:00:30,290
computer move
is outlandish in its in its concept and

9542
03:00:30,290 --> 03:00:30,300
is outlandish in its in its concept and
 

9543
03:00:30,300 --> 03:00:32,030
is outlandish in its in its concept and
it's

9544
03:00:32,030 --> 03:00:32,040
it's
 

9545
03:00:32,040 --> 03:00:33,830
it's
um and its idea

9546
03:00:33,830 --> 03:00:33,840
um and its idea
 

9547
03:00:33,840 --> 03:00:35,330
um and its idea
so the best example that I can give of

9548
03:00:35,330 --> 03:00:35,340
so the best example that I can give of
 

9549
03:00:35,340 --> 03:00:36,710
so the best example that I can give of
that is if you gave a hundred grand

9550
03:00:36,710 --> 03:00:36,720
that is if you gave a hundred grand
 

9551
03:00:36,720 --> 03:00:39,349
that is if you gave a hundred grand
Masters a position and told them you

9552
03:00:39,349 --> 03:00:39,359
Masters a position and told them you
 

9553
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:40,309
Masters a position and told them you
know what what do you think the best

9554
03:00:40,309 --> 03:00:40,319
know what what do you think the best
 

9555
03:00:40,319 --> 03:00:41,809
know what what do you think the best
move here is for black not in this

9556
03:00:41,809 --> 03:00:41,819
move here is for black not in this
 

9557
03:00:41,819 --> 03:00:44,030
move here is for black not in this
position right here we have nothing but

9558
03:00:44,030 --> 03:00:44,040
position right here we have nothing but
 

9559
03:00:44,040 --> 03:00:45,650
position right here we have nothing but
an overwhelming amount of them would

9560
03:00:45,650 --> 03:00:45,660
an overwhelming amount of them would
 

9561
03:00:45,660 --> 03:00:47,510
an overwhelming amount of them would
look at the position evaluate everything

9562
03:00:47,510 --> 03:00:47,520
look at the position evaluate everything
 

9563
03:00:47,520 --> 03:00:49,130
look at the position evaluate everything
they know about the game of chess which

9564
03:00:49,130 --> 03:00:49,140
they know about the game of chess which
 

9565
03:00:49,140 --> 03:00:50,750
they know about the game of chess which
is relatively similar but obviously

9566
03:00:50,750 --> 03:00:50,760
is relatively similar but obviously
 

9567
03:00:50,760 --> 03:00:52,910
is relatively similar but obviously
slightly imbalanced based on their skill

9568
03:00:52,910 --> 03:00:52,920
slightly imbalanced based on their skill
 

9569
03:00:52,920 --> 03:00:54,590
slightly imbalanced based on their skill
level and they would come up with a

9570
03:00:54,590 --> 03:00:54,600
level and they would come up with a
 

9571
03:00:54,600 --> 03:00:57,170
level and they would come up with a
sample size of two or three moves and in

9572
03:00:57,170 --> 03:00:57,180
sample size of two or three moves and in
 

9573
03:00:57,180 --> 03:00:58,610
sample size of two or three moves and in
comes the computer with a [\h__\h]

9574
03:00:58,610 --> 03:00:58,620
comes the computer with a [\h__\h]
 

9575
03:00:58,620 --> 03:00:59,809
comes the computer with a [\h__\h]
Haymaker

9576
03:00:59,809 --> 03:00:59,819
Haymaker
 

9577
03:00:59,819 --> 03:01:02,510
Haymaker
and suddenly everybody goes

9578
03:01:02,510 --> 03:01:02,520
and suddenly everybody goes
 

9579
03:01:02,520 --> 03:01:04,130
and suddenly everybody goes
oh everything we know about Chess has

9580
03:01:04,130 --> 03:01:04,140
oh everything we know about Chess has
 

9581
03:01:04,140 --> 03:01:05,690
oh everything we know about Chess has
gone out the window so they all start

9582
03:01:05,690 --> 03:01:05,700
gone out the window so they all start
 

9583
03:01:05,700 --> 03:01:06,769
gone out the window so they all start
looking at that move and they know it's

9584
03:01:06,769 --> 03:01:06,779
looking at that move and they know it's
 

9585
03:01:06,779 --> 03:01:08,030
looking at that move and they know it's
the best move so now they start adding

9586
03:01:08,030 --> 03:01:08,040
the best move so now they start adding
 

9587
03:01:08,040 --> 03:01:09,889
the best move so now they start adding
the evidence behind

9588
03:01:09,889 --> 03:01:09,899
the evidence behind
 

9589
03:01:09,899 --> 03:01:12,650
the evidence behind
the verdict as opposed to getting to the

9590
03:01:12,650 --> 03:01:12,660
the verdict as opposed to getting to the
 

9591
03:01:12,660 --> 03:01:14,570
the verdict as opposed to getting to the
verdict while first looking at at the

9592
03:01:14,570 --> 03:01:14,580
verdict while first looking at at the
 

9593
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:15,769
verdict while first looking at at the
evidence

9594
03:01:15,769 --> 03:01:15,779
evidence
 

9595
03:01:15,779 --> 03:01:18,469
evidence
so the concept of it and the idea of it

9596
03:01:18,469 --> 03:01:18,479
so the concept of it and the idea of it
 

9597
03:01:18,479 --> 03:01:20,510
so the concept of it and the idea of it
is so outlandish based on a certain type

9598
03:01:20,510 --> 03:01:20,520
is so outlandish based on a certain type
 

9599
03:01:20,520 --> 03:01:23,510
is so outlandish based on a certain type
of position that you can't fully grasp

9600
03:01:23,510 --> 03:01:23,520
of position that you can't fully grasp
 

9601
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:25,490
of position that you can't fully grasp
it you have to continue to beg the

9602
03:01:25,490 --> 03:01:25,500
it you have to continue to beg the
 

9603
03:01:25,500 --> 03:01:27,590
it you have to continue to beg the
engine to tell you what the variation is

9604
03:01:27,590 --> 03:01:27,600
engine to tell you what the variation is
 

9605
03:01:27,600 --> 03:01:30,230
engine to tell you what the variation is
a move is only good if its extension is

9606
03:01:30,230 --> 03:01:30,240
a move is only good if its extension is
 

9607
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:32,929
a move is only good if its extension is
good that's the way chess works so if

9608
03:01:32,929 --> 03:01:32,939
good that's the way chess works so if
 

9609
03:01:32,939 --> 03:01:35,210
good that's the way chess works so if
like a move is good it's because the

9610
03:01:35,210 --> 03:01:35,220
like a move is good it's because the
 

9611
03:01:35,220 --> 03:01:37,250
like a move is good it's because the
computer has seen that the various

9612
03:01:37,250 --> 03:01:37,260
computer has seen that the various
 

9613
03:01:37,260 --> 03:01:39,590
computer has seen that the various
branches of things going forward are

9614
03:01:39,590 --> 03:01:39,600
branches of things going forward are
 

9615
03:01:39,600 --> 03:01:41,690
branches of things going forward are
also good so you bring all that back and

9616
03:01:41,690 --> 03:01:41,700
also good so you bring all that back and
 

9617
03:01:41,700 --> 03:01:43,730
also good so you bring all that back and
no human could have even conceptualized

9618
03:01:43,730 --> 03:01:43,740
no human could have even conceptualized
 

9619
03:01:43,740 --> 03:01:46,490
no human could have even conceptualized
that initial thing but the second thing

9620
03:01:46,490 --> 03:01:46,500
that initial thing but the second thing
 

9621
03:01:46,500 --> 03:01:48,830
that initial thing but the second thing
about computer moves is they they look

9622
03:01:48,830 --> 03:01:48,840
about computer moves is they they look
 

9623
03:01:48,840 --> 03:01:51,590
about computer moves is they they look
counter-intuitive so

9624
03:01:51,590 --> 03:01:51,600
counter-intuitive so
 

9625
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:54,110
counter-intuitive so
that's a if you might be in a position

9626
03:01:54,110 --> 03:01:54,120
that's a if you might be in a position
 

9627
03:01:54,120 --> 03:01:56,570
that's a if you might be in a position
where it looks like the demands of the

9628
03:01:56,570 --> 03:01:56,580
where it looks like the demands of the
 

9629
03:01:56,580 --> 03:01:59,990
where it looks like the demands of the
position are ABC and then the computer

9630
03:01:59,990 --> 03:02:00,000
position are ABC and then the computer
 

9631
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:02,450
position are ABC and then the computer
is like nope it's not because I've seen

9632
03:02:02,450 --> 03:02:02,460
is like nope it's not because I've seen
 

9633

podcast yesterday basically saying okay
this is beyond my level saying out of my

9656
03:02:28,370 --> 03:02:28,380
this is beyond my level saying out of my
 

9657
03:02:28,380 --> 03:02:30,230
this is beyond my level saying out of my
league yeah what's that what's out of

9658
03:02:30,230 --> 03:02:30,240
league yeah what's that what's out of
 

9659

championship kind of we get what we can
read between the lines right it's is it

9664
03:02:34,309 --> 03:02:34,319
read between the lines right it's is it
 

9665
03:02:34,319 --> 03:02:36,170
read between the lines right it's is it
possible that Hans is that level of

9666
03:02:36,170 --> 03:02:36,180
possible that Hans is that level of
 

9667
03:02:36,180 --> 03:02:40,550
possible that Hans is that level of
Genius is there like different

9668
03:02:40,550 --> 03:02:40,560

 

9669
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:42,650

different kinds of Genius

9670
03:02:42,650 --> 03:02:42,660
different kinds of Genius
 

9671
03:02:42,660 --> 03:02:46,130
different kinds of Genius
like where one you could be out of each

9672
03:02:46,130 --> 03:02:46,140
like where one you could be out of each
 

9673
03:02:46,140 --> 03:02:49,490
like where one you could be out of each
other's League kind of thing maybe in

9674
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:49,500
other's League kind of thing maybe in
 

9675
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:51,710
other's League kind of thing maybe in
the case of Magnus it's understanding of

9676
03:02:51,710 --> 03:02:51,720
the case of Magnus it's understanding of
 

9677
03:02:51,720 --> 03:02:52,670
the case of Magnus it's understanding of
end games

9678
03:02:52,670 --> 03:02:52,680
end games
 

9679
03:02:52,680 --> 03:02:55,370
end games
it's just somehow he understands the

9680
03:02:55,370 --> 03:02:55,380
it's just somehow he understands the
 

9681
03:02:55,380 --> 03:02:56,929
it's just somehow he understands the
that last phase of the game and the

9682
03:02:56,929 --> 03:02:56,939
that last phase of the game and the
 

9683
03:02:56,939 --> 03:02:58,309
that last phase of the game and the
complexities and the problems he

9684
03:02:58,309 --> 03:02:58,319
complexities and the problems he
 

9685
03:02:58,319 --> 03:02:59,990
complexities and the problems he
composed better than anybody else so you

9686
03:02:59,990 --> 03:03:00,000
composed better than anybody else so you
 

9687
03:03:00,000 --> 03:03:02,050
composed better than anybody else so you
can see Magnus do

9688
03:03:02,050 --> 03:03:02,060
can see Magnus do
 

9689
03:03:02,060 --> 03:03:06,110
can see Magnus do
uh poor looking Moves In the End Game

9690
03:03:06,110 --> 03:03:06,120
uh poor looking Moves In the End Game
 

9691
03:03:06,120 --> 03:03:10,130
uh poor looking Moves In the End Game
or like moves that don't fit what seem

9692
03:03:10,130 --> 03:03:10,140
or like moves that don't fit what seem
 

9693
03:03:10,140 --> 03:03:13,670
or like moves that don't fit what seem
your gut says is would be the optimal

9694
03:03:13,670 --> 03:03:13,680
your gut says is would be the optimal
 

9695
03:03:13,680 --> 03:03:16,730
your gut says is would be the optimal
yes but also

9696
03:03:16,730 --> 03:03:16,740
yes but also
 

9697
03:03:16,740 --> 03:03:18,349
yes but also
so it's not that you even think they're

9698
03:03:18,349 --> 03:03:18,359
so it's not that you even think they're
 

9699
03:03:18,359 --> 03:03:19,910
so it's not that you even think they're
right you you just might not even

9700
03:03:19,910 --> 03:03:19,920
right you you just might not even
 

9701
03:03:19,920 --> 03:03:22,429
right you you just might not even
consider them yeah because of over

9702
03:03:22,429 --> 03:03:22,439
consider them yeah because of over
 

9703
03:03:22,439 --> 03:03:23,990
consider them yeah because of over
Reliance on your own information or even

9704
03:03:23,990 --> 03:03:24,000
Reliance on your own information or even
 

9705
03:03:24,000 --> 03:03:25,610
Reliance on your own information or even
the computer that was what was going on

9706
03:03:25,610 --> 03:03:25,620
the computer that was what was going on
 

9707
03:03:25,620 --> 03:03:28,010
the computer that was what was going on
in game six she kept doing things and

9708
03:03:28,010 --> 03:03:28,020
in game six she kept doing things and
 

9709
03:03:28,020 --> 03:03:30,349
in game six she kept doing things and
kept playing and kept finding play and

9710
03:03:30,349 --> 03:03:30,359
kept playing and kept finding play and
 

9711
03:03:30,359 --> 03:03:32,510
kept playing and kept finding play and
posing those questions that humans and

9712
03:03:32,510 --> 03:03:32,520
posing those questions that humans and
 

9713
03:03:32,520 --> 03:03:34,730
posing those questions that humans and
computers could not understand so he

9714
03:03:34,730 --> 03:03:34,740
computers could not understand so he
 

9715
03:03:34,740 --> 03:03:37,070
computers could not understand so he
beat the engine basically he could he

9716
03:03:37,070 --> 03:03:37,080
beat the engine basically he could he
 

9717
03:03:37,080 --> 03:03:38,090
beat the engine basically he could he
wouldn't have beaten the engine because

9718
03:03:38,090 --> 03:03:38,100
wouldn't have beaten the engine because
 

9719
03:03:38,100 --> 03:03:40,190
wouldn't have beaten the engine because
they would have defended Yan lost that

9720
03:03:40,190 --> 03:03:40,200
they would have defended Yan lost that
 

9721
03:03:40,200 --> 03:03:42,889
they would have defended Yan lost that
game in the 90s move psychologically he

9722
03:03:42,889 --> 03:03:42,899
game in the 90s move psychologically he
 

9723
03:03:42,899 --> 03:03:44,030
game in the 90s move psychologically he
thought the game was over so that

9724
03:03:44,030 --> 03:03:44,040
thought the game was over so that
 

9725
03:03:44,040 --> 03:03:45,530
thought the game was over so that
contributed computer would have defended

9726
03:03:45,530 --> 03:03:45,540
contributed computer would have defended
 

9727
03:03:45,540 --> 03:03:47,870
contributed computer would have defended
so by the by the time this podcast comes

9728
03:03:47,870 --> 03:03:47,880
so by the by the time this podcast comes
 

9729
03:03:47,880 --> 03:03:49,070
so by the by the time this podcast comes
out which I don't know would be in a

9730
03:03:49,070 --> 03:03:49,080
out which I don't know would be in a
 

9731
03:03:49,080 --> 03:03:50,330
out which I don't know would be in a
week or something like that I feel like

9732
03:03:50,330 --> 03:03:50,340
week or something like that I feel like
 

9733
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:52,610
week or something like that I feel like
more will happen

9734
03:03:52,610 --> 03:03:52,620
more will happen
 

9735
03:03:52,620 --> 03:03:54,650
more will happen
let's say you're predicting engine how

9736
03:03:54,650 --> 03:03:54,660
let's say you're predicting engine how
 

9737
03:03:54,660 --> 03:03:59,030
let's say you're predicting engine how
does this Hans drama end wow look let's

9738
03:03:59,030 --> 03:03:59,040
does this Hans drama end wow look let's
 

9739
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:02,030
does this Hans drama end wow look let's
look in um in three months

9740
03:04:02,030 --> 03:04:02,040
look in um in three months
 

9741
03:04:02,040 --> 03:04:03,889
look in um in three months
by the time we get to the next World

9742
03:04:03,889 --> 03:04:03,899
by the time we get to the next World
 

9743
03:04:03,899 --> 03:04:05,630
by the time we get to the next World
Championship let's say

9744
03:04:05,630 --> 03:04:05,640
Championship let's say
 

9745
03:04:05,640 --> 03:04:09,170
Championship let's say
what what uh this what are the options

9746
03:04:09,170 --> 03:04:09,180
what what uh this what are the options
 

9747
03:04:09,180 --> 03:04:10,490
what what uh this what are the options
what are the possible let's imagine

9748
03:04:10,490 --> 03:04:10,500
what are the possible let's imagine
 

9749
03:04:10,500 --> 03:04:12,170
what are the possible let's imagine
let's not say like what the probability

9750
03:04:12,170 --> 03:04:12,180
let's not say like what the probability
 

9751
03:04:12,180 --> 03:04:13,790
let's not say like what the probability
is what are the options

9752
03:04:13,790 --> 03:04:13,800
is what are the options
 

9753
03:04:13,800 --> 03:04:17,630
is what are the options
uh chess.com is forced to or agrees to

9754
03:04:17,630 --> 03:04:17,640
uh chess.com is forced to or agrees to
 

9755
03:04:17,640 --> 03:04:20,570
uh chess.com is forced to or agrees to
or whatever to come up with a huge

or whatever to come up with a huge
 

9757
03:04:20,580 --> 03:04:22,070
or whatever to come up with a huge
amount of evidence of cheating in the

9758
03:04:22,070 --> 03:04:22,080
amount of evidence of cheating in the
 

9759
03:04:22,080 --> 03:04:23,170
amount of evidence of cheating in the
past

9760
03:04:23,170 --> 03:04:23,180
past
 

9761
03:04:23,180 --> 03:04:26,809
past
uh or Hans comes out

9762
03:04:26,809 --> 03:04:26,819
uh or Hans comes out
 

9763
03:04:26,819 --> 03:04:29,269
uh or Hans comes out
what are the what can Hans do with this

9764
03:04:29,269 --> 03:04:29,279
what are the what can Hans do with this
 

9765
03:04:29,279 --> 03:04:32,269
what are the what can Hans do with this
so I'm uncomfortable with the general

9766
03:04:32,269 --> 03:04:32,279
so I'm uncomfortable with the general
 

9767
03:04:32,279 --> 03:04:34,670
so I'm uncomfortable with the general
make sure you can maybe update me on

9768
03:04:34,670 --> 03:04:34,680
make sure you can maybe update me on
 

9769
03:04:34,680 --> 03:04:37,010
make sure you can maybe update me on
this but there was a little bit of an

9770
03:04:37,010 --> 03:04:37,020
this but there was a little bit of an
 

9771
03:04:37,020 --> 03:04:39,530
this but there was a little bit of an
attack on him not a lot of an attack

9772
03:04:39,530 --> 03:04:39,540
attack on him not a lot of an attack
 

9773
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:42,050
attack on him not a lot of an attack
that he's a cheater right without

9774
03:04:42,050 --> 03:04:42,060
that he's a cheater right without
 

9775
03:04:42,060 --> 03:04:44,630
that he's a cheater right without
evidence without clear conclusive

9776
03:04:44,630 --> 03:04:44,640
evidence without clear conclusive
 

9777
03:04:44,640 --> 03:04:47,090
evidence without clear conclusive
evidence physical evidence physical

9778
03:04:47,090 --> 03:04:47,100
evidence physical evidence physical
 

9779
03:04:47,100 --> 03:04:49,550
evidence physical evidence physical
evidence so all of those all right

9780
03:04:49,550 --> 03:04:49,560
evidence so all of those all right
 

9781
03:04:49,560 --> 03:04:52,730
evidence so all of those all right
that's the tricky thing yeah so like

9782
03:04:52,730 --> 03:04:52,740
that's the tricky thing yeah so like
 

9783
03:04:52,740 --> 03:04:54,590
that's the tricky thing yeah so like
that stuff we're talking about is beyond

9784
03:04:54,590 --> 03:04:54,600
that stuff we're talking about is beyond
 

9785
03:04:54,600 --> 03:04:55,670
that stuff we're talking about is beyond
my level

9786
03:04:55,670 --> 03:04:55,680
my level
 

9787
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:58,070
my level
that starts being

9788
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
that starts being
 

9789
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,710
that starts being
um kind of intuitive circumstantial

9790
03:05:00,710 --> 03:05:00,720
um kind of intuitive circumstantial
 

9791
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:03,050
um kind of intuitive circumstantial
evidence there's

9792
03:05:03,050 --> 03:05:03,060
evidence there's
 

9793
03:05:03,060 --> 03:05:05,929
evidence there's
the statistical evidence behind the

9794
03:05:05,929 --> 03:05:05,939
the statistical evidence behind the
 

9795
03:05:05,939 --> 03:05:07,490
the statistical evidence behind the
over-the-board games that he's played in

9796
03:05:07,490 --> 03:05:07,500
over-the-board games that he's played in
 

9797
03:05:07,500 --> 03:05:11,269
over-the-board games that he's played in
2020 2021 where the games match what's

9798
03:05:11,269 --> 03:05:11,279
2020 2021 where the games match what's
 

9799
03:05:11,279 --> 03:05:14,410
2020 2021 where the games match what's
called engine correlation more than

9800
03:05:14,410 --> 03:05:14,420
called engine correlation more than
 

9801
03:05:14,420 --> 03:05:17,090
called engine correlation more than
Magnus and many other top Grand Masters

9802
03:05:17,090 --> 03:05:17,100
Magnus and many other top Grand Masters
 

9803
03:05:17,100 --> 03:05:18,530
Magnus and many other top Grand Masters
combined

9804
03:05:18,530 --> 03:05:18,540
combined
 

9805
03:05:18,540 --> 03:05:21,590
combined
but that can be argued is because he was

9806
03:05:21,590 --> 03:05:21,600
but that can be argued is because he was
 

9807
03:05:21,600 --> 03:05:23,030
but that can be argued is because he was
very strong in playing weaker

9808
03:05:23,030 --> 03:05:23,040
very strong in playing weaker
 

9809
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:24,410
very strong in playing weaker
oppositions so there's always kind of

9810
03:05:24,410 --> 03:05:24,420
oppositions so there's always kind of
 

9811
03:05:24,420 --> 03:05:26,269
oppositions so there's always kind of
this argument against statistics right

9812
03:05:26,269 --> 03:05:26,279
this argument against statistics right
 

9813
03:05:26,279 --> 03:05:28,910
this argument against statistics right
there's the fact that the guy who Magnus

9814
03:05:28,910 --> 03:05:28,920
there's the fact that the guy who Magnus
 

9815
03:05:28,920 --> 03:05:32,570
there's the fact that the guy who Magnus
name dropped Maxim bloogie loogie is a

ground for intelligent systems that
 

9919
03:07:20,100 --> 03:07:23,030
ground for intelligent systems that
eventually uh take over human

9920
03:07:23,030 --> 03:07:23,040
eventually uh take over human

have video titles Stockbridge versus
stockfish and that was the experiment I

9942
03:07:44,030 --> 03:07:44,040
stockfish and that was the experiment I
 

9943
03:07:44,040 --> 03:07:45,650
stockfish and that was the experiment I
made them play each other

9944
03:07:45,650 --> 03:07:45,660
made them play each other
 

9945
03:07:45,660 --> 03:07:47,630
made them play each other
so I made the two person what did you

9946
03:07:47,630 --> 03:07:47,640
so I made the two person what did you
 

9947
03:07:47,640 --> 03:07:49,429
so I made the two person what did you
learn from that experiment

9948
03:07:49,429 --> 03:07:49,439
learn from that experiment
 

9949
03:07:49,439 --> 03:07:52,070
learn from that experiment
uh I enjoyed first of all they will

9950
03:07:52,070 --> 03:07:52,080
uh I enjoyed first of all they will
 

9951
03:07:52,080 --> 03:07:54,769
uh I enjoyed first of all they will
always make a draw so engines don't get

9952
03:07:54,769 --> 03:07:54,779
always make a draw so engines don't get
 

9953
03:07:54,779 --> 03:07:55,969
always make a draw so engines don't get
to play each other from a beginning

9954
03:07:55,969 --> 03:07:55,979
to play each other from a beginning
 

9955
03:07:55,979 --> 03:07:57,830
to play each other from a beginning
position because they will always draw

9956
03:07:57,830 --> 03:07:57,840
position because they will always draw
 

9957
03:07:57,840 --> 03:08:00,110
position because they will always draw
especially if they're the same engine so

9958
03:08:00,110 --> 03:08:00,120
especially if they're the same engine so
 

9959
03:08:00,120 --> 03:08:02,090
especially if they're the same engine so
stockfish 15 slackfish 15 I don't think

9960
03:08:02,090 --> 03:08:02,100
stockfish 15 slackfish 15 I don't think
 

9961
03:08:02,100 --> 03:08:03,590
stockfish 15 slackfish 15 I don't think
one side will ever beat the other

9962
03:08:03,590 --> 03:08:03,600
one side will ever beat the other
 

9963
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:05,210
one side will ever beat the other
basically

9964
03:08:05,210 --> 03:08:05,220
basically
 

9965
03:08:05,220 --> 03:08:07,490
basically
but if you program them to play a

9966
03:08:07,490 --> 03:08:07,500
but if you program them to play a
 

9967
03:08:07,500 --> 03:08:09,290
but if you program them to play a
certain opening position according to

9968
03:08:09,290 --> 03:08:09,300
certain opening position according to
 

9969
03:08:09,300 --> 03:08:11,750
certain opening position according to
chess Theory you get to see interesting

9970
03:08:11,750 --> 03:08:11,760
chess Theory you get to see interesting
 

9971
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:14,090
chess Theory you get to see interesting
ways into how they evaluate one of the

9972
03:08:14,090 --> 03:08:14,100
ways into how they evaluate one of the
 

9973
03:08:14,100 --> 03:08:15,650
ways into how they evaluate one of the
things one of the ways that it played

9974
03:08:15,650 --> 03:08:15,660
things one of the ways that it played
 

9975
03:08:15,660 --> 03:08:17,990
things one of the ways that it played
against the London opening was absurd

9976
03:08:17,990 --> 03:08:18,000
against the London opening was absurd
 

9977
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:19,610
against the London opening was absurd
like it just it was completely

9978
03:08:19,610 --> 03:08:19,620
like it just it was completely
 

9979
03:08:19,620 --> 03:08:22,250
like it just it was completely
ridiculous black sacrificed two pawns as

9980
03:08:22,250 --> 03:08:22,260
ridiculous black sacrificed two pawns as
 

9981
03:08:22,260 --> 03:08:24,530
ridiculous black sacrificed two pawns as
early as move six which is a borderline

9982
03:08:24,530 --> 03:08:24,540
early as move six which is a borderline
 

9983
03:08:24,540 --> 03:08:26,389
early as move six which is a borderline
completely lost position

9984
03:08:26,389 --> 03:08:26,399
completely lost position
 

9985
03:08:26,399 --> 03:08:28,910
completely lost position
and then both sides foresaw that the

9986
03:08:28,910 --> 03:08:28,920
and then both sides foresaw that the
 

9987
03:08:28,920 --> 03:08:30,170
and then both sides foresaw that the
only way white was going to be able to

9988
03:08:30,170 --> 03:08:30,180
only way white was going to be able to
 

9989
03:08:30,180 --> 03:08:32,389
only way white was going to be able to
use those that material advantage was to

9990
03:08:32,389 --> 03:08:32,399
use those that material advantage was to
 

9991
03:08:32,399 --> 03:08:33,590
use those that material advantage was to
give it back

9992
03:08:33,590 --> 03:08:33,600
give it back
 

9993
03:08:33,600 --> 03:08:35,269
give it back
and stabilize their own position like

9994
03:08:35,269 --> 03:08:35,279
and stabilize their own position like
 

9995
03:08:35,279 --> 03:08:37,490
and stabilize their own position like
black just got a crazy attack

9996
03:08:37,490 --> 03:08:37,500
black just got a crazy attack
 

9997
03:08:37,500 --> 03:08:40,010
black just got a crazy attack
Jesus Christ because this is crazy yeah

9998
03:08:40,010 --> 03:08:40,020
Jesus Christ because this is crazy yeah
 

9999
03:08:40,020 --> 03:08:41,269
Jesus Christ because this is crazy yeah
but they drew I mean they ended up

10000
03:08:41,269 --> 03:08:41,279
but they drew I mean they ended up
 

10001
03:08:41,279 --> 03:08:43,370
but they drew I mean they ended up
drawing so I I'm also gonna make them

10002
03:08:43,370 --> 03:08:43,380
drawing so I I'm also gonna make them
 

10003
03:08:43,380 --> 03:08:46,010
drawing so I I'm also gonna make them
play against each other in

10004
03:08:46,010 --> 03:08:46,020
play against each other in
 

10005
03:08:46,020 --> 03:08:48,110
play against each other in
either bad openings or like some of the

10006
03:08:48,110 --> 03:08:48,120
either bad openings or like some of the
 

10007
03:08:48,120 --> 03:08:49,809
either bad openings or like some of the
most popular gambits

10008
03:08:49,809 --> 03:08:49,819
most popular gambits
 

10009
03:08:49,819 --> 03:08:52,429
most popular gambits
looking looking at something like that

10010
03:08:52,429 --> 03:08:52,439
looking looking at something like that
 

10011
03:08:52,439 --> 03:08:54,349
looking looking at something like that
um and the way I'm going to do this is

10012
03:08:54,349 --> 03:08:54,359
um and the way I'm going to do this is
 

10013
03:08:54,359 --> 03:08:55,490
um and the way I'm going to do this is
basically say

10014
03:08:55,490 --> 03:08:55,500
basically say
 

10015
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:58,130
basically say
which chess gambits are the best

10016
03:08:58,130 --> 03:08:58,140
which chess gambits are the best
 

10017
03:08:58,140 --> 03:08:59,710
which chess gambits are the best
and the way I'm going to do that is

10018
03:08:59,710 --> 03:08:59,720
and the way I'm going to do that is
 

10019
03:08:59,720 --> 03:09:01,670
and the way I'm going to do that is
theoretically the engine should be able

10020
03:09:01,670 --> 03:09:01,680
theoretically the engine should be able
 

10021
03:09:01,680 --> 03:09:05,269
theoretically the engine should be able
to beat the Gambit because the Gambit is

10022
03:09:05,269 --> 03:09:05,279
to beat the Gambit because the Gambit is
 

10023
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:08,269
to beat the Gambit because the Gambit is
very rarely blessed by the computer

10024
03:09:08,269 --> 03:09:08,279
very rarely blessed by the computer
 

10025
03:09:08,279 --> 03:09:11,330
very rarely blessed by the computer
so if the computer cannot beat that

10026
03:09:11,330 --> 03:09:11,340
so if the computer cannot beat that
 

10027
03:09:11,340 --> 03:09:13,429
so if the computer cannot beat that
Gambit that means it's good

10028
03:09:13,429 --> 03:09:13,439
Gambit that means it's good
 

10029
03:09:13,439 --> 03:09:14,809
Gambit that means it's good
that means it's not losing if it's a

10030
03:09:14,809 --> 03:09:14,819
that means it's not losing if it's a
 

10031
03:09:14,819 --> 03:09:16,730
that means it's not losing if it's a
completely lost Gambit it will beat it

10032
03:09:16,730 --> 03:09:16,740
completely lost Gambit it will beat it
 

10033
03:09:16,740 --> 03:09:19,429
completely lost Gambit it will beat it
but if it draws despite getting that

10034
03:09:19,429 --> 03:09:19,439
but if it draws despite getting that
 

10035
03:09:19,439 --> 03:09:21,110
but if it draws despite getting that
early disadvantage

10036
03:09:21,110 --> 03:09:21,120
early disadvantage
 

10037
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:22,730
early disadvantage
then that means the Gambit is very

10038
03:09:22,730 --> 03:09:22,740
then that means the Gambit is very
 

10039
03:09:22,740 --> 03:09:25,130
then that means the Gambit is very
reliable and you can play it so that's a

10040
03:09:25,130 --> 03:09:25,140
reliable and you can play it so that's a
 

10041
03:09:25,140 --> 03:09:28,610
reliable and you can play it so that's a
good way to evaluate opening games yeah

10042
03:09:28,610 --> 03:09:28,620
good way to evaluate opening games yeah
 

10043
03:09:28,620 --> 03:09:30,710
good way to evaluate opening games yeah
what's what's the best what's your

10044
03:09:30,710 --> 03:09:30,720
what's what's the best what's your
 

10045
03:09:30,720 --> 03:09:33,410
what's what's the best what's your
favorite opening

10046
03:09:33,410 --> 03:09:33,420

 

10047
03:09:33,420 --> 03:09:36,349

or what what openings do you like there

10048
03:09:36,349 --> 03:09:36,359
or what what openings do you like there
 

10049
03:09:36,359 --> 03:09:37,910
or what what openings do you like there
was an opening that

10050
03:09:37,910 --> 03:09:37,920
was an opening that
 

10051
03:09:37,920 --> 03:09:40,610
was an opening that
got me back into chess when I was 15. I

10052
03:09:40,610 --> 03:09:40,620
got me back into chess when I was 15. I
 

10053
03:09:40,620 --> 03:09:42,230
got me back into chess when I was 15. I
had quit for like three years and I went

10054
03:09:42,230 --> 03:09:42,240
had quit for like three years and I went
 

10055
03:09:42,240 --> 03:09:45,290
had quit for like three years and I went
to my friend's house and he had a book

10056
03:09:45,290 --> 03:09:45,300
to my friend's house and he had a book
 

10057
03:09:45,300 --> 03:09:47,630
to my friend's house and he had a book
by Lars gandorf a Danish Grandmaster

10058
03:09:47,630 --> 03:09:47,640
by Lars gandorf a Danish Grandmaster
 

10059
03:09:47,640 --> 03:09:50,990
by Lars gandorf a Danish Grandmaster
called the Karo Khan defense which is

10060
03:09:50,990 --> 03:09:51,000
called the Karo Khan defense which is
 

10061
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:53,630
called the Karo Khan defense which is
C6 do you want white do you want black

10062
03:09:53,630 --> 03:09:53,640
C6 do you want white do you want black
 

10063
03:09:53,640 --> 03:09:55,070
C6 do you want white do you want black
do you want to show them the opening

10064
03:09:55,070 --> 03:09:55,080
do you want to show them the opening
 

10065
03:09:55,080 --> 03:09:57,290
do you want to show them the opening
this is the opening the carcon defense

10066
03:09:57,290 --> 03:09:57,300
this is the opening the carcon defense
 

10067
03:09:57,300 --> 03:09:59,389
this is the opening the carcon defense
so you play E4 I play C6 I have I have

10068
03:09:59,389 --> 03:09:59,399
so you play E4 I play C6 I have I have
 

10069
03:09:59,399 --> 03:10:01,790
so you play E4 I play C6 I have I have
to play Black that's it yeah absolutely

10070
03:10:01,790 --> 03:10:01,800
to play Black that's it yeah absolutely
 

10071
03:10:01,800 --> 03:10:05,170
to play Black that's it yeah absolutely
and we develop from here

10072
03:10:05,170 --> 03:10:05,180

 

10073
03:10:05,180 --> 03:10:08,630

what counts as a opening okay but the

10074
03:10:08,630 --> 03:10:08,640
what counts as a opening okay but the
 

10075
03:10:08,640 --> 03:10:10,550
what counts as a opening okay but the
development does the development matter

10076
03:10:10,550 --> 03:10:10,560
development does the development matter
 

10077
03:10:10,560 --> 03:10:12,650
development does the development matter
yeah so from here the development goes

10078
03:10:12,650 --> 03:10:12,660
yeah so from here the development goes
 

10079
03:10:12,660 --> 03:10:14,750
yeah so from here the development goes
into the variations of the Karo Khan so

10080
03:10:14,750 --> 03:10:14,760
into the variations of the Karo Khan so
 

10081
03:10:14,760 --> 03:10:17,510
into the variations of the Karo Khan so
this is the Karo Khan like you can be in

10082
03:10:17,510 --> 03:10:17,520
this is the Karo Khan like you can be in
 

10083
03:10:17,520 --> 03:10:18,650
this is the Karo Khan like you can be in
a city but then you can be in

10084
03:10:18,650 --> 03:10:18,660
a city but then you can be in
 

10085
03:10:18,660 --> 03:10:20,330
a city but then you can be in
neighborhoods so that's a very

10086
03:10:20,330 --> 03:10:20,340
neighborhoods so that's a very
 

10087
03:10:20,340 --> 03:10:22,610
neighborhoods so that's a very
non-dramatic okay uh

10088
03:10:22,610 --> 03:10:22,620
non-dramatic okay uh
 

10089
03:10:22,620 --> 03:10:24,710
non-dramatic okay uh
two Pawns in the center so that's called

10090
03:10:24,710 --> 03:10:24,720
two Pawns in the center so that's called
 

10091
03:10:24,720 --> 03:10:27,530
two Pawns in the center so that's called
The Briar variation so which what's a

10092
03:10:27,530 --> 03:10:27,540
The Briar variation so which what's a
 

10093
03:10:27,540 --> 03:10:29,030
The Briar variation so which what's a
good thing for me two two squares yeah

10094
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:29,040
good thing for me two two squares yeah
 

10095
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:30,170
good thing for me two two squares yeah
if you can put two Pawns in the center

10096
03:10:30,170 --> 03:10:30,180
if you can put two Pawns in the center
 

10097
03:10:30,180 --> 03:10:32,630
if you can put two Pawns in the center
yeah you should and then um so that's a

10098
03:10:32,630 --> 03:10:32,640
yeah you should and then um so that's a
 

10099
03:10:32,640 --> 03:10:34,490
yeah you should and then um so that's a
good thing yes and then I will go here

10100
03:10:34,490 --> 03:10:34,500
good thing yes and then I will go here
 

10101
03:10:34,500 --> 03:10:35,809
good thing yes and then I will go here
and now you have to decide what you're

10102
03:10:35,809 --> 03:10:35,819
and now you have to decide what you're
 

10103
03:10:35,819 --> 03:10:37,070
and now you have to decide what you're
gonna do with

10104
03:10:37,070 --> 03:10:37,080
gonna do with
 

10105
03:10:37,080 --> 03:10:38,870
gonna do with
your center point you can push take or

10106
03:10:38,870 --> 03:10:38,880
your center point you can push take or
 

10107
03:10:38,880 --> 03:10:40,130
your center point you can push take or
defend it

10108
03:10:40,130 --> 03:10:40,140
defend it
 

10109
03:10:40,140 --> 03:10:44,570
defend it
and uh push take or defend right yeah uh

10110
03:10:44,570 --> 03:10:44,580
and uh push take or defend right yeah uh
 

10111
03:10:44,580 --> 03:10:46,969
and uh push take or defend right yeah uh
what would you suggest take is the the

10112
03:10:46,969 --> 03:10:46,979
what would you suggest take is the the
 

10113
03:10:46,979 --> 03:10:49,190
what would you suggest take is the the
worst take is just stable so we just

10114
03:10:49,190 --> 03:10:49,200
worst take is just stable so we just
 

10115
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:51,769
worst take is just stable so we just
trade but pushing is considered the best

10116
03:10:51,769 --> 03:10:51,779
trade but pushing is considered the best
 

10117
03:10:51,779 --> 03:10:54,170
trade but pushing is considered the best
advancing and taking my space away from

10118
03:10:54,170 --> 03:10:54,180
advancing and taking my space away from
 

10119
03:10:54,180 --> 03:10:54,889
advancing and taking my space away from
me

10120
03:10:54,889 --> 03:10:54,899
me
 

10121
03:10:54,899 --> 03:10:57,410
me
so I think Alpha zero or stockfish would

10122
03:10:57,410 --> 03:10:57,420
so I think Alpha zero or stockfish would
 

10123
03:10:57,420 --> 03:11:00,230
so I think Alpha zero or stockfish would
probably always push push and now

10124
03:11:00,230 --> 03:11:00,240
probably always push push and now
 

10125
03:11:00,240 --> 03:11:03,110
probably always push push and now
there's something called like the main

10126
03:11:03,110 --> 03:11:03,120
there's something called like the main
 

10127
03:11:03,120 --> 03:11:04,849
there's something called like the main
line or the sideline main line is what's

10128
03:11:04,849 --> 03:11:04,859
line or the sideline main line is what's
 

10129
03:11:04,859 --> 03:11:06,349
line or the sideline main line is what's
the most popular played at all levels

10130
03:11:06,349 --> 03:11:06,359
the most popular played at all levels
 

10131
03:11:06,359 --> 03:11:08,389
the most popular played at all levels
which is moving the bishop here I've

10132
03:11:08,389 --> 03:11:08,399
which is moving the bishop here I've
 

10133
03:11:08,399 --> 03:11:11,150
which is moving the bishop here I've
played this a lot but for beginners this

10134
03:11:11,150 --> 03:11:11,160
played this a lot but for beginners this
 

10135
03:11:11,160 --> 03:11:13,190
played this a lot but for beginners this
is an intermediate player's uh this is

10136
03:11:13,190 --> 03:11:13,200
is an intermediate player's uh this is
 

10137
03:11:13,200 --> 03:11:15,050
is an intermediate player's uh this is
why I love this opening so much on move

10138
03:11:15,050 --> 03:11:15,060
why I love this opening so much on move
 

10139
03:11:15,060 --> 03:11:17,330
why I love this opening so much on move
three black already has a plus score

10140
03:11:17,330 --> 03:11:17,340
three black already has a plus score
 

10141
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:18,830
three black already has a plus score
which is

10142
03:11:18,830 --> 03:11:18,840
which is
 

10143
03:11:18,840 --> 03:11:20,990
which is
crazy like it's not supposed to happen

10144
03:11:20,990 --> 03:11:21,000
crazy like it's not supposed to happen
 

10145
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,990
crazy like it's not supposed to happen
and there's this very tricky second most

10146
03:11:23,990 --> 03:11:24,000
and there's this very tricky second most
 

10147
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:25,610
and there's this very tricky second most
popular move which is undermining your

10148
03:11:25,610 --> 03:11:25,620
popular move which is undermining your
 

10149
03:11:25,620 --> 03:11:27,110
popular move which is undermining your
Center trying to get you to take my free

10150
03:11:27,110 --> 03:11:27,120
Center trying to get you to take my free

Pawn but destabilize and leave both of

10152
03:11:29,870 --> 03:11:29,880
Pawn but destabilize and leave both of
 

10153
03:11:29,880 --> 03:11:32,570
Pawn but destabilize and leave both of
them kind of hanging and uh is that why

10154
03:11:32,570 --> 03:11:32,580
them kind of hanging and uh is that why
 

10155
03:11:32,580 --> 03:11:34,250
them kind of hanging and uh is that why
the the plus score

10156
03:11:34,250 --> 03:11:34,260
the the plus score
 

10157
03:11:34,260 --> 03:11:36,290
the the plus score
is because you're susceptible to the

10158
03:11:36,290 --> 03:11:36,300
is because you're susceptible to the
 

10159
03:11:36,300 --> 03:11:38,710
is because you're susceptible to the
destabil destabilization yes because

10160
03:11:38,710 --> 03:11:38,720
destabil destabilization yes because
 

10161
03:11:38,720 --> 03:11:42,650
destabil destabilization yes because
people at 99 of the rating ladder do not

10162
03:11:42,650 --> 03:11:42,660
people at 99 of the rating ladder do not
 

10163
03:11:42,660 --> 03:11:44,450
people at 99 of the rating ladder do not
understand how to deal with what's

10164
03:11:44,450 --> 03:11:44,460
understand how to deal with what's
 

10165
03:11:44,460 --> 03:11:46,190
understand how to deal with what's
coming basically they don't know how to

10166
03:11:46,190 --> 03:11:46,200
coming basically they don't know how to
 

10167
03:11:46,200 --> 03:11:48,830
coming basically they don't know how to
deal with a structural attack

10168
03:11:48,830 --> 03:11:48,840
deal with a structural attack
 

10169
03:11:48,840 --> 03:11:51,230
deal with a structural attack
so would uh would stockfish try to

10170
03:11:51,230 --> 03:11:51,240
so would uh would stockfish try to
 

10171
03:11:51,240 --> 03:11:52,670
so would uh would stockfish try to
defend the pawn here and keep no it

10172
03:11:52,670 --> 03:11:52,680
defend the pawn here and keep no it
 

10173
03:11:52,680 --> 03:11:53,809
defend the pawn here and keep no it
would take the pawn and tell you to go

10174
03:11:53,809 --> 03:11:53,819
would take the pawn and tell you to go
 

10175
03:11:53,819 --> 03:11:56,030
would take the pawn and tell you to go
[\h__\h] yourself oh

10176
03:11:56,030 --> 03:11:56,040
[\h__\h] yourself oh
 

10177
03:11:56,040 --> 03:11:59,030
[\h__\h] yourself oh
I knew that because I am 3400 right that

10178
03:11:59,030 --> 03:11:59,040
I knew that because I am 3400 right that
 

10179
03:11:59,040 --> 03:12:00,110
I knew that because I am 3400 right that
would take the pawn and be like all

10180
03:12:00,110 --> 03:12:00,120
would take the pawn and be like all
 

10181
03:12:00,120 --> 03:12:02,929
would take the pawn and be like all
right win it back and even if you did

10182
03:12:02,929 --> 03:12:02,939
right win it back and even if you did
 

10183
03:12:02,939 --> 03:12:04,550
right win it back and even if you did
you would suffer it would make you win

10184
03:12:04,550 --> 03:12:04,560
you would suffer it would make you win
 

10185
03:12:04,560 --> 03:12:05,690
you would suffer it would make you win
it back in the most annoying way it

10186
03:12:05,690 --> 03:12:05,700
it back in the most annoying way it
 

10187
03:12:05,700 --> 03:12:06,710
it back in the most annoying way it
would make you tie your shoes together

10188
03:12:06,710 --> 03:12:06,720
would make you tie your shoes together
 

10189
03:12:06,720 --> 03:12:07,910
would make you tie your shoes together
and

10190
03:12:07,910 --> 03:12:07,920
and
 

10191
03:12:07,920 --> 03:12:11,210
and
so I uh like as stockfish I would taste

10192
03:12:11,210 --> 03:12:11,220
so I uh like as stockfish I would taste
 

10193
03:12:11,220 --> 03:12:12,309
so I uh like as stockfish I would taste
yes

10194
03:12:12,309 --> 03:12:12,319
yes
 

10195
03:12:12,319 --> 03:12:15,950
yes
that's the best move but not at 99 of

10196
03:12:15,950 --> 03:12:15,960
that's the best move but not at 99 of
 

10197
03:12:15,960 --> 03:12:17,870
that's the best move but not at 99 of
the rating ladder which is funny

10198
03:12:17,870 --> 03:12:17,880
the rating ladder which is funny
 

10199
03:12:17,880 --> 03:12:21,230
the rating ladder which is funny
interesting

10200
03:12:21,230 --> 03:12:21,240

 

10201
03:12:21,240 --> 03:12:23,269

um but you like to play this

10202
03:12:23,269 --> 03:12:23,279
um but you like to play this
 

10203
03:12:23,279 --> 03:12:25,610
um but you like to play this
I play this against GMS I play both I

10204
03:12:25,610 --> 03:12:25,620
I play this against GMS I play both I
 

10205
03:12:25,620 --> 03:12:27,590
I play this against GMS I play both I
move my Bishop I push it and you know

10206
03:12:27,590 --> 03:12:27,600
move my Bishop I push it and you know
 

10207
03:12:27,600 --> 03:12:29,090
move my Bishop I push it and you know
what are the different ways it evolves

10208
03:12:29,090 --> 03:12:29,100
what are the different ways it evolves
 

10209
03:12:29,100 --> 03:12:31,010
what are the different ways it evolves
like then the rest doesn't matter so

10210
03:12:31,010 --> 03:12:31,020
like then the rest doesn't matter so
 

10211
03:12:31,020 --> 03:12:32,769
like then the rest doesn't matter so
this is just like a pawn structure thing

10212
03:12:32,769 --> 03:12:32,779
this is just like a pawn structure thing
 

10213
03:12:32,779 --> 03:12:35,870
this is just like a pawn structure thing
uh yeah and I mean it how deep are most

10214
03:12:35,870 --> 03:12:35,880
uh yeah and I mean it how deep are most
 

10215
03:12:35,880 --> 03:12:37,010
uh yeah and I mean it how deep are most
openings

10216
03:12:37,010 --> 03:12:37,020
openings
 

10217
03:12:37,020 --> 03:12:39,349
openings
so it's anywhere from like two moves to

10218
03:12:39,349 --> 03:12:39,359
so it's anywhere from like two moves to
 

10219
03:12:39,359 --> 03:12:41,030
so it's anywhere from like two moves to
like 10 moves kind of thing yeah you can

10220
03:12:41,030 --> 03:12:41,040
like 10 moves kind of thing yeah you can
 

10221
03:12:41,040 --> 03:12:43,250
like 10 moves kind of thing yeah you can
be out of theory very very quickly to

10222
03:12:43,250 --> 03:12:43,260
be out of theory very very quickly to
 

10223
03:12:43,260 --> 03:12:44,929
be out of theory very very quickly to
move two move three like basically on

10224
03:12:44,929 --> 03:12:44,939
move two move three like basically on
 

10225
03:12:44,939 --> 03:12:46,910
move two move three like basically on
your own you have a general idea but you

10226
03:12:46,910 --> 03:12:46,920
your own you have a general idea but you
 

10227
03:12:46,920 --> 03:12:48,769
your own you have a general idea but you
don't remember games I mean I I know

10228
03:12:48,769 --> 03:12:48,779
don't remember games I mean I I know
 

10229
03:12:48,779 --> 03:12:50,750
don't remember games I mean I I know
Karo Khan games from start to finish

10230
03:12:50,750 --> 03:12:50,760
Karo Khan games from start to finish
 

10231
03:12:50,760 --> 03:12:53,510
Karo Khan games from start to finish
because I've played it since 2011. so

10232
03:12:53,510 --> 03:12:53,520
because I've played it since 2011. so
 

10233
03:12:53,520 --> 03:12:54,889
because I've played it since 2011. so
you know all the different branches that

10234
03:12:54,889 --> 03:12:54,899
you know all the different branches that
 

10235
03:12:54,899 --> 03:12:57,170
you know all the different branches that
goes without down yeah I I think I know

10236
03:12:57,170 --> 03:12:57,180
goes without down yeah I I think I know
 

10237
03:12:57,180 --> 03:12:59,330
goes without down yeah I I think I know
every opening in chess basically I think

10238
03:12:59,330 --> 03:12:59,340
every opening in chess basically I think
 

10239
03:12:59,340 --> 03:13:02,150
every opening in chess basically I think
most most title players know every

10240
03:13:02,150 --> 03:13:02,160
most most title players know every
 

10241
03:13:02,160 --> 03:13:04,429
most most title players know every
opening but we don't know we can't play

10242
03:13:04,429 --> 03:13:04,439
opening but we don't know we can't play
 

10243
03:13:04,439 --> 03:13:06,830
opening but we don't know we can't play
it competitively because we would be but

10244
03:13:06,830 --> 03:13:06,840
it competitively because we would be but
 

10245
03:13:06,840 --> 03:13:08,690
it competitively because we would be but
what are some of the weirder openings

10246
03:13:08,690 --> 03:13:08,700
what are some of the weirder openings
 

10247
03:13:08,700 --> 03:13:13,570
what are some of the weirder openings
that um foreign

10248
03:13:13,570 --> 03:13:13,580

 

10249
03:13:13,580 --> 03:13:17,389

but might be explored

10250
03:13:17,389 --> 03:13:17,399
but might be explored
 

10251
03:13:17,399 --> 03:13:20,269
but might be explored
like Magnus might play them just to [\h__\h]

10252
03:13:20,269 --> 03:13:20,279
like Magnus might play them just to [\h__\h]
 

10253
03:13:20,279 --> 03:13:22,070
like Magnus might play them just to [\h__\h]
with the opponent he played something

10254
03:13:22,070 --> 03:13:22,080
with the opponent he played something
 

10255

recently actually uh against this German
Prodigy Vincent kymer which was um a

10258
03:13:29,269 --> 03:13:29,279
Prodigy Vincent kymer which was um a
 

10259
03:13:29,279 --> 03:13:32,269
Prodigy Vincent kymer which was um a
specific move order in a very popular

10260
03:13:32,269 --> 03:13:32,279
specific move order in a very popular
 

10261
03:13:32,279 --> 03:13:34,309
specific move order in a very popular
opening so it was basically a position

10262
03:13:34,309 --> 03:13:34,319
opening so it was basically a position
 

10263
03:13:34,319 --> 03:13:35,870
opening so it was basically a position
that had been reached thousands of times

10264
03:13:35,870 --> 03:13:35,880
that had been reached thousands of times
 

10265
03:13:35,880 --> 03:13:38,690
that had been reached thousands of times
but the move order Magnus chose with

10266
03:13:38,690 --> 03:13:38,700
but the move order Magnus chose with
 

10267
03:13:38,700 --> 03:13:41,410
but the move order Magnus chose with
white was played maybe

10268
03:13:41,410 --> 03:13:41,420
white was played maybe
 

10269
03:13:41,420 --> 03:13:44,269
white was played maybe
0.05 percent of the time which is crazy

10270
03:13:44,269 --> 03:13:44,279
0.05 percent of the time which is crazy
 

10271
03:13:44,279 --> 03:13:46,969
0.05 percent of the time which is crazy
thousands of games and it's supposed to

10272
03:13:46,969 --> 03:13:46,979
thousands of games and it's supposed to
 

10273
03:13:46,979 --> 03:13:49,010
thousands of games and it's supposed to
be not good meaning it allows black to

10274
03:13:49,010 --> 03:13:49,020
be not good meaning it allows black to
 

10275
03:13:49,020 --> 03:13:50,690
be not good meaning it allows black to
equalize because that's what black is

10276
03:13:50,690 --> 03:13:50,700
equalize because that's what black is
 

10277
03:13:50,700 --> 03:13:51,590
equalize because that's what black is
going for

10278
03:13:51,590 --> 03:13:51,600
going for
 

10279
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:53,809
going for
it's not winning the game but equalizing

10280
03:13:53,809 --> 03:13:53,819
it's not winning the game but equalizing
 

10281
03:13:53,819 --> 03:13:56,090
it's not winning the game but equalizing
because you go second says I don't care

10282
03:13:56,090 --> 03:13:56,100
because you go second says I don't care
 

10283
03:13:56,100 --> 03:13:57,950
because you go second says I don't care
about equalizing I just want a position

10284
03:13:57,950 --> 03:13:57,960
about equalizing I just want a position
 

10285
03:13:57,960 --> 03:14:00,349
about equalizing I just want a position
I don't want my opponent to know the

10286
03:14:00,349 --> 03:14:00,359
I don't want my opponent to know the
 

10287
03:14:00,359 --> 03:14:02,210
I don't want my opponent to know the
answers to the test

10288
03:14:02,210 --> 03:14:02,220
answers to the test
 

10289
03:14:02,220 --> 03:14:04,910
answers to the test
and that's so interesting yeah because

10290
03:14:04,910 --> 03:14:04,920
and that's so interesting yeah because
 

10291
03:14:04,920 --> 03:14:07,309
and that's so interesting yeah because
also [\h__\h] you psychologically it throws

10292
03:14:07,309 --> 03:14:07,319
also [\h__\h] you psychologically it throws
 

10293
03:14:07,319 --> 03:14:09,050
also [\h__\h] you psychologically it throws
you off and just always keep you on your

10297
03:14:11,220 --> 03:14:13,010
toes he's in a weird position but he
also has the advantage of being able to

10298
03:14:13,010 --> 03:14:13,020
also has the advantage of being able to
 

10299
03:14:13,020 --> 03:14:14,630
also has the advantage of being able to
intimidate

10300
03:14:14,630 --> 03:14:14,640

03:14:19,920 --> 03:14:22,010
how much is that a roll of it like being
scared of the other person that's usual

10308
03:14:22,010 --> 03:14:22,020
scared of the other person that's usual
 

10309
03:14:22,020 --> 03:14:23,630
scared of the other person that's usual
I think I think some of the top guys

when Magnus is messing around in the
 

10321
03:14:33,180 --> 03:14:35,150
when Magnus is messing around in the
opening it's very different than another

10322
03:14:35,150 --> 03:14:35,160
opening it's very different than another

10381
03:15:32,700 --> 03:15:34,490
on him maybe and then he's a mysterious
guy but just different because you're

03:15:38,929 --> 03:15:38,939
yeah there's very few people yeah so in
 

10387
03:15:38,939 --> 03:15:40,849
yeah there's very few people yeah so in
uh in poker they talk about Phil Ivey

this is an art this is a journey yeah

10614
03:19:58,190 --> 03:19:58,200
this is an art this is a journey yeah
 

10615
03:19:58,200 --> 03:20:01,429
this is an art this is a journey yeah
and I think if you resist the lessons

10616
03:20:01,429 --> 03:20:01,439
and I think if you resist the lessons
 

10617
03:20:01,439 --> 03:20:03,110
and I think if you resist the lessons
that failure teaches you that's when you

10618
03:20:03,110 --> 03:20:03,120
that failure teaches you that's when you
 

10619
03:20:03,120 --> 03:20:06,889
that failure teaches you that's when you
don't grow so like just relax and one of

10620
03:20:06,889 --> 03:20:06,899
don't grow so like just relax and one of
 

10621
03:20:06,899 --> 03:20:08,510
don't grow so like just relax and one of
the things you have to learn probably

10622
03:20:08,510 --> 03:20:08,520
the things you have to learn probably
 

10623
03:20:08,520 --> 03:20:11,150
the things you have to learn probably
place the chest to is to know how to

10624
03:20:11,150 --> 03:20:11,160
place the chest to is to know how to
 

10625
03:20:11,160 --> 03:20:13,190
place the chest to is to know how to
relax your body your mind

10626
03:20:13,190 --> 03:20:13,200
relax your body your mind
 

10627
03:20:13,200 --> 03:20:15,170
relax your body your mind
and just like

10628
03:20:15,170 --> 03:20:15,180
and just like
 

10629
03:20:15,180 --> 03:20:17,210
and just like
there's something about just like you

10630
03:20:17,210 --> 03:20:17,220
there's something about just like you
 

10631
03:20:17,220 --> 03:20:18,290
there's something about just like you
said like

10632
03:20:18,290 --> 03:20:18,300
said like
 

10633
03:20:18,300 --> 03:20:21,110
said like
if you don't resist it if you relax

10634
03:20:21,110 --> 03:20:21,120
if you don't resist it if you relax
 

10635
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:23,570
if you don't resist it if you relax
then your body your mind will learn the

10636
03:20:23,570 --> 03:20:23,580
then your body your mind will learn the
 

10637
03:20:23,580 --> 03:20:25,610
then your body your mind will learn the
way of this game

10638
03:20:25,610 --> 03:20:25,620
way of this game
 

10639
03:20:25,620 --> 03:20:30,110
way of this game
and probably add to that is just put a

10640
03:20:30,110 --> 03:20:30,120
and probably add to that is just put a
 

10641
03:20:30,120 --> 03:20:33,110
and probably add to that is just put a
lot of hours in of having fun

10642
03:20:33,110 --> 03:20:33,120
lot of hours in of having fun
 

10643
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:35,929
lot of hours in of having fun
but then then I I on that Perpetual

10644
03:20:35,929 --> 03:20:35,939
but then then I I on that Perpetual
 

10645
03:20:35,939 --> 03:20:37,550
but then then I I on that Perpetual
chess podcast I listened to somebody

that say like it doesn't like Puzzles
 

10649
03:20:40,080 --> 03:20:41,630
that say like it doesn't like Puzzles
none of that what matters is the number

10650
03:20:41,630 --> 03:20:41,640
none of that what matters is the number
 

10651
03:20:41,640 --> 03:20:44,990
none of that what matters is the number
of hours you spend kind of suffering

10652
03:20:44,990 --> 03:20:45,000
of hours you spend kind of suffering
 

10653
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,870
of hours you spend kind of suffering
meaning like thinking deeply like count

10654
03:20:47,870 --> 03:20:47,880
meaning like thinking deeply like count
 

10655
03:20:47,880 --> 03:20:51,469
meaning like thinking deeply like count
like like straining like thinking with

10656
03:20:51,469 --> 03:20:51,479
like like straining like thinking with
 

10657
03:20:51,479 --> 03:20:54,410
like like straining like thinking with
your mind like really working hard so uh

10658
03:20:54,410 --> 03:20:54,420
your mind like really working hard so uh
 

10659
03:20:54,420 --> 03:20:55,910
your mind like really working hard so uh
and then you know you have the Magnus

10660
03:20:55,910 --> 03:20:55,920
and then you know you have the Magnus
 

10661
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:58,010
and then you know you have the Magnus
who says no what matters is the number

10662
03:20:58,010 --> 03:20:58,020
who says no what matters is the number
 

10663
03:20:58,020 --> 03:21:00,110
who says no what matters is the number
of hours you spend having fun

10664
03:21:00,110 --> 03:21:00,120
of hours you spend having fun
 

10665
03:21:00,120 --> 03:21:03,769
of hours you spend having fun
yeah it's a mix it's a mix he's right I

10666
03:21:03,769 --> 03:21:03,779
yeah it's a mix it's a mix he's right I
 

10667
03:21:03,779 --> 03:21:05,450
yeah it's a mix it's a mix he's right I
don't quite agree with suffering but I

10668
03:21:05,450 --> 03:21:05,460
don't quite agree with suffering but I
 

10669
03:21:05,460 --> 03:21:07,429
don't quite agree with suffering but I
think people do a lot of fake learning

10670
03:21:07,429 --> 03:21:07,439
think people do a lot of fake learning
 

10671
03:21:07,439 --> 03:21:10,429
think people do a lot of fake learning
they play Speed games they

10672
03:21:10,429 --> 03:21:10,439
they play Speed games they
 

10673
03:21:10,439 --> 03:21:13,010
they play Speed games they
just go through tactics so okay I have

10674
03:21:13,010 --> 03:21:13,020
just go through tactics so okay I have
 

10675
03:21:13,020 --> 03:21:15,410
just go through tactics so okay I have
to do 20 tactics okay Boop wrong next

10676
03:21:15,410 --> 03:21:15,420
to do 20 tactics okay Boop wrong next
 

10677
03:21:15,420 --> 03:21:18,290
to do 20 tactics okay Boop wrong next
one I used to tell my students you need

10678
03:21:18,290 --> 03:21:18,300
one I used to tell my students you need
 

10679
03:21:18,300 --> 03:21:20,090
one I used to tell my students you need
to do

10680
03:21:20,090 --> 03:21:20,100
to do
 

10681
03:21:20,100 --> 03:21:22,610
to do
10 puzzles and you need to get 100

10682
03:21:22,610 --> 03:21:22,620
10 puzzles and you need to get 100
 

10683
03:21:22,620 --> 03:21:24,889
10 puzzles and you need to get 100
correct I don't care how long it takes

10684
03:21:24,889 --> 03:21:24,899
correct I don't care how long it takes
 

10685
03:21:24,899 --> 03:21:27,230
correct I don't care how long it takes
so I suppose that kind of is like the

10686
03:21:27,230 --> 03:21:27,240
so I suppose that kind of is like the
 

10687
03:21:27,240 --> 03:21:28,670
so I suppose that kind of is like the
suffering Theory

10688
03:21:28,670 --> 03:21:28,680
suffering Theory
 

10689
03:21:28,680 --> 03:21:32,269
suffering Theory
but if you do 30 puzzles and you get

10690
03:21:32,269 --> 03:21:32,279
but if you do 30 puzzles and you get
 

10691
03:21:32,279 --> 03:21:33,889
but if you do 30 puzzles and you get
eight correct

10692
03:21:33,889 --> 03:21:33,899
eight correct
 

10693
03:21:33,899 --> 03:21:36,670
eight correct
what even is that that's

10694
03:21:36,670 --> 03:21:36,680
what even is that that's
 

10695
03:21:36,680 --> 03:21:39,950
what even is that that's
so laughable and the correct amount of

10696
03:21:39,950 --> 03:21:39,960
so laughable and the correct amount of
 

10697
03:21:39,960 --> 03:21:43,030
so laughable and the correct amount of
you know it was 29 I don't know but 26

10698
03:21:43,030 --> 03:21:43,040
you know it was 29 I don't know but 26
 

10699
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:45,469
you know it was 29 I don't know but 26
it's you can't do that you have to get

10700
03:21:45,469 --> 03:21:45,479
it's you can't do that you have to get
 

10701
03:21:45,479 --> 03:21:47,090
it's you can't do that you have to get
things right and that's the only way

10702
03:21:47,090 --> 03:21:47,100
things right and that's the only way
 

10703
03:21:47,100 --> 03:21:48,290
things right and that's the only way
you're actually and that requires like

10704
03:21:48,290 --> 03:21:48,300
you're actually and that requires like
 

10705
03:21:48,300 --> 03:21:49,790
you're actually and that requires like
thinking deeply like really struggling

10706
03:21:49,790 --> 03:21:49,800
thinking deeply like really struggling
 

10707
03:21:49,800 --> 03:21:51,170
thinking deeply like really struggling
like especially if you're doing the

10708
03:21:51,170 --> 03:21:51,180
like especially if you're doing the
 

10709
03:21:51,180 --> 03:21:53,510
like especially if you're doing the
puzzles at the level that that's your

10710
