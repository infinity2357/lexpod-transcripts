we spoke a year ago about rapid at-home
testing and i think you think

76
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:28,720
testing and i think you think
 

77
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,950
testing and i think you think
it should have been still should be a

78
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:30,960
it should have been still should be a
 

79

so let's recap where do things stand
today in terms of rapid at home testing

and then there's this little test and

110
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,040
and then there's this little test and
 

111
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,190
and then there's this little test and
it's the first time for many people that

they are they're using it and they're
 

115
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,910
they are they're using it and they're
feeling

control their little slice
 

121
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,630
control their little slice
of this pandemic so

122
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:18,640
of this pandemic so
 

123
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,390
of this pandemic so
as these tests have come out and more

124
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,400
as these tests have come out and more
 

125
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,470
as these tests have come out and more
and more more americans have had an

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:22,480
and more more americans have had an
 

127
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,110
and more more americans have had an
opportunity to go and buy them from you

128
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,120

for a long time all of 2020 it was like

you know all of the these different
 

153
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,390
you know all of the these different
things and we could of course go through

154
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,400
things and we could of course go through
 

155
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,949
things and we could of course go through
and recap what those what the benefits

and recap what those what the benefits
 

157

metrics are that we should be looking at
 

161
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,910

to get them to understand

172
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:11,599
to get them to understand
 

173
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,350
to get them to understand
that there is a different reason to test

174
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:13,360
that there is a different reason to test
 

175
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,589
that there is a different reason to test
in a pandemic than purely diagnostics

176
00:03:15,589 --> 00:03:15,599
in a pandemic than purely diagnostics
 

177
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,670
in a pandemic than purely diagnostics
and transmission blockade and severing

178
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:17,680
and transmission blockade and severing
 

179
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,149
and transmission blockade and severing
transmission chains the big one so now

180
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:20,159
transmission chains the big one so now
 

181
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,430
transmission chains the big one so now
i think we're at a point where people

182
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,440
i think we're at a point where people
 

183
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,949
i think we're at a point where people
are now understanding and they're

184
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:22,959
are now understanding and they're
 

185
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,789
are now understanding and they're
understanding because they are feeling

186
00:03:24,789 --> 00:03:24,799
understanding because they are feeling
 

187
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,630
understanding because they are feeling
it they're holding it and they're doing

188
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:26,640
it they're holding it and they're doing
 

189
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,750
it they're holding it and they're doing
it they're seeing they're feeling the

190
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:27,760
it they're seeing they're feeling the
 

191
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,750
it they're seeing they're feeling the
delight of seeing a negative

192
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:29,760
delight of seeing a negative
 

193
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,309
delight of seeing a negative
and saying i feel more comfortable it's

194
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:32,319
and saying i feel more comfortable it's
 

195
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,470
and saying i feel more comfortable it's
not perfect but it's pretty darn close

196
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:34,480
not perfect but it's pretty darn close
 

197
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,750
not perfect but it's pretty darn close
to perfect

198
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:35,760
to perfect
 

199
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,710
to perfect
to allowing me to go and see my mom

200
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:38,720
to allowing me to go and see my mom
 

201
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,670
to allowing me to go and see my mom
without mistakenly infecting her

202
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:41,680
without mistakenly infecting her
 

203
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,470
without mistakenly infecting her
you know or whatever the story might be

204
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,480
you know or whatever the story might be
 

205
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,789
you know or whatever the story might be
and now that that's happening i think

206
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:46,799
and now that that's happening i think
 

207
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,470
and now that that's happening i think
all of a sudden we're seeing a massive

208
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:48,480
all of a sudden we're seeing a massive
 

209
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,350
all of a sudden we're seeing a massive
change

210
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,360
change
 

211
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,910
change
politically for these tests

212
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:51,920
politically for these tests
 

213
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,830
politically for these tests
uh biden just came out the kova 19

214
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:53,840
uh biden just came out the kova 19
 

215
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,429
uh biden just came out the kova 19
action plan the other day and one of the

216
00:03:55,429 --> 00:03:55,439
action plan the other day and one of the
 

217
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,750
action plan the other day and one of the
main pillars of it was testing and in

218
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:57,760
main pillars of it was testing and in
 

219
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,910
main pillars of it was testing and in
particular bringing rapid tests uh

220
00:03:59,910 --> 00:03:59,920
particular bringing rapid tests uh
 

221
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,750
particular bringing rapid tests uh
scaling them up

222
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:01,760
scaling them up
 

223
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,190
scaling them up
so

224
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,200
so
 

225
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,270
so
on that front i think

226
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:05,280
on that front i think
 

227
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,110
on that front i think
finally there is success people are

228
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,120
finally there is success people are
 

229
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,949
finally there is success people are
actually understanding and

230
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:08,959
actually understanding and
 

231
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,390
actually understanding and
you know i haven't stopped beating this

232
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:10,400
you know i haven't stopped beating this
 

233
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,270
you know i haven't stopped beating this
drum

234
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:11,280
drum
 

235
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,429
drum
for far too long and i like hate rapid

236
00:04:13,429 --> 00:04:13,439
for far too long and i like hate rapid
 

237
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,110
for far too long and i like hate rapid
tests now

238
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:15,120
tests now
 

239
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,670
tests now
so maybe it's good to step back uh

240
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:17,680
so maybe it's good to step back uh
 

241
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,349
so maybe it's good to step back uh
would you say most americans have not

242
00:04:19,349 --> 00:04:19,359
would you say most americans have not
 

243
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,230
would you say most americans have not
taken a rapid home test absolutely most

244
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:22,240
taken a rapid home test absolutely most
 

245
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,310
taken a rapid home test absolutely most
have definitely not taken a rapid test

246
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,320
have definitely not taken a rapid test
 

247
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,270
have definitely not taken a rapid test
so like

248
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:25,280
so like
 

249
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,710
so like
many of them probably don't know they

250
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:26,720
many of them probably don't know they
 

251
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,670
many of them probably don't know they
kind of

252
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:27,680
kind of
 

253
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,670
kind of
probably say testing

254
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:29,680
probably say testing
 

255
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,469
probably say testing
they have like memories of testing like

256
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:32,479
they have like memories of testing like
 

257
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,230
they have like memories of testing like
pcr testing they have to go into

258
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,240
pcr testing they have to go into
 

259
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,990
pcr testing they have to go into
somewhere and they have to

260
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:36,000
somewhere and they have to
 

261
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,950
somewhere and they have to
like a

262
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:36,960
like a
 

263
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,590
like a
swab deep in their nose and that's the

264
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:39,600
swab deep in their nose and that's the
 

265
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,189
swab deep in their nose and that's the
experience so maybe when if you have to

266
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:41,199
experience so maybe when if you have to
 

267
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,270
experience so maybe when if you have to
travel like canada or something like

268
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:43,280
travel like canada or something like
 

269
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,950
travel like canada or something like
that you have to get tested that kind of

270
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:44,960
that you have to get tested that kind of
 

271
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,870
that you have to get tested that kind of
stuff so what are rapid at home tests

272
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:48,880
stuff so what are rapid at home tests
 

273
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,629
stuff so what are rapid at home tests
yeah so so the rapid at-home tests are

274
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:52,639
yeah so so the rapid at-home tests are
 

275
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,870
yeah so so the rapid at-home tests are
i like to call them paper strip tests

276
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:54,880
i like to call them paper strip tests
 

277
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,350
i like to call them paper strip tests
simple they're simple tests that i wish

278
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:57,360
simple they're simple tests that i wish
 

279
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,909
simple they're simple tests that i wish
i brought some today but i didn't um

280
00:04:59,909 --> 00:04:59,919
i brought some today but i didn't um
 

281
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,310
i brought some today but i didn't um
they're simple tests that

282
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:02,320
they're simple tests that
 

283
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,270
they're simple tests that
uh

284
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:03,280
uh
 

285
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,070
uh
you

286
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:04,080
you
 

287
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,629
you
swab at the moment most of them use a

288
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:06,639
swab at the moment most of them use a
 

289
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,070
swab at the moment most of them use a
swab that you just swab the front of

290
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,080
swab that you just swab the front of
 

291
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,150
swab that you just swab the front of
your nose so it's not one of the deep

292
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,160
your nose so it's not one of the deep
 

293
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,590
your nose so it's not one of the deep
the deep swabs that you know goes into

294
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:11,600
the deep swabs that you know goes into
 

295
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,870
the deep swabs that you know goes into
your brain

296
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:12,880
your brain
 

297
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,950
your brain
and uh and so it's not very

298
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:14,960
and uh and so it's not very
 

299
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,390
and uh and so it's not very
uncomfortable it's just like picking

300
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:16,400
uncomfortable it's just like picking
 

301
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,469
uncomfortable it's just like picking
your nose if you'll you know and and you

302
00:05:18,469 --> 00:05:18,479
your nose if you'll you know and and you
 

303
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,510
your nose if you'll you know and and you
you put that swab and

304
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:21,520
you put that swab and
 

305
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,270
you put that swab and
you put that swab into

306
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:23,280
you put that swab into
 

307
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,110
you put that swab into
a little tube

308
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:25,120
a little tube
 

309
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,270
a little tube
and the tube has some liquid in it and

310
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,280
and the tube has some liquid in it and
 

311
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,469
and the tube has some liquid in it and
then you

312
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:28,479
then you
 

313
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,629
then you
pour put a few drops of that liquid onto

314
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:30,639
pour put a few drops of that liquid onto
 

315
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,070
pour put a few drops of that liquid onto
a paper strip or you drop the paper

316
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,080
a paper strip or you drop the paper
 

317
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,870
a paper strip or you drop the paper
strip into the tube just like

318
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,880
strip into the tube just like
 

319
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,909
strip into the tube just like
one of those

320
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:35,919
one of those
 

321
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,950
one of those
indicators for the pool and if you dress

322
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:38,960
indicators for the pool and if you dress
 

323
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,870
indicators for the pool and if you dress
like a pregnancy test then if you get

324
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:40,880
like a pregnancy test then if you get
 

325
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,550
like a pregnancy test then if you get
two lines you're positive one line

326
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:42,560
two lines you're positive one line
 

327
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,150
two lines you're positive one line
you're negative

328
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:44,160
you're negative
 

329
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,550
you're negative
it's super simple it takes 30 seconds

330
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:46,560
it's super simple it takes 30 seconds
 

331
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,310
it's super simple it takes 30 seconds
once you know how to do it of hands-on

332
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,320
once you know how to do it of hands-on
 

333
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,550
once you know how to do it of hands-on
time and you wait around 10 minutes and

334
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:50,560
time and you wait around 10 minutes and
 

335
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,110
time and you wait around 10 minutes and
then you read the result

336
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,120
then you read the result
 

337
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,830
then you read the result
they are extraordinarily effective to

00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:55,840
they are extraordinarily effective to
 

339
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,029
they are extraordinarily effective to
answer

340
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:57,039
answer
 

341
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,790
answer
one question am i infectious

342
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:00,800
one question am i infectious
 

343
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,430
one question am i infectious
and that is the public health question

344
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:03,440
and that is the public health question
 

345
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,070
and that is the public health question
that we need to answer and consistently

346
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,080
that we need to answer and consistently
 

347
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,430
that we need to answer and consistently
ask

348
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:07,440
ask
 

349
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,070
ask
during this pandemic are you infectious

350
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,080
during this pandemic are you infectious
 

351
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,909
during this pandemic are you infectious
am i infectious because it's only when

352
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:11,919
am i infectious because it's only when
 

353
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,629
am i infectious because it's only when
we know that we're infectious that we

354
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:14,639
we know that we're infectious that we
 

355
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,950
we know that we're infectious that we
can be empowered to not mistakenly

356
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:16,960
can be empowered to not mistakenly
 

357
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,270
can be empowered to not mistakenly
infect others

358
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:19,280
infect others
 

359
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,909
infect others
the pcr test is a little different

360
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:21,919
the pcr test is a little different
 

361
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,150
the pcr test is a little different
and we can go into

362
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,160
and we can go into
 

363
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,469
and we can go into
the pros and cons but

364
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:26,479
the pros and cons but
 

365
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,629
the pros and cons but
uh you know one of the the major

366
00:06:28,629 --> 00:06:28,639
uh you know one of the the major
 

367
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,029
uh you know one of the the major
differences is that a pcr test

368
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:31,039
differences is that a pcr test
 

369
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,029
differences is that a pcr test
gets a lot of

370
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:33,039
gets a lot of
 

371
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,710
gets a lot of
a lot of people talking about the pcr

372
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:34,720
a lot of people talking about the pcr
 

373
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,790
a lot of people talking about the pcr
test say it's much more sensitive

374
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:38,800
test say it's much more sensitive
 

375
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,830
test say it's much more sensitive
and

376
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:39,840
and
 

377
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,710
and
at an analytical level it is it can

378
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:42,720
at an analytical level it is it can
 

379
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,110
at an analytical level it is it can
detect one molecule instead of a hundred

380
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,120
detect one molecule instead of a hundred
 

381
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,830
detect one molecule instead of a hundred
thousand

382
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:46,840
thousand
 

383
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,990
thousand
but for public health we don't want a

384
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:50,000
but for public health we don't want a
 

385
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,469
but for public health we don't want a
test that can detect one molecule in

386
00:06:52,469 --> 00:06:52,479
test that can detect one molecule in
 

387
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,110
test that can detect one molecule in
fact that has created a net negative for

00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,120
fact that has created a net negative for
 

389
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,629
fact that has created a net negative for
public health

390
00:06:56,629 --> 00:06:56,639
public health
 

391
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,710
public health
we just want to know am i infectious and

392
00:06:58,710 --> 00:06:58,720
we just want to know am i infectious and
 

393
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,950
we just want to know am i infectious and
to know that question to know if i'm

394
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
to know that question to know if i'm
 

395
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,670
to know that question to know if i'm
infectious i only need a test

396
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:03,680
infectious i only need a test
 

397
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,909
infectious i only need a test
that is going to be positive

398
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:05,919
that is going to be positive
 

399
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,670
that is going to be positive
if i have a high viral load like a

400
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:07,680
if i have a high viral load like a
 

401
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,870
if i have a high viral load like a
million

402
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:08,880
million
 

403
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,550
million
and when you're and the virus grows so

404
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:10,560
and when you're and the virus grows so
 

405
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,550
and when you're and the virus grows so
fast it will grow from zero to a billion

406
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:12,560
fast it will grow from zero to a billion
 

407
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,230
fast it will grow from zero to a billion
in a day

408
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:14,240
in a day
 

409
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,070
in a day
so you don't really need even on the

410
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:16,080
so you don't really need even on the
 

411
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,589
so you don't really need even on the
front end of an infection you don't need

412
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:17,599
front end of an infection you don't need
 

413
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,830
front end of an infection you don't need
better sensitivity

414
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:19,840
better sensitivity
 

415
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,350
better sensitivity
if the trade-off is that you don't get

416
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:21,360
if the trade-off is that you don't get
 

417
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,909
if the trade-off is that you don't get
the result for one two or three days you

418
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:23,919
the result for one two or three days you
 

419
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,629
the result for one two or three days you
absolutely want a rapid result

420
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:26,639
absolutely want a rapid result
 

421
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,550
absolutely want a rapid result
that can tell you yes you're infectious

422
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:28,560
that can tell you yes you're infectious
 

423
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,830
that can tell you yes you're infectious
you're transmitting to others right now

424
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:31,840
you're transmitting to others right now
 

425
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,749
you're transmitting to others right now
and i'm going to give you the results

426
00:07:33,749 --> 00:07:33,759
and i'm going to give you the results
 

427
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,830
and i'm going to give you the results
right now so it is a much more effective

428
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:35,840
right now so it is a much more effective
 

429
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,990
right now so it is a much more effective
tool because it's fast because it's

430
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:38,000
tool because it's fast because it's
 

431
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,950
tool because it's fast because it's
accessible we can use them in the home

accessible we can use them in the home
 

433
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,309
accessible we can use them in the home
and there's some issues with using them

434
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:42,319
and there's some issues with using them
 

435
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,629
and there's some issues with using them
a home we can talk a little bit about

436
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:44,639
a home we can talk a little bit about
 

437
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,189
a home we can talk a little bit about
what those issues are like reporting and

438
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:47,199
what those issues are like reporting and
 

439
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,869
what those issues are like reporting and
how do you is everything on the honor

00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:00,080
of time for somebody to get a pcr test
 

453
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,670
of time for somebody to get a pcr test
they either have to go online and order

454

they either have to go online and order
 

455
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,110
they either have to go online and order
it it takes the next day for it to come

they swab themselves they ship it out

460
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:05,680
they swab themselves they ship it out
 

461
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,950
they swab themselves they ship it out
the next day and then they get a result

462
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:06,960
the next day and then they get a result
 

463
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,189
the next day and then they get a result
two days later

464
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:09,199
two days later
 

465
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,950
two days later
that's four days minimum for the most

466
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:10,960
that's four days minimum for the most
 

467
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,029
that's four days minimum for the most
part and you know at that point you're

468
00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:13,039
part and you know at that point you're
 

469
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,629
part and you know at that point you're
not even infectious even if you did

470
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:14,639
not even infectious even if you did
 

471
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,070
not even infectious even if you did
happen to be infectious when you first

472
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,080
happen to be infectious when you first
 

473
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,749
happen to be infectious when you first
ordered the test right

474
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:17,759
ordered the test right
 

475
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,589
ordered the test right
so it's really of the speed of these

476
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:19,599
so it's really of the speed of these
 

477
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,790
so it's really of the speed of these
tests and the accessibility and

478
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:20,800
tests and the accessibility and
 

479
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,629
tests and the accessibility and
distribution of them that makes them so

480
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:22,639
distribution of them that makes them so
 

481
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,029
distribution of them that makes them so
immensely powerful so this like amazing

482
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:25,039
immensely powerful so this like amazing
 

483
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:26,629

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,149
answers the question am i currently
infectious and you have i think a

494
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:36,159
infectious and you have i think a
 

495
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,990
infectious and you have i think a
comparison of three different uh sorry

496
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,000
comparison of three different uh sorry
 

497

seven different tests based on the viral

498
00:08:40,949 --> 00:08:40,959
seven different tests based on the viral
 

499
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,909
seven different tests based on the viral
load

500
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:41,919
load
 

501
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,149
load
and based on the viral load across these

502
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:44,159
and based on the viral load across these
 

503
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,350
and based on the viral load across these
different tests

504
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:45,360
different tests
 

505
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,030
different tests
you look at the likelihood of

506
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:47,040
you look at the likelihood of
 

507
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,870
you look at the likelihood of
infectiousness

508
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:48,880
infectiousness
 

509
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,870
infectiousness
so what is this graphic show we can

510
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:50,880
so what is this graphic show we can
 

511
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,949
so what is this graphic show we can
overlay that for people just i think

512
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:52,959
overlay that for people just i think
 

513
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,030
overlay that for people just i think
it's just really nice and really clear

514
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:55,040
it's just really nice and really clear
 

515
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,670
it's just really nice and really clear
yeah so what that's showing is that we

516
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:57,680
yeah so what that's showing is that we
 

517
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,990
yeah so what that's showing is that we
can never ask what's the sensitivity of

518
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:00,000
can never ask what's the sensitivity of
 

519
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,150
can never ask what's the sensitivity of
a test and just let that be the answer

520
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,160
a test and just let that be the answer
 

521
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,630
a test and just let that be the answer
that's what the fda does currently

522
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:04,640
that's what the fda does currently
 

523
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,790
that's what the fda does currently
and that question doesn't mean anything

524
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:06,800
and that question doesn't mean anything
 

525
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,949
and that question doesn't mean anything
we have to say what is the sensitivity

526
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:08,959
we have to say what is the sensitivity
 

527
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,590
we have to say what is the sensitivity
of the test to detect what right

528
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:11,600
of the test to detect what right
 

529
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,590
of the test to detect what right
and so we can have different viral loads

530
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:13,600
and so we can have different viral loads
 

531
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,750
and so we can have different viral loads
for example we can have

532
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:15,760
for example we can have
 

533
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,430
for example we can have
you can have a viral load of one or you

534
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:17,440
you can have a viral load of one or you
 

535
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,630
you can have a viral load of one or you
can have a viral load of a trillion and

536
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:20,640
can have a viral load of a trillion and
 

537
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,590
can have a viral load of a trillion and
a pcr test will tell tell you that you

538
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:23,600
a pcr test will tell tell you that you
 

539
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,509
a pcr test will tell tell you that you
are positive regardless of whether it's

540
00:09:25,509 --> 00:09:25,519
are positive regardless of whether it's
 

541
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,070
are positive regardless of whether it's
one or a trillion

542
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:28,080
one or a trillion
 

543
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,710
one or a trillion
now so we can't ask the question how

544
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:30,720
now so we can't ask the question how
 

545
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,550
now so we can't ask the question how
sensitive is a rapid test compared to

546
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,560
sensitive is a rapid test compared to
 

547
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,870
sensitive is a rapid test compared to
pcr because that covers the whole gamut

548
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:34,880
pcr because that covers the whole gamut
 

549
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,070
pcr because that covers the whole gamut
what we really want to say is how

550
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,080
what we really want to say is how
 

551
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,070
what we really want to say is how
sensitive is the rapid test

552
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,080
sensitive is the rapid test
 

553
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,630
sensitive is the rapid test
to detect me if i am infectious

554
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:40,640
to detect me if i am infectious
 

555
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,509
to detect me if i am infectious
and that gets to about 97

556
00:09:43,509 --> 00:09:43,519
and that gets to about 97
 

557
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,470
and that gets to about 97
or so

558
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:44,480
or so
 

559
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,590
or so
sensitive

560
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
sensitive
 

561
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,230
sensitive
if the question is how likely is it to

562
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:48,240
if the question is how likely is it to
 

563
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,910
if the question is how likely is it to
detect me if i'm a super spreader that's

564
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:49,920
detect me if i'm a super spreader that's
 

565
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,430
detect me if i'm a super spreader that's
a really important one to be able to

566
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:51,440
a really important one to be able to
 

567
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,710
a really important one to be able to
detect they're all about 100 sensitive

568
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:54,720
detect they're all about 100 sensitive
 

569
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,150
detect they're all about 100 sensitive
so if you have extraordinarily high

570
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:56,160
so if you have extraordinarily high
 

571
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,590
so if you have extraordinarily high
viral loads to the point where you might

572
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:57,600
viral loads to the point where you might
 

573
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,070
viral loads to the point where you might
be a super spreader these simple rapid

574
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:00,080
be a super spreader these simple rapid
 

575
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,470
be a super spreader these simple rapid
tests will essentially always catch you

576
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:02,480
tests will essentially always catch you
 

577
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,470
tests will essentially always catch you
and tell you you're positive

578
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:04,480
and tell you you're positive
 

579
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,150
and tell you you're positive
and then as you go down the line if

580
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,160
and then as you go down the line if
 

581
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,110
and then as you go down the line if
you're no longer infectious at all

582
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,120
you're no longer infectious at all
 

583
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,829
you're no longer infectious at all
then these rapid tests might have a zero

584
00:10:11,829 --> 00:10:11,839
then these rapid tests might have a zero
 

585
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,630
then these rapid tests might have a zero
percent sensitivity compared to pcr but

586
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:14,640
percent sensitivity compared to pcr but
 

587
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,949
percent sensitivity compared to pcr but
that's actually a good thing the fda and

588
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:16,959
that's actually a good thing the fda and
 

589
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,630
that's actually a good thing the fda and
others look at it as though it's a bad

590
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:18,640
others look at it as though it's a bad
 

591
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,310
others look at it as though it's a bad
thing because they average it all

592
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,320
thing because they average it all
 

593
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,829
thing because they average it all
together and say oh

594
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:21,839
together and say oh
 

595
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,990
together and say oh
this is only a 40 sensitive test

596
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:24,000
this is only a 40 sensitive test
 

597
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,230
this is only a 40 sensitive test
compared to pcr

598
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:26,240
compared to pcr
 

599
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,310
compared to pcr
but that's not the right way to look at

600
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:28,320
but that's not the right way to look at
 

601
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,590
but that's not the right way to look at
it you want to say well out of all of

602
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:29,600
it you want to say well out of all of
 

603
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,190
it you want to say well out of all of
the samples how many of them were not

604
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:31,200
the samples how many of them were not
 

605
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,590
the samples how many of them were not
transmissible how many were mid moderate

606
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:33,600
transmissible how many were mid moderate
 

607
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,910
transmissible how many were mid moderate
high extremely high super spreader

608
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:35,920
high extremely high super spreader
 

609
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,269
high extremely high super spreader
and you should at the very least create

610
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:37,279
and you should at the very least create
 

611
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,470
and you should at the very least create
a weighted average based on

612
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:38,480
a weighted average based on
 

613
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,790
a weighted average based on
transmissibility potential

614
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:40,800
transmissibility potential
 

615
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,389
transmissibility potential
we don't do that you know and that's why

616
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:42,399
we don't do that you know and that's why
 

617
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,230
we don't do that you know and that's why
nobody in america has these tests

618
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,240
nobody in america has these tests
 

619
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,470
nobody in america has these tests
because that's why they're very rare

620
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:46,480
because that's why they're very rare
 

621
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,870
because that's why they're very rare
because we have slowed down their

622
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:48,880
because we have slowed down their
 

623
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,030
because we have slowed down their
authorization because of that

624
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,040
authorization because of that
 

625
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,949
authorization because of that
misunderstanding that they don't have to

626
00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:52,959
misunderstanding that they don't have to
 

627
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,910
misunderstanding that they don't have to
be

628
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:53,920
be
 

629
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,310
be
80 or 90 sensitive compared to any time

630
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:56,320
80 or 90 sensitive compared to any time
 

631
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,389
80 or 90 sensitive compared to any time
pcr positivity

632
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:58,399
pcr positivity
 

633
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,030
pcr positivity
they need to be 80 or 90 or more if

634
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,040
they need to be 80 or 90 or more if
 

635
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,829
they need to be 80 or 90 or more if
you're infectious and for that question

636
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:03,839
you're infectious and for that question
 

637
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,670
you're infectious and for that question
they're like 95

638
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
they're like 95
 

639
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,750
they're like 95
up to 100 sensitive when you're most

640
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:07,760
up to 100 sensitive when you're most
 

641
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,829
up to 100 sensitive when you're most
infectious so you have a lot of iron

642
00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:09,839
infectious so you have a lot of iron
 

643
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:12,630
infectious so you have a lot of iron
particles in you so i mean that's what

644
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:12,640
particles in you so i mean that's what
 

645
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,870
particles in you so i mean that's what
it means when you say viral load that

646
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:14,880
it means when you say viral load that
 

647
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,710
it means when you say viral load that
means you're going to be very infectious

648
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:16,720
means you're going to be very infectious
 

649
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,230
means you're going to be very infectious
the more you have the more infectious

650
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:18,240
the more you have the more infectious
 

651
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,550
the more you have the more infectious
you are and this test is

652
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:20,560
you are and this test is
 

653
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,910
you are and this test is
basically

654
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:21,920
basically
 

655
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,910
basically
very good at detecting when you're very

656
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:23,920
very good at detecting when you're very
 

657
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,750
very good at detecting when you're very
infectious

658
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:25,760
infectious
 

659
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,389
infectious
why don't we have

660
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:28,399
why don't we have
 

661
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,470
why don't we have
a rapid home test so you said there's a

662
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:30,480
a rapid home test so you said there's a
 

663
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,990
a rapid home test so you said there's a
bit of confusion

664
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,000
bit of confusion
 

665
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,389
bit of confusion
fda is involved you've talked about you

666
00:11:34,389 --> 00:11:34,399
fda is involved you've talked about you
 

667
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,790
fda is involved you've talked about you
continue to talk about

668
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:36,800
continue to talk about
 

669
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,389
continue to talk about
that

670
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:38,399
that
 

671
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,710
that
these at-home tests are classified as i

672
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:40,720
these at-home tests are classified as i
 

673
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,790
these at-home tests are classified as i
guess medical devices that's right and

674
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:42,800
guess medical devices that's right and
 

675
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,949
guess medical devices that's right and
so because of that fda is looking at

676
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:44,959
so because of that fda is looking at
 

677
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,430
so because of that fda is looking at
them differently

678
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:47,440
them differently
 

679
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,750
them differently
then they probably should be looked at

680
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:49,760
then they probably should be looked at
 

681
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,949
then they probably should be looked at
so

682
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:50,959
so
 

683
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,110
so
what what's the problem here

684
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:53,120
what what's the problem here
 

685
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,030
what what's the problem here
can you can you sort of explain what

686
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:55,040
can you can you sort of explain what
 

687
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,710
can you can you sort of explain what
does it mean to be a medical device why

688
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:56,720
does it mean to be a medical device why
 

689
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,870
does it mean to be a medical device why
is that an issue where is the fda

690
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:58,880
is that an issue where is the fda
 

691
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,030
is that an issue where is the fda
messing up

692
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:01,040
messing up
 

693
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,350
messing up
when we declare something as a medical

694
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:03,360
when we declare something as a medical
 

695
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,350
when we declare something as a medical
device and we evaluate it as a medical

696
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:05,360
device and we evaluate it as a medical
 

697
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,750
device and we evaluate it as a medical
device then it makes sense that the

698
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:07,760
device then it makes sense that the
 

699
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,750
device then it makes sense that the
comparison if you're trying to get a new

700
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:09,760
comparison if you're trying to get a new
 

701
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,590
comparison if you're trying to get a new
one onto the market

702
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:11,600
one onto the market
 

703
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,350
one onto the market
that the comparison would be against a

704
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:13,360
that the comparison would be against a
 

705
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,430
that the comparison would be against a
gold standard medical device for that

706
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:15,440
gold standard medical device for that
 

707
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,110
gold standard medical device for that
purpose

708
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,120
purpose
 

709
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,790
purpose
so pcr

710
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:18,800
so pcr
 

711
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,190
so pcr
is currently the gold standard or at

712
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:21,200
is currently the gold standard or at
 

713
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,310
is currently the gold standard or at
least

714
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:22,320
least
 

715
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,030
least
in

716
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,040
in
 

717
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,509
in
the in the eyes of the fda the pcr test

718
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:25,519
the in the eyes of the fda the pcr test
 

719
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,350
the in the eyes of the fda the pcr test
is the gold standard

720
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,360
is the gold standard
 

721
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,670
is the gold standard
uh medical device

722
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:29,680
uh medical device
 

723
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,190
uh medical device
and as a physician that's because it's

724
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:31,200
and as a physician that's because it's
 

725
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,269
and as a physician that's because it's
so sensitive

726
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:33,279
so sensitive
 

727
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,710
so sensitive
as a physician

728
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:34,720
as a physician
 

729
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,389
as a physician
i have one patient in front of me at a

730
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:36,399
i have one patient in front of me at a
 

731
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:37,590
i have one patient in front of me at a
time

732
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:37,600
time
 

733
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,430
time
and that patient comes to me and i don't

734
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:39,440
and that patient comes to me and i don't
 

735
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,870
and that patient comes to me and i don't
have to care about the 99.9999

736
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:42,880
have to care about the 99.9999
 

737
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,910
have to care about the 99.9999
of people

738
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:43,920
of people
 

739
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,910
of people
in the world who are not

740
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:45,920
in the world who are not
 

741
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,590
in the world who are not
in front of me i only care about that

742
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:47,600
in front of me i only care about that
 

743
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,949
in front of me i only care about that
one patient

744
00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:48,959
one patient
 

745
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:50,470
one patient
and so when i get a sample from that

746
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,480
and so when i get a sample from that
 

747
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,030
and so when i get a sample from that
patient and that patient's saying doc

748
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,040
patient and that patient's saying doc
 

749
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,629
patient and that patient's saying doc
you know i don't feel well i haven't

750
00:12:54,629 --> 00:12:54,639
you know i don't feel well i haven't
 

751
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,910
you know i don't feel well i haven't
been feeling well for the last few weeks

752
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:55,920
been feeling well for the last few weeks
 

753
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,910
been feeling well for the last few weeks
do you think this is covid

754
00:12:57,910 --> 00:12:57,920
do you think this is covid
 

755
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,710
do you think this is covid
well for that question i want to have

756
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:00,720
well for that question i want to have
 

757
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,069
well for that question i want to have
the absolute best sensitivity test

758
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:04,079
the absolute best sensitivity test
 

759
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,509
the absolute best sensitivity test
regardless of what it means for

760
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:05,519
regardless of what it means for
 

761
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,509
regardless of what it means for
transmissibility because my patient

762
00:13:07,509 --> 00:13:07,519
transmissibility because my patient
 

763
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,509
transmissibility because my patient
isn't sitting in my office saying doc do

764
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:09,519
isn't sitting in my office saying doc do
 

765
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,430
isn't sitting in my office saying doc do
you think i'm infectious

766
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:11,440
you think i'm infectious
 

767
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,949
you think i'm infectious
they're saying doc do you think i have

768
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:12,959
they're saying doc do you think i have
 

769

recently been or am infected
 

771
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,269
recently been or am infected
and these are totally different things

772
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:17,279
and these are totally different things
 

773
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,069
and these are totally different things
one

774
00:13:18,069 --> 00:13:18,079
one
 

775
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:19,350
one
is medicine

776
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:19,360
is medicine
 

777
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,590
is medicine
and if the patient's infected you know i

778
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:21,600
and if the patient's infected you know i
 

779
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,110
and if the patient's infected you know i
the time isn't of the essence because

780
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,120
the time isn't of the essence because
 

781
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,550
the time isn't of the essence because
they're sitting there in my office i can

782
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:24,560
they're sitting there in my office i can
 

783
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,509
they're sitting there in my office i can
say look

784
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:25,519
say look
 

785
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,269
say look
i'm sorry you're not feeling well let's

786
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:27,279
i'm sorry you're not feeling well let's
 

787
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,509
i'm sorry you're not feeling well let's
get a pcr test on you we'll be able to

788
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:29,519
get a pcr test on you we'll be able to
 

789
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,190
get a pcr test on you we'll be able to
tell you if you have any

790
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,200
tell you if you have any
 

791
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,910
tell you if you have any
evidence that there has been recently an

792
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:33,920
evidence that there has been recently an
 

793
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,910
evidence that there has been recently an
infection inside of you

794
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:35,920
infection inside of you
 

795
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,590
infection inside of you
and you'll get the result in a couple

796
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:37,600
and you'll get the result in a couple
 

797
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,030
and you'll get the result in a couple
days

798
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:39,040
days
 

799
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,269
days
and it might be expensive and so

800
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:41,279
and it might be expensive and so
 

801
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,030
and it might be expensive and so
insurance is going to pay for it and

802
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,040
insurance is going to pay for it and
 

803
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,110
insurance is going to pay for it and
you're just one person and so i don't

804
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,120
you're just one person and so i don't
 

805
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,790
you're just one person and so i don't
really care how many resources it takes

806
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:46,800
really care how many resources it takes
 

807
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,949
really care how many resources it takes
to get you this answer

808
00:13:48,949 --> 00:13:48,959
to get you this answer
 

809
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,550
to get you this answer
on the other hand

810
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,560
on the other hand
 

811
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,990
on the other hand
there's rapid there's public health

812
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,000
there's rapid there's public health
 

813
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,030
there's rapid there's public health
testing and public health testing is

814
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,040
testing and public health testing is
 

815
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,590
testing and public health testing is
it has to account for all of the people

816
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:57,600
it has to account for all of the people
 

817
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,350
it has to account for all of the people
you're not seeing as well as the person

818
00:13:59,350 --> 00:13:59,360
you're not seeing as well as the person
 

819
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,870
you're not seeing as well as the person
you're testing at the moment so

820
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:00,880
you're testing at the moment so
 

821
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,389
you're testing at the moment so
accessibility becomes a central theme

822
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:04,399
accessibility becomes a central theme
 

823
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,310
accessibility becomes a central theme
frequency of tests it has to account for

824
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:06,320
frequency of tests it has to account for
 

825
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,750
frequency of tests it has to account for
all the days that you're not sitting

826
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:07,760
all the days that you're not sitting
 

827
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,670
all the days that you're not sitting
there in front of your doctor's office

828
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:09,680
there in front of your doctor's office
 

829
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,910
there in front of your doctor's office
getting a test as well as the one you

830
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:11,920
getting a test as well as the one you
 

831
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,069
getting a test as well as the one you
are so it has to say how frequently what

832
00:14:14,069 --> 00:14:14,079
are so it has to say how frequently what
 

833
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:15,670
are so it has to say how frequently what
if you're infected tomorrow but you're

834
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:15,680
if you're infected tomorrow but you're
 

835
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,269
if you're infected tomorrow but you're
at the doctor's office today getting a

836
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:17,279
at the doctor's office today getting a
 

837
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,030
at the doctor's office today getting a
negative covet test

838
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:19,040
negative covet test
 

839
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,189
negative covet test
that pcr test at the doctor's office

840
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:21,199
that pcr test at the doctor's office
 

841
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,030
that pcr test at the doctor's office
today is going to do nothing

842
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,040
today is going to do nothing
 

843
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,870
today is going to do nothing
to let you know that you get exposed and

844
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:24,880
to let you know that you get exposed and
 

845
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,949
to let you know that you get exposed and
infected tomorrow the only way to know

846
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:26,959
infected tomorrow the only way to know
 

847
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,389
infected tomorrow the only way to know
that is to be testing yourself

848
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:28,399
that is to be testing yourself
 

849
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,150
that is to be testing yourself
frequently

850
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,160
frequently
 

851
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,509
frequently
so

852
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:31,519
so
 

853
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,430
so
and the the reason it matters is

854
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:33,440
and the the reason it matters is
 

855
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,910
and the the reason it matters is
that these tests can be accessible if we

856
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:35,920
that these tests can be accessible if we
 

857
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,470
that these tests can be accessible if we
are okay with saying the real purpose of

858
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:38,480
are okay with saying the real purpose of
 

859
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,990
are okay with saying the real purpose of
a of a

860
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,000
a of a
 

861
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,430
a of a
public health test is to answer the

862
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:41,440
public health test is to answer the
 

863
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,509
public health test is to answer the
question am i infectious

864
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:43,519
question am i infectious
 

865
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,110
question am i infectious
the reason we want to answer that is if

866
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,120
the reason we want to answer that is if
 

867
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,470
the reason we want to answer that is if
you're infectious that's when you

868
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:46,480
you're infectious that's when you
 

869
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,670
you're infectious that's when you
isolate

870
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:47,680
isolate
 

871
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,389
isolate
we actually don't want to isolate

872
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:50,399
we actually don't want to isolate
 

873
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,230
we actually don't want to isolate
positive pcr pcr-positive individuals

874
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:54,240
positive pcr pcr-positive individuals
 

875
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,389
positive pcr pcr-positive individuals
who are no longer infectious

876
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:56,399
who are no longer infectious
 

877
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,430
who are no longer infectious
that's bad public health practice like

878
00:14:59,430 --> 00:14:59,440
that's bad public health practice like
 

879
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,949
that's bad public health practice like
if i haven't been infectious for three

880
00:15:00,949 --> 00:15:00,959
if i haven't been infectious for three
 

881
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,389
if i haven't been infectious for three
weeks i don't want to have somebody tell

882
00:15:02,389 --> 00:15:02,399
weeks i don't want to have somebody tell
 

883
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,750
weeks i don't want to have somebody tell
me that i need to

884
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:03,760
me that i need to
 

885
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,990
me that i need to
go and isolate for 10 days just because

886
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,000
go and isolate for 10 days just because
 

887
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,150
go and isolate for 10 days just because
i happen to use a pcr test

888
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:08,160
i happen to use a pcr test
 

889
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,790
i happen to use a pcr test
today three weeks after i was infectious

890
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:10,800
today three weeks after i was infectious
 

891
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,670
today three weeks after i was infectious
and furthermore i definitely don't want

892
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:13,680
and furthermore i definitely don't want
 

893
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,910
and furthermore i definitely don't want
the public health agency to come and you

894
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:15,920
the public health agency to come and you
 

895
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,590
the public health agency to come and you
know round up all the people i was with

896
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:17,600
know round up all the people i was with
 

897
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,870
know round up all the people i was with
last night and so you guys have to

898
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:18,880
last night and so you guys have to
 

899
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,069
last night and so you guys have to
quarantine

900
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:20,079
quarantine
 

901
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,910
quarantine
for 14 days because you were with

902
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:21,920
for 14 days because you were with
 

903
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,389
for 14 days because you were with
michael who wasn't infectious yesterday

904
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:24,399
michael who wasn't infectious yesterday
 

905
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,030
michael who wasn't infectious yesterday
it's nonsensical to do that

906
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:27,040
it's nonsensical to do that
 

907
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,870
it's nonsensical to do that
it's a huge disincentive to actually get

908
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:28,880
it's a huge disincentive to actually get
 

909
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,790
it's a huge disincentive to actually get
tested that's exactly right huge

910
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:30,800
tested that's exactly right huge
 

911
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,790
tested that's exactly right huge
disincentive to get tested people you

912
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:32,800
disincentive to get tested people you
 

913
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,230
disincentive to get tested people you
know if it's too sensitive especially

914
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:34,240
know if it's too sensitive especially
 

915
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,790
know if it's too sensitive especially
with flights things like that like

916
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:36,800
with flights things like that like
 

917
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,550
with flights things like that like
we shouldn't be stopping people from

918
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:38,560
we shouldn't be stopping people from
 

919
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,389
we shouldn't be stopping people from
taking a flight if they haven't been

920
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:40,399
taking a flight if they haven't been
 

921
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,990
taking a flight if they haven't been
infectious for 60 days and to be clear

922
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:44,000
infectious for 60 days and to be clear
 

923
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,990
infectious for 60 days and to be clear
people are only infectious for i don't

924
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,000
people are only infectious for i don't
 

925
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,670
people are only infectious for i don't
know somewhere between three and seven

926
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:47,680
know somewhere between three and seven
 

927
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,870
know somewhere between three and seven
days

928
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:48,880
days
 

929
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,829
days
but can be positive on a pcr test for

930
00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:51,839
but can be positive on a pcr test for
 

931
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,749
but can be positive on a pcr test for
30 to 70 days

932
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:53,759
30 to 70 days
 

933
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,509
30 to 70 days
so i mean it's it's potentially a

934
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:55,519
so i mean it's it's potentially a
 

935
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,590
so i mean it's it's potentially a
tenfold difference in terms of how long

936
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:57,600
tenfold difference in terms of how long
 

937
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,269
tenfold difference in terms of how long
your pc are positive

938
00:15:59,269 --> 00:15:59,279
your pc are positive
 

939
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,590
your pc are positive
versus how long you're infectious

940
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:01,600
versus how long you're infectious
 

941
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,350
versus how long you're infectious
so we don't want to be taking people

942
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:03,360
so we don't want to be taking people
 

943
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,670
so we don't want to be taking people
during those 30 to 70 days and saying

944
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:05,680
during those 30 to 70 days and saying
 

945
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,350
during those 30 to 70 days and saying
you need to isolate just because you go

946
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:07,360
you need to isolate just because you go
 

947
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,430
you need to isolate just because you go
and get a swab or you can't go on your

948
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:09,440
and get a swab or you can't go on your
 

949
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,509
and get a swab or you can't go on your
trip just because you had covered last

950
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:11,519
trip just because you had covered last
 

951
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,629
trip just because you had covered last
month

952
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:12,639
month
 

953
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,790
month
that's not good use of a test

954
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:16,800

 

955
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,790

so the reason we don't have these tools

956
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:18,800
so the reason we don't have these tools
 

957
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,430
so the reason we don't have these tools
right now is because

958
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:21,440
right now is because
 

959
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,389
right now is because
when we evaluate an ant a rapid test as

960
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:24,399
when we evaluate an ant a rapid test as
 

961
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,069
when we evaluate an ant a rapid test as
a medical device

962
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:26,079
a medical device
 

963
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,910
a medical device
the fda says

964
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:27,920
the fda says
 

965
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,230
the fda says
well this has to achieve the properties

966
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:30,240
well this has to achieve the properties
 

967
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,949
well this has to achieve the properties
that we expect from a medical device

968
00:16:32,949 --> 00:16:32,959
that we expect from a medical device
 

969
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:34,389
that we expect from a medical device
which again

970
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
which again
 

971
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,389
which again
doesn't have to take time into account

972
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:36,399
doesn't have to take time into account
 

973
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,150
doesn't have to take time into account
doesn't really have to take cost or

974
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,160
doesn't really have to take cost or
 

975
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,230
doesn't really have to take cost or

account it only takes sensitivity and

978
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:42,480
account it only takes sensitivity and
 

979
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,870
account it only takes sensitivity and
specificity to catch molecules

980
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:46,880

 

981
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,470

and so just

982
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:48,480
and so just
 

983
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,990
and so just
by definition i mean it is a

984
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:50,000
by definition i mean it is a
 

985
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,189
by definition i mean it is a
mathematical fact you know that that if

986
00:16:53,189 --> 00:16:53,199
mathematical fact you know that that if
 

987
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,590
mathematical fact you know that that if
you have a perfect public health test

988
00:16:55,590 --> 00:16:55,600
you have a perfect public health test
 

989
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,110
you have a perfect public health test
for covid which means that it would be

990
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,120
for covid which means that it would be
 

991
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,030
for covid which means that it would be
100 sensitive

992
00:16:59,030 --> 00:16:59,040
100 sensitive
 

993
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,189
100 sensitive
and 100 specific

994
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:01,199
and 100 specific
 

995
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,230
and 100 specific
for contagious people or for the

996
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:04,240
for contagious people or for the
 

997
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,750
for contagious people or for the
infectious stage of an infection

998
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:07,760
infectious stage of an infection
 

999
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,470
infectious stage of an infection
then it literally can't it is an

1000
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:10,480
then it literally can't it is an
 

1001
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,909
then it literally can't it is an
impossibility for that test to achieve

1002
00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:13,919
impossibility for that test to achieve
 

1003
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,510
impossibility for that test to achieve
an 80 sensitivity at a population level

1004
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:17,520
an 80 sensitivity at a population level
 

1005
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,510
an 80 sensitivity at a population level
against a medical device which is what

1006
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,520
against a medical device which is what
 

1007
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,750
against a medical device which is what
the fda asks for and that's because

1008
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:21,760
the fda asks for and that's because
 

1009
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,789
the fda asks for and that's because
you're only infectious for maybe 20

1010
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:24,799
you're only infectious for maybe 20
 

1011
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:25,990
you're only infectious for maybe 20
so

1012
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:26,000
so
 

1013
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,150
so
theoretically it should only have a 20

1014
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:28,160
theoretically it should only have a 20
 

1015
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,510
theoretically it should only have a 20
sensitivity

1016
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:29,520
sensitivity
 

1017
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,590
sensitivity
against the pcr while still being a

1018
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:31,600
against the pcr while still being a
 

1019
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,150
against the pcr while still being a
perfect medical a perfect public health

1020
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:34,160
perfect medical a perfect public health
 

1021
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,470
perfect medical a perfect public health
test and the test is answering the

1022
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:36,480
test and the test is answering the
 

1023
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,990
test and the test is answering the
question am i infectious that's what

1024
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:38,000
question am i infectious that's what
 

1025
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,230
question am i infectious that's what
you're testing for not for the exact

1026
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:40,240
you're testing for not for the exact
 

1027
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,230
you're testing for not for the exact
counting of the viron particles in your

1028
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
counting of the viron particles in your
 

1029
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,070
counting of the viron particles in your
system that's that's exactly right okay

1030
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:44,080
system that's that's exactly right okay
 

1031
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,270
system that's that's exactly right okay
so what

1032
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,280
so what
 

1033
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,630
so what
why

1034
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:46,640
why
 

1035
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,789
why
are we still here

1036
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:48,799
are we still here
 

1037
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,669
are we still here
so have you had conversations with folks

1038
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:51,679
so have you had conversations with folks
 

1039
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,950
so have you had conversations with folks
you said that there's a bunch of um

1040
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:54,960
you said that there's a bunch of um
 

1041
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,390
you said that there's a bunch of um
leaders that are kind of starting to

1042
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:56,400
leaders that are kind of starting to
 

1043
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,549
leaders that are kind of starting to
wake up to this idea but why is this

1044
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:58,559
wake up to this idea but why is this
 

1045
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,470
wake up to this idea but why is this
taking this so long

1046
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:00,480
taking this so long
 

1047
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,230
taking this so long
why don't we still have hundreds of

1048
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:02,240
why don't we still have hundreds of
 

1049
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,310
why don't we still have hundreds of
millions of at home tests

1050
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:06,320
millions of at home tests
 

1051
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,150
millions of at home tests
the reason it's taking long i think is

1052
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:10,160
the reason it's taking long i think is
 

1053
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,270
the reason it's taking long i think is
because every agency and government

1054
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:13,280
because every agency and government
 

1055
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,470
because every agency and government
is generally deferential to the fda and

1056
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:16,480
is generally deferential to the fda and
 

1057
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,390
is generally deferential to the fda and
in this context

1058
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:18,400
in this context
 

1059
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,110
in this context
i would argue that government hasn't

1060
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,120
i would argue that government hasn't
 

1061
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,990
i would argue that government hasn't
been particularly creative

1062
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,000
been particularly creative
 

1063
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,789
been particularly creative
so for example last year trump was still

1064
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:26,799
so for example last year trump was still
 

1065
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,470
so for example last year trump was still
president i would or or in the

1066
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:28,480
president i would or or in the
 

1067
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,669
president i would or or in the
transition

1068
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:29,679
transition
 

1069
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,270
transition
and i i recall talking to the white

1070
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:31,280
and i i recall talking to the white
 

1071
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,669
and i i recall talking to the white
house a number of times and saying

1072
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:33,679
house a number of times and saying
 

1073
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,990
house a number of times and saying
here's a plan to give us our lives back

1074
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,000
here's a plan to give us our lives back
 

1075
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,190
here's a plan to give us our lives back
i think that was actually the title of

1076
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:37,200
i think that was actually the title of
 

1077
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,070
i think that was actually the title of
the atlantic article you know and

1078
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,080
the atlantic article you know and
 

1079
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,789
the atlantic article you know and
this plan can stop shutdowns it can it

1080
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:42,799
this plan can stop shutdowns it can it
 

1081
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:45,029
this plan can stop shutdowns it can it
can stop outbreaks it can allow society

1082
00:18:45,029 --> 00:18:45,039
can stop outbreaks it can allow society
 

1083
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,350
can stop outbreaks it can allow society
to keep running and could have

1084
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:47,360
to keep running and could have
 

1085
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,590
to keep running and could have
prevented the outbreaks of last winter

1086
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:49,600
prevented the outbreaks of last winter
 

1087
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,310
prevented the outbreaks of last winter
and

1088
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:50,320
and
 

1089
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,390
and
fall and saved hundreds of thousands of

1090
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:52,400
fall and saved hundreds of thousands of
 

1091
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,390
fall and saved hundreds of thousands of
lives

1092
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:54,400
lives
 

1093
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,710
lives
so when i bring that to the white house

1094
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,720
so when i bring that to the white house
 

1095
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,750
so when i bring that to the white house
or to the government of federal

1096
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:57,760
or to the government of federal
 

1097
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,830
or to the government of federal
government whoever it might be and i say

1098
00:18:59,830 --> 00:18:59,840
government whoever it might be and i say
 

1099
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,990
government whoever it might be and i say
here's a plan like this this would work

1100
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:02,000
here's a plan like this this would work
 

1101
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,909
here's a plan like this this would work
they say you know what i get back is

1102
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:03,919
they say you know what i get back is
 

1103
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,150
they say you know what i get back is
this sounds really interesting michael

1104
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:06,160
this sounds really interesting michael
 

1105
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,310
this sounds really interesting michael
uh it looks like it checks out but

1106
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:08,320
uh it looks like it checks out but
 

1107
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,070
uh it looks like it checks out but
there's one problem we don't have the

1108
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:10,080
there's one problem we don't have the
 

1109
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,909
there's one problem we don't have the
test there's no scale

1110
00:19:11,909 --> 00:19:11,919
test there's no scale
 

1111
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,510
test there's no scale
and that's kind of where it all dropped

1112
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:13,520
and that's kind of where it all dropped
 

1113
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,110
and that's kind of where it all dropped
it's like this defeatist attitude of

1114
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:15,120
it's like this defeatist attitude of
 

1115
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,230
it's like this defeatist attitude of
like oh don't have the test so

1116
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:18,240
like oh don't have the test so
 

1117
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,549
like oh don't have the test so
so we can't act on it but now it's

1118
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:20,559
so we can't act on it but now it's
 

1119
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,390
so we can't act on it but now it's
really changing

1120
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:22,400
really changing
 

1121
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,669
really changing
well and so that's really where things

1122
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:23,679
well and so that's really where things
 

1123
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,110
well and so that's really where things
have been and so nobody's paid attention

1124
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:25,120
have been and so nobody's paid attention
 

1125
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,710
have been and so nobody's paid attention
it's always been this like esoteric

1126
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:26,720
it's always been this like esoteric
 

1127
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,590
it's always been this like esoteric
thing

1128
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:27,600
thing
 

1129
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,430
thing
that yeah maybe one day we'll get around

1130
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:29,440
that yeah maybe one day we'll get around
 

1131
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,110
that yeah maybe one day we'll get around
to it but really it's not that important

1132
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,120
to it but really it's not that important
 

1133
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,669
to it but really it's not that important
and the pandemic's going away but

1134
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:33,679
and the pandemic's going away but
 

1135
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,390
and the pandemic's going away but
this was like 100 predictable everything

1136
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:36,400
this was like 100 predictable everything
 

1137
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,710
this was like 100 predictable everything
that's happening today we predicted it

1138
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:38,720
that's happening today we predicted it
 

1139
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,470
that's happening today we predicted it
last year you know it's not this isn't

1140
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:40,480
last year you know it's not this isn't
 

1141
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,150
last year you know it's not this isn't
like rocket science or the variance and

1142
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:42,160
like rocket science or the variance and
 

1143
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,669
like rocket science or the variance and
all those kinds of things

1144
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:43,679
all those kinds of things
 

1145
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,150
all those kinds of things
so the fda we can start to understand

1146
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,160
so the fda we can start to understand
 

1147
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,029
so the fda we can start to understand
why but also like

1148
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:49,039
why but also like
 

1149
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,310
why but also like
one question i want to ask is it

1150
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:50,320
one question i want to ask is it
 

1151
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,190
one question i want to ask is it
possible to go around the fda yeah

1152
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:53,200
possible to go around the fda yeah
 

1153
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,430
possible to go around the fda yeah
so why has the fda not changed

1154
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:57,440

 

1155
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,909

and why has nobody tried to push the fda

1156
00:19:59,909 --> 00:19:59,919
and why has nobody tried to push the fda
 

1157
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,270
and why has nobody tried to push the fda
to change like

1158
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:01,280
to change like
 

1159
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,590
to change like
the i think what the real reason is the

1160
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:03,600
the i think what the real reason is the
 

1161
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,430
the i think what the real reason is the
fda

1162
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:05,440
fda
 

1163
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,149
fda
has one job around these tests and it is

1164
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:08,159
has one job around these tests and it is
 

1165
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,230
has one job around these tests and it is
to authorize them as medical devices

1166
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:10,240
to authorize them as medical devices
 

1167
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,390
to authorize them as medical devices
they haven't been charged with doing

1168
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:12,400
they haven't been charged with doing
 

1169
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,909
they haven't been charged with doing
anything else

1170
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:13,919
anything else
 

1171
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,230
anything else
so in their eyes they're doing exactly

1172
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:16,240
so in their eyes they're doing exactly
 

1173
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,710
so in their eyes they're doing exactly
what they're supposed to do

1174
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:18,720
what they're supposed to do
 

1175
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,549
what they're supposed to do
they're evaluating these tests as

1176
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:20,559
they're evaluating these tests as
 

1177
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,230
they're evaluating these tests as
medical devices and they're telling

1178
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:22,240
medical devices and they're telling
 

1179
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,149
medical devices and they're telling
company after company after company

1180
00:20:24,149 --> 00:20:24,159
company after company after company
 

1181
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,549
company after company after company
sorry you don't make the cut

1182
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:26,559
sorry you don't make the cut
 

1183
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,070
sorry you don't make the cut
and the only way to make the cut is

1184
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:28,080
and the only way to make the cut is
 

1185
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,669
and the only way to make the cut is
really to kind of skew your clinical

1186
00:20:29,669 --> 00:20:29,679
really to kind of skew your clinical
 

1187
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,590
really to kind of skew your clinical
trials to favor

1188
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:31,600
trials to favor
 

1189
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,830
trials to favor
the rapid test being positive which

1190
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:33,840
the rapid test being positive which
 

1191
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,350
the rapid test being positive which
isn't really good practice we shouldn't

1192
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:35,360
isn't really good practice we shouldn't
 

1193
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,029
isn't really good practice we shouldn't
be trying to skew clinical trials

1194
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:39,039
be trying to skew clinical trials
 

1195
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,470
be trying to skew clinical trials
but that's kind of what's happened

1196
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:40,480
but that's kind of what's happened
 

1197
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,549
but that's kind of what's happened
that's been it's been forced upon the

1198
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:42,559
that's been it's been forced upon the
 

1199
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,390
that's been it's been forced upon the
companies to do that

1200
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:44,400
companies to do that
 

1201
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,430
companies to do that
and so

1202
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:45,440
and so
 

1203
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,350
and so
i think the fda truly believes from the

1204
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:47,360
i think the fda truly believes from the
 

1205
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,549
i think the fda truly believes from the
bottom of their heart that they are

1206
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:48,559
bottom of their heart that they are
 

1207
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,549
bottom of their heart that they are
doing the right thing here

1208
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:50,559
doing the right thing here
 

1209
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,029
doing the right thing here
and i would argue that to an extent they

1210
00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:53,039
and i would argue that to an extent they
 

1211
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,230
and i would argue that to an extent they
are i've been pretty hard on the fda but

1212
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:56,240
are i've been pretty hard on the fda but
 

1213
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,710
are i've been pretty hard on the fda but
maybe the issue is a higher level issue

1214
00:20:58,710 --> 00:20:58,720
maybe the issue is a higher level issue
 

1215
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,470
maybe the issue is a higher level issue
like the the in vitro diagnostics

1216
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:00,480
like the the in vitro diagnostics
 

1217
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,830
like the the in vitro diagnostics
division is

1218
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:01,840
division is
 

1219
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,590
division is
they get applications and they evaluate

1220
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:03,600
they get applications and they evaluate
 

1221
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,789
they get applications and they evaluate
them and the applications are for

1222
00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:04,799
them and the applications are for
 

1223
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,789
them and the applications are for
medical claims

1224
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:06,799
medical claims
 

1225
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,630
medical claims
that's however because there's been a

1226
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:08,640
that's however because there's been a
 

1227
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,190
that's however because there's been a
misunderstanding of these tests and the

1228
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:11,200
misunderstanding of these tests and the
 

1229
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,750
misunderstanding of these tests and the
companies only know to apply for these

1230
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:13,760
companies only know to apply for these
 

1231
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,270
companies only know to apply for these
as medical claims

1232
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:15,280
as medical claims
 

1233
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,110
as medical claims
because there is no

1234
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:17,120
because there is no
 

1235
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,870
because there is no
there's nothing else in this country to

1236
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:18,880
there's nothing else in this country to
 

1237
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,710
there's nothing else in this country to
apply for

1238
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:20,720
apply for
 

1239
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,390
apply for
except the medical claim

1240
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,400
except the medical claim
 

1241
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,230
except the medical claim
so we we don't have a public health

1242
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,240
so we we don't have a public health
 

1243
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,789
so we we don't have a public health
pathway to evaluate a test and authorize

1244
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:26,799
pathway to evaluate a test and authorize
 

1245
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,270
pathway to evaluate a test and authorize
a test it doesn't exist we have

1246
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:29,280
a test it doesn't exist we have
 

1247
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,510
a test it doesn't exist we have
defunded and devalued public health for

1248
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:31,520
defunded and devalued public health for
 

1249
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,190
defunded and devalued public health for
so long

1250
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:33,200
so long
 

1251
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,789
so long
that we literally don't have a language

1252
00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:34,799
that we literally don't have a language
 

1253
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,430
that we literally don't have a language
for it we don't have laws a language

1254
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:37,440
for it we don't have laws a language
 

1255
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,430
for it we don't have laws a language
words is it called a public health test

1256
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:39,440
words is it called a public health test
 

1257
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,590
words is it called a public health test
is it called something else i call it a

1258
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:41,600
is it called something else i call it a
 

1259
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,390
is it called something else i call it a
public health test because i'm trying to

1260
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:44,400
public health test because i'm trying to
 

1261
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,470
public health test because i'm trying to
create a new definition here

1262
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,480
create a new definition here
 

1263
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,310
create a new definition here
but that's why

1264
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:48,320
but that's why
 

1265
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,990
but that's why
that's why nobody's acted because no

1266
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:50,000
that's why nobody's acted because no
 

1267
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,190
that's why nobody's acted because no
because everyone says well there's no

1268
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:51,200
because everyone says well there's no
 

1269
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,110
because everyone says well there's no
other pathway so the fda

1270
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:53,120
other pathway so the fda
 

1271
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,270
other pathway so the fda
in vitro medical diagnostics division is

1272
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:55,280
in vitro medical diagnostics division is
 

1273
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,909
in vitro medical diagnostics division is
the only pathway so what i am trying to

1274
00:21:57,909 --> 00:21:57,919
the only pathway so what i am trying to
 

1275
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:58,950
the only pathway so what i am trying to
do

1276
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:58,960
do
 

1277
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,190
do
is to say look

1278
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:01,200
is to say look
 

1279
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,230
is to say look
the fda very clearly states

1280
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:04,240
the fda very clearly states
 

1281
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,909
the fda very clearly states
that they do not authorize or review

1282
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:07,919
that they do not authorize or review
 

1283
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,990
that they do not authorize or review
public health tools

1284
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:10,000
public health tools
 

1285
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,430
public health tools
and not and they don't authorize or

1286
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:11,440
and not and they don't authorize or
 

1287
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,190
and not and they don't authorize or
review public health tests for for covid

1288
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:15,200
review public health tests for for covid
 

1289
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,149
review public health tests for for covid
so

1290
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:16,159
so
 

1291
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,630
so
what i want the president of the united

1292
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:18,640
what i want the president of the united
 

1293
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,750
what i want the president of the united
states to do is to utilize executive

1294
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:21,760
states to do is to utilize executive
 

1295
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:24,630
states to do is to utilize executive
powers and take an executive action that

1296
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:24,640

could potentially

1300
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:29,280
could potentially
 

1301
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,950
could potentially
change all of this

1302
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:30,960
change all of this
 

1303
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,190
change all of this
and it's a pretty obvious and simple

1304
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:33,200
and it's a pretty obvious and simple
 

1305

if we can do that if we can get that
language out there so that that's the

then all of a sudden the fda is off the
 

1335

they're not trying to to cram a square
 

1339

they can say look the antigen tests are

1342
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:10,960
they can say look the antigen tests are
 

1343
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,630
they can say look the antigen tests are
not on us anymore at least if they're

1344
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:12,640
not on us anymore at least if they're
 

1345
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,310
not on us anymore at least if they're
going to be used for public health like

1346
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:14,320
going to be used for public health like
 

1347
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,830
going to be used for public health like
when you test a thousand people at a

1348
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,840
when you test a thousand people at a
 

1349
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,270
when you test a thousand people at a
time or

1350
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,280
time or
 

1351
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,909
time or
test a school a school classroom if

1352
00:23:19,909 --> 00:23:19,919
test a school a school classroom if
 

1353
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,990
test a school a school classroom if
they've been exposed this is public

1354
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,000
they've been exposed this is public
 

1355
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,149
they've been exposed this is public
health and so then the cdc could take it

1356
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:24,159
health and so then the cdc could take it
 

1357
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,029
health and so then the cdc could take it
over

1358
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:25,039
over
 

1359
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,430
over
the cdc could say okay

1360
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:27,440
the cdc could say okay
 

1361
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,350
the cdc could say okay
what are the metrics we are interested

1362
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:29,360
what are the metrics we are interested
 

1363
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,230
what are the metrics we are interested
in

1364
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,240
in
 

1365
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,590
in
and they could say we're interested in a

1366
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:31,600
and they could say we're interested in a
 

1367
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,029
and they could say we're interested in a
test that can catch you if you're

1368
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:33,039
test that can catch you if you're
 

1369
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,950
test that can catch you if you're
infectious so you want high viral load

1370
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:34,960
infectious so you want high viral load
 

1371
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,149
infectious so you want high viral load
detection that's fast that's scalable

1372
00:23:38,149 --> 00:23:38,159
detection that's fast that's scalable
 

1373
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,990
detection that's fast that's scalable
and hey you know if your test has been

1374
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:40,000
and hey you know if your test has been
 

1375
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,070
and hey you know if your test has been
used in europe for months and has

1376
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,080
used in europe for months and has
 

1377
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,909
used in europe for months and has
performed extremely well

1378
00:23:43,909 --> 00:23:43,919
performed extremely well
 

1379
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,750
performed extremely well
then then we'll give you a certificate

1380
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:45,760
then then we'll give you a certificate
 

1381
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,549
then then we'll give you a certificate
by right you know immediately and that

1382
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:48,559
by right you know immediately and that
 

1383
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,789
by right you know immediately and that
could actually get

1384
00:23:50,789 --> 00:23:50,799
could actually get
 

1385
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,549
could actually get
hundreds of millions of additional tests

1386
00:23:52,549 --> 00:23:52,559
hundreds of millions of additional tests
 

1387
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,029
hundreds of millions of additional tests
into the united states tomorrow

1388
00:23:55,029 --> 00:23:55,039
into the united states tomorrow
 

1389
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,789
into the united states tomorrow
so you need some kind of classification

1390
00:23:56,789 --> 00:23:56,799
so you need some kind of classification
 

1391
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,029
so you need some kind of classification
from an fda from somebody to call it a

1392
00:23:59,029 --> 00:23:59,039
from an fda from somebody to call it a
 

1393
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,870
from an fda from somebody to call it a
public health tool in order for it to be

1394
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:00,880
public health tool in order for it to be
 

1395
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,269
public health tool in order for it to be
manufactured is it possible to just go

1396
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:03,279
manufactured is it possible to just go
 

1397
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,430
manufactured is it possible to just go
around all of this and just for somebody

1398
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:05,440
around all of this and just for somebody
 

1399
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,750
around all of this and just for somebody
to manufacture at scale

1400
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:07,760
to manufacture at scale
 

1401
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:08,950
to manufacture at scale
tests

1402
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:08,960
tests
 

1403
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,750
tests
well

1404
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:09,760
well
 

1405
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,149
well
you if you did that and you just called

1406
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:12,159
you if you did that and you just called
 

1407
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,669
you if you did that and you just called
them you put a claim on them that called

1408
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:13,679
them you put a claim on them that called
 

1409
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,950
them you put a claim on them that called
them public health tools

1410
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:16,960
them public health tools
 

1411
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,190
them public health tools
the fda has a very

1412
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:19,200
the fda has a very
 

1413
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,269
the fda has a very
weird view of this and they will tell

1414
00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:21,279
weird view of this and they will tell
 

1415
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,870
weird view of this and they will tell
you that it's illegal that it's a crime

1416
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:24,880
you that it's illegal that it's a crime
 

1417
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,190
you that it's illegal that it's a crime
is there a way to say like elon musk did

1418
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:27,200
is there a way to say like elon musk did
 

1419
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,470
is there a way to say like elon musk did
with the flamethrower it's not a

1420
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:28,480
with the flamethrower it's not a
 

1421
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,950
with the flamethrower it's not a
flamethrower yeah

1422
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:30,960
flamethrower yeah
 

1423
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,269
flamethrower yeah
uh believe me i've tried i've tried to

1424
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:33,279
uh believe me i've tried i've tried to
 

1425
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,230
uh believe me i've tried i've tried to
think of all the different approaches um

1426
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:36,240
think of all the different approaches um
 

1427
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,750
think of all the different approaches um
you know there's weird there's like

1428
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:37,760
you know there's weird there's like
 

1429
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,909
you know there's weird there's like
there's major inconsistencies here so

1430
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:39,919
there's major inconsistencies here so
 

1431
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,430
there's major inconsistencies here so
it's not like we don't have a precedent

1432
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:41,440
it's not like we don't have a precedent
 

1433
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,950
it's not like we don't have a precedent
for a public health test even during

1434
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:42,960
for a public health test even during
 

1435
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,789
for a public health test even during
this pandemic

1436
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:44,799
this pandemic
 

1437
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,110
this pandemic
there is a very strong precedent

1438
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:47,120
there is a very strong precedent
 

1439
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,110
there is a very strong precedent
uh pooled testing

1440
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,120
uh pooled testing
 

1441
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,190
uh pooled testing
we have companies like ginkgo right

1442
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:51,200
we have companies like ginkgo right
 

1443
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,950
we have companies like ginkgo right
based out here in cambridge

uh
 

1449
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,029
uh
you know working with 100 different labs

1450
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,039
you know working with 100 different labs
 

1451
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,710
you know working with 100 different labs
around the country so that might mean

1452
00:24:58,710 --> 00:24:58,720
around the country so that might mean
 

1453
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,470
around the country so that might mean
like not a ton of quality control over

1454
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:00,480
like not a ton of quality control over
 

1455
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:01,990
like not a ton of quality control over
those labs

1456

those labs
 

1457
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,190

doing

1458
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:03,200
doing
 

1459
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,630
doing
uh i mean i don't want to say that they

1460
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:04,640
uh i mean i don't want to say that they
 

1461
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,230
uh i mean i don't want to say that they
don't i'm just saying the reality is if

1462
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:06,240
don't i'm just saying the reality is if
 

1463
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,990
don't i'm just saying the reality is if
you're working with that many labs it's

1464
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:08,000
you're working with that many labs it's
 

1465
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,909
you're working with that many labs it's
hard to say they're running pooled

1466
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:09,919
hard to say they're running pooled
 

1467
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,190
hard to say they're running pooled
testing

1468
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:11,200
testing
 

1469
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,630
testing
of millions and millions millions of

1470
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
of millions and millions millions of
 

1471
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,029
of millions and millions millions of
kids

1472
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:15,039
kids
 

1473
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:17,909
kids
so here you have a company that's

1474
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:17,919
so here you have a company that's
 

1475
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,269
so here you have a company that's
testing

1476
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:19,279
testing
 

1477
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,870
testing
in each pool five to 25 kids at a time

1478
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:22,880
in each pool five to 25 kids at a time
 

1479
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,190
in each pool five to 25 kids at a time
millions of kids in a pretty distributed

1480
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,200
millions of kids in a pretty distributed
 

1481
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,470
millions of kids in a pretty distributed
way across the country and all these

1482
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:26,480
way across the country and all these
 

1483
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,470
way across the country and all these
different labs

1484
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:28,480
different labs
 

1485
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,390
different labs
and the fda doesn't care at all you

1486
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
and the fda doesn't care at all you
 

1487
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,230
and the fda doesn't care at all you
don't need any ua it doesn't need a

1488
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:32,240
don't need any ua it doesn't need a
 

1489
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,149
don't need any ua it doesn't need a
regulatory authority

1490
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:34,159
regulatory authority
 

1491
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:35,830
regulatory authority
it's collection on site it's getting

1492
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:35,840
it's collection on site it's getting
 

1493
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,870
it's collection on site it's getting
shipped to a lab there's no oversight of

1494
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:38,880
shipped to a lab there's no oversight of
 

1495
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,149
shipped to a lab there's no oversight of
it

1496
00:25:40,149 --> 00:25:40,159
it
 

1497
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,390
it
so why does that have no oversight but a

1498
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:42,400
so why does that have no oversight but a
 

1499
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,029
so why does that have no oversight but a
rapid test for pub for the exact same

1500
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,039
rapid test for pub for the exact same
 

1501
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,310
rapid test for pub for the exact same
purpose

1502
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:46,320
purpose
 

1503
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,669
purpose
you're just giving people immediate

1504
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:47,679
you're just giving people immediate
 

1505
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:49,750
you're just giving people immediate
results instead of two-day delayed

1506
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
results instead of two-day delayed
 

1507
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,990
results instead of two-day delayed
pooled pcr results so it's a much more

1508
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:52,000
pooled pcr results so it's a much more
 

1509
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,750
pooled pcr results so it's a much more
effective tool

1510
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:53,760
effective tool
 

1511
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,909
effective tool
why is the rapid test used for the same

1512
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:55,919
why is the rapid test used for the same
 

1513
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:56,950
why is the rapid test used for the same
purpose

1514
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:56,960
purpose
 

1515
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,710

not designated as a public health tool

not designated as a public health tool
 

1517
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,230
not designated as a public health tool
but requiring

1518
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
but requiring
 

1519
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,390
but requiring
fda authorization

1520
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:02,400
fda authorization
 

1521
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,110
fda authorization
it's a ridiculous reason

1522
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:05,120
it's a ridiculous reason
 

1523
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,750
it's a ridiculous reason
and it's because the fda says that if a

1524
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:07,760
and it's because the fda says that if a
 

1525
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,510
and it's because the fda says that if a
test

1526
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:09,520
test
 

1527
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,510
test
and this is actually cms that says this

1528
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:11,520
and this is actually cms that says this
 

1529
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,590
and this is actually cms that says this
and then the fda adopts it

1530
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:13,600
and then the fda adopts it
 

1531
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,190
and then the fda adopts it
if a test alters your

1532
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:17,200
if a test alters your
 

1533
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,590
if a test alters your
behavior if you get a single result and

1534
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:19,600
behavior if you get a single result and
 

1535
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,830
behavior if you get a single result and
it's going to alter your behavior

1536
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:21,840
it's going to alter your behavior
 

1537
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,350
it's going to alter your behavior
then that is a medical device

1538
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:25,360
then that is a medical device
 

1539
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,390
then that is a medical device
but

1540
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:26,400
but
 

1541
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,390
but
the thing that i find ridiculous is like

1542
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:28,400
the thing that i find ridiculous is like
 

1543
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,310
the thing that i find ridiculous is like
okay but you can give a pooled test that

1544
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:30,320
okay but you can give a pooled test that
 

1545
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,830
okay but you can give a pooled test that
alters 25 people's behavior at once

1546
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:33,840
alters 25 people's behavior at once
 

1547
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,750
alters 25 people's behavior at once
and that's not falling like that's more

1548
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:35,760
and that's not falling like that's more
 

1549
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,750
and that's not falling like that's more
risky one person turns positive in the

1550
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:37,760
risky one person turns positive in the
 

1551
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,390
risky one person turns positive in the
pool and 25 people have to be

1552
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:40,400
pool and 25 people have to be
 

1553
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,549
pool and 25 people have to be
quarantined

1554
00:26:42,549 --> 00:26:42,559
quarantined
 

1555
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,029
quarantined
and uh how do they evaluate the accuracy

1556
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:45,039
and uh how do they evaluate the accuracy
 

1557
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,710
and uh how do they evaluate the accuracy
so for people who don't know a pooled

1558
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:46,720
so for people who don't know a pooled
 

1559
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,590
so for people who don't know a pooled
test

1560
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:47,600
test
 

1561
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,830
test
is you're testing a small fraction of

1562
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:49,840
is you're testing a small fraction of
 

1563
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,750
is you're testing a small fraction of
the people

1564
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:51,760
the people
 

1565
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,470
the people
and

1566
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:52,480
and
 

1567
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,190
and
if one of them is positive then you

1568
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:55,200
if one of them is positive then you
 

1569
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,789
if one of them is positive then you
basically say we have to retest

1570
00:26:56,789 --> 00:26:56,799
basically say we have to retest
 

1571
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,870
basically say we have to retest
everybody in the pool or like you yeah

1572
00:26:58,870 --> 00:26:58,880
everybody in the pool or like you yeah
 

1573
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,190
everybody in the pool or like you yeah
so you take let's say you have a school

1574
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:01,200
so you take let's say you have a school
 

1575
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,029
so you take let's say you have a school
and each classroom you might have 20

1576
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:03,039
and each classroom you might have 20
 

1577
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,269
and each classroom you might have 20
kids each swab their nose in a classroom

1578
00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:05,279
kids each swab their nose in a classroom
 

1579
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,870
kids each swab their nose in a classroom
and all those swabs go into a single

1580
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:06,880
and all those swabs go into a single
 

1581
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,990
and all those swabs go into a single
tube

1582
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:08,000
tube
 

1583
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,669
tube
and then you rinse that tube out with

1584
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:09,679
and then you rinse that tube out with
 

1585
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,909
and then you rinse that tube out with
some saline and you run a pcr test on

1586
00:27:11,909 --> 00:27:11,919
some saline and you run a pcr test on
 

1587
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:15,669
some saline and you run a pcr test on
that tube of 25 samples or 20 samples

1588
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:15,679
that tube of 25 samples or 20 samples
 

1589
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,909
that tube of 25 samples or 20 samples
and so if that tube turns positive in

1590
00:27:17,909 --> 00:27:17,919
and so if that tube turns positive in
 

1591
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,669
and so if that tube turns positive in
the pcr test

1592
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:19,679
the pcr test
 

1593
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,110
the pcr test
then all 20 or 25 of those students

1594
00:27:23,110 --> 00:27:23,120
then all 20 or 25 of those students
 

1595
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,750
then all 20 or 25 of those students
are now having to quarantine yeah and if

1596
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:25,760
are now having to quarantine yeah and if
 

1597
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,470
are now having to quarantine yeah and if
there's no positive then all 20 or 25

1598
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:28,480
there's no positive then all 20 or 25
 

1599
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,070
there's no positive then all 20 or 25
students are

1600
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:30,080
students are
 

1601
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,990
students are
interpreting that their result is

1602
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:32,000
interpreting that their result is
 

1603
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,190
interpreting that their result is
negative

1604
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:33,200
negative
 

1605
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,149
negative
you know so it really is ridiculous

1606
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:36,159
you know so it really is ridiculous
 

1607
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,870
you know so it really is ridiculous
decision by the fda to say that

1608
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:38,880
decision by the fda to say that
 

1609
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,029
decision by the fda to say that
if the test itself only tests one sample

1610
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:41,039
if the test itself only tests one sample
 

1611
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,710
if the test itself only tests one sample
at a time it's medicine

1612
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:42,720
at a time it's medicine
 

1613
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,710
at a time it's medicine
because it will tell you one person at a

1614
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:44,720
because it will tell you one person at a
 

1615
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,470
because it will tell you one person at a
time if you're positive or if you're

1616
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:46,480
time if you're positive or if you're
 

1617
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,630
time if you're positive or if you're
negative but if you do it as a pool and

1618
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:48,640
negative but if you do it as a pool and
 

1619
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,230
negative but if you do it as a pool and
you and you

1620
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,240
you and you
 

1621
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,149
you and you
tell 25 people that your pool was

1622
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:52,159
tell 25 people that your pool was
 

1623
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:54,070
tell 25 people that your pool was
negative

1624
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:54,080
negative
 

1625
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,669
negative
then that's somehow different that's

1626
00:27:55,669 --> 00:27:55,679
then that's somehow different that's
 

1627
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,909
then that's somehow different that's
public health not medicine it it doesn't

1628
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:57,919
public health not medicine it it doesn't
 

1629
00:27:57,919 --> 00:27:59,669
public health not medicine it it doesn't
make there's no logic there was it just

1630
00:27:59,669 --> 00:27:59,679
make there's no logic there was it just
 

1631
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,149
make there's no logic there was it just
personalities and accidents of history

1632
00:28:02,149 --> 00:28:02,159
personalities and accidents of history
 

1633
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,149
personalities and accidents of history
or something like that for example

1634
00:28:04,149 --> 00:28:04,159
or something like that for example
 

1635
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,590
or something like that for example
you talk about the

1636
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:05,600
you talk about the
 

1637
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,310
you talk about the
public health tools and cdc you look at

1638
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:08,320
public health tools and cdc you look at
 

1639
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,430
public health tools and cdc you look at
masks

1640
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:09,440
masks
 

1641
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,070
masks
so masks were decided to somehow be an

1642
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:12,080
so masks were decided to somehow be an
 

1643
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,510
so masks were decided to somehow be an
effective tool

1644
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:13,520
effective tool
 

1645
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,310
effective tool
to help with the pandemic like so i'm

1646
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:16,320
to help with the pandemic like so i'm
 

1647
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,190
to help with the pandemic like so i'm
sure the evidence that was used there

1648
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:19,200
sure the evidence that was used there
 

1649
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,430
sure the evidence that was used there
was probably not as strong as the

1650
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:21,440
was probably not as strong as the
 

1651
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,990
was probably not as strong as the
evidence supporting antigen rapid tests

1652
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,000
evidence supporting antigen rapid tests
 

1653
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,029
evidence supporting antigen rapid tests
i was

1654
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:25,039
i was
 

1655
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,789
i was
very much reading a lot of research on

1656
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:26,799
very much reading a lot of research on
 

1657
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:29,510
very much reading a lot of research on
masks it's tricky it's really tricky to

1658
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:29,520
masks it's tricky it's really tricky to
 

1659
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,830
masks it's tricky it's really tricky to
show how well they stop the transmission

1660
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:31,840
show how well they stop the transmission
 

1661
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,430
show how well they stop the transmission
of a virus especially when you don't

1662
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:33,440
of a virus especially when you don't
 

1663
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,029
of a virus especially when you don't
fully understand how the virus is

1664
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:35,039
fully understand how the virus is
 

1665
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,350
fully understand how the virus is
transmitted or the viral load required

1666
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:37,360
transmitted or the viral load required
 

1667
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,590
transmitted or the viral load required
all that kind of stuff but then the cdc

1668
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:39,600
all that kind of stuff but then the cdc
 

1669
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,990
all that kind of stuff but then the cdc
pretty quickly decided masks or whatever

1670
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:42,000
pretty quickly decided masks or whatever
 

1671
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,590
pretty quickly decided masks or whatever
there's some oscillations back and forth

1672
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:43,600
there's some oscillations back and forth
 

1673
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,909
there's some oscillations back and forth
but then they quickly decided all

1674
00:28:45,909 --> 00:28:45,919
but then they quickly decided all
 

1675
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,510
but then they quickly decided all
everybody decided masks is a good tool

1676
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:49,520
everybody decided masks is a good tool
 

1677
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,510
everybody decided masks is a good tool
so masks being decided a good tool and

1678
00:28:51,510 --> 00:28:51,520
so masks being decided a good tool and
 

1679
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,389
so masks being decided a good tool and
then

1680
00:28:52,389 --> 00:28:52,399
then
 

1681
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,029
then
rapid antigen tests not a good tool is

1682
00:28:55,029 --> 00:28:55,039
rapid antigen tests not a good tool is
 

1683
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,669
rapid antigen tests not a good tool is
that just like certain personalities who

1684
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:57,679
that just like certain personalities who
 

1685
00:28:57,679 --> 00:28:59,510
that just like certain personalities who
didn't speak up in a meeting or who did

1686
00:28:59,510 --> 00:28:59,520
didn't speak up in a meeting or who did
 

1687
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,350
didn't speak up in a meeting or who did
speak up in a meeting is this just like

1688
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:01,360
speak up in a meeting is this just like
 

1689
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,110
speak up in a meeting is this just like
a weird role of the dice or is there a

1690
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:03,120
a weird role of the dice or is there a
 

1691
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,870
a weird role of the dice or is there a
better explanation

1692
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:04,880
better explanation
 

1693
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,430
better explanation
i think it's somewhat of a roll the dice

1694
00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:07,440
i think it's somewhat of a roll the dice
 

1695
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,710
i think it's somewhat of a roll the dice
but i also think it's that testing

1696
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:10,720
but i also think it's that testing
 

1697
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,510
but i also think it's that testing
so

1698
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:11,520
so
 

1699
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,430
so
doctors

1700
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:13,440
doctors
 

1701
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,830
doctors
don't pretend to like really understand

1702
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:15,840
don't pretend to like really understand
 

1703
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,830
don't pretend to like really understand
much about like

1704
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:17,840
much about like
 

1705
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,389
much about like
fluid dynamics and you know how well

1706
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:20,399
fluid dynamics and you know how well
 

1707
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,070
fluid dynamics and you know how well
masks are working like that's like way

1708
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,080
masks are working like that's like way
 

1709
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,669
masks are working like that's like way
out of their realm

1710
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:23,679
out of their realm
 

1711
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,950
out of their realm
doctors

1712
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:24,960
doctors
 

1713
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,830
doctors
do believe that they understand all

1714
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:27,840
do believe that they understand all
 

1715
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,310
do believe that they understand all
aspects of the tests right

1716
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:30,320
aspects of the tests right
 

1717
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,350
aspects of the tests right
and so the greatest barriers to rapid

1718
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:33,360
and so the greatest barriers to rapid
 

1719
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,909
and so the greatest barriers to rapid
tests being brought to market or sort of

1720
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:37,919
tests being brought to market or sort of
 

1721
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,549
tests being brought to market or sort of
being being rolled out heavily and

1722
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:40,559
being being rolled out heavily and
 

1723
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,669
being being rolled out heavily and
supported as public health tools

1724
00:29:43,669 --> 00:29:43,679
supported as public health tools
 

1725
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,430
supported as public health tools
uh the greatest barriers came from

1726
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:45,440
uh the greatest barriers came from
 

1727
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,669
uh the greatest barriers came from
physicians saying

1728
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:47,679
physicians saying
 

1729
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:49,830
physicians saying
hell no we can't use a test that's not

1730
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:49,840
hell no we can't use a test that's not
 

1731
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,470
hell no we can't use a test that's not
as sensitive as a pcr

1732
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:52,480
as sensitive as a pcr
 

1733
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,669
as sensitive as a pcr
and

1734
00:29:53,669 --> 00:29:53,679
and
 

1735
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:56,070
and
look at what happens if you use this

1736
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,080
look at what happens if you use this
 

1737
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,789
look at what happens if you use this
antigen test and not a pcr test you get

1738
00:29:58,789 --> 00:29:58,799
antigen test and not a pcr test you get
 

1739
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,669
antigen test and not a pcr test you get
people

1740
00:29:59,669 --> 00:29:59,679
people
 

1741
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,909
people
who are showing a positive on a pcr

1742
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:01,919
who are showing a positive on a pcr
 

1743
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,990
who are showing a positive on a pcr
negative on an antigen

1744
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,000
negative on an antigen
 

1745
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,630
negative on an antigen
and they just assume that that was a

1746
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:06,640
and they just assume that that was a
 

1747
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,870
and they just assume that that was a
false negative on the antigen

1748
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:08,880
false negative on the antigen
 

1749
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,549
false negative on the antigen
for public health i would call it a

1750
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:10,559
for public health i would call it a
 

1751
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,909
for public health i would call it a
false positive on the pcr test but this

1752
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:13,919
false positive on the pcr test but this
 

1753
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,070
false positive on the pcr test but this
type of thinking

1754
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,080
type of thinking
 

1755
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,710
type of thinking
literally does not exist in medicine and

1756
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:18,720
literally does not exist in medicine and
 

1757
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,389
literally does not exist in medicine and
i think the biggest problem here is that

1758
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:20,399
i think the biggest problem here is that
 

1759
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,350
i think the biggest problem here is that
we

1760
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:21,360
we
 

1761
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,310
we
placed physicians in decision making

1762
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,320
placed physicians in decision making
 

1763
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,430
placed physicians in decision making
power

we have
 

1767
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,510
we have
won this pandemic hit everyone called up

00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:29,520
won this pandemic hit everyone called up
 

1769

tests should we use that kind of thing
 

1777
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,870
tests should we use that kind of thing
and there is no training in medical

and there is no training in medical
school for this kind of public health

1780
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:42,720
school for this kind of public health
 

1781
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,510
school for this kind of public health
work like uh you have to optimize on the

1782
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:45,520
work like uh you have to optimize on the
 

1783
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,909
work like uh you have to optimize on the
right qualities of a test

1784
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:47,919
right qualities of a test
 

1785
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,029
right qualities of a test
that have nothing to do with medicine

1786
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:51,039
that have nothing to do with medicine
 

1787
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:53,669
that have nothing to do with medicine
and then sometimes if not frequently

1788
00:30:53,669 --> 00:30:53,679
and then sometimes if not frequently
 

1789
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,350
and then sometimes if not frequently
they're actually at odds and i'll give

1790
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:55,360
they're actually at odds and i'll give
 

1791
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,269
they're actually at odds and i'll give
an example

1792
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:57,279
an example
 

1793
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,789
an example
why the physicians you could see why the

1794
00:30:58,789 --> 00:30:58,799
why the physicians you could see why the
 

1795
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,230
why the physicians you could see why the
physicians would have been against it

1796
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,240
physicians would have been against it
 

1797
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,070
physicians would have been against it
from their perspective

1798
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:02,080
from their perspective
 

1799
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,830
from their perspective
and they say uh if a physician is a tsa

1800
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:05,840
and they say uh if a physician is a tsa
 

1801
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,029
and they say uh if a physician is a tsa
agent

at the airport
 

1805
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,190
at the airport
you know a tsa agent their role at any

1806
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:11,200
you know a tsa agent their role at any
 

1807
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,630
you know a tsa agent their role at any

and the role they think that the
 

1811
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,909

what those tsa agents don't have to

1830
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:34,799
what those tsa agents don't have to
 

1831
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,710
what those tsa agents don't have to
worry about is well how many other

1832
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:36,720
worry about is well how many other
 

1833
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,470

00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:43,440
security the average tsa agent doesn't
 

1841
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,710
security the average tsa agent doesn't
have to worry about that they literally

1842
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:44,720
have to worry about that they literally
 

1843
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,630
have to worry about that they literally
have one job to do and it's pay

attention to this lane
if there's a big gap in the security

1848
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:51,039
if there's a big gap in the security
 

1849

if there's a big gap in the security
line and people are flowing through

without going through security that's
 

1853
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,549
without going through security that's
not on the tsa agent that's not a big

1854
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:56,559
not on the tsa agent that's not a big
 

1855

not on the tsa agent that's not a big

system
 

1859
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,590
system
and we can't expect that tsa agent to

1860
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:03,600
and we can't expect that tsa agent to
 

1861
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,430
and we can't expect that tsa agent to
have ever even thought about that like

1862
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:05,440
have ever even thought about that like
 

1863
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,950
have ever even thought about that like
that's not on them they were trained to

1864
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:06,960
that's not on them they were trained to
 

1865
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,430
that's not on them they were trained to
look at a to look at the bag

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:09,440
look at a to look at the bag
 

1867
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,070
look at a to look at the bag
and that's kind of like physicians

1868
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:12,080
and that's kind of like physicians
 

1869
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,909
and that's kind of like physicians
and i you know probably some physicians

1870
00:32:13,909 --> 00:32:13,919
and i you know probably some physicians
 

1871
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,269
and i you know probably some physicians
will hear this and feel like i'm

1872
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:15,279
will hear this and feel like i'm
 

1873
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,350
will hear this and feel like i'm
insulting it i don't mean to be liking

1874
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:17,360
insulting it i don't mean to be liking

insulting it i don't mean to be liking
you know the two professions and or

1876
00:32:18,789 --> 00:32:18,799
you know the two professions and or
 

1877
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,549
you know the two professions and or
anything like that i what but the point

1878
00:32:20,549 --> 00:32:20,559
anything like that i what but the point
 

1879
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,470
anything like that i what but the point
is is that

1880
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:22,480
is is that
 

1881
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,269
is is that
a physician has one duty do no harm to

1882
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:25,279
a physician has one duty do no harm to
 

1883
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,470
a physician has one duty do no harm to
this patient

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,350
this patient
time isn't of the essence scale how many

1886
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:29,360
time isn't of the essence scale how many
 

1887
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,389
time isn't of the essence scale how many
tests can my hospital perform in a day

1888
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:32,399
tests can my hospital perform in a day
 

1889
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,029
tests can my hospital perform in a day
how many tests can my county or country

1890
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,039
how many tests can my county or country
 

1891
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,350
how many tests can my county or country
perform in a day that's not a

1892
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:37,360
perform in a day that's not a
 

1893
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,430
perform in a day that's not a
physician's training to think like that

1894
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,440
physician's training to think like that
 

1895
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,110
physician's training to think like that
at all

1896
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:41,120
at all
 

1897
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,750
at all
and so what has happened is doctors got

1898
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:43,760
and so what has happened is doctors got
 

1899
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,230
and so what has happened is doctors got
on board early and said oh hell no we've

1900
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:46,240
on board early and said oh hell no we've
 

1901
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,750
on board early and said oh hell no we've
seen these antigen tests before they're

1902
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:47,760
seen these antigen tests before they're
 

1903
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,509
seen these antigen tests before they're
not particularly sensitive compared to

1904
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:49,519
not particularly sensitive compared to
 

1905
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,909
not particularly sensitive compared to
pcr and and early in the pandemic there

1906
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:51,919
pcr and and early in the pandemic there
 

1907
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,990
pcr and and early in the pandemic there
was like pissing matches between labs

1908
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,000
was like pissing matches between labs
 

1909
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,950
was like pissing matches between labs
who had the most sensitive pcr

1910
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:56,960
who had the most sensitive pcr
 

1911
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,149
who had the most sensitive pcr
and it just

1912
00:32:58,149 --> 00:32:58,159
and it just
 

1913
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,789
and it just
distracted everything it really i was

1914
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:00,799
distracted everything it really i was
 

1915
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,430
distracted everything it really i was
trying to say pretty early like

1916
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:03,440
trying to say pretty early like
 

1917
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,350
trying to say pretty early like
we don't need sensitivity we just need

1918
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:05,360
we don't need sensitivity we just need
 

1919
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,350
we don't need sensitivity we just need
frequency we just need scale we need to

1920
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:07,360
frequency we just need scale we need to
 

1921
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,509
frequency we just need scale we need to
think differently because our only goal

1922
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:09,519
think differently because our only goal
 

1923
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:10,870
think differently because our only goal
if we're doing

1924
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:10,880
if we're doing
 

1925
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,789
if we're doing
frequent routine testing of asymptomatic

1926
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:12,799
frequent routine testing of asymptomatic
 

1927
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,590

is not medicine it's to say do you need
 

1931
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,870
is not medicine it's to say do you need
to isolate now

1932
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:16,880
to isolate now
 

1933
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,950
to isolate now
and if you have a pcr test that's taking

1934
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:18,960
and if you have a pcr test that's taking
 

1935
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,590
and if you have a pcr test that's taking
three days to return and you're like if

1936
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:21,600
three days to return and you're like if

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:53,510
idea of rapid home testing
and it's it's you watch that happening

2022
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:53,520
and it's it's you watch that happening
 

2023
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,270
and it's it's you watch that happening
this discussion that this is an obvious

2024
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,280
this discussion that this is an obvious
 

2025
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,710
this discussion that this is an obvious
part of the solution and the solution is

2026
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:56,720
part of the solution and the solution is
 

2027
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,990
part of the solution and the solution is
not happening

2028
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:58,000
not happening
 

2029
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,990
not happening
so who is supposed to implement this

2030
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,000
so who is supposed to implement this
 

2031
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,190
so who is supposed to implement this
idea

2032
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:01,200
idea
 

2033
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,270
idea
i think the cdc that it should start

2034
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:03,280
i think the cdc that it should start
 

2035
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,069
i think the cdc that it should start
there

2036
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:04,079
there
 

2037
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,990
there
override the fda

2038
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:06,000
override the fda
 

2039
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,349
override the fda
well i don't even think it needs to

2040
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:07,359
well i don't even think it needs to
 

2041
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:09,190
well i don't even think it needs to
override it and that's why i think these

2042
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:09,200
override it and that's why i think these
 

2043
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,950
override it and that's why i think these
should just be designated as a different

2044
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:10,960
should just be designated as a different
 

2045
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,150
should just be designated as a different
tool

2046

2049
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,390
so that the company is it's not
overriding it's just saying look this

2050
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:16,400
overriding it's just saying look this
 

2051
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,589
overriding it's just saying look this
isn't even this isn't in your

00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:17,599
isn't even this isn't in your
 

2053
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,230
isn't even this isn't in your
jurisdiction to the fda this is just a

fda they designate these as medical
 

2063
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,589
fda they designate these as medical
devices purely because they could change

2064
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:31,599
devices purely because they could change
 

2065
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,589
devices purely because they could change
somebody's behavior based on the result

2066
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:33,599
somebody's behavior based on the result
 

2067
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,430
somebody's behavior based on the result
of one test

of one test
 

2069
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,670
of one test
so to change that at this point unless

2097
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,150
i'm tasking the cdc
to certify these tests or or authorize

2098
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:06,160
to certify these tests or or authorize
 

2099
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,630
to certify these tests or or authorize
them for use in the united states and

2100
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:08,640
them for use in the united states and
 

2101
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,150
them for use in the united states and
you know he has to say something like

2102
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,160
you know he has to say something like
 

2103
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,470
you know he has to say something like
that he can't come out and say these are

2104
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:12,480
that he can't come out and say these are
 

2105
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,349
that he can't come out and say these are
public health tools have free reign

2106
00:36:15,349 --> 00:36:15,359
public health tools have free reign
 

2107
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:17,750
public health tools have free reign
just you know any company start start

2108
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:17,760
just you know any company start start
 

2109
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,950
just you know any company start start
shipping them in the us because that

2110
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:18,960
shipping them in the us because that
 

2111
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,950
shipping them in the us because that
would create pandemonia and we'd have a

2112
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:20,960
would create pandemonia and we'd have a
 

2113
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,710
would create pandemonia and we'd have a
lot of bad tests

2114
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:22,720
lot of bad tests
 

2115
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,190
lot of bad tests
but there's a lot of really good tests

2116
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:25,200
but there's a lot of really good tests
 

2117
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,150
but there's a lot of really good tests
out there we just are taking like 6 to

2118
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,160
out there we just are taking like 6 to
 

2119
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,710
out there we just are taking like 6 to
12 months to run trials they're failing

2120
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:30,720
12 months to run trials they're failing
 

2121
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,829
12 months to run trials they're failing
because they can't keep up with pcr

2122
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:33,839
because they can't keep up with pcr
 

2123
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:35,030
because they can't keep up with pcr
and

2124
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,040
and
 

2125
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,470
and
if the president were to do this then

2126
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:36,480
if the president were to do this then
 

2127
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,150
if the president were to do this then
the cdc could take it over and they

2128
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:38,160
the cdc could take it over and they
 

2129
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,349
the cdc could take it over and they
could say okay

2130
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:39,359
could say okay
 

2131
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,069
could say okay
it's on us we're going to decide

2132
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:42,079
it's on us we're going to decide
 

2133
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,310
it's on us we're going to decide
the uk actually did this they

2134
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:44,320
the uk actually did this they
 

2135
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,310
the uk actually did this they
early on they said okay

2136
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:46,320
early on they said okay
 

2137
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,150
early on they said okay
they laid out a very clear regimen they

2138
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,160
they laid out a very clear regimen they
 

2139
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,990
they laid out a very clear regimen they
said this is how we are going to

2140
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,000
said this is how we are going to
 

2141
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,270
said this is how we are going to
evaluate

2142
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:51,280
evaluate
 

2143
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,270
evaluate
rapid antigen tests because they're

2144
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:53,280
rapid antigen tests because they're
 

2145
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,670
rapid antigen tests because they're
public health tools they did it in a in

2146
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:55,680
public health tools they did it in a in
 

2147
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,109
public health tools they did it in a in
a domain that was outside of their

2148
00:36:57,109 --> 00:36:57,119
a domain that was outside of their
 

2149
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,190
a domain that was outside of their
normal medical diagnostic regulatory

2150
00:36:59,190 --> 00:36:59,200
normal medical diagnostic regulatory
 

2151
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,390
normal medical diagnostic regulatory
agencies

2152
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:00,400
agencies
 

2153
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,030
agencies
and they they literally just had

2154
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,040
and they they literally just had
 

2155
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,589
and they they literally just had
a very fast screening to say what are

2156
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:05,599
a very fast screening to say what are
 

2157
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,390
a very fast screening to say what are
the best tests they went through a huge

2158
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:08,400
the best tests they went through a huge
 

2159
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,750
the best tests they went through a huge
number of different tests they said okay

2160
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:09,760
number of different tests they said okay
 

2161
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,510
number of different tests they said okay
these are the this is the rank order of

2162
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:11,520
these are the this is the rank order of
 

2163
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,349
these are the this is the rank order of
which tests are good which are bad which

2164
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:13,359
which tests are good which are bad which
 

2165
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,910
which tests are good which are bad which
are scalable which are not

2166
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:15,920
are scalable which are not
 

2167
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,910
are scalable which are not
and they were able to start deploying

2168
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:17,920
and they were able to start deploying
 

2169
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,710
and they were able to start deploying
them in weeks not years so i think the

2170
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:20,720
them in weeks not years so i think the
 

2171
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,790
them in weeks not years so i think the
cdc really needs to take charge the

2172
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:22,800
cdc really needs to take charge the
 

2173
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,150
cdc really needs to take charge the
problem is when it comes to like law

2174
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:26,160
problem is when it comes to like law
 

2175
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,630
problem is when it comes to like law
if everyone currently perceives this as

2176
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:28,640
if everyone currently perceives this as
 

2177
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,430
if everyone currently perceives this as
like

2178
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:29,440
like
 

2179
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,270
like
fully within the domain of the fda and

2180
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:31,280
fully within the domain of the fda and
 

2181
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,430
fully within the domain of the fda and
they've never heard of such an uh public

2182
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:33,440
they've never heard of such an uh public
 

2183
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,390
they've never heard of such an uh public
health

2184
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:34,400
health
 

2185
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,670
health
test idea enable it but but the fda

2186
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:37,680
test idea enable it but but the fda
 

2187
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,470
test idea enable it but but the fda
itself has created the idea by saying we

2188
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:40,480
itself has created the idea by saying we
 

2189
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,870
itself has created the idea by saying we
don't regulate public health tools

2190
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:42,880
don't regulate public health tools
 

2191
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,630
don't regulate public health tools
so the word is out there the fda has

2192
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:44,640
so the word is out there the fda has
 

2193
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,349
so the word is out there the fda has
said we don't regulate them so that

2194
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:47,359
said we don't regulate them so that
 

2195
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,510
said we don't regulate them so that
gives the president an opportunity to

2196
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:49,520
gives the president an opportunity to
 

2197
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,790
gives the president an opportunity to
say okay

2198
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,800
say okay
 

2199
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,470
say okay
these are those you know these are

2200
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:52,480
these are those you know these are
 

2201
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,510
these are those you know these are
public health tools by definition

2202
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:55,520
public health tools by definition
 

2203
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,430
public health tools by definition
and and i do think that this is a kind

2204
00:37:57,430 --> 00:37:57,440
and and i do think that this is a kind
 

2205
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,349
and and i do think that this is a kind
of a crisis and it's a crisis of testing

2206
00:37:59,349 --> 00:37:59,359
of a crisis and it's a crisis of testing
 

2207
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,750
of a crisis and it's a crisis of testing
but it's also a crisis of like

2208
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:01,760
but it's also a crisis of like
 

2209
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,710
but it's also a crisis of like
really we're going to go through this

2210
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:02,720
really we're going to go through this
 

2211
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,310
really we're going to go through this
whole pandemic and never figure this

2212
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:04,320
whole pandemic and never figure this
 

2213
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,510
whole pandemic and never figure this
thing out

2214
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:05,520
thing out
 

2215
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,069
thing out
that's just really sad you know if we

2216
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:08,079
that's just really sad you know if we
 

2217
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,829
that's just really sad you know if we
get through this and don't figure out

2218
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:09,839
get through this and don't figure out
 

2219
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,390
get through this and don't figure out
how to evaluate a damn rapid test

2220
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:12,400
how to evaluate a damn rapid test
 

2221
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,190
how to evaluate a damn rapid test
so

2222
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:13,200
so
 

2223
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,190
so
how do vaccines

2224
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:15,200
how do vaccines
 

2225
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,550
how do vaccines
play with this so one of the things that

2226
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:18,560
play with this so one of the things that
 

2227
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,589
play with this so one of the things that
when people discuss solutions to covid

2228
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:21,599
when people discuss solutions to covid
 

2229
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,829
when people discuss solutions to covid
there's a sense that

2230
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:23,839
there's a sense that
 

2231
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,390
there's a sense that
once you have a vaccine kova dissolved

2232
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:26,400
once you have a vaccine kova dissolved
 

2233
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,710
once you have a vaccine kova dissolved
so how does that interplay

2234
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:28,720
so how does that interplay
 

2235
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,550
so how does that interplay
like why do we still need tests if we

2236
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:30,560
like why do we still need tests if we
 

2237
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,430
like why do we still need tests if we
have vaccines yeah i am i actually wrote

2238
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:33,440
have vaccines yeah i am i actually wrote
 

2239
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,190
have vaccines yeah i am i actually wrote
an op-ed in

2240
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:35,200
an op-ed in
 

2241
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,270
an op-ed in
new york times or wall street journal or

2242
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:37,280
new york times or wall street journal or
 

2243
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,349
new york times or wall street journal or
something that was titled why we still

2244
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:39,359
something that was titled why we still
 

2245
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,470
something that was titled why we still
need rapid tests with with vaccines

2246
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:42,480
need rapid tests with with vaccines
 

2247
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,910
need rapid tests with with vaccines
and

2248
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:43,920
and
 

2249
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,230
and
the real reason is because we have

2250
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:46,240
the real reason is because we have
 

2251
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,790
the real reason is because we have
evaluated our vaccines based on their

2252
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:48,800
evaluated our vaccines based on their
 

2253
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,870
evaluated our vaccines based on their
ability to stop disease

2254
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
ability to stop disease

in fact most of the trials didn't
 

2257
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,790
in fact most of the trials didn't

stop transmission
 

2261
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,109
stop transmission
they didn't even evaluate that at all no

they didn't even evaluate that at all no
 

2263

and
 

2269
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,230
and
with a virus like this it would be a bit

2270
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:06,240
with a virus like this it would be a bit
 

2271
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,550
with a virus like this it would be a bit
naive to think that it's really going to

naive to think that it's really going to
 

2273
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,310
naive to think that it's really going to
stop transmission well

2274
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:12,320

 

2275
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,230

i think a lot of excitement happened

2276
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,240
i think a lot of excitement happened
 

2277
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,310
i think a lot of excitement happened
right after the first clinical trials

2278
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:16,320
right after the first clinical trials
 

2279
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,990
right after the first clinical trials
and i'm sure we were talking about it

2280
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,000
and i'm sure we were talking about it
 

2281
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,270
and i'm sure we were talking about it
when when i was last here i would

2282
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:19,280
when when i was last here i would
 

2283
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,030
when when i was last here i would
imagine given the timing

2284
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,040
imagine given the timing
 

2285
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,630
imagine given the timing
but those first clinical trials came out

2286
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:22,640
but those first clinical trials came out
 

2287
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,910
but those first clinical trials came out
and everyone

2288
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:23,920
and everyone
 

2289
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,270
and everyone
you know jumped for joy that these

2290
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:25,280
you know jumped for joy that these
 

2291
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,190
you know jumped for joy that these
things were going to be the the end to

things were going to be the the end to

this pandemic
 

2295
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,470
this pandemic
but we had really short-sighted vision

00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:30,480
but we had really short-sighted vision
 

2297
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,910

features one is
 

2301
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,150
features one is
uh that they might not stop transmission

2302
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:38,160
uh that they might not stop transmission
 

2303
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,870
uh that they might not stop transmission
another i guess three another is that uh

new variants might come around that will
 

2307
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,910
new variants might come around that will

we were measuring the efficacy of these
 

2315
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,109
we were measuring the efficacy of these

term so what happened
 

2327
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,829
term so what happened
with the vaccines is that

2328
00:40:03,829 --> 00:40:03,839
with the vaccines is that
 

2329
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,670
with the vaccines is that
everyone got very comfortable this

2330
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:05,680
everyone got very comfortable this
 

2331
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,750
everyone got very comfortable this
including the cdc saying

00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:07,760
including the cdc saying
 

2333
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,589
including the cdc saying
if you've been vaccinated you know this

2334
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
if you've been vaccinated you know this
 

2335
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,910
if you've been vaccinated you know this
is the end of the pandemic for you

2336
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:11,920
is the end of the pandemic for you
 

2337
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,750
is the end of the pandemic for you
and let's keep it up

2338
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:13,760
and let's keep it up
 

2339
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,069
and let's keep it up
but then delta comes along and waning

2340
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079
but then delta comes along and waning
 

2341
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:17,589
but then delta comes along and waning
immunity comes along and both of these

2342
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:17,599
immunity comes along and both of these
 

2343
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,790
immunity comes along and both of these
things compound exactly as anticipated

things compound exactly as anticipated
to get breakthrough cases

2346
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:22,839
to get breakthrough cases
 

2347
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,829
to get breakthrough cases
and unfortunately what we're seeing now

2348
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:25,839
and unfortunately what we're seeing now
 

2349
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,150
and unfortunately what we're seeing now
is the cdc and the administration went

2350
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:28,160
is the cdc and the administration went
 

2351
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,710
is the cdc and the administration went
so all in on saying that

2352
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:30,720
so all in on saying that
 

2353
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,870
so all in on saying that
breakthrough cases are rare that

2354
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:32,880
breakthrough cases are rare that
 

2355
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,230
breakthrough cases are rare that
transmission doesn't really happen if

2356
00:40:34,230 --> 00:40:34,240
transmission doesn't really happen if
 

2357
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,550
transmission doesn't really happen if
you're vaccinated without great data

2358
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:36,560
you're vaccinated without great data
 

2359
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,190
you're vaccinated without great data
especially with delta that once people

00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:39,200
especially with delta that once people
 

2361
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,670
especially with delta that once people
started seeing breakthrough cases

2362
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:41,680
started seeing breakthrough cases
 

2363
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,069
started seeing breakthrough cases
they start interpreting that as a

they start interpreting that as a
 

2365
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,910
they start interpreting that as a
failure of the vaccine the vaccines are

they're not working to stop transmission

they're not working to stop transmission
and if our goal is to stop transmission

we have different goals
 

2383
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,150
we have different goals
like we're okay with people getting ill

like we're okay with people getting ill
 

2385
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,309
like we're okay with people getting ill
and letting transmission go because we

2386
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:06,319
and letting transmission go because we
 

2387
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:08,150
and letting transmission go because we
don't want to worry about it anymore

don't want to worry about it anymore

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,150
don't want to worry about it anymore
we're not there yet so until we decide

we're not there yet so until we decide

we're not there yet so until we decide
we're not going to stop transmission we

we're not going to stop transmission we
 

2393
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,150
we're not going to stop transmission we
need other avenues besides the vaccine

2394
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:14,160
need other avenues besides the vaccine
 

2395
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,510
need other avenues besides the vaccine
because it's

2396
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:15,520
because it's
 

2397
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,030
because it's
it's not doing it it also means that

2398
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:17,040
it's not doing it it also means that
 

2399
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,589
it's not doing it it also means that
herd immunity isn't going to happen and

2400
00:41:19,589 --> 00:41:19,599
herd immunity isn't going to happen and
 

2401
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,270
herd immunity isn't going to happen and
unfortunately as long as we keep letting

2402
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:21,280
unfortunately as long as we keep letting
 

2403
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,349
unfortunately as long as we keep letting

we're kind of giving this virus a boot

we're kind of giving this virus a boot

we're kind of giving this virus a boot
camp of exactly what it needs to

vaccine-derived antibodies that makes me
 

2415
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,470

very nervous so the more we can do to

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,150
very nervous so the more we can do to
stop spread

2418
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,160
stop spread
 

2419
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,069
stop spread
in the unvaccinated in the elderly

2420
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:40,079
in the unvaccinated in the elderly
 

2421
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,190
in the unvaccinated in the elderly
vaccinated and in other people

2422
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:43,200
vaccinated and in other people
 

2423
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,829
vaccinated and in other people
the better we we just should be focusing

2424
00:41:45,829 --> 00:41:45,839
the better we we just should be focusing
 

2425
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,910
the better we we just should be focusing
on that so in your eyes the solution

2426
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:47,920
on that so in your eyes the solution
 

2427
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,349
on that so in your eyes the solution
would look like this

2428
00:41:49,349 --> 00:41:49,359
would look like this
 

2429
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,190
would look like this
you would have make enough tests where

2430
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:51,200
you would have make enough tests where
 

2431
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,870
you would have make enough tests where
every single person would get tested

2432
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:52,880
every single person would get tested
 

2433
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,550
every single person would get tested
every single day

2434
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:54,560
every single day
 

2435
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,630
every single day
i think that that would be

2436
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:56,640
i think that that would be
 

2437
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,230
i think that that would be
i don't want to do that actually i want

2438
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:58,240
i don't want to do that actually i want
 

2439
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,030
i don't want to do that actually i want
to do a variation on that i think what

2440
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,040
to do a variation on that i think what
 

2441
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,950
to do a variation on that i think what
we should do is have a dynamical testing

2442
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:02,960
we should do is have a dynamical testing
 

2443
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,990
we should do is have a dynamical testing
program

2444
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:04,000
program
 

2445
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,870
program
it doesn't have to be

2446
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:06,880
it doesn't have to be
 

2447
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,309
it doesn't have to be
complicated

2448
00:42:08,309 --> 00:42:08,319
complicated
 

2449
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,470
complicated
it's every household has a box of tests

2450
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,480
it's every household has a box of tests
 

2451
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,150
it's every household has a box of tests
in their cupboard

2452
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:12,160
in their cupboard
 

2453
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,550
in their cupboard
and if you haven't seen any cases in

2454
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:14,560
and if you haven't seen any cases in
 

2455
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,309
and if you haven't seen any cases in
your community for a long time stop

2456
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:16,319
your community for a long time stop
 

2457
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,710
your community for a long time stop
testing do waste water

2458
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:18,720
testing do waste water
 

2459
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,550
testing do waste water
testing to see if there's any rna coming

2460
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:20,560
testing to see if there's any rna coming
 

2461
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,069
testing to see if there's any rna coming
back

2462
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:22,079
back
 

2463
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,829
back
if you start to see rna in the waste

2464
00:42:23,829 --> 00:42:23,839
if you start to see rna in the waste
 

2465
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,430
if you start to see rna in the waste
water that represents the virus and

2466
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:25,440
water that represents the virus and
 

2467
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,430
water that represents the virus and
you're still wanting to stop outbreaks

2468
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:27,440
you're still wanting to stop outbreaks
 

2469
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,030
you're still wanting to stop outbreaks
you say hey

2470
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:29,040
you say hey
 

2471
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,150
you say hey
you know those tests that are in your

2472
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:30,160
you know those tests that are in your
 

2473
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,630
you know those tests that are in your
cupboards households in this county

2474
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:32,640
cupboards households in this county
 

2475
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,309
cupboards households in this county
why don't what is in each household or

2476
00:42:34,309 --> 00:42:34,319
why don't what is in each household or
 

2477
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:35,990
why don't what is in each household or
each person each household use one test

2478
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,000
each person each household use one test
 

2479
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,510
each person each household use one test
per week

2480
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:37,520
per week
 

2481
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:40,550
per week
and can you uh sorry to just pause

2482
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:40,560
and can you uh sorry to just pause
 

2483
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,630
and can you uh sorry to just pause
on that idea that's

2484
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:42,640
on that idea that's
 

2485
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,630
on that idea that's
really cool the the waste water testing

2486
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:44,640
really cool the the waste water testing
 

2487
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,470
really cool the the waste water testing
that's the thing so you can you can get

2488
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:46,480
that's the thing so you can you can get
 

2489
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,349
that's the thing so you can you can get
a sense of how prevalent the virus is in

2490
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:49,359
a sense of how prevalent the virus is in
 

2491
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,109
a sense of how prevalent the virus is in
a particular community by testing the

2492
00:42:51,109 --> 00:42:51,119
a particular community by testing the
 

2493
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:53,510
a particular community by testing the
wastewater that's exactly right and so

2494
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:53,520
wastewater that's exactly right and so
 

2495
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,710
wastewater that's exactly right and so
the viral load associated uh the viral

2496
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:56,720
the viral load associated uh the viral
 

2497
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,510
the viral load associated uh the viral
load that you can find in the community

2498
00:42:59,510 --> 00:42:59,520
load that you can find in the community
 

2499
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,150
load that you can find in the community
represents the prevalence of the virus

2500
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:02,160
represents the prevalence of the virus
 

2501
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,990
represents the prevalence of the virus
in the community which is really quite

2502
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:04,000
in the community which is really quite
 

2503
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,910
in the community which is really quite
nice that's not that's a nice way to

2504
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:05,920
nice that's not that's a nice way to
 

2505
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,990
nice that's not that's a nice way to
paint like a map of the

2506
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:08,000
paint like a map of the
 

2507
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,870
paint like a map of the
the intensity uh of the virus okay so

2508
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:10,880
the intensity uh of the virus okay so
 

2509
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,470
the intensity uh of the virus okay so
when it

2510
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:12,480
when it
 

2511
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,870
when it
when it goes above a certain level

2512
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:14,880
when it goes above a certain level
 

2513
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,150
when it goes above a certain level
you can start

2514
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:16,160
you can start
 

2515
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,109
you can start
doing

2516
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:17,119
doing
 

2517
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,349
doing
much higher frequency testing per house

2518
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:19,359
much higher frequency testing per house
 

2519
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:21,670
much higher frequency testing per house
in each household that's right so i

2520
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:21,680
in each household that's right so i
 

2521
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,870
in each household that's right so i
don't want people to be in testing

2522
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:22,880
don't want people to be in testing
 

2523
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,109
don't want people to be in testing
purgatory like that's not what i want i

2524
00:43:25,109 --> 00:43:25,119
purgatory like that's not what i want i
 

2525
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,470
purgatory like that's not what i want i
just want us to get through this damn

2526
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:26,480
just want us to get through this damn
 

2527
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,910
just want us to get through this damn
pandemic and

2528
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:27,920
pandemic and
 

2529
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,270
pandemic and
and so we can monitor the waste water or

2530
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:31,280
and so we can monitor the waste water or
 

2531
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:33,190
and so we can monitor the waste water or
any other methods we can monitor the

2532
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:33,200
any other methods we can monitor the
 

2533
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,510
any other methods we can monitor the
hospitals in the clinics and if somebody

2534
00:43:35,510 --> 00:43:35,520
hospitals in the clinics and if somebody
 

2535
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,109
hospitals in the clinics and if somebody
does come in with coveted like symptoms

2536
00:43:37,109 --> 00:43:37,119
does come in with coveted like symptoms
 

2537
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:38,470
does come in with coveted like symptoms
and then a few other people come in you

2538
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:38,480
and then a few other people come in you
 

2539
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,390
and then a few other people come in you
realize okay we got spread happening in

2540
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:40,400
realize okay we got spread happening in
 

2541
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:41,910
realize okay we got spread happening in
our community

2542
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:41,920

2543
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,750

need to do
 

2549
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,510
need to do
tell people tell families use your test

2550
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:49,520
tell people tell families use your test
 

2551
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,750
tell people tell families use your test
and if the cases get worse

2552
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:51,760
and if the cases get worse
 

2553
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,190
and if the cases get worse
because you're just doing it once a week

2554
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,200
because you're just doing it once a week
 

2555
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,630
because you're just doing it once a week
that's not going to stop transmission

2556
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:54,640
that's not going to stop transmission
 

2557
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,670
that's not going to stop transmission
but it's going to enable you to identify

2558
00:43:57,670 --> 00:43:57,680
but it's going to enable you to identify
 

2559
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:59,670
but it's going to enable you to identify
where outbreaks are happening

2560
00:43:59,670 --> 00:43:59,680
where outbreaks are happening
 

2561
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:01,270
where outbreaks are happening
if you start to find outbreaks in

2562
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:01,280
if you start to find outbreaks in
 

2563
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,390
if you start to find outbreaks in
pockets

2564
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:02,400
pockets
 

2565
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,150
pockets
then the rule is simply okay let's

2566
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:04,160
then the rule is simply okay let's
 

2567
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,990
then the rule is simply okay let's
squash the outbreak real fast so

2568
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:06,000
squash the outbreak real fast so
 

2569
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,990
squash the outbreak real fast so
everyone in that area uncertain zip code

2570
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:08,000
everyone in that area uncertain zip code
 

2571
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,510
everyone in that area uncertain zip code
or whatever it might be

or whatever it might be
 

2573
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,349
or whatever it might be
test every two days

2574
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:11,359
test every two days
 

2575
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,109
test every two days
you know for seven days or every day for

2576
00:44:13,109 --> 00:44:13,119
you know for seven days or every day for

seven days
 

2579
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,030
seven days
and you'll get rid of the outbreak

2580
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:17,040
and you'll get rid of the outbreak
 

2581
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,670
and you'll get rid of the outbreak
we can do that and if you've now gone

2582
00:44:19,670 --> 00:44:19,680
we can do that and if you've now gone
 

2583
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,750
we can do that and if you've now gone
again you know a week or two with no

00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:21,760
again you know a week or two with no
 

2585

again you know a week or two with no
cases

cases
 

2587
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,750
cases
uh identified stop the testing again

2588
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:25,760
uh identified stop the testing again
 

2589
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,510

people go and infect 95 people
 

2655
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,030
people go and infect 95 people
but that's for a virus like this that's

but that's for a virus like this that's
 

2657

but that's for a virus like this that's
a massive public health win if you can

a massive public health win if you can

00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,550
a massive public health win if you can
get 100 people to infect 90 most people

doctors i would say like a lot of people

2662
00:45:42,150 --> 00:45:42,160
doctors i would say like a lot of people
 

2663
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,069
doctors i would say like a lot of people
would say that sounds like a failure to

would say that sounds like a failure to

be honest
 

2667
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,349
be honest
but if you do that for multiple days in

2668
00:45:47,349 --> 00:45:47,359
but if you do that for multiple days in
 

2669
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:48,470
but if you do that for multiple days in
a row

2670
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:48,480
a row
 

2671
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,150
a row
then in a couple of weeks you've gone

2672
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,160
then in a couple of weeks you've gone
 

2673
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,990
then in a couple of weeks you've gone
from a big outbreak to a very very small

2674
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:52,000
from a big outbreak to a very very small

outbreak
and on the other hand if you don't do

2678
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:54,720
and on the other hand if you don't do
 

2679
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,710
and on the other hand if you don't do
that if you allow 100 people to just

2680
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:56,720
that if you allow 100 people to just
 

2681
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,190
that if you allow 100 people to just
infect 140 people

2682
00:45:59,190 --> 00:45:59,200
infect 140 people
 

2683
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,190
infect 140 people
because you're not doing the testing

2684
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:01,200
because you're not doing the testing
 

2685
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:03,510
because you're not doing the testing
then instead of having 20 people at the

2686
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:03,520
then instead of having 20 people at the
 

2687
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:05,589
then instead of having 20 people at the
end of those four weeks with the testing

2688
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:05,599
end of those four weeks with the testing
 

2689
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,150
end of those four weeks with the testing
you literally would have 600

2690
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:08,160
you literally would have 600
 

2691
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:09,990
you literally would have 600
massive differences here

2692
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,000
massive differences here
 

2693
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,950
massive differences here
and all

2694
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:10,960
and all
 

2695
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,630
and all
the only goal then is to get our below

2696
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
the only goal then is to get our below
 

2697
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:14,550
the only goal then is to get our below
one have 100 people in fact less than

00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:14,560
one have 100 people in fact less than
 

2699
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,630
one have 100 people in fact less than
100 and you stop the outbreaks and

2700
00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:16,640
100 and you stop the outbreaks and
 

2701
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,230
100 and you stop the outbreaks and
everyone stays safe

2702

everyone stays safe
 

2703
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:19,910
everyone stays safe
from everything you've seen how cheap

2704
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:19,920
from everything you've seen how cheap
 

2705
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,829
from everything you've seen how cheap
can these things get from like in the

00:46:21,829 --> 00:46:21,839
can these things get from like in the
 

2707
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:23,430
can these things get from like in the
past year

2708
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:23,440
past year
 

2709
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,790
past year
in in terms of the developments you've

2710
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:24,800
in in terms of the developments you've
 

2711
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,109
in in terms of the developments you've
seen with the various test manufacturers

2712
00:46:27,109 --> 00:46:27,119
seen with the various test manufacturers
 

2713
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,390
seen with the various test manufacturers
how cheap can it be to make a test to

2714
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:30,400
how cheap can it be to make a test to
 

2715
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,309
how cheap can it be to make a test to
manufacture a test so there's the

2716
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:32,319
manufacture a test so there's the
 

2717
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,390
manufacture a test so there's the
manufacturing process that could be 50

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:34,400
manufacturing process that could be 50
 

2719
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,470
manufacturing process that could be 50
cents maybe less

now saying vaccinate our test which is

2788
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:44,400
now saying vaccinate our test which is
 

2789
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,069
now saying vaccinate our test which is
going to lead to a crisis if we don't

2790
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:46,079
going to lead to a crisis if we don't
 

2791
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,349
going to lead to a crisis if we don't
fix this soon because we're going to

2792
00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:47,359
fix this soon because we're going to
 

2793
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:49,430
fix this soon because we're going to
massive demand for testing in the next

2794
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:49,440
massive demand for testing in the next
 

2795
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,190
massive demand for testing in the next
couple weeks

2796
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:51,200
couple weeks
 

2797
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,430
couple weeks
but when he says that that's essentially

2798
00:47:53,430 --> 00:47:53,440
but when he says that that's essentially
 

2799
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:55,270
but when he says that that's essentially
saying okay companies need to make sure

2800
00:47:55,270 --> 00:47:55,280
saying okay companies need to make sure
 

2801
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:57,349
saying okay companies need to make sure
that their people are testing so are you

2802
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:57,359
that their people are testing so are you
 

2803
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:59,829
that their people are testing so are you
gonna base it on the honor system

2804
00:47:59,829 --> 00:47:59,839
gonna base it on the honor system
 

2805
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,030
gonna base it on the honor system
i would say you probably would not base

2806
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:03,040
i would say you probably would not base
 

2807
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,790
i would say you probably would not base
testing on the honor system if it's like

2808
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:04,800
testing on the honor system if it's like
 

2809
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,750
testing on the honor system if it's like
to uh take somebody who would otherwise

2810
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:07,760
to uh take somebody who would otherwise
 

2811
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,230
to uh take somebody who would otherwise
be quarantined from in school and so you

2812
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:10,240
be quarantined from in school and so you
 

2813
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,990
be quarantined from in school and so you
can go to school as long as your test is

2814
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,000
can go to school as long as your test is
 

2815
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,910
can go to school as long as your test is
negative so test to stay program is a

2816
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:13,920
negative so test to stay program is a
 

2817
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,349
negative so test to stay program is a
big thing that i've been pushing for and

00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:15,359
big thing that i've been pushing for and
 

2819
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,109
big thing that i've been pushing for and
others have

need to test
 

2825
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,750
need to test
they need to have verification

2826
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:23,760
they need to have verification
 

2827
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,950
they need to have verification
but they don't want to like set up

2828
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:24,960
but they don't want to like set up
 

2829
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:27,109
but they don't want to like set up
nursing stations in their lobbies or in

00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:30,640
everyone's tired of that we need to
 

2835
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,910
everyone's tired of that we need to
bring the test into the home but that

2836
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:31,920
bring the test into the home but that
 

2837
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,710
bring the test into the home but that
means we need the technology to enable

2838
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:34,720
means we need the technology to enable
 

2839
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:35,670
means we need the technology to enable
it

2840

2861
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,309

and every morning we all had to test in

2862
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:58,319
and every morning we all had to test in
 

2863
00:48:58,319 --> 00:48:59,430
and every morning we all had to test in
the morning which i thought was a great

that can be
 

2919
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,390
that can be
considered proof that you yourself use

2920
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:54,400
considered proof that you yourself use
 

2921
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,710
considered proof that you yourself use
the test and you yourself got a negative

2922

the test and you yourself got a negative
 

2923
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,790
the test and you yourself got a negative
so the tools are out here

so the tools are out here
 

2925
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,549
so the tools are out here
if we want to use them at scale and in

these tests get that the results get
delivered to public health agencies but

3000

delivered to public health agencies but
 

3001
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,549
delivered to public health agencies but
i've long held that

i've long held that
 

3003

i think it's going to be hard to

3020
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:38,000
i think it's going to be hard to
 

3021
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,390
i think it's going to be hard to
maintain complete privacy

there is a tension between these two
 

3055
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,510
there is a tension between these two
things for sure and how do you balance

3056
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:17,520
things for sure and how do you balance
 

3057
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,270
things for sure and how do you balance
that during a public health

3058
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:19,280
that during a public health
 

3059
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,190
that during a public health
emergency

3060
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:21,200
emergency
 

3061
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,430
emergency
i think first and foremost let people

3062
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:23,440
i think first and foremost let people
 

3063
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,030
i think first and foremost let people
everyone has a right to know their

3064
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:25,040
everyone has a right to know their
 

3065
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,470
everyone has a right to know their
status

3066
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:26,480
status
 

3067
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:28,470
status
the fact that we have made it hard for

3068
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:28,480
the fact that we have made it hard for
 

3069
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,230
the fact that we have made it hard for
people to know their status on their

3070
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:30,240
people to know their status on their
 

3071
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,030
people to know their status on their
terms i think is a travesty i mean it's

3072
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:33,040
terms i think is a travesty i mean it's
 

3073
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,390
terms i think is a travesty i mean it's
just so

3074
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:34,400
just so
 

3075
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,190
just so
terrible that we have

3076
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:37,200
terrible that we have
 

3077
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,510
terrible that we have
prioritized

3078
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:39,520
prioritized
 

3079
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:41,510
prioritized
us knowing at the expense of you know

3080
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:41,520
us knowing at the expense of you know
 

3081
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:43,190
us knowing at the expense of you know
essentially what like elta's long said

3082
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:43,200
essentially what like elta's long said
 

3083
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:44,950
essentially what like elta's long said
during this pandemic is

3084
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:44,960
during this pandemic is
 

3085
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,349
during this pandemic is
if i'm public health it's if i can't

3086
00:52:47,349 --> 00:52:47,359
if i'm public health it's if i can't
 

3087
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,589
if i'm public health it's if i can't
know then you can't know your status

3088
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:49,599
know then you can't know your status
 

3089
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,190
know then you can't know your status
like that's not the right way to look at

3090
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,200
like that's not the right way to look at
 

3091
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:53,510
like that's not the right way to look at
public health we need to engage the

3092
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:53,520
public health we need to engage the
 

3093
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,270
public health we need to engage the
public and if some of them don't want to

3094
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:55,280
public and if some of them don't want to
 

3095

public and if some of them don't want to
participate in the public health part

participate in the public health part
 

3097
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:58,309
participate in the public health part
but want to know

3098
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:58,319
but want to know
 

3099
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,750
but want to know
their status

3100
00:52:59,750 --> 00:52:59,760
their status
 

3101
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,589
their status
by default they are participating in

00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:01,599
by default they are participating in
 

3103
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:02,950
by default they are participating in
public health whether they know it or

their mom sick by mistake
 

3109
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,910
their mom sick by mistake
at least most people wouldn't and then

3110
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:07,920
at least most people wouldn't and then
 

3111
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,430
at least most people wouldn't and then
also you can create systems where

3112
00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:11,440
also you can create systems where
 

3113
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,710
also you can create systems where
you can

3114
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:12,720
you can

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,230
you can
individuals can form relationships based

3116
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:16,240
individuals can form relationships based
 

3117
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,990
individuals can form relationships based
on their status

without ever reporting it to a
centralized place so

3122
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:22,000
centralized place so
 

3123
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,150
centralized place so
you can go to i don't know

3124
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:24,160
you can go to i don't know
 

3125
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,710
you can go to i don't know
a local business owner might

3126
00:53:26,710 --> 00:53:26,720
a local business owner might
 

3127
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,630
a local business owner might
require that you show

3128
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:28,640
require that you show
 

3129
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,150
require that you show
that you're negative

3130
00:53:30,150 --> 00:53:30,160
that you're negative
 

3131
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,390
that you're negative
but that doesn't require reporting it

3132
00:53:32,390 --> 00:53:32,400
but that doesn't require reporting it
 

3133
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,750
but that doesn't require reporting it
you can

3134
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:33,760
you can
 

3135
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,470
you can
like there might be um basically like an

3136
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:36,480
like there might be um basically like an
 

3137
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,670
like there might be um basically like an
id

3138
00:53:37,670 --> 00:53:37,680
id
 

3139
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,950
id
that's only in possession you are the

3140
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:40,960
that's only in possession you are the
 

3141
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,549
that's only in possession you are the
only person in possession of that so you

3142
00:53:42,549 --> 00:53:42,559
only person in possession of that so you
 

3143
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,710
only person in possession of that so you
literally show it exactly here's a test

3144
00:53:44,710 --> 00:53:44,720
literally show it exactly here's a test
 

3145
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,109
literally show it exactly here's a test
i took it's negative and nobody else

3146
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:47,119
i took it's negative and nobody else
 

3147
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:49,270
i took it's negative and nobody else
knows about that test so that could very

3148
00:53:49,270 --> 00:53:49,280
knows about that test so that could very
 

3149
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,510
knows about that test so that could very
well be done even through a company like

3150
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:51,520
well be done even through a company like
 

3151
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,030
well be done even through a company like
e-med i think

3152
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:53,040
e-med i think
 

3153
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,630
e-med i think
and i might be wrong here

3154
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:54,640
and i might be wrong here
 

3155
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,349
and i might be wrong here
uh i believe that they take the test

3156
00:53:57,349 --> 00:53:57,359
uh i believe that they take the test
 

3157
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,349
uh i believe that they take the test
result and because they are considered a

3158
00:53:59,349 --> 00:53:59,359
result and because they are considered a
 

3159
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,910
result and because they are considered a
clia waived laboratory like a digital

3160
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:01,920
clia waived laboratory like a digital
 

3161
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:03,349
clia waived laboratory like a digital
laboratory

3162
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:03,359
laboratory
 

3163
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:06,390
laboratory
they report their results by law out to

3164
00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:06,400
they report their results by law out to
 

3165
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,630
they report their results by law out to
uh the public health agencies

3166
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:08,640
uh the public health agencies
 

3167
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,589
uh the public health agencies
but let's say there was something a

3168
00:54:09,589 --> 00:54:09,599
but let's say there was something a
 

3169
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,790
but let's say there was something a
little different let's say you were

3170
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:10,800
little different let's say you were
 

3171
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,109
little different let's say you were
verifying an over-the-counter test

3172
00:54:13,109 --> 00:54:13,119
verifying an over-the-counter test
 

3173
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,470
verifying an over-the-counter test
and it doesn't have to be a cleo wave

3174
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:14,480
and it doesn't have to be a cleo wave
 

3175
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,670
and it doesn't have to be a cleo wave
because it's over the counter then

3176
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:15,680
because it's over the counter then
 

3177
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,069
because it's over the counter then
you're not bound by clio rules

3178
00:54:18,069 --> 00:54:18,079
you're not bound by clio rules
 

3179
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:18,950
you're not bound by clio rules
and

3180
00:54:18,950 --> 00:54:18,960
and
 

3181
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,950
and
you could create the same service but

3182
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:20,960
you could create the same service but
 

3183
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:22,630
you could create the same service but
that just doesn't report out to the

3184
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:22,640
that just doesn't report out to the
 

3185
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:24,390
that just doesn't report out to the
public health agencies it gives people

3186
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:24,400
public health agencies it gives people
 

3187
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,589
public health agencies it gives people
the option

3188
00:54:25,589 --> 00:54:25,599
the option
 

3189
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,430
the option
to opt in or out of public health

3190
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
to opt in or out of public health
 

3191
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,030
to opt in or out of public health
reporting and

yes of course i would prefer that the
data be available to evaluate to know

00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:42,000
data be available to evaluate to know
 

3207
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,510
data be available to evaluate to know
where the cases are

3208
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:43,520
where the cases are
 

3209
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,190
where the cases are
but first and foremost i want to make

3210
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:45,200

3211
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,230
but first and foremost i want to make
sure that the people using the test

3212
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:48,240
sure that the people using the test
 

3213
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,230
sure that the people using the test
are are going to use the test and if

3214
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:50,240
are are going to use the test and if
 

3215
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,710
are are going to use the test and if
that means that they're not reporting

3216
00:54:52,710 --> 00:54:52,720
that means that they're not reporting
 

3217
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:53,990
that means that they're not reporting
and if that's the only way that they

3218
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:54,000
and if that's the only way that they
 

3219
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,829
and if that's the only way that they
will use it is if it's not reported then

3220
00:54:55,829 --> 00:54:55,839
will use it is if it's not reported then
 

3221
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,990
will use it is if it's not reported then
that's better than no test

3222
00:54:57,990 --> 00:54:58,000
that's better than no test
 

3223
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,470
that's better than no test
and especially given that the

3224
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:00,480
and especially given that the
 

3225
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,510
and especially given that the
central to the vaccine hesitancy is a

3226
00:55:03,510 --> 00:55:03,520
central to the vaccine hesitancy is a
 

3227
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,990
central to the vaccine hesitancy is a
distrust of authority in the distrust of

3228
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:06,000
distrust of authority in the distrust of
 

3229
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,829
distrust of authority in the distrust of
government so

3230
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:07,839
government so
 

3231
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:09,670
government so
you're asking

3232
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:09,680
you're asking
 

3233
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:12,630
you're asking
you're asking people to get tested

3234
00:55:12,630 --> 00:55:12,640
you're asking people to get tested
 

3235
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,870
you're asking people to get tested
and report their

3236
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:14,880
and report their
 

3237
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,109
and report their
status

3238
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:17,119
status
 

3239
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:18,789
status
to a centralized authority when they're

3240
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:18,799
to a centralized authority when they're
 

3241
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:19,910
to a centralized authority when they're
clearly

3242
00:55:19,910 --> 00:55:19,920
clearly
 

3243
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,829
clearly
do not trust that authority it doesn't

3244
00:55:21,829 --> 00:55:21,839
do not trust that authority it doesn't
 

3245
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,829
do not trust that authority it doesn't
make any sense it seems like a perfect

3246
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:23,839
make any sense it seems like a perfect
 

3247
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:25,190
make any sense it seems like a perfect
solution

3248
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:25,200
solution
 

3249
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,589
solution
to let people who are hesitant on the

3250
00:55:27,589 --> 00:55:27,599
to let people who are hesitant on the
 

3251
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:29,829
to let people who are hesitant on the
vaccine to uh

3252
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:29,839
vaccine to uh
 

3253

really do i think we can have the

3266
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
really do i think we can have the
 

3267
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,750
really do i think we can have the
verified services

3268
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:45,760
verified services
 

3269
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,430
verified services
and we could have the privacy if you

3270
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:47,440
and we could have the privacy if you
 

3271
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,870
and we could have the privacy if you
want if you want if you need to go into

3272
00:55:48,870 --> 00:55:48,880
want if you want if you need to go into
 

3273
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,950
want if you want if you need to go into
a restaurant and there's a rule that you

3274
00:55:50,950 --> 00:55:50,960
a restaurant and there's a rule that you
 

3275
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,870
a restaurant and there's a rule that you
have to be a negative test

3276
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:52,880
have to be a negative test
 

3277
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,230
have to be a negative test
have it on your phone and only your

3278
00:55:54,230 --> 00:55:54,240
have it on your phone and only your
 

3279
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,549
have it on your phone and only your
phone and it's okay like emed emails you

3280
00:55:56,549 --> 00:55:56,559
phone and it's okay like emed emails you
 

3281
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,870
phone and it's okay like emed emails you
the the lab report you have it you can

3282
00:55:58,870 --> 00:55:58,880
the the lab report you have it you can
 

3283
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,549
the the lab report you have it you can
say look that's my name i use it this

3284
00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:00,559
say look that's my name i use it this
 

3285
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,630
say look that's my name i use it this
morning negative

3286
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:02,640
morning negative
 

3287
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,390
morning negative
and in that case you'd want something

3288
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:04,400
and in that case you'd want something
 

3289
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,630
and in that case you'd want something
that just is there and is not

3290
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:06,640
that just is there and is not
 

3291
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,150
that just is there and is not
going anywhere else and i think that

3292
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:08,160
going anywhere else and i think that
 

3293
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,549
going anywhere else and i think that
those services like i think they can

3294
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:10,559
those services like i think they can
 

3295
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:11,510
those services like i think they can
exist

3296
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:11,520
exist
 

3297
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,990
exist
and it's a struggle because for those

3298
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:14,000
and it's a struggle because for those
 

3299
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,589
and it's a struggle because for those
companies

3300
00:56:15,589 --> 00:56:15,599
companies
 

3301
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:17,109
companies
they don't want to fall out of favor

3302
00:56:17,109 --> 00:56:17,119
they don't want to fall out of favor
 

3303
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,750
they don't want to fall out of favor
with the cdc or with the fda

3304
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:19,760
with the cdc or with the fda
 

3305
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,910
with the cdc or with the fda
and so this is a big problem in our

3306
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:21,920
and so this is a big problem in our
 

3307
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:25,750
and so this is a big problem in our
marketplace in general by having

3308
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:25,760
marketplace in general by having
 

3309
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:28,069
marketplace in general by having
by having private companies

3310
00:56:28,069 --> 00:56:28,079
by having private companies
 

3311
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,589
by having private companies
who want to

3312
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:29,599
who want to
 

3313
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,150
who want to
be the be the public health agents of

3314
00:56:32,150 --> 00:56:32,160
be the be the public health agents of
 

3315
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,829
be the be the public health agents of
this pandemic

3316
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:33,839
this pandemic
 

3317
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:35,589
this pandemic
we lose a lot of control because the

3318
00:56:35,589 --> 00:56:35,599
we lose a lot of control because the
 

3319
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,109
we lose a lot of control because the
companies ultimately have to do what's

3320
00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:37,119
companies ultimately have to do what's
 

3321
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,430
companies ultimately have to do what's
going to make them money so they survive

3322
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:39,440
going to make them money so they survive
 

3323
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:40,950
going to make them money so they survive
and keep performing the service it's

3324
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:40,960
and keep performing the service it's
 

3325
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:44,150
and keep performing the service it's
really it's really just such a hard

3326
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:44,160
really it's really just such a hard
 

3327
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,150
really it's really just such a hard
problem and i this is why last time i

3328
00:56:46,150 --> 00:56:46,160
problem and i this is why last time i
 

3329
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:48,069
problem and i this is why last time i
was here i'm guessing

3330
00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:48,079
was here i'm guessing
 

3331
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,990
was here i'm guessing
i was probably really pushing for the

3332
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:50,000
i was probably really pushing for the
 

3333
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,270
i was probably really pushing for the
government

3334
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:51,280
government
 

3335
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,589
government
to be producing these tests

3336
00:56:53,589 --> 00:56:53,599
to be producing these tests
 

3337
00:56:53,599 --> 00:56:55,030
to be producing these tests
i think i would have still been pushing

3338
00:56:55,030 --> 00:56:55,040
i think i would have still been pushing
 

3339
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,390
i think i would have still been pushing
for that you know at this point i've

3340
00:56:56,390 --> 00:56:56,400
for that you know at this point i've
 

3341
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,829
for that you know at this point i've
decided okay the government's clearly

3342
00:56:57,829 --> 00:56:57,839
decided okay the government's clearly
 

3343
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,670
decided okay the government's clearly
not going to do that i've been thinking

3344
00:56:59,670 --> 00:56:59,680
not going to do that i've been thinking
 

3345
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,430
not going to do that i've been thinking
i really want elon musk to produce the

3346
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:01,440
i really want elon musk to produce the
 

3347
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,630
i really want elon musk to produce the
tests like

3348
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:02,640
tests like
 

3349
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,549
tests like
i i really

3350
00:57:04,549 --> 00:57:04,559
i i really
 

3351
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,589
i i really
am sort of serious that these tests are

3352
00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:07,599
am sort of serious that these tests are
 

3353
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,829
am sort of serious that these tests are
simple to make but we've been using like

3354
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:09,839
simple to make but we've been using like
 

3355
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,190
simple to make but we've been using like
machines to make them that have been

3356
00:57:11,190 --> 00:57:11,200
machines to make them that have been
 

3357
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,789
machines to make them that have been
around for a long time

3358
00:57:12,789 --> 00:57:12,799
around for a long time
 

3359
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:15,109
around for a long time
scale is an issue right now

3360
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:15,119
scale is an issue right now
 

3361
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,589
scale is an issue right now
kind of really it's the eua process and

3362
00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:17,599
kind of really it's the eua process and
 

3363
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,030
kind of really it's the eua process and
getting the companies to be allowed to

3364
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:19,040
getting the companies to be allowed to
 

3365
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,030
getting the companies to be allowed to
market in the us that's the issue but

3366
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:21,040
market in the us that's the issue but
 

3367
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:23,190
market in the us that's the issue but
let's just say scale is the issue and

3368
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:23,200
let's just say scale is the issue and
 

3369
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,950
let's just say scale is the issue and
one company wants to make 20 million

3370
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:24,960
one company wants to make 20 million
 

3371
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,109
one company wants to make 20 million
tests a day

3372
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:27,119
tests a day
 

3373
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,870
tests a day
these aren't that hard like we we should

3374
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:28,880
these aren't that hard like we we should
 

3375
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,549
these aren't that hard like we we should
be able to do that we just need a faster

3376
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:30,559
be able to do that we just need a faster
 

3377
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,549
be able to do that we just need a faster
machine a better machine yeah and a

3378
00:57:32,549 --> 00:57:32,559
machine a better machine yeah and a
 

3379
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,710
machine a better machine yeah and a
quicker one and a few folks like you

3380
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:34,720
quicker one and a few folks like you
 

3381
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,549
quicker one and a few folks like you
mentioned know how to solve that problem

3382
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:36,559
mentioned know how to solve that problem
 

3383
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:38,309
mentioned know how to solve that problem
yeah i've had a lot of discussion with

3384
00:57:38,309 --> 00:57:38,319
yeah i've had a lot of discussion with
 

3385
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:40,630
yeah i've had a lot of discussion with
uh with tesla folks you know with with

3386
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:40,640
uh with tesla folks you know with with
 

3387
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,230
uh with tesla folks you know with with
people that used to work a test like jim

3388
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:42,240
people that used to work a test like jim
 

3389
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,630
people that used to work a test like jim
keller about how to make stuff much

3390
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:44,640
keller about how to make stuff much
 

3391
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,309
keller about how to make stuff much
cheaper much better that's basically

3392
00:57:46,309 --> 00:57:46,319
cheaper much better that's basically
 

3393
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:49,109
cheaper much better that's basically
what tesla is world-class at and

3394
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:49,119
what tesla is world-class at and
 

3395
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:50,549
what tesla is world-class at and
it's like okay

3396
00:57:50,549 --> 00:57:50,559
it's like okay
 

3397
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:51,750
it's like okay
does this

3398
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:51,760
does this
 

3399
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,150
does this
thing have to cost a thousand dollars no

3400
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:54,160
thing have to cost a thousand dollars no
 

3401
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,910
thing have to cost a thousand dollars no
it can cost ten dollars right and let's

3402
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
it can cost ten dollars right and let's
 

3403
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,910
it can cost ten dollars right and let's
figure out how to manufacture it those

3404
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:57,920
figure out how to manufacture it those
 

3405
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,750
figure out how to manufacture it those
those those folks are like the best in

3406
00:57:59,750 --> 00:57:59,760
those those folks are like the best in
 

3407
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:02,950
those those folks are like the best in
the world they're doing that okay but um

3408
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:02,960
the world they're doing that okay but um
 

3409
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,309
the world they're doing that okay but um
what about this biden action plan

3410
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:06,319
what about this biden action plan
 

3411
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:08,390
what about this biden action plan
so it sounds like

3412
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:08,400
so it sounds like
 

3413
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,109
so it sounds like
the guy uh agrees with you vaccinate or

3414
00:58:11,109 --> 00:58:11,119
the guy uh agrees with you vaccinate or
 

3415
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:12,390
the guy uh agrees with you vaccinate or
test

3416
00:58:12,390 --> 00:58:12,400
test
 

3417
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,670
test
so

3418
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,680
so
 

3419
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,109
so
i think given that choice a lot of

3420
00:58:15,109 --> 00:58:15,119
i think given that choice a lot of
 

3421
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:17,910
i think given that choice a lot of
people go test in america because

3422
00:58:17,910 --> 00:58:17,920
people go test in america because
 

3423
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,990
people go test in america because
there's there's like a division it seems

3424
00:58:19,990 --> 00:58:20,000
there's there's like a division it seems
 

3425
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,109
there's there's like a division it seems
like so what is this just uh politics is

3426
00:58:23,109 --> 00:58:23,119
like so what is this just uh politics is
 

3427
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:24,230
like so what is this just uh politics is
is this

3428
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:24,240
is this
 

3429
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,670
is this
just words or do you think this is

3430
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:25,680
just words or do you think this is
 

3431
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,349
just words or do you think this is
actually going to lead to something and

3432
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:27,359
actually going to lead to something and
 

3433
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,510
actually going to lead to something and
maybe can you explain what the action

3434
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:29,520
maybe can you explain what the action
 

3435
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:31,589
maybe can you explain what the action
plan sure is

3436
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:31,599
plan sure is
 

3437
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,430
plan sure is
so there's there's a number of pillars

3438
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:33,440
so there's there's a number of pillars
 

3439
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,710
so there's there's a number of pillars
to the action plan um the two that i've

3440
00:58:36,710 --> 00:58:36,720
to the action plan um the two that i've
 

3441
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,390
to the action plan um the two that i've
been most focused on i mean some of them

3442
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:38,400
been most focused on i mean some of them
 

3443
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,069
been most focused on i mean some of them
are we want to get everyone vaccinated

3444
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:40,079
are we want to get everyone vaccinated
 

3445
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,910
are we want to get everyone vaccinated
all these things and

3446
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:41,920
all these things and
 

3447
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,470
all these things and
one pillar is saying any

3448
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:44,480
one pillar is saying any
 

3449
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,829
one pillar is saying any
company in the united states that has

3450
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:47,839
company in the united states that has
 

3451
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:51,430
company in the united states that has
more than a hundred employees

3452
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:51,440
more than a hundred employees
 

3453
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,230
more than a hundred employees
is now required to

3454
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:54,240
is now required to
 

3455
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:56,630
is now required to
ensure that any unvaccinated individuals

3456
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:56,640
ensure that any unvaccinated individuals
 

3457
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:58,390
ensure that any unvaccinated individuals
in their workforce

3458
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:58,400
in their workforce
 

3459
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,109
in their workforce
test weekly

3460
00:59:01,109 --> 00:59:01,119
test weekly
 

3461
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,030
test weekly
another pillar is that

3462
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:03,040
another pillar is that
 

3463
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,950
another pillar is that
the president's going to

3464
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:04,960
the president's going to
 

3465
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,309
the president's going to
reduce the cost of pcr tests

3466
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:08,319
reduce the cost of pcr tests
 

3467
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,589
reduce the cost of pcr tests
by 35 which is pretty

3468
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:11,599
by 35 which is pretty
 

3469
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,270
by 35 which is pretty
moderate reduction

3470
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:13,280
moderate reduction
 

3471
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,190
moderate reduction
um and

3472
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:15,200
um and
 

3473
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:17,270
um and
is going to reduce the cost of antigen

3474
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:17,280
is going to reduce the cost of antigen
 

3475
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,549
is going to reduce the cost of antigen
tests and scale them up and make 280

3476
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:20,559
tests and scale them up and make 280
 

3477
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,789
tests and scale them up and make 280
million tests

3478
00:59:22,789 --> 00:59:22,799
million tests
 

3479
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:26,309
million tests
and put two billion dollars into it

3480
00:59:26,309 --> 00:59:26,319
and put two billion dollars into it
 

3481
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,069
and put two billion dollars into it
so those are the two that i found most

3482
00:59:28,069 --> 00:59:28,079
so those are the two that i found most
 

3483
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,589
so those are the two that i found most
intriguing for the kind of mission that

3484
00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:29,599
intriguing for the kind of mission that
 

3485
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,270
intriguing for the kind of mission that
i've been on which is to just educate

3486
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:31,280
i've been on which is to just educate
 

3487
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,829
i've been on which is to just educate
people around hey we have really really

3488
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:33,839
people around hey we have really really
 

3489
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:35,510
people around hey we have really really
powerful public health tools we have yet

3490
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:35,520
powerful public health tools we have yet
 

3491
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,109
powerful public health tools we have yet
to deploy

3492
00:59:37,109 --> 00:59:37,119
to deploy
 

3493
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:39,510
to deploy
um

3494
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:39,520

 

3495
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,950

the issue

3496
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:40,960
the issue
 

3497
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,349
the issue
at hand though is that now that the

3498
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:43,359
at hand though is that now that the
 

3499
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:47,349
at hand though is that now that the
president has said vaccinate or test

3500
00:59:47,349 --> 00:59:47,359
president has said vaccinate or test
 

3501
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:49,510
president has said vaccinate or test
there's a problem inherent in that you

3502
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:49,520
there's a problem inherent in that you
 

3503
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,270
there's a problem inherent in that you
know it's essentially to coerce people

3504
00:59:51,270 --> 00:59:51,280
know it's essentially to coerce people
 

3505
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,750
know it's essentially to coerce people
around vaccinated to get vaccinated

3506
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:53,760
around vaccinated to get vaccinated
 

3507
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,109
around vaccinated to get vaccinated
because vaccinator test doesn't make

3508
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:55,119
because vaccinator test doesn't make
 

3509
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,470
because vaccinator test doesn't make
sense when the vaccinated people can

3510
00:59:56,470 --> 00:59:56,480
sense when the vaccinated people can
 

3511
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,309
sense when the vaccinated people can
transmit the virus just fine it should

3512
00:59:58,309 --> 00:59:58,319
transmit the virus just fine it should
 

3513
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:01,030
transmit the virus just fine it should
be vaccinate and test exactly it's the

3514
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:01,040
be vaccinate and test exactly it's the
 

3515
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:02,789
be vaccinate and test exactly it's the
problem that i have with that vaccinate

3516
01:00:02,789 --> 01:00:02,799
problem that i have with that vaccinate
 

3517
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:04,549
problem that i have with that vaccinate
or test idea

3518
01:00:04,549 --> 01:00:04,559
or test idea
 

3519
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,549
or test idea
is it's great if you want to use it as a

3520
01:00:06,549 --> 01:00:06,559
is it's great if you want to use it as a
 

3521
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:07,829
is it's great if you want to use it as a
coercive

3522
01:00:07,829 --> 01:00:07,839
coercive
 

3523
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:08,710
coercive
uh

3524
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:08,720
uh
 

3525
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,870
uh
effort to get people vaccinated like i'm

3526
01:00:10,870 --> 01:00:10,880
effort to get people vaccinated like i'm
 

3527
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,510
effort to get people vaccinated like i'm
not going to wade into that argument

3528
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:13,520
not going to wade into that argument
 

3529
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,109
not going to wade into that argument
do i agree with it or not i'm just not

3530
01:00:15,109 --> 01:00:15,119
do i agree with it or not i'm just not
 

3531
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,910
do i agree with it or not i'm just not
going to even put my uh

3532
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:17,920
going to even put my uh
 

3533
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,470
going to even put my uh
i disagree with let me say

3534
01:00:20,470 --> 01:00:20,480
i disagree with let me say
 

3535

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,190
that's our goal
so we should use the tools that are

3696
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:07,200
so we should use the tools that are
 

3697
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,630
so we should use the tools that are
going to stop transmission if that's our

3698
01:03:08,630 --> 01:03:08,640
going to stop transmission if that's our
 

3699
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,950
going to stop transmission if that's our
goal and saying vaccinate or test if our

3700
01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:10,960
goal and saying vaccinate or test if our
 

3701
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,190
goal and saying vaccinate or test if our
goal is to actually stop transmission

3702
01:03:13,190 --> 01:03:13,200
goal is to actually stop transmission
 

3703
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,109
goal is to actually stop transmission
that's confusing because vaccines are

3704
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:15,119
that's confusing because vaccines are
 

3705
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,390
that's confusing because vaccines are
not stopping it there may be mildly

3706
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:18,400
not stopping it there may be mildly
 

3707
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,950
not stopping it there may be mildly
lowering the risk of transmission

3708
01:03:20,950 --> 01:03:20,960
lowering the risk of transmission
 

3709
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:23,349
lowering the risk of transmission
so i i'm just not a fan of that language

3710
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:23,359
so i i'm just not a fan of that language
 

3711
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:24,870
so i i'm just not a fan of that language
i think we should be being very very

3712
01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:24,880
i think we should be being very very
 

3713
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:26,549
i think we should be being very very
clear like you said and up front about

3714
01:03:26,549 --> 01:03:26,559
clear like you said and up front about
 

3715
01:03:26,559 --> 01:03:27,670
clear like you said and up front about
what are the

3716
01:03:27,670 --> 01:03:27,680
what are the
 

3717
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,470
what are the
limitations of the test of the vaccine

3718
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:30,480
limitations of the test of the vaccine
 

3719
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,470
limitations of the test of the vaccine
and of the test and we should be very

3720
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:32,480
and of the test and we should be very
 

3721
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:33,829
and of the test and we should be very
clear that like you know it can only

3722
01:03:33,829 --> 01:03:33,839
clear that like you know it can only
 

3723
01:03:33,839 --> 01:03:36,630
clear that like you know it can only
help the american public

3724
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:36,640
help the american public
 

3725
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,349
help the american public
in aggregate is extremely intelligent to

3726
01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:39,359
in aggregate is extremely intelligent to
 

3727
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,270
in aggregate is extremely intelligent to
you know they will figure out

3728
01:03:41,270 --> 01:03:41,280
you know they will figure out
 

3729
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,349
you know they will figure out
when you say that vaccine breakthrough

3730
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:43,359
when you say that vaccine breakthrough
 

3731
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,109
when you say that vaccine breakthrough
cases are rare and then they start

3732
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:45,119
cases are rare and then they start
 

3733
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:46,069
cases are rare and then they start
seeing

3734
01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:46,079
seeing
 

3735
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:48,309
seeing
story after story of like whole parties

3736
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:48,319
story after story of like whole parties
 

3737
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:50,870
story after story of like whole parties
of people or vaccines have outbreaks and

3738
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:50,880
of people or vaccines have outbreaks and
 

3739
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,630
of people or vaccines have outbreaks and
and everyone knows more people now who

3740
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:52,640
and everyone knows more people now who
 

3741
01:03:52,640 --> 01:03:54,069
and everyone knows more people now who
are having breakthrough cases than they

3742
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:54,079
are having breakthrough cases than they
 

3743
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:56,150
are having breakthrough cases than they
knew who had regular cases before the

3744
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:56,160
knew who had regular cases before the
 

3745
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:59,990
knew who had regular cases before the
vaccine people start to wonder hmm

3746
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:00,000
vaccine people start to wonder hmm
 

3747
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,270
vaccine people start to wonder hmm
well this is weird they say that the

3748
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,280
well this is weird they say that the
 

3749
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,789
well this is weird they say that the
vaccines are working breakthrough cases

3750
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:02,799
vaccines are working breakthrough cases
 

3751
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:04,470
vaccines are working breakthrough cases
are rare maybe the whole vaccine program

3752
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:04,480
are rare maybe the whole vaccine program
 

3753
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,309
are rare maybe the whole vaccine program
is failing entirely

3754
01:04:06,309 --> 01:04:06,319
is failing entirely
 

3755
01:04:06,319 --> 01:04:07,750
is failing entirely
and so it ends up shooting ourselves in

3756
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:07,760
and so it ends up shooting ourselves in
 

3757
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,150
and so it ends up shooting ourselves in
the foot if we try to

3758
01:04:10,150 --> 01:04:10,160
the foot if we try to
 

3759
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,150
the foot if we try to
create false expectations because we

3760
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:12,160
create false expectations because we
 

3761
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:14,710
create false expectations because we
think it's going to be beneficial

3762
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
think it's going to be beneficial
 

3763
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,390
think it's going to be beneficial
uh for one thing when it's not for the

3764
01:04:16,390 --> 01:04:16,400
uh for one thing when it's not for the
 

3765
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,150
uh for one thing when it's not for the
other and so the other so to get back to

3766
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:18,160
other and so the other so to get back to
 

3767
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,670
other and so the other so to get back to
the action plan

3768
01:04:19,670 --> 01:04:19,680
the action plan
 

3769
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,029
the action plan
vaccinate or test i think

3770
01:04:23,029 --> 01:04:23,039
vaccinate or test i think
 

3771
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,109
vaccinate or test i think
and and the re and the increase in rapid

3772
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:25,119
and and the re and the increase in rapid
 

3773
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:27,430
and and the re and the increase in rapid
tests i do think it was a bold move i

3774
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:27,440
tests i do think it was a bold move i
 

3775
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:28,710
tests i do think it was a bold move i
think it

3776
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:28,720
think it
 

3777
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,870
think it
i i would say that it was the most

3778
01:04:30,870 --> 01:04:30,880
i i would say that it was the most
 

3779
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,990
i i would say that it was the most
prominent

3780
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:32,000
prominent
 

3781
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,589
prominent
sort of display

3782
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:33,599
sort of display
 

3783
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,510
sort of display
encouraging display of the fact that

3784
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:35,520
encouraging display of the fact that
 

3785
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,190
encouraging display of the fact that
rapid tests are

3786
01:04:37,190 --> 01:04:37,200
rapid tests are
 

3787
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,309
rapid tests are
indeed

3788
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:38,319
indeed
 

3789
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,710
indeed
effective public health tools

3790
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:40,720
effective public health tools
 

3791
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,349
effective public health tools
my real concern now with with is that

3792
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:43,359
my real concern now with with is that
 

3793
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:45,670
my real concern now with with is that
280 million tests that's like less than

3794
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:45,680
280 million tests that's like less than
 

3795
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,349
280 million tests that's like less than
one per person per year in the united

3796
01:04:47,349 --> 01:04:47,359
one per person per year in the united
 

3797
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,829
one per person per year in the united
states so that's not

3798
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:49,839
states so that's not
 

3799
01:04:49,839 --> 01:04:51,589
states so that's not
the way that he said and delivered it

3800
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:51,599
the way that he said and delivered it
 

3801
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:53,029
the way that he said and delivered it
and what most people think of when they

3802
01:04:53,029 --> 01:04:53,039
and what most people think of when they
 

3803
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:54,870
and what most people think of when they
hear the word 280 million you don't

3804
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:54,880
hear the word 280 million you don't
 

3805
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,150
hear the word 280 million you don't
usually put a lot of thought into what

3806
01:04:56,150 --> 01:04:56,160
usually put a lot of thought into what
 

3807
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,670
usually put a lot of thought into what
does that number mean it sounds a big

3808
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:57,680
does that number mean it sounds a big
 

3809
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,029
does that number mean it sounds a big
number

3810
01:04:59,029 --> 01:04:59,039
number
 

3811
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:00,470
number
most people are now going to be

3812
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:00,480
most people are now going to be
 

3813
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,309
most people are now going to be
expecting that these tests are actually

3814
01:05:02,309 --> 01:05:02,319
expecting that these tests are actually
 

3815
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,990
expecting that these tests are actually
going to be staying in stock on the on

3816
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:04,000
going to be staying in stock on the on
 

3817
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,309
going to be staying in stock on the on
the shelves at cvs and walgreens and

3818
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:06,319
the shelves at cvs and walgreens and
 

3819
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:09,510
the shelves at cvs and walgreens and
amazon or whatever so that's crisis

3820
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:09,520
amazon or whatever so that's crisis
 

3821
01:05:09,520 --> 01:05:11,829
amazon or whatever so that's crisis
number one it's like now the expectation

3822
01:05:11,829 --> 01:05:11,839
number one it's like now the expectation
 

3823
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,670
number one it's like now the expectation
is set for having rapid tests but

3824
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:13,680
is set for having rapid tests but
 

3825
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:15,670
is set for having rapid tests but
they're not going to scale that well

3826
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:15,680
they're not going to scale that well
 

3827
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:17,190
they're not going to scale that well
we won't have them and then there's

3828
01:05:17,190 --> 01:05:17,200
we won't have them and then there's
 

3829
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:19,270
we won't have them and then there's
vaccinate or test

3830
01:05:19,270 --> 01:05:19,280
vaccinate or test
 

3831
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,789
vaccinate or test
and that's going to bring millions and

3832
01:05:20,789 --> 01:05:20,799
and that's going to bring millions and
 

3833
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:22,789
and that's going to bring millions and
millions of people who are not currently

3834
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:22,799
millions of people who are not currently
 

3835
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,789
millions of people who are not currently
testing to have to start testing so

3836
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:24,799
testing to have to start testing so
 

3837
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:27,349
testing to have to start testing so
that's going to overwhelm our pcr labs

3838
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:27,359
that's going to overwhelm our pcr labs
 

3839
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:29,349
that's going to overwhelm our pcr labs
and it's going to create five-day delays

3840
01:05:29,349 --> 01:05:29,359
and it's going to create five-day delays
 

3841
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,829
and it's going to create five-day delays
again with pcr if not longer

3842
01:05:31,829 --> 01:05:31,839
again with pcr if not longer
 

3843
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,829
again with pcr if not longer
because we'll have backlogs

3844
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:33,839
because we'll have backlogs
 

3845
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:35,750
because we'll have backlogs
and so the only real solution to this is

3846
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:35,760
and so the only real solution to this is
 

3847
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:37,750
and so the only real solution to this is
to just scale up the tests that are

3848
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:37,760
to just scale up the tests that are
 

3849
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,109
to just scale up the tests that are
actually scalable

3850
01:05:39,109 --> 01:05:39,119
actually scalable
 

3851
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:40,710
actually scalable
and that's these simple rapid tests and

3852
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:40,720
and that's these simple rapid tests and
 

3853
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,630
and that's these simple rapid tests and
it's not even to scale them up

it's to open the doors so the companies
 

3861
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,430
it's to open the doors so the companies
that already exist here and can scale

supportive of it in principle
 

3895
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,630
supportive of it in principle
but i think now

3896
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:20,640
but i think now
 

3897
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:23,430
but i think now
now we actually are in a in like a the

3898
01:06:23,430 --> 01:06:23,440
now we actually are in a in like a the
 

3899
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:24,950
now we actually are in a in like a the
timer has been set and we have to deal

3900
01:06:24,950 --> 01:06:24,960
timer has been set and we have to deal
 

3901
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:26,789
timer has been set and we have to deal
with the crisis before it happens

3902
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:26,799
with the crisis before it happens
 

3903
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:27,910
with the crisis before it happens
otherwise there could be some real

3904
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:27,920
otherwise there could be some real
 

3905
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,190
otherwise there could be some real
political

3906
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:29,200
political
 

3907
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,750
political
points taken off you know i do worry

3908
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:31,760
points taken off you know i do worry
 

3909
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,589
points taken off you know i do worry
that the president if he doesn't pull

3910
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:33,599
that the president if he doesn't pull
 

3911
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,190
that the president if he doesn't pull
through with this and really make the

3912
01:06:35,190 --> 01:06:35,200
through with this and really make the
 

3913
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,630
through with this and really make the
test available we end up getting into

3914
01:06:36,630 --> 01:06:36,640
test available we end up getting into
 

3915
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,109
test available we end up getting into
this other test crisis this fall

3916
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:39,119
this other test crisis this fall
 

3917
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:41,109
this other test crisis this fall
there could be political consequences to

3918
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:41,119
there could be political consequences to
 

3919
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,710
there could be political consequences to
that and the reason is like these rapid

3920
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:42,720
that and the reason is like these rapid
 

3921
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:44,390
that and the reason is like these rapid
tests are so personal they become

3922
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:44,400
tests are so personal they become
 

3923
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,950
tests are so personal they become
emotional almost they're so they give

3924
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:46,960
emotional almost they're so they give
 

3925
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:48,309
emotional almost they're so they give
people that empowerment that i was

3926
01:06:48,309 --> 01:06:48,319
people that empowerment that i was
 

3927
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:49,829
people that empowerment that i was
talking about earlier

3928
01:06:49,829 --> 01:06:49,839
talking about earlier
 

3929
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,230
talking about earlier
and when people can't get that because

3930
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:52,240
and when people can't get that because
 

3931
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,549
and when people can't get that because
the shelves are out of stock

3932
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:54,559
the shelves are out of stock
 

3933
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:56,710
the shelves are out of stock
they actually feel frustrated and then

3934
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:56,720
they actually feel frustrated and then
 

3935
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,630
they actually feel frustrated and then
that converts into like anger like in

3936
01:06:58,630 --> 01:06:58,640
that converts into like anger like in
 

3937
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,670
that converts into like anger like in
the blame and so i do think that we have

3938
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:01,680
the blame and so i do think that we have
 

3939
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,670
the blame and so i do think that we have
to be really smart about

3940
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:03,680
to be really smart about
 

3941
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:05,190
to be really smart about
making a policy like this and then

3942
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:05,200
making a policy like this and then
 

3943
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,349
making a policy like this and then
ensuring that we can carry through

3944
01:07:07,349 --> 01:07:07,359
ensuring that we can carry through
 

3945
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,029
ensuring that we can carry through
with what the average american is

3946
01:07:09,029 --> 01:07:09,039
with what the average american is
 

3947
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:11,190
with what the average american is
actually expecting

3948
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:11,200
actually expecting
 

3949
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,390
actually expecting
and

3950
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:12,400
and
 

3951
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,309
and
speaking of politics one of the great

3952
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:14,319
speaking of politics one of the great
 

3953
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:16,230
speaking of politics one of the great
things about testing maybe you can

3954
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:16,240
things about testing maybe you can
 

3955
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:18,150
things about testing maybe you can
correct me but for my sense

3956
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:18,160
correct me but for my sense
 

3957
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:21,029
correct me but for my sense
it's one of the only solutions to covid

3958
01:07:21,029 --> 01:07:21,039
it's one of the only solutions to covid
 

3959
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:23,430
it's one of the only solutions to covid
that has not yet been politicized

why did we ever close anything down we
 

4207
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,350
why did we ever close anything down we
didn't close things down because

4208
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:49,360
didn't close things down because
 

4209
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:51,669
didn't close things down because
everyone is positive we closed things

4210
01:11:51,669 --> 01:11:51,679
everyone is positive we closed things
 

4211
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:53,590
everyone is positive we closed things
down because we didn't know if anyone

4212
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:53,600
down because we didn't know if anyone
 

4213
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,110
down because we didn't know if anyone
was positive

4217
01:11:58,159 --> 01:11:59,910
we quarantine a whole classroom of kids
not because they're all positive but

4218
01:11:59,910 --> 01:11:59,920
not because they're all positive but
 

4219
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,510
not because they're all positive but
because we don't know if one of them are

4220
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:01,520
because we don't know if one of them are
 

4221

because we don't know if one of them are
positive and so we just quarantine

test.org where we did
 

4339
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:55,030
test.org where we did
automate the process of writing letters

4340

automate the process of writing letters
 

4341
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:58,149
automate the process of writing letters
to um congressional members and and

they will not change and we shouldn't
 

4361
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:18,870
they will not change and we shouldn't
ask them to change because they have

ask them to change because they have

stick to it so what we need to do and
 

4369
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:26,390
stick to it so what we need to do and
maybe this is something to do

maybe this is something to do
 

4371

judged the rapid test x prize
and it went great we actually got

01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:22,800
and it went great we actually got
 

4421
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,870

and no clinical trials you know just a
 

4427
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:31,350
and no clinical trials you know just a
couple days worth of work in the lab and

couple days worth of work in the lab and
 

4429
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:33,270
couple days worth of work in the lab and
boom and if we actually systematize it

4430
01:15:33,270 --> 01:15:33,280
boom and if we actually systematize it
 

4431
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:35,590
boom and if we actually systematize it
would be an hour so in the lab you know

4432
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:35,600
would be an hour so in the lab you know
 

4433
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:36,830
would be an hour so in the lab you know
so

4434
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:36,840
so
 

4435
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:39,669
so
simple so i don't know i mean i don't

4436
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:39,679
simple so i don't know i mean i don't
 

4437
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:42,149
simple so i don't know i mean i don't
know how to really impact change i've

4438
01:15:42,149 --> 01:15:42,159
know how to really impact change i've
 

4439
01:15:42,159 --> 01:15:43,910
know how to really impact change i've
thankfully you know i have a platform

4440
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:43,920
thankfully you know i have a platform
 

4441
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:46,870
thankfully you know i have a platform
and i've been able to start talking with

4442
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:46,880
and i've been able to start talking with
 

4443
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:48,790
and i've been able to start talking with
people who are very close to the

4444
01:15:48,790 --> 01:15:48,800
people who are very close to the
 

4445
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,149
people who are very close to the
president and the white house and um and

president and the white house and um and
 

4447
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:53,990
president and the white house and um and
i do think that some change is finally

4448
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:54,000
i do think that some change is finally
 

4449
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:56,630
i do think that some change is finally
happening because the silver bullet of

4450
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:56,640
happening because the silver bullet of
 

4451
01:15:56,640 --> 01:15:58,950
happening because the silver bullet of
the vaccine has not panned out to be the

4452
01:15:58,950 --> 01:15:58,960
the vaccine has not panned out to be the
 

4453
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:00,709
the vaccine has not panned out to be the
silver bullet so now we gotta

4454
01:16:00,709 --> 01:16:00,719
silver bullet so now we gotta
 

4455
01:16:00,719 --> 01:16:01,990
silver bullet so now we gotta
now i think

4456
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:02,000
now i think
 

4457
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,910
now i think
we're moving from a country that was a

4458

we're moving from a country that was a
 

4459
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,470
we're moving from a country that was a
vaccine only approach to

4460
01:16:06,470 --> 01:16:06,480
vaccine only approach to
 

4461
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:08,070
vaccine only approach to
finally recognizing at the highest

4462
01:16:08,070 --> 01:16:08,080
finally recognizing at the highest
 

4463
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,310
finally recognizing at the highest
levels that there's other tools

4464
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:10,320
levels that there's other tools
 

4465
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,390
levels that there's other tools
do you think it's possible to reopen

4466
01:16:12,390 --> 01:16:12,400
do you think it's possible to reopen
 

4467
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,510
do you think it's possible to reopen
fully

4468
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:13,520
fully
 

4469
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:15,189
fully
without solving the testing problem

4470
01:16:15,189 --> 01:16:15,199
without solving the testing problem
 

4471
01:16:15,199 --> 01:16:16,870
without solving the testing problem
completely like do you think this

4472
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:16,880
completely like do you think this
 

4473
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,430
completely like do you think this
vaccine approach will get us to reopen

4474
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:19,440
vaccine approach will get us to reopen
 

4475
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:21,510
vaccine approach will get us to reopen
fully

4476

fully
 

4477
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,790
fully
i do yeah i think over time though

i mean if we a lot of people ask me like
 

4481
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:30,390
i mean if we a lot of people ask me like
what's what's like happening like what's

4482
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:30,400
what's what's like happening like what's
 

4483
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,310
what's what's like happening like what's
the end game here like where does this

4484
01:16:32,310 --> 01:16:32,320
the end game here like where does this
 

4485
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,510
the end game here like where does this
end

4486
01:16:33,510 --> 01:16:33,520
end
 

4487
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:35,990
end
and um

4488
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:36,000
and um
 

4489
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:39,350
and um
it's actually not a mystery the end game

4490
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:39,360
it's actually not a mystery the end game
 

4491
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:43,110
it's actually not a mystery the end game
is we will grow out of this virus

4492
01:16:43,110 --> 01:16:43,120
is we will grow out of this virus
 

4493
01:16:43,120 --> 01:16:44,790
is we will grow out of this virus
and by that i mean

4494
01:16:44,790 --> 01:16:44,800
and by that i mean
 

4495
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,310
and by that i mean
you and i

4496
01:16:46,310 --> 01:16:46,320
you and i
 

4497
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:47,189
you and i
and

4498
01:16:47,189 --> 01:16:47,199
and
 

4499
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,790
and
most people who are watching this are

4500
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:48,800
most people who are watching this are
 

4501
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,030
most people who are watching this are
adults right

4502
01:16:51,030 --> 01:16:51,040
adults right
 

4503
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:53,910
adults right
adults don't like to get infected with a

4504
01:16:53,910 --> 01:16:53,920
adults don't like to get infected with a
 

4505
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,470
adults don't like to get infected with a
virus for the very first time as adults

4506
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:56,480
virus for the very first time as adults
 

4507
01:16:56,480 --> 01:16:59,030
virus for the very first time as adults
babies are okay with it and so what we

4508
01:16:59,030 --> 01:16:59,040
babies are okay with it and so what we
 

4509
01:16:59,040 --> 01:17:00,950
babies are okay with it and so what we
have to do to understand how we're

4510
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:00,960
have to do to understand how we're
 

4511
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,950
have to do to understand how we're
getting out of this virus

4512
01:17:02,950 --> 01:17:02,960
getting out of this virus
 

4513
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,590
getting out of this virus
is to look at babies look at newborns

4514
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:05,600
is to look at babies look at newborns
 

4515
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,590
is to look at babies look at newborns
and say okay how does a baby get out of

4516
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:07,600
and say okay how does a baby get out of
 

4517
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:09,030
and say okay how does a baby get out of
their high risk

4518
01:17:09,030 --> 01:17:09,040
their high risk
 

4519
01:17:09,040 --> 01:17:10,229
their high risk
time period

4520
01:17:10,229 --> 01:17:10,239
time period
 

4521
01:17:10,239 --> 01:17:11,910
time period
they get exposed they get like exposed

4522
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:11,920
they get exposed they get like exposed
 

4523
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,189
they get exposed they get like exposed
multiple times or vaccinated of course

4524
01:17:15,189 --> 01:17:15,199
multiple times or vaccinated of course
 

4525
01:17:15,199 --> 01:17:16,709
multiple times or vaccinated of course
and eventually

4526
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:16,719
and eventually
 

4527
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:18,070
and eventually
they get exposed enough that they build

4528
01:17:18,070 --> 01:17:18,080
they get exposed enough that they build
 

4529
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:19,750
they get exposed enough that they build
up this nice cushion of immunity that's

4530
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:19,760
up this nice cushion of immunity that's
 

4531
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,910
up this nice cushion of immunity that's
sufficiently diverse that they can

4532
01:17:21,910 --> 01:17:21,920
sufficiently diverse that they can
 

4533
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:23,270
sufficiently diverse that they can
battle whatever gets thrown at them

4534
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:23,280
battle whatever gets thrown at them
 

4535
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:25,590
battle whatever gets thrown at them
because they've seen it all already

4536
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:25,600
because they've seen it all already
 

4537
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,390
because they've seen it all already
but

4538
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:26,400
but
 

4539
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,630
but
one exposure doesn't do it i mean over

4540
01:17:28,630 --> 01:17:28,640
one exposure doesn't do it i mean over
 

4541
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,709
one exposure doesn't do it i mean over
the course of the first few years of

4542
01:17:30,709 --> 01:17:30,719
the course of the first few years of
 

4543
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:32,790
the course of the first few years of
life kids get exposed to chronoviruses

4544
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:32,800
life kids get exposed to chronoviruses
 

4545
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,630
life kids get exposed to chronoviruses
tons of times lots of different viruses

4546
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:34,640
tons of times lots of different viruses
 

4547
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:35,590
tons of times lots of different viruses
they get

4548
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:35,600
they get
 

4549
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,270
they get
so unfortunately what's happening with

4550
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:37,280
so unfortunately what's happening with
 

4551
01:17:37,280 --> 01:17:40,070
so unfortunately what's happening with
us why this is so bad for us is that as

4552
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:40,080
us why this is so bad for us is that as
 

4553
01:17:40,080 --> 01:17:41,350
us why this is so bad for us is that as
we're adults

4554
01:17:41,350 --> 01:17:41,360
we're adults
 

4555
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:43,189
we're adults
we don't regenerate tissue very well we

4556
01:17:43,189 --> 01:17:43,199
we don't regenerate tissue very well we
 

4557
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:44,790
we don't regenerate tissue very well we
have like over abundant inflammatory

4558
01:17:44,790 --> 01:17:44,800
have like over abundant inflammatory
 

4559
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,310
have like over abundant inflammatory
response we have all these problems that

4560
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:46,320
response we have all these problems that
 

4561
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,070
response we have all these problems that
when we get an infection for the first

4562
01:17:48,070 --> 01:17:48,080
when we get an infection for the first
 

4563
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:49,110
when we get an infection for the first
time

4564
01:17:49,110 --> 01:17:49,120
time
 

4565
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:51,750
time
it sucks it harms us it causes us

4566
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:51,760
it sucks it harms us it causes us
 

4567
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:54,229
it sucks it harms us it causes us
problems but over time just like a baby

4568
01:17:54,229 --> 01:17:54,239
problems but over time just like a baby
 

4569
01:17:54,239 --> 01:17:55,830
problems but over time just like a baby
we're going to start building up our

4570
01:17:55,830 --> 01:17:55,840
we're going to start building up our
 

4571
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:59,110
we're going to start building up our
immunity through vaccines and exposures

4572
01:17:59,110 --> 01:17:59,120
immunity through vaccines and exposures
 

4573
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,110
immunity through vaccines and exposures
you know i hate to say it but tons of

4574
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:01,120
you know i hate to say it but tons of
 

4575
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:02,630
you know i hate to say it but tons of
people are getting exposed to delta

4576
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:02,640
people are getting exposed to delta
 

4577
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,709
people are getting exposed to delta
right now who don't know it

4578
01:18:04,709 --> 01:18:04,719
right now who don't know it
 

4579
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:06,070
right now who don't know it
tons

4580
01:18:06,070 --> 01:18:06,080
tons
 

4581
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,350
tons
and

4582
01:18:07,350 --> 01:18:07,360
and
 

4583
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,430
and
uh if you're vaccinated you don't know

4584
01:18:09,430 --> 01:18:09,440
uh if you're vaccinated you don't know
 

4585
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,270
uh if you're vaccinated you don't know
it as my point there

4586
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:11,280
it as my point there
 

4587
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,870
it as my point there
and you know at the end of the day this

4588
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:12,880
and you know at the end of the day this
 

4589
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,870
and you know at the end of the day this
is actually i do not want this to be

4590
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:14,880
is actually i do not want this to be
 

4591
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,110
is actually i do not want this to be
misconstrued as like saying go get

4592
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:17,120
misconstrued as like saying go get
 

4593
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:19,110
misconstrued as like saying go get
infected but the fact that people are

4594
01:18:19,110 --> 01:18:19,120
infected but the fact that people are
 

4595
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:21,110
infected but the fact that people are
getting infected you know will

4596
01:18:21,110 --> 01:18:21,120
getting infected you know will
 

4597
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:24,070
getting infected you know will
add to our level of protection later on

4598
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:24,080
add to our level of protection later on
 

4599
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,830
add to our level of protection later on
and so yeah but the question is how long

4600
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:25,840
and so yeah but the question is how long
 

4601
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,310
and so yeah but the question is how long
that whole process takes i think you

4602
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:28,320
that whole process takes i think you
 

4603
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:30,550
that whole process takes i think you
know my guess is probably by the end of

4604
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:30,560
know my guess is probably by the end of
 

4605
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,669
know my guess is probably by the end of
next year early 2023 we will probably

4606
01:18:33,669 --> 01:18:33,679
next year early 2023 we will probably
 

4607
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:35,590
next year early 2023 we will probably
start looking at this as though it is

4608
01:18:35,590 --> 01:18:35,600
start looking at this as though it is
 

4609
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:37,830
start looking at this as though it is
not a particularly dangerous virus for

4610
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:37,840
not a particularly dangerous virus for
 

4611
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,430
not a particularly dangerous virus for
most people the elderly though it will

4612
01:18:39,430 --> 01:18:39,440
most people the elderly though it will
 

4613
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,189
most people the elderly though it will
still be but that's because they're

4614
01:18:41,189 --> 01:18:41,199
still be but that's because they're
 

4615
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:43,430
still be but that's because they're
immunity like variants and stuff right

4616
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:43,440
immunity like variants and stuff right
 

4617
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:46,070
immunity like variants and stuff right
now other people say this statement you

4618
01:18:46,070 --> 01:18:46,080
now other people say this statement you
 

4619
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,510
now other people say this statement you
just said a year ago about this spring

4620
01:18:49,510 --> 01:18:49,520
just said a year ago about this spring
 

4621
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:52,229
just said a year ago about this spring
right well that probably was not wise

4622
01:18:52,229 --> 01:18:52,239
right well that probably was not wise
 

4623
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:53,990
right well that probably was not wise
well i mean it's because your the

4624
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:54,000
well i mean it's because your the
 

4625
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,149
well i mean it's because your the
intuition is like okay

4626
01:18:56,149 --> 01:18:56,159
intuition is like okay
 

4627
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,310
intuition is like okay
now that there's a vaccine you're either

4628
01:18:58,310 --> 01:18:58,320
now that there's a vaccine you're either
 

4629
01:18:58,320 --> 01:18:59,510
now that there's a vaccine you're either
going to take the vaccine or get

4630
01:18:59,510 --> 01:18:59,520
going to take the vaccine or get
 

4631
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,669
going to take the vaccine or get
infected and then it'll be hurt immunity

4632
01:19:01,669 --> 01:19:01,679
infected and then it'll be hurt immunity
 

4633
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:03,669
infected and then it'll be hurt immunity
over like it'll be very quick

4634
01:19:03,669 --> 01:19:03,679
over like it'll be very quick
 

4635
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:05,110
over like it'll be very quick
so you know

4636
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:05,120
so you know
 

4637
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,950
so you know
that that's the intuition but

4638
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:06,960
that that's the intuition but
 

4639
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:09,110
that that's the intuition but
it seems like that's not

4640
01:19:09,110 --> 01:19:09,120
it seems like that's not
 

4641
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:11,270
it seems like that's not
happening it seems like we're in this

4642
01:19:11,270 --> 01:19:11,280
happening it seems like we're in this
 

4643
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,030
happening it seems like we're in this
constant state

4644
01:19:13,030 --> 01:19:13,040
constant state
 

4645
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,430
constant state
of uh fear-mongering for different

4646
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:15,440
of uh fear-mongering for different
 

4647
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:18,630
of uh fear-mongering for different
reasons it's almost um

4648
01:19:18,630 --> 01:19:18,640
reasons it's almost um
 

4649
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:20,550
reasons it's almost um
it's almost like the virus got

4650
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:20,560
it's almost like the virus got
 

4651
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,630
it's almost like the virus got
deeply integrated not into just our

4652
01:19:22,630 --> 01:19:22,640
deeply integrated not into just our
 

4653
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:24,070
deeply integrated not into just our
biology but

4654
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:24,080
biology but
 

4655
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:27,830
biology but
in the game of politics and

4656
01:19:27,830 --> 01:19:27,840
in the game of politics and
 

4657
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:30,390
in the game of politics and
in the fear mongering around the news

4658
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:30,400
in the fear mongering around the news
 

4659
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,229
in the fear mongering around the news
because the virus now started being

4660
01:19:32,229 --> 01:19:32,239
because the virus now started being
 

4661
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:34,229
because the virus now started being
together with the vaccine and the masks

4662
01:19:34,229 --> 01:19:34,239
together with the vaccine and the masks
 

4663
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,390
together with the vaccine and the masks
and it started getting

4664
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:36,400
and it started getting
 

4665
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:39,990
and it started getting
uh integrated into uh the division

4666
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:40,000
uh integrated into uh the division
 

4667
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,790
uh integrated into uh the division
that's so effective at uh

4668
01:19:42,790 --> 01:19:42,800
that's so effective at uh
 

4669
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,110
that's so effective at uh
monetizing social media for example and

4670
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:45,120
monetizing social media for example and
 

4671
01:19:45,120 --> 01:19:47,270
monetizing social media for example and
so it's like all right

4672
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:47,280
so it's like all right
 

4673
01:19:47,280 --> 01:19:49,910
so it's like all right
so how do you get out of that mm-hmm

4674
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:49,920
so how do you get out of that mm-hmm
 

4675
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,510
so how do you get out of that mm-hmm
because you can always kind of present

4676
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:51,520
because you can always kind of present
 

4677
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:53,189
because you can always kind of present
certain kinds of numbers about number of

4678
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:53,199
certain kinds of numbers about number of
 

4679
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:55,830
certain kinds of numbers about number of
cases or

4680
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:55,840
cases or
 

4681
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:56,630
cases or
how

4682
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:56,640
how
 

4683
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:59,750
how
full hospitals are and and start making

4684
01:19:59,750 --> 01:19:59,760
full hospitals are and and start making
 

4685
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,910
full hospitals are and and start making
claims about that we're still this is as

4686
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:01,920
claims about that we're still this is as
 

4687
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,590
claims about that we're still this is as
bad as it's ever been those kinds of

4688
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:03,600
bad as it's ever been those kinds of
 

4689
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:04,709
bad as it's ever been those kinds of
statements

4690
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:04,719
statements
 

4691
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:06,870
statements
and so i'm not sure exactly what the way

4692
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:06,880
and so i'm not sure exactly what the way
 

4693
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,149
and so i'm not sure exactly what the way
out is except the same way out as it was

4694
01:20:10,149 --> 01:20:10,159
out is except the same way out as it was
 

4695
01:20:10,159 --> 01:20:12,550
out is except the same way out as it was
originally which is testing

4696
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:12,560
originally which is testing
 

4697
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,830
originally which is testing
this information it's information yeah

4698
01:20:15,830 --> 01:20:15,840
this information it's information yeah
 

4699
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:17,669
this information it's information yeah
and and i think we can do that we can

4700
01:20:17,669 --> 01:20:17,679
and and i think we can do that we can
 

4701
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,550
and and i think we can do that we can
keep outbreaks suppressed with testing

4702
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:20,560
keep outbreaks suppressed with testing
 

4703
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,990
keep outbreaks suppressed with testing
because it's information like people

4704
01:20:21,990 --> 01:20:22,000
because it's information like people
 

4705
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,430
because it's information like people
keep thinking of tests as big medical

4706
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:23,440
keep thinking of tests as big medical
 

4707
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,350
keep thinking of tests as big medical
things they're not they're information

4708
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:25,360
things they're not they're information
 

4709
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:27,189
things they're not they're information
it can allow us to control things just

4710
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:27,199
it can allow us to control things just
 

4711
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:27,990
it can allow us to control things just
like

4712
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:28,000
like
 

4713
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,990
like
we drive down

4714
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:30,000
we drive down
 

4715
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,510
we drive down
a road and

4716
01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:31,520
a road and
 

4717
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,350
a road and
we look at the cars and we don't hit

4718
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:33,360
we look at the cars and we don't hit
 

4719
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:34,550
we look at the cars and we don't hit
other cars because we have the

4720
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:34,560
other cars because we have the
 

4721
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,669
other cars because we have the
information that they're in the lane

4722
01:20:35,669 --> 01:20:35,679
information that they're in the lane
 

4723
01:20:35,679 --> 01:20:37,270
information that they're in the lane
next to us

4724
01:20:37,270 --> 01:20:37,280
next to us
 

4725
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,030
next to us
and they're moving over like that's just

4726
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,040
and they're moving over like that's just
 

4727
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,350
and they're moving over like that's just
information like you said glow green the

4728
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:41,360
information like you said glow green the
 

4729
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:43,189
information like you said glow green the
problem with the virus you don't have

4730
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:43,199
problem with the virus you don't have
 

4731
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:45,590
problem with the virus you don't have
you don't see you're walking around and

4732
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:45,600
you don't see you're walking around and
 

4733
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:47,830
you don't see you're walking around and
everybody is a potential

4734
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:47,840
everybody is a potential
 

4735
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:49,030
everybody is a potential
uh

4736
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:49,040
uh
 

4737
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:50,709
uh
like infectious

4738
01:20:50,709 --> 01:20:50,719
like infectious
 

4739
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,189
like infectious
creature and so if you see the world as

4740
01:20:53,189 --> 01:20:53,199
creature and so if you see the world as
 

4741
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,590
creature and so if you see the world as
a potential potential for infection

4742
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:55,600
a potential potential for infection
 

4743
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:57,030
a potential potential for infection
you're going to be terrified of that

4744
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:57,040
you're going to be terrified of that
 

4745
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,629
you're going to be terrified of that
exactly right and that is what has

4746
01:20:58,629 --> 01:20:58,639
exactly right and that is what has
 

4747
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:00,629
exactly right and that is what has
happened and i and that's why i've been

4748
01:21:00,629 --> 01:21:00,639
happened and i and that's why i've been
 

4749
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,870
happened and i and that's why i've been
pushing so hard for for these tests

4750
01:21:02,870 --> 01:21:02,880
pushing so hard for for these tests
 

4751
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:05,350
pushing so hard for for these tests
because they can allow people if you use

4752
01:21:05,350 --> 01:21:05,360
because they can allow people if you use
 

4753
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,270
because they can allow people if you use
them at a community level you can have

4754
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:07,280
them at a community level you can have
 

4755
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:08,790
them at a community level you can have
enough people know that they're positive

4756
01:21:08,790 --> 01:21:08,800
enough people know that they're positive
 

4757
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,310
enough people know that they're positive
enough people are good people that they

4758
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:10,320
enough people are good people that they
 

4759
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,390
enough people are good people that they
won't go out and affect others

4760
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:12,400
won't go out and affect others
 

4761
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:14,550
won't go out and affect others
and the other great thing about them is

4762
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:14,560
and the other great thing about them is
 

4763
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:17,270
and the other great thing about them is
again a 10-day isolation period

4764
01:21:17,270 --> 01:21:17,280
again a 10-day isolation period
 

4765
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,430
again a 10-day isolation period
especially for a vaccinated person but

4766
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:19,440
especially for a vaccinated person but
 

4767
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,430
especially for a vaccinated person but
in either case

4768
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:21,440
in either case
 

4769
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,910
in either case
is also an information problem we don't

4770
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:23,920
is also an information problem we don't
 

4771
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,830
is also an information problem we don't
have to isolate for 10 days if we're

4772
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:25,840
have to isolate for 10 days if we're
 

4773
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:27,750
have to isolate for 10 days if we're
infected what if we're only infectious

4774
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:27,760
infected what if we're only infectious
 

4775
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,510
infected what if we're only infectious
for two yeah especially if we're

4776
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:29,520
for two yeah especially if we're
 

4777
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,270
for two yeah especially if we're
vaccinated why are we telling people the

4778
01:21:31,270 --> 01:21:31,280
vaccinated why are we telling people the
 

4779
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,510
vaccinated why are we telling people the
only reason the cdc ever and the wha

4780
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:33,520
only reason the cdc ever and the wha
 

4781
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,270
only reason the cdc ever and the wha
suggested a 10-day

4782
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:35,280
suggested a 10-day
 

4783
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,910
suggested a 10-day
isolation or a 14-day quarantine is

4784
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:37,920
isolation or a 14-day quarantine is
 

4785
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,189
isolation or a 14-day quarantine is
because we didn't know when people

4786
01:21:39,189 --> 01:21:39,199
because we didn't know when people
 

4787
01:21:39,199 --> 01:21:41,110
because we didn't know when people
stopped being infectious

4788
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:41,120
stopped being infectious
 

4789
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,390
stopped being infectious
there's actually some people stay

4790
01:21:42,390 --> 01:21:42,400
there's actually some people stay
 

4791
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,709
there's actually some people stay
infectious for 14 days it's rare

4792
01:21:44,709 --> 01:21:44,719
infectious for 14 days it's rare
 

4793
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:46,390
infectious for 14 days it's rare
but there's a lot of people who stay

4794
01:21:46,390 --> 01:21:46,400
but there's a lot of people who stay
 

4795
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:48,310
but there's a lot of people who stay
infectious for like four

4796
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:48,320
infectious for like four
 

4797
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,669
infectious for like four
and that's a whole other week that we're

4798
01:21:49,669 --> 01:21:49,679
and that's a whole other week that we're
 

4799
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,750
and that's a whole other week that we're
asking people to isolate people would

4800
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:51,760
asking people to isolate people would
 

4801
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:54,950
asking people to isolate people would
probably be much more likely to comply

4802
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:54,960
probably be much more likely to comply
 

4803
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,550
probably be much more likely to comply
if they only have to isolate as long as

4804
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:56,560
if they only have to isolate as long as
 

4805
01:21:56,560 --> 01:21:57,910
if they only have to isolate as long as
they wake up each morning and see two

4806
01:21:57,910 --> 01:21:57,920
they wake up each morning and see two
 

4807
01:21:57,920 --> 01:21:58,790
they wake up each morning and see two
lines

4808

lines
 

4809
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,070

because you're actually seeing it for

would be so the goal is
 

5227
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:19,430
would be so the goal is
you have to first look at it through the

5228
01:29:19,430 --> 01:29:19,440
you have to first look at it through the
 

5229
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,669
you have to first look at it through the
eyes of samsara which is the cycle of

5230
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:21,679
eyes of samsara which is the cycle of
 

5231
01:29:21,679 --> 01:29:22,870
eyes of samsara which is the cycle of
rebirth

5232
01:29:22,870 --> 01:29:22,880
rebirth
 

5233
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,470
rebirth
which is suffering it's a cycle of

5234
01:29:24,470 --> 01:29:24,480
which is suffering it's a cycle of
 

5235
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:26,390
which is suffering it's a cycle of
suffering it's how it's viewed and the

5236
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:26,400
suffering it's how it's viewed and the
 

5237
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,990
suffering it's how it's viewed and the
idea is like if i really love this hat

5238
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:30,000
idea is like if i really love this hat
 

5239
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,229
idea is like if i really love this hat
and then the hat gets lost i'm sad so

5240
01:29:32,229 --> 01:29:32,239
and then the hat gets lost i'm sad so
 

5241
01:29:32,239 --> 01:29:34,310
and then the hat gets lost i'm sad so
that makes me suffer

5242
01:29:34,310 --> 01:29:34,320
that makes me suffer
 

5243
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,550
that makes me suffer
and if i hate this hat and i see it then

5244
01:29:36,550 --> 01:29:36,560
and if i hate this hat and i see it then
 

5245
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:39,110
and if i hate this hat and i see it then
it makes me sad or mad and that you know

5246
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:39,120
it makes me sad or mad and that you know
 

5247
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,510
it makes me sad or mad and that you know
it's an emotion but if i have if i'm

5248
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:41,520
it's an emotion but if i have if i'm
 

5249
01:29:41,520 --> 01:29:44,550
it's an emotion but if i have if i'm
completely ambivalent about that hat

5250
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:44,560
completely ambivalent about that hat
 

5251
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:45,750
completely ambivalent about that hat
i don't care it's there i don't care if

5252
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:45,760
i don't care it's there i don't care if
 

5253
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,990
i don't care it's there i don't care if
it gets lost if it's shredded

5254
01:29:47,990 --> 01:29:48,000
it gets lost if it's shredded
 

5255
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:51,430
it gets lost if it's shredded
then that is invokes no emotional rise

5256
01:29:51,430 --> 01:29:51,440
then that is invokes no emotional rise
 

5257
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,830
then that is invokes no emotional rise
out of me good or bad and so the idea is

5258
01:29:53,830 --> 01:29:53,840
out of me good or bad and so the idea is
 

5259
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:56,070
out of me good or bad and so the idea is
to find the balance there where

5260
01:29:56,070 --> 01:29:56,080
to find the balance there where
 

5261
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,910
to find the balance there where
you are so detached from everything that

5262
01:29:57,910 --> 01:29:57,920
you are so detached from everything that
 

5263
01:29:57,920 --> 01:30:00,229
you are so detached from everything that
you're not getting a rise negative or

5264
01:30:00,229 --> 01:30:00,239
you're not getting a rise negative or
 

5265
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:02,629
you're not getting a rise negative or
positive and

5266
01:30:02,629 --> 01:30:02,639
positive and
 

5267
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,790
positive and
you know this is really it's really such

5268
01:30:04,790 --> 01:30:04,800
you know this is really it's really such
 

5269
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:07,110
you know this is really it's really such
a distinct

5270
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:07,120

at scale
 

5749
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:34,790
at scale
to

01:39:07,830 --> 01:39:07,840
threats to human civilization
 

5783
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:10,790
threats to human civilization
are you nevertheless optimistic

5784
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:10,800
are you nevertheless optimistic
 

5785
01:39:10,800 --> 01:39:12,629
are you nevertheless optimistic
oh i don't think i'm optimistic about it

5786
01:39:12,629 --> 01:39:12,639
oh i don't think i'm optimistic about it
 

5787
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:13,590
oh i don't think i'm optimistic about it
all

5788
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:13,600
all
 

5789
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:16,790
all
i think what are you most worried about

5790
01:39:16,790 --> 01:39:16,800
i think what are you most worried about
 

5791
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:18,310
i think what are you most worried about
i it's it's one of those things so

5792
01:39:18,310 --> 01:39:18,320
i it's it's one of those things so
 

5793
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,470
i it's it's one of those things so
existential that i don't worry about it

5794
01:39:20,470 --> 01:39:20,480
existential that i don't worry about it
 

5795
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:22,229
existential that i don't worry about it
um

5796
01:39:22,229 --> 01:39:22,239
um
 

5797
01:39:22,239 --> 01:39:24,390
um
but i do think i mean let's in the

5798
01:39:24,390 --> 01:39:24,400
but i do think i mean let's in the
 

5799
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:26,310
but i do think i mean let's in the
united states for example so you asked

5800
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:26,320
united states for example so you asked
 

5801
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,310
united states for example so you asked
about the human civilization but let's

5802
01:39:28,310 --> 01:39:28,320
about the human civilization but let's
 

5803
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:30,470
about the human civilization but let's
talk about like a american society for a

5804
01:39:30,470 --> 01:39:30,480
talk about like a american society for a
 

5805
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,430
talk about like a american society for a
moment

5806
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:31,440
moment
 

5807
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,350
moment
i do think that like we're

5808
01:39:33,350 --> 01:39:33,360
i do think that like we're
 

5809
01:39:33,360 --> 01:39:35,910
i do think that like we're
probably seeing like

5810
01:39:35,910 --> 01:39:35,920
probably seeing like
 

5811
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:37,350
probably seeing like
the end of a really interesting

5812
01:39:37,350 --> 01:39:37,360
the end of a really interesting
 

5813
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:39,669
the end of a really interesting
experiment like the american experiment

5814
01:39:39,669 --> 01:39:39,679
experiment like the american experiment
 

5815
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,229
experiment like the american experiment
and we're seeing its limitations

5816
01:39:42,229 --> 01:39:42,239
and we're seeing its limitations
 

5817
01:39:42,239 --> 01:39:43,669
and we're seeing its limitations
we're probably going to become another

5818
01:39:43,669 --> 01:39:43,679
we're probably going to become another
 

5819
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:45,830
we're probably going to become another
blip like another one another power

5820
01:39:45,830 --> 01:39:45,840
blip like another one another power
 

5821
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,510
blip like another one another power
that's in the history books that like

5822
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:47,520
that's in the history books that like
 

5823
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:49,510
that's in the history books that like
rose and collapsed probably that's where

5824
01:39:49,510 --> 01:39:49,520
rose and collapsed probably that's where
 

5825
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:50,870
rose and collapsed probably that's where
we'll go

5826
01:39:50,870 --> 01:39:50,880
we'll go
 

5827
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:54,470
we'll go
in terms of civilization i think

5828
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:54,480
in terms of civilization i think
 

5829
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:57,030
in terms of civilization i think
we're demonstrating a pretty significant

5830
01:39:57,030 --> 01:39:57,040
we're demonstrating a pretty significant
 

5831
01:39:57,040 --> 01:39:59,430
we're demonstrating a pretty significant
inability to

5832
01:39:59,430 --> 01:39:59,440
inability to
 

5833
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:01,830
inability to
recognize the danger when

5834
01:40:01,830 --> 01:40:01,840
recognize the danger when
 

5835
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:03,270
recognize the danger when
whether that's the pandemic or whether

5836
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:03,280
whether that's the pandemic or whether
 

5837
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:06,390
whether that's the pandemic or whether
that's climate change

5838
01:40:06,390 --> 01:40:06,400

 

5839
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,629

i think it's extraordinary that we

5840
01:40:10,629 --> 01:40:10,639
i think it's extraordinary that we
 

5841
01:40:10,639 --> 01:40:13,430
i think it's extraordinary that we
we are not taking these things seriously

5842
01:40:13,430 --> 01:40:13,440
we are not taking these things seriously
 

5843
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,470
we are not taking these things seriously
yeah and

5844
01:40:14,470 --> 01:40:14,480
yeah and
 

5845
01:40:14,480 --> 01:40:16,790
yeah and
we're not acting with the urgency and i

5846
01:40:16,790 --> 01:40:16,800
we're not acting with the urgency and i
 

5847
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,229
we're not acting with the urgency and i
mean in some ways climate change

5848
01:40:20,229 --> 01:40:20,239
mean in some ways climate change
 

5849
01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:22,790
mean in some ways climate change
truly makes like this pandemic look like

5850
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:22,800
truly makes like this pandemic look like
 

5851
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,510
truly makes like this pandemic look like
child's play in terms of like the

5852
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:25,520
child's play in terms of like the
 

5853
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,629
child's play in terms of like the
destruction it has the potential to read

5854
01:40:28,629 --> 01:40:28,639
destruction it has the potential to read
 

5855
01:40:28,639 --> 01:40:30,390
destruction it has the potential to read
i tend to think if you just look at the

5856
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:30,400
i tend to think if you just look at the
 

5857
01:40:30,400 --> 01:40:32,470
i tend to think if you just look at the
progress of human history

5858
01:40:32,470 --> 01:40:32,480
progress of human history
 

5859
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,709
progress of human history
that the people

5860
01:40:34,709 --> 01:40:34,719
that the people
 

5861
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,669
that the people
who do good in the world

5862
01:40:37,669 --> 01:40:37,679
who do good in the world
 

5863
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:40,470
who do good in the world
out power the people that are the

5864
01:40:40,470 --> 01:40:40,480
out power the people that are the
 

5865
01:40:40,480 --> 01:40:42,950
out power the people that are the
that do bad in the world so we kind of

5866
01:40:42,950 --> 01:40:42,960
that do bad in the world so we kind of
 

5867
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:45,430
that do bad in the world so we kind of
there's something about our minds

5868
01:40:45,430 --> 01:40:45,440
there's something about our minds
 

5869
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:47,910
there's something about our minds
that likes to focus on the negative like

5870
01:40:47,910 --> 01:40:47,920
that likes to focus on the negative like
 

5871
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:50,629
that likes to focus on the negative like
on the destructive because we're afraid

5872
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:50,639
on the destructive because we're afraid
 

5873
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:51,990
on the destructive because we're afraid
of it

5874
01:40:51,990 --> 01:40:52,000
of it
 

5875
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,830
of it
it's also for some reason more fun to

5876
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:53,840
it's also for some reason more fun to
 

5877
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:56,629
it's also for some reason more fun to
watch destruction i don't you know

5878
01:40:56,629 --> 01:40:56,639
watch destruction i don't you know
 

5879
01:40:56,639 --> 01:40:59,750
watch destruction i don't you know
but it seems like the people who build

5880
01:40:59,750 --> 01:40:59,760
but it seems like the people who build
 

5881
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,590
but it seems like the people who build
who create solutions who um

5882
01:41:03,590 --> 01:41:03,600
who create solutions who um
 

5883
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:07,270
who create solutions who um
yeah who innovate and who just put

5884
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:07,280
yeah who innovate and who just put
 

5885
01:41:07,280 --> 01:41:08,149
yeah who innovate and who just put
like

5886
01:41:08,149 --> 01:41:08,159
like
 

5887
01:41:08,159 --> 01:41:10,070
like
both on the emotional level so love out

5888
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:10,080
both on the emotional level so love out
 

5889
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:11,350
both on the emotional level so love out
there and

5890
01:41:11,350 --> 01:41:11,360
there and
 

5891
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:12,149
there and
like

5892
01:41:12,149 --> 01:41:12,159
like
 

5893
01:41:12,159 --> 01:41:14,229
like
on the actual engineering level tools

5894
01:41:14,229 --> 01:41:14,239
on the actual engineering level tools
 

5895
01:41:14,239 --> 01:41:16,550
on the actual engineering level tools
that make for higher quality of life i

5896
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:16,560
that make for higher quality of life i
 

5897
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:18,550
that make for higher quality of life i
think those win out if you look at human

5898
01:41:18,550 --> 01:41:18,560
think those win out if you look at human
 

5899
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,669
think those win out if you look at human
history

5900
01:41:19,669 --> 01:41:19,679
history
 

5901
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:21,669
history
um but the question is whether the

5902
01:41:21,669 --> 01:41:21,679
um but the question is whether the
 

5903
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,390
um but the question is whether the
negative stuff can sometimes peak to the

5904
01:41:24,390 --> 01:41:24,400
negative stuff can sometimes peak to the
 

5905
01:41:24,400 --> 01:41:26,390
negative stuff can sometimes peak to the
level where everybody's just destroyed

5906
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:26,400
level where everybody's just destroyed
 

5907
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:28,629
level where everybody's just destroyed
but as long as that doesn't happen

5908
01:41:28,629 --> 01:41:28,639
but as long as that doesn't happen
 

5909
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:31,189
but as long as that doesn't happen
i i tend to believe that there would be

5910
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:31,199
i i tend to believe that there would be
 

5911
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:33,430
i i tend to believe that there would be
like a gradual with some

5912
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:33,440
like a gradual with some
 

5913
01:41:33,440 --> 01:41:35,750
like a gradual with some
noise a gradual improvement of quality

5914
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:35,760
noise a gradual improvement of quality
 

5915
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:38,149
noise a gradual improvement of quality
of life in human civilization

5916
01:41:38,149 --> 01:41:38,159
of life in human civilization
 

5917
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,709
of life in human civilization
i do think so to a certain extent but

5918
01:41:40,709 --> 01:41:40,719
i do think so to a certain extent but
 

5919
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:42,390
i do think so to a certain extent but
it's that what's what you said like

5920
01:41:42,390 --> 01:41:42,400
it's that what's what you said like
 

5921
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,149
it's that what's what you said like
unless there's like some

5922
01:41:44,149 --> 01:41:44,159
unless there's like some
 

5923
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:46,870
unless there's like some
significant peak of bad you know the

5924
01:41:46,870 --> 01:41:46,880
significant peak of bad you know the
 

5925
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,350
significant peak of bad you know the
the problem with bad

5926
01:41:49,350 --> 01:41:49,360
the problem with bad
 

5927
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:51,430
the problem with bad
is that it can happen like that you know

5928
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:51,440
is that it can happen like that you know
 

5929
01:41:51,440 --> 01:41:52,950
is that it can happen like that you know
good

5930
01:41:52,950 --> 01:41:52,960
good
 

5931
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:55,350
good
you can you can't build a society

5932
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:55,360
you can you can't build a society
 

5933
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,590
you can you can't build a society
overnight but you sure can kill one

5934
01:41:57,590 --> 01:41:57,600
overnight but you sure can kill one
 

5935
01:41:57,600 --> 01:41:58,830
overnight but you sure can kill one
like i just think

5936
01:41:58,830 --> 01:41:58,840
like i just think
 

5937
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:00,470
like i just think
about

5938
01:42:00,470 --> 01:42:00,480
about
 

5939
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,669
about
food crises and instability and just i

5940
01:42:03,669 --> 01:42:03,679
food crises and instability and just i
 

5941
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:05,590
food crises and instability and just i
don't know but i do hope that i mean i

5942
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:05,600
don't know but i do hope that i mean i
 

5943
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:08,950
don't know but i do hope that i mean i
completely agree i think we can engineer

5944
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:08,960
completely agree i think we can engineer
 

5945
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:11,910
completely agree i think we can engineer
our way to a healthier

5946
01:42:11,910 --> 01:42:11,920
our way to a healthier
 

5947
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,350
our way to a healthier
better world like i truly do

5948
01:42:15,350 --> 01:42:15,360
better world like i truly do
 

5949
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:17,669
better world like i truly do
my concern is that the people who are

5950
01:42:17,669 --> 01:42:17,679
my concern is that the people who are
 

5951
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:19,990
my concern is that the people who are
doing that until very recently

5952
01:42:19,990 --> 01:42:20,000
doing that until very recently
 

5953
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,550
doing that until very recently
don't generally rule the world

5954
01:42:22,550 --> 01:42:22,560
don't generally rule the world
 

5955
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,109
don't generally rule the world
now of course we're seeing

5956
01:42:25,109 --> 01:42:25,119
now of course we're seeing
 

5957
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:29,030
now of course we're seeing
non-elected leaders and you know people

5958
01:42:29,030 --> 01:42:29,040
non-elected leaders and you know people
 

5959
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:29,910
non-elected leaders and you know people
who

5960
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:29,920
who
 

5961
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,669
who
run massive corporations essentially

5962
01:42:33,669 --> 01:42:33,679
run massive corporations essentially
 

5963
01:42:33,679 --> 01:42:36,149
run massive corporations essentially
having as much or really more power than

5964
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:36,159
having as much or really more power than
 

5965
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,709
having as much or really more power than
elected leaders or than kings and queens

5966
01:42:38,709 --> 01:42:38,719
elected leaders or than kings and queens
 

5967
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:39,910
elected leaders or than kings and queens
and such

5968
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:39,920
and such
 

5969
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:41,990
and such
so how they choose to wield that power

5970
01:42:41,990 --> 01:42:42,000
so how they choose to wield that power
 

5971
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,149
so how they choose to wield that power
you know is an interesting choice and i

5972
01:42:44,149 --> 01:42:44,159
you know is an interesting choice and i
 

5973
01:42:44,159 --> 01:42:46,550
you know is an interesting choice and i
do hope that you're right in that

5974
01:42:46,550 --> 01:42:46,560
do hope that you're right in that
 

5975
01:42:46,560 --> 01:42:48,870
do hope that you're right in that
over time

5976
01:42:48,870 --> 01:42:48,880
over time
 

5977
01:42:48,880 --> 01:42:50,229
over time
fear

5978
01:42:50,229 --> 01:42:50,239
fear
 

5979
01:42:50,239 --> 01:42:53,109
fear
will drive companies to

5980
01:42:53,109 --> 01:42:53,119
will drive companies to
 

5981
01:42:53,119 --> 01:42:54,790
will drive companies to
produce a better product or whatever you

5982
01:42:54,790 --> 01:42:54,800
produce a better product or whatever you
 

5983
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:56,709
produce a better product or whatever you
know something like over time it's just

5984
01:42:56,709 --> 01:42:56,719
know something like over time it's just
 

5985
01:42:56,719 --> 01:42:59,189
know something like over time it's just
like predator prey models

5986
01:42:59,189 --> 01:42:59,199
like predator prey models
 

5987
01:42:59,199 --> 01:43:01,510
like predator prey models
you get so bad or so everything like

5988
01:43:01,510 --> 01:43:01,520
you get so bad or so everything like
 

5989
01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:03,830
you get so bad or so everything like
it's so revved up that all of a sudden

5990
01:43:03,830 --> 01:43:03,840
it's so revved up that all of a sudden
 

5991
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:05,590
it's so revved up that all of a sudden
something cracks and they say okay i do

5992
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:05,600
something cracks and they say okay i do
 

5993
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:07,590
something cracks and they say okay i do
want an electric car or whatever like

5994
01:43:07,590 --> 01:43:07,600
want an electric car or whatever like
 

5995
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,709
want an electric car or whatever like
and

5996
01:43:08,709 --> 01:43:08,719
and
 

5997
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:10,550
and
and that takes some combination of

5998
01:43:10,550 --> 01:43:10,560
and that takes some combination of
 

5999
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:11,750
and that takes some combination of
innovation

6000
01:43:11,750 --> 01:43:11,760
innovation
 

6001
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:13,109
innovation
letting people know that these electric

6002
01:43:13,109 --> 01:43:13,119
letting people know that these electric
 

6003
01:43:13,119 --> 01:43:15,430
letting people know that these electric
cars exist it's kind of rapid tests too

6004
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:15,440
cars exist it's kind of rapid tests too
 

6005
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,590
cars exist it's kind of rapid tests too
like you get to finally feel it and see

6006
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:17,600
like you get to finally feel it and see
 

6007
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:18,470
like you get to finally feel it and see
it

6008
01:43:18,470 --> 01:43:18,480
it
 

6009
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,310
it
have an electric car and then all of a

6010
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:20,320
have an electric car and then all of a
 

6011
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,830
have an electric car and then all of a
sudden things change and everyone says

6012
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:21,840
sudden things change and everyone says
 

6013
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:23,510
sudden things change and everyone says
oh this is so bad and actually i'm doing

6014
01:43:23,510 --> 01:43:23,520
oh this is so bad and actually i'm doing
 

6015
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:25,590
oh this is so bad and actually i'm doing
good for the world relatively speaking

6016
01:43:25,590 --> 01:43:25,600
good for the world relatively speaking
 

6017
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,790
good for the world relatively speaking
and

6018
01:43:26,790 --> 01:43:26,800
and
 

6019
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:28,790
and
you know i guess it's a paradigm shift

6020
01:43:28,790 --> 01:43:28,800
you know i guess it's a paradigm shift
 

6021
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:29,830
you know i guess it's a paradigm shift
yeah

6022
01:43:29,830 --> 01:43:29,840
yeah
 

6023
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:32,229
yeah
it becomes uh lack of a better word

6024
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:32,239
it becomes uh lack of a better word
 

6025
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:33,189
it becomes uh lack of a better word

6028
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:34,960
positivity does
 

6029
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:35,990

6030
01:43:35,990 --> 01:43:36,000
and
 

6031
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,229
and
i mean i believe that ultimately that

6032
01:43:38,229 --> 01:43:38,239
i mean i believe that ultimately that
 

6033
01:43:38,239 --> 01:43:40,390
i mean i believe that ultimately that
that wins out

6034
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:40,400
that wins out
 

6035
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:42,709
that wins out
because i think there's much more power

6036
01:43:42,709 --> 01:43:42,719
because i think there's much more power
 

6037
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:45,350
because i think there's much more power
to be gained so i think most people want

6038
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:45,360
to be gained so i think most people want
 

6039
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:47,830
to be gained so i think most people want
to do good and if you want to wield

6040
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:47,840
to do good and if you want to wield
 

6041
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:51,189
to do good and if you want to wield
power you want to uh

6042
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:51,199
power you want to uh
 

6043
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:54,070
power you want to uh
channeled people's desire to do good

6044
01:43:54,070 --> 01:43:54,080
channeled people's desire to do good
 

6045
01:43:54,080 --> 01:43:56,550
channeled people's desire to do good
and i think over time that's that's

6046
01:43:56,550 --> 01:43:56,560
and i think over time that's that's
 

6047
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:58,870
and i think over time that's that's
exactly what people uh

6048
01:43:58,870 --> 01:43:58,880
exactly what people uh
 

6049
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,109
exactly what people uh
will do but yeah this i mean both on the

6050
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:01,119
will do but yeah this i mean both on the
 

6051
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:03,270
will do but yeah this i mean both on the
natural side the pandemic you know

6052
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:03,280
natural side the pandemic you know
 

6053
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,790
natural side the pandemic you know
there's still biology at play there's

6054
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:04,800
there's still biology at play there's
 

6055
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:06,310
there's still biology at play there's
still viruses out there trying to help

6056
01:44:06,310 --> 01:44:06,320
still viruses out there trying to help
 

6057
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,950
still viruses out there trying to help
us there's accidents uh there's nuclear

6058
01:44:08,950 --> 01:44:08,960
us there's accidents uh there's nuclear
 

6059
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,510
us there's accidents uh there's nuclear
weapons there's unintended consequences

6060
01:44:11,510 --> 01:44:11,520
weapons there's unintended consequences
 

6061
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:12,870
weapons there's unintended consequences
of tools whether it's on the

6062
01:44:12,870 --> 01:44:12,880
of tools whether it's on the
 

6063
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:15,430
of tools whether it's on the
nanotechnology side or the artificial

6064
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:15,440
nanotechnology side or the artificial
 

6065
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:17,189
nanotechnology side or the artificial
intelligence side then there's the

6066
01:44:17,189 --> 01:44:17,199
intelligence side then there's the
 

6067
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:19,350
intelligence side then there's the
natural things like meteors and all that

6068
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:19,360
natural things like meteors and all that
 

6069
01:44:19,360 --> 01:44:22,149
natural things like meteors and all that
that kind of stuff and yeah climate

6070
01:44:22,149 --> 01:44:22,159
that kind of stuff and yeah climate
 

6071
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:23,830
that kind of stuff and yeah climate
change

6072
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:23,840
change
 

6073
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:25,030
change
all of that

6074
01:44:25,030 --> 01:44:25,040
all of that
 

6075
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:27,109
all of that
but i tend to think

6076
01:44:27,109 --> 01:44:27,119
but i tend to think
 

6077
01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,030
but i tend to think
we humans are a clever bunch and when

6078
01:44:29,030 --> 01:44:29,040
we humans are a clever bunch and when
 

6079
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:30,550
we humans are a clever bunch and when
there's a deadline

6080
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:30,560
there's a deadline
 

6081
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:33,590
there's a deadline
a real deadline or real threat before us

6082
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:33,600
a real deadline or real threat before us
 

6083
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:35,590
a real deadline or real threat before us
we kind of step up

6084
01:44:35,590 --> 01:44:35,600
we kind of step up
 

6085
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,950
we kind of step up
i don't know but

6086
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:36,960
i don't know but
 

6087
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:39,430
i don't know but
maybe you have to believe that

6088
01:44:39,430 --> 01:44:39,440
maybe you have to believe that
 

6089
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,229
maybe you have to believe that
um until the very end

6090
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:42,239
um until the very end
 

6091
01:44:42,239 --> 01:44:43,910
um until the very end
yeah

6092
01:44:43,910 --> 01:44:43,920
yeah
 

6093
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:44,950
yeah
that's

6094
01:44:44,950 --> 01:44:44,960
that's
 

6095
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,709
that's
that's right it will oh i mean we'll

6096
01:44:46,709 --> 01:44:46,719
that's right it will oh i mean we'll
 

6097
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:48,629
that's right it will oh i mean we'll
have to see i guess you know neither

6098
01:44:48,629 --> 01:44:48,639
have to see i guess you know neither
 

6099
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:49,510
have to see i guess you know neither
well

6100
01:44:49,510 --> 01:44:49,520
well
 

6101
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:51,340
well
ideally we won't be alive to see that

6102
01:44:51,340 --> 01:44:51,350
ideally we won't be alive to see that
 

6103
01:44:51,350 --> 01:44:53,430
ideally we won't be alive to see that
[Laughter]

6104

[Laughter]
 

6105
01:44:53,440 --> 01:44:56,310
[Laughter]
