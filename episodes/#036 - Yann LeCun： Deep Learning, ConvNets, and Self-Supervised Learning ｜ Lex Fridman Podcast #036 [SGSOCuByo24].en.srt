00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,059
code is called code so that tells you
something and it's actually the design

164
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:32,069
something and it's actually the design
 

165
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,410
something and it's actually the design
of an object you function that's really

166
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,420
of an object you function that's really
 

167
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,180
of an object you function that's really
what legal code is right it tells you

168
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,190
what legal code is right it tells you
 

169
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,640
what legal code is right it tells you
you can do it what you can't do if you

170
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:37,650
you can do it what you can't do if you
 

171
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,800
you can do it what you can't do if you
do it you pay that much that's that's an

172
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:39,810
do it you pay that much that's that's an
 

173
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,280
do it you pay that much that's that's an
objective function so there is this idea

174
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,290
objective function so there is this idea
 

175
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,050
objective function so there is this idea
somehow that it's a new thing for people

176
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,060
somehow that it's a new thing for people
 

177
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,699
somehow that it's a new thing for people
to try to design objective functions are

178
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:46,709
to try to design objective functions are
 

179
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:48,229
to try to design objective functions are
aligned with the common good but no

180
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:48,239
aligned with the common good but no
 

181
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,819
aligned with the common good but no
we've been writing laws for millennia

182
00:03:49,819 --> 00:03:49,829
we've been writing laws for millennia
 

183
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,220
we've been writing laws for millennia
and that's exactly what it is

184
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,230
and that's exactly what it is
 

185
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,620
and that's exactly what it is
so this that's where you know the

186
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:54,630
so this that's where you know the
 

187
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,330
so this that's where you know the
science of lawmaking and and computer

188
00:03:59,330 --> 00:03:59,340
science of lawmaking and and computer
 

189
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,640
science of lawmaking and and computer
science will come together will come

190
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:01,650
science will come together will come
 

191
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,069
science will come together will come
together so it's nothing there's nothing

192
00:04:04,069 --> 00:04:04,079
together so it's nothing there's nothing
 

193
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,190
together so it's nothing there's nothing
special about how or a I systems is just

194
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:07,200
special about how or a I systems is just
 

195
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,830
special about how or a I systems is just
the continuation of tools used to make

196
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:09,840
the continuation of tools used to make
 

197
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,939
the continuation of tools used to make
some of these difficult ethical

198
00:04:10,939 --> 00:04:10,949
some of these difficult ethical
 

199
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:13,789
some of these difficult ethical
judgments that laws make yeah and we and

200
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:13,799
judgments that laws make yeah and we and
 

201
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,450
judgments that laws make yeah and we and
we have systems like this already that

202
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:15,460
we have systems like this already that
 

203
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,390
we have systems like this already that
you know make many decisions for

204
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:18,400
you know make many decisions for
 

205
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,760
you know make many decisions for
ourselves in society that you know need

206
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:20,770
ourselves in society that you know need
 

207
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,740
ourselves in society that you know need
to be designed in a way that they like

208
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:22,750
to be designed in a way that they like
 

209
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,090
to be designed in a way that they like
you know rules about things that

210
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:24,100
you know rules about things that
 

211
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,340
you know rules about things that
sometimes sometimes have bad side

212
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:26,350
sometimes sometimes have bad side
 

213
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,500
sometimes sometimes have bad side
effects and we have to be flexible

214
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:28,510
effects and we have to be flexible
 

215
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,000
effects and we have to be flexible
enough about those rules so that they

216
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,010
enough about those rules so that they
 

217
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,470
enough about those rules so that they
can be broken when it's obvious that

218
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:31,480
can be broken when it's obvious that
 

219
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,710
can be broken when it's obvious that
they shouldn't be applied so you don't

220
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:34,720
they shouldn't be applied so you don't
 

221
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,000
they shouldn't be applied so you don't
see this on the camera here but all the

222
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,010
see this on the camera here but all the
 

223
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,070
see this on the camera here but all the
decorations in this room is all pictures

224
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:38,080
decorations in this room is all pictures
 

225
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,790
decorations in this room is all pictures
from 2001 a Space Odyssey Wow

226
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:41,800
from 2001 a Space Odyssey Wow
 

227
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,920
from 2001 a Space Odyssey Wow
and by accident or is there a lot about

228
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:43,930
and by accident or is there a lot about
 

229
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,020
and by accident or is there a lot about
accident it's by design Wow so if you

230
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,030
accident it's by design Wow so if you
 

231
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,650
accident it's by design Wow so if you
were if you were to build hell 10,000 so

232
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:52,660
were if you were to build hell 10,000 so
 

233
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,830
were if you were to build hell 10,000 so
an improvement of Hal 9000 what would

234
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:55,840
an improvement of Hal 9000 what would
 

235
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,140
an improvement of Hal 9000 what would
you improve well first of all I wouldn't

236
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:58,150
you improve well first of all I wouldn't
 

237
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,410
you improve well first of all I wouldn't
ask you to hold secrets and tell lies

238
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:01,420
ask you to hold secrets and tell lies
 

239
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,480
ask you to hold secrets and tell lies
because that's really what breaks it in

240
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,490
because that's really what breaks it in
 

241
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,430
because that's really what breaks it in
the end that's the the fact that it's

242
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,440
the end that's the the fact that it's
 

243
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,740
the end that's the the fact that it's
asking itself questions about the

244
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:07,750
asking itself questions about the
 

245
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,390
asking itself questions about the
purpose of the mission and it's you know

246
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:09,400
purpose of the mission and it's you know
 

247
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,310
purpose of the mission and it's you know
pieces things together that it's heard

248
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:11,320
pieces things together that it's heard
 

249
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,020
pieces things together that it's heard
you know all the secrecy of the

250
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,030
you know all the secrecy of the
 

251
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,700
you know all the secrecy of the
preparation of the mission and the fact

252
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:14,710
preparation of the mission and the fact
 

253
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,190
preparation of the mission and the fact
that it was discovery and on the lunar

254
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:17,200
that it was discovery and on the lunar
 

255
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,990
that it was discovery and on the lunar
surface that really was kept secret and

256
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:19,000
surface that really was kept secret and
 

257
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,170
surface that really was kept secret and
and one part of Hal's memory knows this

258
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:22,180
and one part of Hal's memory knows this
 

259
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,630
and one part of Hal's memory knows this
and the other part is does not know it

260
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:24,640
and the other part is does not know it
 

261
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,610
and the other part is does not know it
and it's supposed to not tell anyone and

262
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:26,620
and it's supposed to not tell anyone and
 

263
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,800
and it's supposed to not tell anyone and
that creates a internal conflict do you

264
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:28,810
that creates a internal conflict do you
 

265
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:31,260
that creates a internal conflict do you
think there's never should be a set of

266
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:31,270
think there's never should be a set of
 

267
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,140
think there's never should be a set of
things that night AI system should not

268
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:34,150
things that night AI system should not
 

269
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:38,370
things that night AI system should not
be allowed like a set of facts that

270
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:38,380
be allowed like a set of facts that
 

271
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,410
be allowed like a set of facts that
should not be shared with the human

272
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:40,420
should not be shared with the human
 

273
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:44,130
should not be shared with the human
operators well I think no I think the I

274
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,140
operators well I think no I think the I
 

275
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,800
operators well I think no I think the I
think it should be a bit like in the

276
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:46,810
think it should be a bit like in the
 

277
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:52,110
think it should be a bit like in the
design of autonomous AI systems there

278
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:52,120
design of autonomous AI systems there
 

279
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,360
design of autonomous AI systems there
should be the equivalent of you know the

280
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,370
should be the equivalent of you know the
 

281
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:58,350
should be the equivalent of you know the
the the oath that hypocrite Oh calm

282
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:58,360
the the oath that hypocrite Oh calm
 

283
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,860
the the oath that hypocrite Oh calm
yourself yeah that doctors sign up to

284
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:01,870
yourself yeah that doctors sign up to
 

285
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,810
yourself yeah that doctors sign up to
right so the certain thing certain rule

286
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:03,820
right so the certain thing certain rule
 

287
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,820
right so the certain thing certain rule
said that that you have to abide by and

288
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:05,830
said that that you have to abide by and
 

289
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,070
said that that you have to abide by and
we can sort of hardwire this into into

290
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,080
we can sort of hardwire this into into
 

291
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,110
we can sort of hardwire this into into
our into our machines to kind of make

292
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:10,120
our into our machines to kind of make
 

293
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,700
our into our machines to kind of make
sure they don't go so I'm not you know

294
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:11,710
sure they don't go so I'm not you know
 

295
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:14,760
sure they don't go so I'm not you know
advocate of the the 303 dollars of

Robotics you know the as you move kind

298
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:16,750
Robotics you know the as you move kind
 

299
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,030
Robotics you know the as you move kind
of thing because I don't think it's

300
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:18,040
of thing because I don't think it's
 

301
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,270
of thing because I don't think it's
practical but but you know some some

302
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:21,280
practical but but you know some some
 

303
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,950
practical but but you know some some
level of of limits but but to be clear

304
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:24,960
level of of limits but but to be clear
 

305
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,830
level of of limits but but to be clear
this is not these are not questions that

306
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:28,840
this is not these are not questions that
 

307
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,830
this is not these are not questions that
are kind of really worth asking today

308
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:31,840
are kind of really worth asking today
 

309
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,090
are kind of really worth asking today
because we just don't have the

310
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,100
because we just don't have the
 

311
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,159
because we just don't have the
technology to do this we don't we don't

312
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:35,169
technology to do this we don't we don't
 

313
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:36,450
technology to do this we don't we don't
have a ton of missing teller machines we

314
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:36,460
have a ton of missing teller machines we
 

315
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,860
have a ton of missing teller machines we
have intelligent machines so my

316
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:37,870
have intelligent machines so my
 

317
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,940
have intelligent machines so my

intelligent machines that are very
 

319
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,730
intelligent machines that are very
specialized but they don't they don't

320
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:41,740
specialized but they don't they don't
 

321
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,260
specialized but they don't they don't
really sort of satisfy an objective

322
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:43,270
really sort of satisfy an objective
 

323
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,210
really sort of satisfy an objective
they're just you know kind of trained to

324
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:45,220
they're just you know kind of trained to
 

325
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:49,200
they're just you know kind of trained to
do one thing so until we have some idea

326
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,210
do one thing so until we have some idea
 

327
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,590
do one thing so until we have some idea
for design of a full-fledged autonomous

328
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600
for design of a full-fledged autonomous
 

329
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,090
for design of a full-fledged autonomous
intelligent system asking the question

330
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,100
intelligent system asking the question
 

331
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,890
intelligent system asking the question
of how we design use objective I think

332
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:55,900
of how we design use objective I think
 

333
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,800
of how we design use objective I think
is a little a little too abstract it's a

334
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:58,810
is a little a little too abstract it's a
 

335
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:00,720
is a little a little too abstract it's a
little tough rat there's useful elements

336
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:00,730
little tough rat there's useful elements
 

337
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,290
little tough rat there's useful elements
to it in that it helps us understand our

338
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:04,300
to it in that it helps us understand our
 

339
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,760
to it in that it helps us understand our
own ethical codes humans so even just as

340
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:08,770
own ethical codes humans so even just as
 

341
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,129
own ethical codes humans so even just as
a thought experiment if you imagine that

342
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:11,139
a thought experiment if you imagine that
 

343
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:15,000
a thought experiment if you imagine that
in a GI system is here today how would

344
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,010
in a GI system is here today how would
 

345
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:17,070
in a GI system is here today how would
we program it is a kind of nice thought

346
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,080
we program it is a kind of nice thought
 

347
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,730
we program it is a kind of nice thought
experiment of constructing how should we

348
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:19,740
experiment of constructing how should we
 

349
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,460
experiment of constructing how should we
have a law have a system of laws far as

350
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:23,470
have a law have a system of laws far as
 

351
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,060
have a law have a system of laws far as
humans

352
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,070
humans
 

353
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,210
humans
it's just a nice practical tool and I

354
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:27,220
it's just a nice practical tool and I
 

355
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,430
it's just a nice practical tool and I
think there's echoes of that idea too in

356
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:29,440
think there's echoes of that idea too in
 

357
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,610
think there's echoes of that idea too in
the AI systems left today it don't have

358
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:32,620
the AI systems left today it don't have
 

359
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,719
the AI systems left today it don't have
to be that intelligent

360
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:33,729
to be that intelligent
 

361
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:35,580
to be that intelligent
yeah like autonomous vehicles there's

362
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:35,590
yeah like autonomous vehicles there's
 

363
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,400
yeah like autonomous vehicles there's
these things start creeping in that were

364
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:38,410
these things start creeping in that were
 

365
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,810
these things start creeping in that were
thinking about but certainly they

366
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:39,820
thinking about but certainly they
 

367
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:43,010
thinking about but certainly they
shouldn't be framed as as hell yeah

368
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,020
shouldn't be framed as as hell yeah
 

369
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,100
shouldn't be framed as as hell yeah
looking back what is the most I'm sorry

370
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,110
looking back what is the most I'm sorry
 

371
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,610
looking back what is the most I'm sorry
if it's a silly question but what is the

372
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:50,620
if it's a silly question but what is the
 

373
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,560
if it's a silly question but what is the
most beautiful or surprising idea and

374
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:52,570
most beautiful or surprising idea and
 

375
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,110
most beautiful or surprising idea and
deep learning or AI in general that

376
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,120
deep learning or AI in general that
 

377
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,550
deep learning or AI in general that
you've ever come across sort of

378
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:56,560
you've ever come across sort of
 

379
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,570
you've ever come across sort of
personally well you said back and and

380
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:00,580
personally well you said back and and
 

381
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,340
personally well you said back and and
just had this kind of wow that's pretty

382
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:02,350
just had this kind of wow that's pretty
 

383
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,820
just had this kind of wow that's pretty
cool

384
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:02,830
cool
 

385
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:05,430
cool
moment that's nice well surprising I

386
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:05,440
moment that's nice well surprising I
 

387
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,320
moment that's nice well surprising I
don't know if it's an idea rather than a

don't know if it's an idea rather than a
 

389
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:15,510
don't know if it's an idea rather than a

read in every textbook right every pre

00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:32,610
read in every textbook right every pre
deep learning textbook that told you you

00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:32,620
deep learning textbook that told you you
 

405
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,079
deep learning textbook that told you you
need to have fewer parameters and you

406
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:34,089
need to have fewer parameters and you
 

407
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,350
need to have fewer parameters and you
have data samples you know if you have

00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:37,360
have data samples you know if you have
 

409
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,940
have data samples you know if you have
non-convex objective function you have

no guarantee of convergence you know all
 

413
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,180
no guarantee of convergence you know all
the things that you read in textbook and

00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:42,190
the things that you read in textbook and
 

415
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,469
the things that you read in textbook and
they tell you stay away from this and

416
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:43,479
they tell you stay away from this and
 

417
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:45,750
they tell you stay away from this and
they were all wrong huge number of

418
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:45,760
they were all wrong huge number of
 

419
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,870
they were all wrong huge number of
parameters non-convex and somehow which

anything right does that surprise you

426
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:56,079
anything right does that surprise you
 

427
00:08:56,079 --> 00:09:00,090
anything right does that surprise you
today well it it was kind of obvious to

428
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,100
today well it it was kind of obvious to
 

429
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,579
today well it it was kind of obvious to
me before I knew anything that that's

430
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:02,589
me before I knew anything that that's
 

431
00:09:02,589 --> 00:09:04,410
me before I knew anything that that's
that this is a good idea and then it

432
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,420
that this is a good idea and then it
 

433
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,000
that this is a good idea and then it
became surprising that it worked

434
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,010
became surprising that it worked
 

435
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:07,530
became surprising that it worked
because I started reading those text

436
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:07,540
because I started reading those text
 

437
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:11,730
because I started reading those text
books okay so okay you talk to the

438
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:11,740
books okay so okay you talk to the
 

439
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,500
books okay so okay you talk to the
intuition of why was obviously if you

440
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:13,510
intuition of why was obviously if you
 

441
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,480
intuition of why was obviously if you
remember well okay so the intuition was

442
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,490
remember well okay so the intuition was
 

443
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,490
remember well okay so the intuition was
it's it's sort of like you know those

444
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:17,500
it's it's sort of like you know those
 

445
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,069
it's it's sort of like you know those
people in the late 19th century who

446
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:20,079
people in the late 19th century who
 

447
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,819
people in the late 19th century who
proved that heavier than than air flight

448
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:23,829
proved that heavier than than air flight
 

449
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:25,949
proved that heavier than than air flight
was impossible right and of course you

450
00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:25,959
was impossible right and of course you
 

451
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,519
was impossible right and of course you
have birds right they do fly and so on

452
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:29,529
have birds right they do fly and so on
 

453
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:31,230
have birds right they do fly and so on
the face of it it it's obviously wrong

454
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,240
the face of it it it's obviously wrong
 

455
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,480
the face of it it it's obviously wrong
as an empirical question right and so we

456
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:33,490
as an empirical question right and so we
 

457
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,060
as an empirical question right and so we
have the same kind of thing that you

458
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,070
have the same kind of thing that you
 

459
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,190
have the same kind of thing that you
know the we know that the brain works we

460
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:38,200
know the we know that the brain works we
 

461
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,050
know the we know that the brain works we
don't know how but we know it works and

462
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,060
don't know how but we know it works and
 

463
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,180
don't know how but we know it works and
we know it's a large network of neurons

464
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,190
we know it's a large network of neurons
 

465
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,980
we know it's a large network of neurons
and interaction and the learning takes

466
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:43,990
and interaction and the learning takes
 

467
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,230
and interaction and the learning takes
place by changing the connection so kind

468
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:46,240
place by changing the connection so kind
 

469
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,370
place by changing the connection so kind
of getting this level of inspiration

470
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,380
of getting this level of inspiration
 

471
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,680
of getting this level of inspiration
without copying the details but sort of

472
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:49,690
without copying the details but sort of
 

473
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,110
without copying the details but sort of
trying to derive basic principles

474
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,120

 

475
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,660

you know that kind of gives you a clue

476
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:56,670
you know that kind of gives you a clue
 

477
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,640
you know that kind of gives you a clue
as to which direction to go there's also

478
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:58,650
as to which direction to go there's also
 

479
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,530
as to which direction to go there's also
the idea somehow that I've been

480
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:00,540
the idea somehow that I've been
 

481
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,030
the idea somehow that I've been
convinced of since I was an undergrad

482
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,040
convinced of since I was an undergrad
 

483
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,540
convinced of since I was an undergrad
that even before that intelligence is

484
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:05,550
that even before that intelligence is
 

485
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,450
that even before that intelligence is
inseparable from running so you the idea

486
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:08,460
inseparable from running so you the idea
 

487
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,040
inseparable from running so you the idea
somehow that you can create an

488
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:10,050
somehow that you can create an
 

489
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:12,740
somehow that you can create an
intelligent machine by basically

490
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:12,750
intelligent machine by basically
 

491
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:16,370
intelligent machine by basically
programming for me was a non-starter you

492
00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:16,380
programming for me was a non-starter you
 

493
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,130
programming for me was a non-starter you
know from the start every intelligent

494
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:19,140
know from the start every intelligent
 

495
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,460
know from the start every intelligent
entity that we know about arrives at

496
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,470
entity that we know about arrives at
 

497
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,100
entity that we know about arrives at
this intelligence to learning so

498
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:25,110
this intelligence to learning so
 

499
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,390
this intelligence to learning so
learning you know machine learning was

500
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:26,400
learning you know machine learning was
 

501
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:30,530
learning you know machine learning was
completely obvious path also because I'm

502
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:30,540
completely obvious path also because I'm
 

503
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,700
completely obvious path also because I'm
lazy so you know it's automate basically

504
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:34,710
lazy so you know it's automate basically
 

505
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,750
lazy so you know it's automate basically
everything and learning is the

506
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,760
everything and learning is the
 

507
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,220
everything and learning is the
automation of intelligence right so do

508
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,230
automation of intelligence right so do
 

509
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,160
automation of intelligence right so do
you think so what is learning then what

510
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,170
you think so what is learning then what
 

511
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,800
you think so what is learning then what
what falls under learning because do you

512
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:45,810
what falls under learning because do you
 

513
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:49,460
what falls under learning because do you
think of reasoning is learning where

514
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:49,470
think of reasoning is learning where
 

515
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:52,430
think of reasoning is learning where
reasoning is certainly a consequence of

516
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:52,440
reasoning is certainly a consequence of
 

517
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,010
reasoning is certainly a consequence of
learning as well just like other

518
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,020
learning as well just like other
 

519
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,080
learning as well just like other
functions of of the brain

520
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,090
functions of of the brain
 

521
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,060
functions of of the brain
the big question about reasoning is how

522
00:10:59,060 --> 00:10:59,070
the big question about reasoning is how
 

523
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,640
the big question about reasoning is how
do you make reasoning compatible with

524
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:01,650
do you make reasoning compatible with
 

525
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,740
do you make reasoning compatible with
gradient based learning do you think

526
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:03,750
gradient based learning do you think
 

527
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,390
gradient based learning do you think
neural networks can be made to reason

528
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:05,400
neural networks can be made to reason
 

529
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,970
neural networks can be made to reason
yes that there's no question about that

530
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:06,980
yes that there's no question about that
 

531
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:11,150
yes that there's no question about that
again we have a good example right the

532
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,160
again we have a good example right the
 

533
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,980
again we have a good example right the
question is is how so the question is

534
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:12,990
question is is how so the question is
 

535
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:15,320
question is is how so the question is
how much prior structure you have to put

536
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,330
how much prior structure you have to put
 

537
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,600
how much prior structure you have to put
in the neural net so that something like

538
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:17,610
in the neural net so that something like
 

539
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,700
in the neural net so that something like
human reasoning will emerge from it you

540
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:19,710
human reasoning will emerge from it you
 

541
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,520
human reasoning will emerge from it you
know from running another question is

542
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:22,530
know from running another question is
 

543
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:25,550
know from running another question is
all of our kind of model of what

544
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:25,560
all of our kind of model of what
 

545
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,640
all of our kind of model of what
reasoning is that are based on logic are

546
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:27,650
reasoning is that are based on logic are
 

547
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,950
reasoning is that are based on logic are
discrete and and and are therefore

548
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:30,960
discrete and and and are therefore
 

549
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,300
discrete and and and are therefore
incompatible with gradient based

550
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:32,310
incompatible with gradient based
 

551
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:34,610
incompatible with gradient based
learning and I was very strong believer

552
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:34,620
learning and I was very strong believer
 

553
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,740
learning and I was very strong believer
in this idea Grandin baserunning I don't

554
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:36,750
in this idea Grandin baserunning I don't
 

555
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,710
in this idea Grandin baserunning I don't
believe that other types of learning

556
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:39,720
believe that other types of learning
 

557
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,360
believe that other types of learning
that don't use kind of gradient

558
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:41,370
that don't use kind of gradient
 

559
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,950
that don't use kind of gradient

like discrete mathematics you don't like

562
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:44,400
like discrete mathematics you don't like
 

563
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,320
like discrete mathematics you don't like
anything discrete

anything discrete
 

565
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,270
anything discrete
well that's it's not that I don't like

566
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:47,280
well that's it's not that I don't like
 

567
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,100
well that's it's not that I don't like
it it's just that it's it's incompatible

568
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,110
it it's just that it's it's incompatible
 

569
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,170
it it's just that it's it's incompatible
with learning and I'm a big fan of

570
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:51,180
with learning and I'm a big fan of
 

571
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,300
with learning and I'm a big fan of
running right so in fact that's perhaps

572
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,310
running right so in fact that's perhaps
 

573
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,840
running right so in fact that's perhaps
one reason why deep learning has been

00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:56,850
one reason why deep learning has been

kind of looked at with suspicion by a
 

577
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,570
kind of looked at with suspicion by a
lot of computer scientists because the

578
00:11:59,570 --> 00:11:59,580
lot of computer scientists because the
 

579
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,060
lot of computer scientists because the
math is very different the method you

math is very different the method you
 

581
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,740
math is very different the method you
use for deep running you know we kind of

582
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:03,750
use for deep running you know we kind of
 

583
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:07,490

00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:37,860
okay maybe let's feel around in the dark
 

609
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,819
okay maybe let's feel around in the dark
of what is a neural network that reasons

look like if yeah maybe

626
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:06,930
look like if yeah maybe
 

627
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,019
look like if yeah maybe
do you have Inklings of thoughts of what

628
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:09,029
do you have Inklings of thoughts of what
 

629
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:11,480
do you have Inklings of thoughts of what
that might look like well yeah I mean

630
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:11,490
that might look like well yeah I mean
 

631
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,910
that might look like well yeah I mean
yes or no if I had precise ideas about

632
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:13,920
yes or no if I had precise ideas about
 

633
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,129
yes or no if I had precise ideas about
this I think you know we'd be building

634
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:16,139
this I think you know we'd be building
 

635
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:17,840
this I think you know we'd be building
it right now but and there are people

636
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:17,850
it right now but and there are people
 

637
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,269
it right now but and there are people
working on this or whose main research

638
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:20,279
working on this or whose main research
 

639
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,129
working on this or whose main research
interest is actually exactly that right

640
00:13:22,129 --> 00:13:22,139
interest is actually exactly that right
 

641
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:24,860
interest is actually exactly that right
so what you need to have is a working

642
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:24,870
so what you need to have is a working
 

643
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,519
so what you need to have is a working
memory so you need to have some device

644
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:28,529
memory so you need to have some device
 

645
00:13:28,529 --> 00:13:31,460
memory so you need to have some device
if you want some subsystem they can

646
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:31,470
if you want some subsystem they can
 

647
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:34,490
if you want some subsystem they can
store a relatively large number of

648
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:34,500
store a relatively large number of
 

649
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,629
store a relatively large number of
factual episodic information for you

650
00:13:38,629 --> 00:13:38,639
factual episodic information for you
 

651
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,870
factual episodic information for you
know a reasonable amount of time so you

652
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:41,880
know a reasonable amount of time so you
 

653
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,639
know a reasonable amount of time so you
you know in the in the brain for example

654
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:43,649
you know in the in the brain for example
 

655
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:45,559
you know in the in the brain for example
it kind of three main types of memory

656
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:45,569
it kind of three main types of memory
 

657
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:50,929
it kind of three main types of memory
one is the sort of memory of the the

658
00:13:50,929 --> 00:13:50,939
one is the sort of memory of the the
 

659
00:13:50,939 --> 00:13:54,410
one is the sort of memory of the the
state of your cortex and that sort of

660
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:54,420
state of your cortex and that sort of
 

661
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,210
state of your cortex and that sort of
disappears within 20 seconds you can't

662
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:56,220
disappears within 20 seconds you can't
 

663
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,829
disappears within 20 seconds you can't
remember things for more than about 20

664
00:13:57,829 --> 00:13:57,839
remember things for more than about 20
 

665
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,439
remember things for more than about 20
seconds or a minute if if you don't have

666
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:00,449
seconds or a minute if if you don't have
 

667
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,960
seconds or a minute if if you don't have
any other form of memory the second type

668
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:02,970
any other form of memory the second type
 

669
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,910
any other form of memory the second type
of memory which is longer term is short

670
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:04,920
of memory which is longer term is short
 

671
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,340
of memory which is longer term is short
term is the hippocampus so you can you

672
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,350
term is the hippocampus so you can you
 

673
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,449
term is the hippocampus so you can you
know you came into this building you

674
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:08,459
know you came into this building you
 

675
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,850
know you came into this building you
remember whether where the the exit is

676
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:10,860
remember whether where the the exit is
 

677
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,629
remember whether where the the exit is
where the elevators are you have some

678
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:14,639
where the elevators are you have some
 

679
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,100
where the elevators are you have some
map of that building that's stored in

680
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:16,110
map of that building that's stored in
 

681
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,379
map of that building that's stored in
your hippocampus you might remember

682
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:18,389
your hippocampus you might remember
 

683
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,569
your hippocampus you might remember
something about what I said you know if

684
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:20,579
something about what I said you know if
 

685
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:20,690
something about what I said you know if
you

686
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:20,700
you
 

687
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,880
you
minutes ago and forgot all our stars

688
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:22,890
minutes ago and forgot all our stars
 

689
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,070
minutes ago and forgot all our stars
being raised but you know but that does

690
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:25,080
being raised but you know but that does
 

691
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,800
being raised but you know but that does
not work in your hippocampus and then

692
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:27,810
not work in your hippocampus and then
 

693
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,570
not work in your hippocampus and then
the the longer term memory is in the

694
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:29,580
the the longer term memory is in the
 

695
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,260
the the longer term memory is in the
synapse the synapses right so what you

696
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,270
synapse the synapses right so what you
 

697
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,790
synapse the synapses right so what you
need if you want for a system that's

698
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:34,800
need if you want for a system that's
 

699
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,380
need if you want for a system that's
capable reasoning is that you want the

700
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:36,390
capable reasoning is that you want the
 

701
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:40,490
capable reasoning is that you want the
hippocampus like thing right and that's

702
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:40,500
hippocampus like thing right and that's
 

703
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,170
hippocampus like thing right and that's
what people have tried to do with memory

704
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:42,180
what people have tried to do with memory
 

705
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,390
what people have tried to do with memory
networks and you know no Turing machines

706
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,400
networks and you know no Turing machines
 

707
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,190
networks and you know no Turing machines
and stuff like that right and and now

708
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:46,200
and stuff like that right and and now
 

709
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,940
and stuff like that right and and now
with transformers which have sort of a

710
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:48,950
with transformers which have sort of a
 

711
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:51,350
with transformers which have sort of a
memory in their kind of self attention

712
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,360
memory in their kind of self attention
 

713
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,910
memory in their kind of self attention
system you can you can think of it this

714
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:52,920
system you can you can think of it this
 

715
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,870
system you can you can think of it this
way so so that's one element you need

716
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:56,880
way so so that's one element you need
 

717
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,180
way so so that's one element you need
another thing you need is some sort of

718
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,190
another thing you need is some sort of
 

719
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:05,210
another thing you need is some sort of
network that can access this memory get

720
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:05,220
network that can access this memory get
 

721
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,520
network that can access this memory get
an information back and then kind of

722
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:07,530
an information back and then kind of
 

723
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,500
an information back and then kind of
crunch on it and then do this

724
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:09,510
crunch on it and then do this
 

725
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,150
crunch on it and then do this
iteratively multiple times because a

726
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:11,160
iteratively multiple times because a
 

727
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:16,010
iteratively multiple times because a
chain of reasoning is a process by which

728
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,020
chain of reasoning is a process by which
 

729
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,620
chain of reasoning is a process by which
you you you can you update your

730
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:18,630
you you you can you update your
 

731
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,240
you you you can you update your
knowledge about the state of the world

732
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,250
knowledge about the state of the world
 

733
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,370
knowledge about the state of the world
about you know what's gonna happen etc

734
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:22,380
about you know what's gonna happen etc
 

735
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,790
about you know what's gonna happen etc
and that there has to be this sort of

736
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:24,800
and that there has to be this sort of
 

737
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,440
and that there has to be this sort of
recurrent operation basically and you

738
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:27,450
recurrent operation basically and you
 

739
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,900
recurrent operation basically and you
think that kind of if we think about a

740
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:29,910
think that kind of if we think about a
 

741
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,150
think that kind of if we think about a
transformer so that seems to be too

742
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,160
transformer so that seems to be too
 

743
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,070
transformer so that seems to be too
small to contain the knowledge that's

744
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,080
small to contain the knowledge that's
 

745
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,310
small to contain the knowledge that's
that's to represent the knowledge as

746
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:37,320
that's to represent the knowledge as
 

747
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,290
that's to represent the knowledge as
containing Wikipedia for example but

748
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,300
containing Wikipedia for example but
 

749
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,930
containing Wikipedia for example but
transformer doesn't have this idea of

750
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:40,940
transformer doesn't have this idea of
 

751
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,650
transformer doesn't have this idea of
recurrence it's got a fixed number of

752
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:42,660
recurrence it's got a fixed number of
 

753
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:44,060
recurrence it's got a fixed number of
layers and that's number of steps that

754
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,070
layers and that's number of steps that
 

755
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,250
layers and that's number of steps that
you know limits basically it's a

756
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:46,260
you know limits basically it's a
 

757
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,020
you know limits basically it's a
representation but recurrence would

758
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,030
representation but recurrence would
 

759
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,440
representation but recurrence would
build on the knowledge somehow I mean

760
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:51,450
build on the knowledge somehow I mean
 

761
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,880
build on the knowledge somehow I mean
yeah it would evolve the knowledge and

762
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:54,890
yeah it would evolve the knowledge and
 

763
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,950
yeah it would evolve the knowledge and
expand the amount of information perhaps

764
00:15:57,950 --> 00:15:57,960
expand the amount of information perhaps
 

765
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,330
expand the amount of information perhaps
or useful information within that

766
00:15:59,330 --> 00:15:59,340
or useful information within that
 

767
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,240
or useful information within that
knowledge yeah but is this something

768
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:02,250
knowledge yeah but is this something
 

769
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,910
knowledge yeah but is this something
that just can emerge with size because

770
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:04,920
that just can emerge with size because
 

771
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,230
that just can emerge with size because
it seems like everything we have now is

772
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:06,240
it seems like everything we have now is
 

773
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,780
it seems like everything we have now is
just no it's not it's not it's not clear

774
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:08,790
just no it's not it's not it's not clear
 

775
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:11,450
just no it's not it's not it's not clear
how you access and right into an

776
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:11,460
how you access and right into an
 

777
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,490
how you access and right into an
associative memory in efficient way I

778
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:13,500
associative memory in efficient way I
 

779
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,110
associative memory in efficient way I
mean sort of the original memory network

780
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:15,120
mean sort of the original memory network
 

781
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,850
mean sort of the original memory network
maybe had something like the right

782
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:16,860
maybe had something like the right
 

783
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,550
maybe had something like the right
architecture but if you try to scale up

784
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:19,560
architecture but if you try to scale up
 

785
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,380
architecture but if you try to scale up
a memory network so that the memory

786
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:21,390
a memory network so that the memory
 

787
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,420
a memory network so that the memory
contains all we keep here it doesn't

788
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,430
contains all we keep here it doesn't
 

789
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:26,600
contains all we keep here it doesn't
quite work right so so this is a need

790
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:26,610
quite work right so so this is a need
 

791
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:29,000
quite work right so so this is a need
for new ideas there okay but it's not

792
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,010
for new ideas there okay but it's not
 

793
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,290
for new ideas there okay but it's not
the only form of reasoning so there's

794
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:30,300
the only form of reasoning so there's
 

795
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,030
the only form of reasoning so there's
another form of reasoning which is true

796
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:32,040
another form of reasoning which is true
 

797
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,640
another form of reasoning which is true
which is very classical so in

798
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:34,650
which is very classical so in
 

799
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:39,410
which is very classical so in
some types of AI and it's based on let's

800
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:39,420
some types of AI and it's based on let's
 

801
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,390
some types of AI and it's based on let's
call it energy minimization okay so you

802
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:41,400
call it energy minimization okay so you
 

803
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,440
call it energy minimization okay so you
have some sort of objective some energy

804
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:45,450
have some sort of objective some energy
 

805
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:50,030
have some sort of objective some energy
function that represents the the the

806
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,040
function that represents the the the
 

807
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,150
function that represents the the the
quality or the negative quality okay

808
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:53,160
quality or the negative quality okay
 

809
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,800
quality or the negative quality okay
energy goes up when things get bad and

810
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:54,810
energy goes up when things get bad and
 

811
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,410
energy goes up when things get bad and
they get low when things get good so

812
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:57,420
they get low when things get good so
 

813
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,050
they get low when things get good so
let's say you you want to figure out you

814
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:00,060
let's say you you want to figure out you
 

815
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,210
let's say you you want to figure out you
know what gestures do I need to to do to

816
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:04,220
know what gestures do I need to to do to
 

817
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:08,180
know what gestures do I need to to do to
grab an object or walk out the door if

818
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,190
grab an object or walk out the door if
 

819
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,190
grab an object or walk out the door if
you have a good model of your own body a

820
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:10,200
you have a good model of your own body a
 

821
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,950
you have a good model of your own body a
good model of the environment using this

822
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:12,960
good model of the environment using this
 

823
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,630
good model of the environment using this
kind of energy minimization you can make

824
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:14,640
kind of energy minimization you can make
 

825
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,760
kind of energy minimization you can make
a you can make you can do planning and

826
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:16,770
a you can make you can do planning and
 

827
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:20,300
a you can make you can do planning and
it's in optimal control it's called it's

828
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:20,310
it's in optimal control it's called it's
 

829
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,740
it's in optimal control it's called it's
called Marie put model predictive

830
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:21,750
called Marie put model predictive
 

831
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,450
called Marie put model predictive
control you have a model of what's gonna

832
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:23,460
control you have a model of what's gonna
 

833
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,680
control you have a model of what's gonna
happen in the world as consequence for

834
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:24,690
happen in the world as consequence for
 

835
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:27,470
happen in the world as consequence for
your actions and that allows you to buy

836
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:27,480
your actions and that allows you to buy
 

837
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,060
your actions and that allows you to buy
energy minimization figure out the

838
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,070
energy minimization figure out the
 

839
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,440
energy minimization figure out the
sequence of action that optimizes a

840
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,450
sequence of action that optimizes a
 

841
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,210
sequence of action that optimizes a
particular objective function which

842
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:32,220
particular objective function which
 

843
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,890
particular objective function which
measures you know minimize the number of

844
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:33,900
measures you know minimize the number of
 

845
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,660
measures you know minimize the number of
times you're gonna hit something and the

846
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:35,670
times you're gonna hit something and the
 

847
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,670
times you're gonna hit something and the
energy gonna spend doing the gesture and

848
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:37,680
energy gonna spend doing the gesture and
 

849
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,230
energy gonna spend doing the gesture and
etc so so that's performer reasoning

850
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:42,240
etc so so that's performer reasoning
 

851
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,580
etc so so that's performer reasoning
planning is a form of reasoning and

852
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:43,590
planning is a form of reasoning and
 

853
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,460
planning is a form of reasoning and
perhaps what led to the ability of

854
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:46,470
perhaps what led to the ability of
 

855
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,540
perhaps what led to the ability of
humans to reason is the fact that or you

856
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:50,550
humans to reason is the fact that or you
 

857
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:53,060
humans to reason is the fact that or you
know species you know that appear before

858
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:53,070
know species you know that appear before
 

859
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,280
know species you know that appear before
us had to do some sort of planning to be

860
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,290
us had to do some sort of planning to be
 

861
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:58,580
us had to do some sort of planning to be
able to hunt and survive and survive the

862
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:58,590
able to hunt and survive and survive the
 

863
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:00,560
able to hunt and survive and survive the
winter in particular and so you know

864
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,570
winter in particular and so you know
 

865
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:02,330
winter in particular and so you know
it's the same capacity that you need to

866
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:02,340
it's the same capacity that you need to
 

867
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:07,910
it's the same capacity that you need to
have so in your intuition is if you look

868
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:07,920
have so in your intuition is if you look
 

869
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,030
have so in your intuition is if you look
at expert systems in encoding knowledge

870
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:11,040
at expert systems in encoding knowledge
 

871
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,530
at expert systems in encoding knowledge
as logic systems as graphs in this kind

872
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:15,540
as logic systems as graphs in this kind
 

873
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:18,740
as logic systems as graphs in this kind
of way is not a useful way to think

874
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:18,750
of way is not a useful way to think
 

875
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,320
of way is not a useful way to think
about knowledge graphs are your brittle

876
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:21,330
about knowledge graphs are your brittle
 

877
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:24,680
about knowledge graphs are your brittle
or logic representation so basically you

878
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:24,690
or logic representation so basically you
 

879
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:27,710
or logic representation so basically you
know variables that that have values and

880
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:27,720
know variables that that have values and
 

881
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,480
know variables that that have values and
constraint between them that are

882
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:29,490
constraint between them that are
 

883
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:32,000
constraint between them that are
represented by rules as well too rigid

884
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,010
represented by rules as well too rigid
 

885
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,830
represented by rules as well too rigid
and too brittle right so one of the you

886
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:33,840
and too brittle right so one of the you
 

887
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,930
and too brittle right so one of the you
know some of the early efforts in that

888
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:35,940
know some of the early efforts in that
 

889
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,700
know some of the early efforts in that
respect were were to put probabilities

890
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:40,710
respect were were to put probabilities
 

891
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:43,130
respect were were to put probabilities
on them so a rule you know you know if

892
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:43,140
on them so a rule you know you know if
 

893
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,480
on them so a rule you know you know if
you have this in that symptom you know

894
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:44,490
you have this in that symptom you know
 

895
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,490
you have this in that symptom you know
you have this disease with that

896
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:46,500
you have this disease with that
 

897
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,750
you have this disease with that
probability and you should

898
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:47,760
probability and you should
 

899
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,640
probability and you should
describe that antibiotic with that

00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:49,650
describe that antibiotic with that
 

901
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:51,680
describe that antibiotic with that
probability right this my sin system

905
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,490
from the for the 70s and that that's
what that branch of AI led to you know

906
00:18:58,490 --> 00:18:58,500
what that branch of AI led to you know
 

907
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,850
what that branch of AI led to you know
busy networks in graphical models and

impractical yeah the question the second
 

929
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,030

question is do you want to represent

930
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:32,040
question is do you want to represent
 

931
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:35,480
question is do you want to represent
knowledge symbols and you want to

knowledge symbols and you want to
 

933
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,520

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43,260
one suggestion with geoff hinton has
 

939
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,110
one suggestion with geoff hinton has
been advocating for many decades is

940
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:45,120
been advocating for many decades is
 

941
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,760
been advocating for many decades is
replace symbols by vectors think of it

942
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:49,770
replace symbols by vectors think of it
 

943
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:51,760
replace symbols by vectors think of it
as pattern of activities in a bunch of

944
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:51,770
as pattern of activities in a bunch of
 

945
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,810
as pattern of activities in a bunch of

946
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:53,820
neurons or units or whatever you wanna
 

947
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,130
neurons or units or whatever you wanna
call them and replace logic by

948
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:57,140
call them and replace logic by
 

949
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,810
call them and replace logic by
continuous functions okay

950
00:19:59,810 --> 00:19:59,820
continuous functions okay
 

951
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,910
continuous functions okay
and that becomes now compatible there's

952
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:01,920
and that becomes now compatible there's
 

953
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,440
and that becomes now compatible there's
a very good set of ideas by region in a

954
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:06,450
a very good set of ideas by region in a
 

955
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:08,630
a very good set of ideas by region in a
paper about 10 years ago by leon go to

956
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:08,640
paper about 10 years ago by leon go to
 

957
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,670
paper about 10 years ago by leon go to
on who is here at face book the title of

958
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:13,680
on who is here at face book the title of
 

959
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,110
on who is here at face book the title of
the paper is for machine learning to

960
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:15,120
the paper is for machine learning to
 

961
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,410
the paper is for machine learning to
machine reasoning and his idea is that

962
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:17,420
machine reasoning and his idea is that
 

963
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,790
machine reasoning and his idea is that
learning learning system should be able

964
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:19,800
learning learning system should be able
 

965
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,920
learning learning system should be able
to manipulate objects that are in the

966
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:21,930
to manipulate objects that are in the
 

967
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,780
to manipulate objects that are in the
same space in a space and then put the

968
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:23,790
same space in a space and then put the
 

969
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,190
same space in a space and then put the
result back in the same space so is this

970
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:25,200
result back in the same space so is this
 

971
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,710
result back in the same space so is this
idea of working memory basically and

972
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:27,720
idea of working memory basically and
 

973
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,040
idea of working memory basically and
it's a very enlightening and in the

974
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,050
it's a very enlightening and in the
 

975
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,920
it's a very enlightening and in the
sense that might learn something like

976
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:33,930
sense that might learn something like
 

977
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,620
sense that might learn something like
the simple expert systems

978
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:36,630
the simple expert systems
 

979
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,310
the simple expert systems
I mean it's with you can learn basic

980
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,320
I mean it's with you can learn basic
 

981
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,470
I mean it's with you can learn basic
logic operations there yeah quite

982
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:42,480
logic operations there yeah quite
 

983
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,120
logic operations there yeah quite
possibly yeah this is a big debate on

984
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:44,130
possibly yeah this is a big debate on
 

985
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,730
possibly yeah this is a big debate on
sort of how much prior structure you

986
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:46,740
sort of how much prior structure you
 

987
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,080
sort of how much prior structure you
have to put in for this kind of stuff to

988
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:48,090
have to put in for this kind of stuff to
 

989
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:50,030
have to put in for this kind of stuff to
emerge that's the debate I have with

990
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:50,040
emerge that's the debate I have with
 

991
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,730
emerge that's the debate I have with
Gary Marcus and people like that yeah

992
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:51,740
Gary Marcus and people like that yeah
 

993
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,730
Gary Marcus and people like that yeah
yeah so and the other person so I just

994
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:55,740
yeah so and the other person so I just
 

995
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:57,770
yeah so and the other person so I just
talked to judea pearl mm-hmm well you

996
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:57,780
talked to judea pearl mm-hmm well you
 

997
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,350
talked to judea pearl mm-hmm well you
mentioned causal inference world

998
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:00,360
mentioned causal inference world
 

999
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,530
mentioned causal inference world
his worry is that the current knew all

1000
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:03,540
his worry is that the current knew all
 

1001
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,200
his worry is that the current knew all
networks are not able to learn what

1002
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:08,210
networks are not able to learn what
 

1003
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,720
networks are not able to learn what
causes what causal inference between

1004
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:11,730
causes what causal inference between
 

1005
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,720
causes what causal inference between
things so I think I think he's right and

1006
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:14,730
things so I think I think he's right and
 

1007
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,400
things so I think I think he's right and
wrong about this if he's talking about

1008
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:16,410
wrong about this if he's talking about
 

1009
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:20,990
wrong about this if he's talking about
the sort of classic type of neural nets

1010
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:21,000
the sort of classic type of neural nets
 

1011
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,940
the sort of classic type of neural nets
people also didn't worry too much about

1012
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:22,950
people also didn't worry too much about
 

1013
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,680
people also didn't worry too much about
this but there's a lot of people now

1014
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:24,690
this but there's a lot of people now
 

1015
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,390
this but there's a lot of people now
working on causal inference and there's

1016
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:26,400
working on causal inference and there's
 

1017
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,980
working on causal inference and there's
a paper that just came out last week by

1018
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:27,990
a paper that just came out last week by
 

1019
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,780
a paper that just came out last week by
Leon Mbutu among others develop his path

1020
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:29,790
Leon Mbutu among others develop his path
 

1021
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,659
Leon Mbutu among others develop his path
and push for other people exactly on

1022
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:32,669
and push for other people exactly on
 

1023
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:36,740
and push for other people exactly on
that problem of how do you kind of you

1024
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:36,750
that problem of how do you kind of you
 

1025
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,330
that problem of how do you kind of you
know get a neural net to sort of pay

1026
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:38,340
know get a neural net to sort of pay
 

1027
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,970
know get a neural net to sort of pay
attention to real causal relationships

1028
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:40,980
attention to real causal relationships
 

1029
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,230
attention to real causal relationships
which may also solve issues of bias in

1030
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:45,240
which may also solve issues of bias in
 

1031
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,530
which may also solve issues of bias in
data and things like this so I'd like to

1032
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:48,540
data and things like this so I'd like to
 

1033
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,049
data and things like this so I'd like to
read that paper because that ultimately

1034
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:51,059
read that paper because that ultimately
 

1035
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:54,530
read that paper because that ultimately
the challenges also seems to fall back

1036
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:54,540
the challenges also seems to fall back
 

1037
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:58,789
the challenges also seems to fall back
on the human expert to ultimately decide

1038
00:21:58,789 --> 00:21:58,799
on the human expert to ultimately decide
 

1039
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,270
on the human expert to ultimately decide
causality between things people are not

1040
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:02,280
causality between things people are not
 

1041
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,620
causality between things people are not
very good at its direction causality

1042
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:03,630
very good at its direction causality
 

1043
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,900
very good at its direction causality
first of all so first of all you talk to

1044
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:05,910
first of all so first of all you talk to
 

1045
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,640
first of all so first of all you talk to
a physicist and physicists actually

1046
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:07,650
a physicist and physicists actually
 

1047
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,350
a physicist and physicists actually
don't believe in causality because look

1048
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,360
don't believe in causality because look
 

1049
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,140
don't believe in causality because look
at the all the busy clause or

1050
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,150
at the all the busy clause or
 

1051
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,120
at the all the busy clause or
microphysics are time reversible so

1052
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,130
microphysics are time reversible so
 

1053
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:16,070
microphysics are time reversible so
there is no causality the arrow of time

1054
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,080
there is no causality the arrow of time
 

1055
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,960
there is no causality the arrow of time
is not right yeah it's it's as soon as

1056
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:17,970
is not right yeah it's it's as soon as
 

1057
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:20,240
is not right yeah it's it's as soon as
you start looking at macroscopic systems

1058
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:20,250
you start looking at macroscopic systems
 

1059
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,070
you start looking at macroscopic systems
where there is unpredictable randomness

1060
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:22,080
where there is unpredictable randomness
 

1061
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,280
where there is unpredictable randomness
where there is clearly an arrow of time

1062
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,290
where there is clearly an arrow of time
 

1063
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,570
where there is clearly an arrow of time
but it's a big mystery in physics

1064
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:26,580
but it's a big mystery in physics
 

1065
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,240
but it's a big mystery in physics
actually well how that emerges is that

1066
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:29,250
actually well how that emerges is that
 

1067
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,909
actually well how that emerges is that
emergent or is it part of the

1068
00:22:31,909 --> 00:22:31,919
emergent or is it part of the
 

1069
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,580
emergent or is it part of the
fundamental fabric of reality yeah or is

1070
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:34,590
fundamental fabric of reality yeah or is
 

1071
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,310
fundamental fabric of reality yeah or is
it bias of intelligent systems that you

1072
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:37,320
it bias of intelligent systems that you
 

1073
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,450
it bias of intelligent systems that you
know because of the second law of

1074
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:38,460
know because of the second law of
 

1075
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,669
know because of the second law of
thermodynamics we perceive a particular

1076
00:22:40,669 --> 00:22:40,679
thermodynamics we perceive a particular
 

1077
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:43,640
thermodynamics we perceive a particular
arrow of time but in fact it's kind of

1078
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:43,650
arrow of time but in fact it's kind of
 

1079
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,980
arrow of time but in fact it's kind of
arbitrary right so yeah physicists

1080
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:45,990
arbitrary right so yeah physicists
 

1081
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,990
arbitrary right so yeah physicists
mathematicians they don't care about I

1082
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:48,000
mathematicians they don't care about I
 

1083
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,480
mathematicians they don't care about I
mean the math doesn't care about the

1084
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:50,490
mean the math doesn't care about the
 

1085
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,280
mean the math doesn't care about the
flow of time well certainly certainly

1086
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,290
flow of time well certainly certainly
 

1087
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,650
flow of time well certainly certainly
macro physics doesn't people themselves

1088
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:54,660
macro physics doesn't people themselves
 

1089
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,350
macro physics doesn't people themselves
are not very good at establishing causal

1090
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,360
are not very good at establishing causal
 

1091
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,470
are not very good at establishing causal
causal relationships if you ask is I

1092
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:00,480
causal relationships if you ask is I
 

1093
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,270
causal relationships if you ask is I
think it was in one of Seymour Papert

1094
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:02,280
think it was in one of Seymour Papert
 

1095
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:06,680
think it was in one of Seymour Papert
spoken on like children learning you

1096
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:06,690
spoken on like children learning you
 

1097
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,970
spoken on like children learning you
know he studied with Jean Piaget you

1098
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:07,980
know he studied with Jean Piaget you
 

1099
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,850
know he studied with Jean Piaget you
know he's the guy who co-authored the

1100
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:10,860
know he's the guy who co-authored the
 

1101
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,409
know he's the guy who co-authored the
book perceptron with Marvin Minsky that

1102
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:12,419
book perceptron with Marvin Minsky that
 

1103
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,769
book perceptron with Marvin Minsky that
kind of killed the first wave

1104
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:13,779
kind of killed the first wave
 

1105
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:16,859
kind of killed the first wave
but but he was actually a learning

1106
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:16,869
but but he was actually a learning
 

1107
00:23:16,869 --> 00:23:20,099
but but he was actually a learning
person he in the sense of studying

1108
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:20,109
person he in the sense of studying
 

1109
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:22,109
person he in the sense of studying

what he got interested in for scepter on

1112
00:23:23,339 --> 00:23:23,349
what he got interested in for scepter on
 

1113
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:27,869
what he got interested in for scepter on
and he wrote that if you ask a little

1114
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:27,879
and he wrote that if you ask a little
 

1115
00:23:27,879 --> 00:23:32,310
and he wrote that if you ask a little
kid about what is the cause of the wind

1116
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:32,320
kid about what is the cause of the wind
 

1117
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,399
kid about what is the cause of the wind
a lot of kids will say they will think

1118
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:35,409
a lot of kids will say they will think
 

1119
00:23:35,409 --> 00:23:36,899
a lot of kids will say they will think
for a while and they'll say oh it's the

1120
00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:36,909
for a while and they'll say oh it's the
 

1121
00:23:36,909 --> 00:23:38,759
for a while and they'll say oh it's the
the branches in the trees they move and

1122
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:38,769
the branches in the trees they move and
 

1123
00:23:38,769 --> 00:23:40,619
the branches in the trees they move and
that creates wind right so they get the

1124
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:40,629
that creates wind right so they get the
 

1125
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,839
that creates wind right so they get the
causal relationship backwards and it's

1126
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:42,849
causal relationship backwards and it's
 

1127
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:44,399
causal relationship backwards and it's
because their understanding of the world

1128

because their understanding of the world

and intuitive physics is not that great
 

1131
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:47,219

right I mean these are like you know

00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:47,229
right I mean these are like you know
 

1133
00:23:47,229 --> 00:23:50,159
right I mean these are like you know
four or five year old kids you know it

gets better and then you understand that
 

1137
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:54,419
gets better and then you understand that
this it can't be right but there are

00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:54,429
this it can't be right but there are
 

1139
00:23:54,429 --> 00:23:58,139
this it can't be right but there are
many things which we can because of our

there's a lot of stuff that we can

1247
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:17,240
had to write it in Fortran or C or
something like this right so you would

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,110
something like this right so you would

1251
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,690

00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,370
because you didn't have any other data
 

1265
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,640
because you didn't have any other data
set to try it on and of course you know

1266
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:32,650
set to try it on and of course you know
 

1267
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,610
set to try it on and of course you know
it works half the time so we'd say you

1268
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:34,620
it works half the time so we'd say you
 

1269
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,800
it works half the time so we'd say you
give up also 22 the batch gradient which

1270
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:37,810
give up also 22 the batch gradient which
 

1271
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,890
give up also 22 the batch gradient which
you know isn't it sufficient so there's

1272
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:40,900
you know isn't it sufficient so there's
 

1273
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,680
you know isn't it sufficient so there's
a lot of bag of tricks that you had to

1274
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:43,690
a lot of bag of tricks that you had to
 

1275
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,120
a lot of bag of tricks that you had to
know to make those things work or you

1276
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,130
know to make those things work or you
 

1277
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:47,760
know to make those things work or you
had to reinvent and a lot of people just

1278
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:47,770
had to reinvent and a lot of people just
 

1279
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,140
had to reinvent and a lot of people just
didn't and they just couldn't make it

1280
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:49,150
didn't and they just couldn't make it
 

1281
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:53,250
didn't and they just couldn't make it
work so that's one thing the investment

1282
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:53,260
work so that's one thing the investment
 

1283
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,640
work so that's one thing the investment
in software platform to be able to kind

1284
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:56,650
in software platform to be able to kind
 

1285
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,470
in software platform to be able to kind
of you know display things figure out

1286
00:26:58,470 --> 00:26:58,480
of you know display things figure out
 

1287
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,000
of you know display things figure out
why things don't work and I get a good

1288
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,010
why things don't work and I get a good
 

1289
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,650
why things don't work and I get a good

1290
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:01,660
intuition for how to get them to work
 

1291
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,510
intuition for how to get them to work
have enough flexibility so you can

1292
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:03,520
have enough flexibility so you can
 

1293
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,430
have enough flexibility so you can
create you know network architectures

1294
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:05,440
create you know network architectures
 

1295
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,400
create you know network architectures
well completion ads and stuff like that

1296
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:07,410
well completion ads and stuff like that
 

1297
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,660
well completion ads and stuff like that
it was hard yeah when you had to write

1298
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:09,670
it was hard yeah when you had to write
 

1299
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,950
it was hard yeah when you had to write
everything from scratch and again you

1300
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:10,960
everything from scratch and again you
 

1301
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,270
everything from scratch and again you
didn't have any Python or MATLAB or

1302
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,280
didn't have any Python or MATLAB or
 

1303
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,090
didn't have any Python or MATLAB or
anything right so what I read that sorry

1321
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,760
favorite language but it's not that we
programmed in Lisp it's that we had to

1322
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:35,770
programmed in Lisp it's that we had to
 

1323
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:38,280
programmed in Lisp it's that we had to
write or this printer printer okay cuz

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:38,290
write or this printer printer okay cuz
 

1325

existed so
 

1329
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,720
existed so
we wrote a lisp interpreter that we

1330
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:42,730
we wrote a lisp interpreter that we
 

1331
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,630
we wrote a lisp interpreter that we
hooked up to you know back in library

1332
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:45,640
hooked up to you know back in library

that we wrote also for neural net

1334
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:47,770
that we wrote also for neural net
 

1335
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,010
that we wrote also for neural net
competition and then after a few years

1336
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:50,020
competition and then after a few years
 

1337
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,370
competition and then after a few years
around 1991 we invented this idea of

1338
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:52,380
around 1991 we invented this idea of
 

1339
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:55,260
around 1991 we invented this idea of
basically having modules that know how

1340
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:55,270
basically having modules that know how
 

1341
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,940
basically having modules that know how
to forward propagate and back propagate

1342
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:56,950
to forward propagate and back propagate
 

1343
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,799
to forward propagate and back propagate
gradients and then interconnecting those

1344
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:58,809

modules in a graph loom but who had made

1346
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:02,380
modules in a graph loom but who had made
 

1347
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,410
modules in a graph loom but who had made
proposals on this about this in the late

1348
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:04,420
proposals on this about this in the late
 

1349
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:06,360
proposals on this about this in the late
80s and were able to implement this

1350
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,370
80s and were able to implement this
 

1351
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,880
80s and were able to implement this
using all this system eventually we

1352
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:08,890
using all this system eventually we
 

1353
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:12,030
using all this system eventually we
wanted to use that system to make build

1354
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,040
wanted to use that system to make build
 

1355
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,470
wanted to use that system to make build
production code for character

recognition at Bell Labs so we actually

1358
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:14,890
recognition at Bell Labs so we actually
 

1359
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,350
recognition at Bell Labs so we actually
wrote a compiler for that disp

1360
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:16,360
wrote a compiler for that disp
 

1361
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,720
wrote a compiler for that disp

1365
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:23,640
is now Microsoft kind of did the bulk of
it with Leone and me and and so we could

1366
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:23,650
it with Leone and me and and so we could
 

1367
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,290
it with Leone and me and and so we could
write our system in lisp and then

1368
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:25,300
write our system in lisp and then
 

1369
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,810
write our system in lisp and then
compiled to seee and then we'll have a

1370
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:27,820
compiled to seee and then we'll have a
 

1371
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,880
compiled to seee and then we'll have a
self-contained complete system that

1372
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:29,890
self-contained complete system that
 

1373
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:32,660
self-contained complete system that
could kind of do the entire thing

1374
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:32,670
could kind of do the entire thing
 

1375
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,280
could kind of do the entire thing
neither Python or turn pro can do this

1376
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:35,290
neither Python or turn pro can do this
 

1377
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:40,410
neither Python or turn pro can do this
today yeah okay it's coming yeah I mean

1378
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:40,420
today yeah okay it's coming yeah I mean
 

1379
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,490
today yeah okay it's coming yeah I mean
there's something like that in

1380
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:41,500
there's something like that in
 

1381
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,770
there's something like that in
Whitehorse called you know tor script

1382
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:43,780
Whitehorse called you know tor script
 

1383
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,560
Whitehorse called you know tor script
and so you know we had to write or Lisp

1384
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:46,570
and so you know we had to write or Lisp
 

1385
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:47,910
and so you know we had to write or Lisp

1390
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,080
do this and not everybody if you don't
 

1391
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,720
do this and not everybody if you don't
completely believe in the concept

1392
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:54,730
completely believe in the concept
 

1393
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,310
completely believe in the concept
you're not going to invest the time to

00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:56,320
you're not going to invest the time to
 

1395
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,710
you're not going to invest the time to
do this right now at the time also you

1396
00:28:58,710 --> 00:28:58,720
do this right now at the time also you
 

1397
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,530
do this right now at the time also you
know it were today this would turn into

1398
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:01,540
know it were today this would turn into
 

1399
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,540
know it were today this would turn into
torture by torture and so for whatever

1400

torture by torture and so for whatever
 

1401
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,400
torture by torture and so for whatever
we put it in open-source everybody would

1402
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:05,410
we put it in open-source everybody would
 

1403
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,370
we put it in open-source everybody would
use it and you know realize it's good

1404
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:07,380
use it and you know realize it's good
 

1405
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,460
use it and you know realize it's good
back before 1995 working at AT&T there's

1406
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,470
back before 1995 working at AT&T there's
 

1407
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:14,100
back before 1995 working at AT&T there's
no way the lawyers would let you release

no way the lawyers would let you release
anything in open source of this nature

anything in open source of this nature
 

1411
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,110
anything in open source of this nature
and so we could not distribute our code

1412
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,120
and so we could not distribute our code
 

1413
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,590
and so we could not distribute our code
really and at that point and sorry to go

really and at that point and sorry to go
 

1415
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,360
really and at that point and sorry to go
on a million tangents but on that point

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:24,370
on a million tangents but on that point

00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:26,970
on a million tangents but on that point
I also read that there was some almost

1418
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:26,980
I also read that there was some almost
 

1419
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,549
I also read that there was some almost
pad like a patent on convolution your

1420
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:29,559
pad like a patent on convolution your
 

1421
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:34,169
pad like a patent on convolution your
network yes it was labs so that first of

1422
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:34,179
network yes it was labs so that first of
 

1423
00:29:34,179 --> 00:29:38,630
network yes it was labs so that first of
all I mean just to actually that ran out

1424
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:38,640
all I mean just to actually that ran out
 

1425
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:45,590
all I mean just to actually that ran out
the thankfully 8007 in 2007 that what

00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:45,600
the thankfully 8007 in 2007 that what
 

1427
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,120
the thankfully 8007 in 2007 that what
look can we can we just talk about that

1428
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:48,130
look can we can we just talk about that
 

1429

1434
00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:54,480
does it mean
 

1435
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,100
does it mean
patent ideas like these software ideas

1436
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,110
patent ideas like these software ideas
 

1437
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,250
patent ideas like these software ideas
essentially or what are mathematical

essentially or what are mathematical
 

1439
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:04,430

ideas or what are they okay so they're
 

1441
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,110
ideas or what are they okay so they're
not mathematical idea so there are you

1442
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,120
not mathematical idea so there are you
 

1443
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,180
not mathematical idea so there are you
know algorithms and there was a period

1444
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:08,190
know algorithms and there was a period
 

1445
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,680
know algorithms and there was a period
where the US Patent Office would allow

1446

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:27,929
in this but I don't believe in this kind
 

1461
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,900
in this but I don't believe in this kind
of patent Facebook basically doesn't

1462
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:29,910
of patent Facebook basically doesn't
 

1463
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:33,369

believe in this kind of pattern

1464
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:33,379

 

1465
00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:37,669

Google Files patterns because they've

1466
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:37,679
Google Files patterns because they've
 

1467
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,430
Google Files patterns because they've
been burned with Apple and so now they

1468
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:40,440
been burned with Apple and so now they
 

1469
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,720
been burned with Apple and so now they
do this for defensive purpose but

1470
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:41,730
do this for defensive purpose but
 

1471
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,639
do this for defensive purpose but
usually they say we're not going to see

1472
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:43,649
usually they say we're not going to see
 

1473

so the the industry does not believe in

1484
00:30:58,399 --> 00:30:58,409
so the the industry does not believe in
 

1485
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:00,350
so the the industry does not believe in

believe in patterns for this kind of
 

1493
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,499
believe in patterns for this kind of
stuff yes so that's that's a great thing

1494
00:31:09,499 --> 00:31:09,509
stuff yes so that's that's a great thing

life of a pattern was 17 years so here's
what happened over the next few years is

developed by an engineering group that
 

1539
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,190
developed by an engineering group that
we were collaborating with AT&T and they

we were collaborating with AT&T and they

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,989
we were collaborating with AT&T and they
were commercialized by NCR which at the

were commercialized by NCR which at the
 

1543
00:32:08,999 --> 00:32:11,899
were commercialized by NCR which at the
time was a subsidiary of AT&T now it

ain't he split up in 1996
99 in 1996 and the lawyers just looked

1548
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:19,710
99 in 1996 and the lawyers just looked
 

1549
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:21,049
99 in 1996 and the lawyers just looked
at all the patterns and they distributed

1550
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:21,059
at all the patterns and they distributed
 

1551
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,310
at all the patterns and they distributed
the patterns among the various companies

the patterns among the various companies
 

1553
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,789
the patterns among the various companies
they gave the the commercial net pattern

1554
00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:25,799
they gave the the commercial net pattern
 

1555
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,259
they gave the the commercial net pattern
to NCR because they were actually

1556
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:27,269
to NCR because they were actually
 

1557
00:32:27,269 --> 00:32:29,659
to NCR because they were actually

proposed the the babbitt asks which were
 

1693
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,320
proposed the the babbitt asks which were
kind of a toy problem to test the

1694
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,330
kind of a toy problem to test the
 

1695
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,330
kind of a toy problem to test the
ability of machines to reason actually

this and it was very useful even though
 

1701
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,960
this and it was very useful even though
it wasn't a real task amnesties kind of

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:20,970
it wasn't a real task amnesties kind of
 

1703
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,530
it wasn't a real task amnesties kind of
halfway a real task so you know toy

1704
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:24,540
halfway a real task so you know toy
 

1705
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,330
halfway a real task so you know toy
problems can be very useful it's just

1706
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:26,340
problems can be very useful it's just
 

1707
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,910
problems can be very useful it's just
that i was really struck by the fact

1708
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:28,920
that i was really struck by the fact
 

1709
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:30,800
that i was really struck by the fact
that a lot of people particularly our

1710

that a lot of people particularly our
 

1711
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,750
that a lot of people particularly our
people with money to invest would be

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:32,760
people with money to invest would be
 

1713
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,910
people with money to invest would be
fooled by people telling them oh we have

1714
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:34,920
fooled by people telling them oh we have

00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,470
you know the algorithm of the cortex and
 

1717
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,500
you know the algorithm of the cortex and
you should give us 50 million yes

1718
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:39,510
you should give us 50 million yes
 

1719
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:42,020
you should give us 50 million yes
absolutely so there's a lot of people

absolutely so there's a lot of people
 

1721
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:45,440
absolutely so there's a lot of people

1725
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:52,150
hype for business reasons and so on but
let me sort of talk to this idea that

1726
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,160
let me sort of talk to this idea that
 

1727
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,220
let me sort of talk to this idea that
new ideas the ideas that push the field

1728
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:55,230
new ideas the ideas that push the field
 

1729
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:55,760
new ideas the ideas that push the field
forward

1730
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:55,770

may not yet have a benchmark or it may

1732
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:58,980
may not yet have a benchmark or it may
 

1733
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,230
may not yet have a benchmark or it may
be very difficult to establish a

1734
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,240
be very difficult to establish a
 

1735
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,880
be very difficult to establish a
benchmark I agree that's part of the

1736
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:01,890
benchmark I agree that's part of the
 

1737
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,650
benchmark I agree that's part of the
process establishing benchmarks is part

1738
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:03,660
process establishing benchmarks is part
 

1739
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,140
process establishing benchmarks is part
of the process so what are your thoughts

1740
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:06,150
of the process so what are your thoughts
 

1741
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,860
of the process so what are your thoughts
about so we have these benchmarks on

1742
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:08,870
about so we have these benchmarks on
 

1743
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:12,760
about so we have these benchmarks on
around stuff we can do with images from

1744
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:12,770
around stuff we can do with images from
 

1745
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,290
around stuff we can do with images from

00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:16,860
every kind of information can pull off
 

1749
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,260
every kind of information can pull off
from images and the surface level

1750
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,270
from images and the surface level
 

1751
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,690
from images and the surface level
there's audio datasets there's some

1752
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:20,700
there's audio datasets there's some
 

1753
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,210
there's audio datasets there's some
video what can we start natural language

1754
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:25,220
video what can we start natural language
 

1755
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,860
video what can we start natural language
what kind of stuff what kind of

1756
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:27,870
what kind of stuff what kind of
 

1757
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,060
what kind of stuff what kind of
benchmarks do you see they start

1758
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,070
benchmarks do you see they start
 

1759
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,990
benchmarks do you see they start
creeping on to more something like

1760
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:32,000
creeping on to more something like
 

1761
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,530
creeping on to more something like
intelligence like reasoning like maybe

1762
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:36,540
intelligence like reasoning like maybe
 

1763
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:38,840
intelligence like reasoning like maybe
you don't like the term but AGI echoes

1764
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:38,850
you don't like the term but AGI echoes
 

1765
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,450
you don't like the term but AGI echoes
of that kind of yeah sort of elation a

1766
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:41,460
of that kind of yeah sort of elation a
 

1767
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,400
of that kind of yeah sort of elation a
lot of people are working on interactive

1768
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:43,410
lot of people are working on interactive
 

1769
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,170
lot of people are working on interactive
environments in which you can you can

1770
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:45,180
environments in which you can you can
 

1771
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,890
environments in which you can you can
train and test intelligent systems so so

1772
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:48,900
train and test intelligent systems so so
 

1773
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,540
train and test intelligent systems so so
there for example you know it's the

1774
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:53,550
there for example you know it's the
 

1775
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:56,150
there for example you know it's the
classical paradigm of supervised running

1776
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:56,160
classical paradigm of supervised running
 

1777
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,040
classical paradigm of supervised running
is that you you have a data set you

1778
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:58,050
is that you you have a data set you
 

1779
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,390
is that you you have a data set you
partition it into a training site

1780
00:36:59,390 --> 00:36:59,400
partition it into a training site
 

1781
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,010
partition it into a training site
validation set test set and there's a

1782
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:01,020
validation set test set and there's a
 

1783
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,610
validation set test set and there's a
clear protocol right but what if the

1784
00:37:04,610 --> 00:37:04,620
clear protocol right but what if the
 

1785
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,080
clear protocol right but what if the
that assumes that this

1786
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,090
that assumes that this
 

1787
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,960
that assumes that this
apples are statistically independent you

1788
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:08,970
apples are statistically independent you
 

1789
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,730
apples are statistically independent you
can exchange them the order in which you

1790
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:10,740
can exchange them the order in which you
 

1791
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,110
can exchange them the order in which you
see them doesn't shouldn't matter you

1792
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:12,120
see them doesn't shouldn't matter you
 

1793
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,840
see them doesn't shouldn't matter you
know things like that but what if the

1794
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:14,850
know things like that but what if the
 

1795
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,430
know things like that but what if the
answer you give determines the next

1796
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:16,440
answer you give determines the next
 

1797
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,200
answer you give determines the next
sample you see which is the case for

1798
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,210
sample you see which is the case for
 

1799
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,750
sample you see which is the case for
example in robotics right you robot does

1800
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:20,760
example in robotics right you robot does
 

1801
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,580
example in robotics right you robot does
something and then it gets exposed to a

1802
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:22,590
something and then it gets exposed to a
 

1803
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,920
something and then it gets exposed to a
new room and depending on where it goes

1804
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:24,930
new room and depending on where it goes
 

1805
00:37:24,930 --> 00:37:26,270
new room and depending on where it goes
the room would be different so that's

1806
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:26,280
the room would be different so that's
 

1807
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,230
the room would be different so that's
the decrease the exploration problem

1808
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:29,240
the decrease the exploration problem
 

1809
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,560
the decrease the exploration problem
the what if the samples so that creates

1810
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:33,570
the what if the samples so that creates
 

1811
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,120
the what if the samples so that creates
also a dependency between samples right

1812
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:35,130
also a dependency between samples right
 

1813
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:38,330
also a dependency between samples right
you you if you move if you can only move

1814
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:38,340
you you if you move if you can only move
 

1815
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,610
you you if you move if you can only move
it in in space the next sample you're

1816
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:40,620
it in in space the next sample you're
 

1817
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,960
it in in space the next sample you're
gonna see is going to be probably in the

00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:41,970
gonna see is going to be probably in the
 

1819
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,800
gonna see is going to be probably in the
same building most likely so so so the

right the robot runs around a 3d model
 

1837
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:07,070
right the robot runs around a 3d model
of a house and can interact with objects

00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,500
of a house and can interact with objects
and things like this how you do robotics

1840
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:09,510
and things like this how you do robotics
 

1841
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:12,160
and things like this how you do robotics
by simulation you have those you know

1842
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:12,170
by simulation you have those you know

you know things like that so that that's
 

1849
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,750
you know things like that so that that's
where the field is going really this

00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,060
kind of environment now back to the
 

1853
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,060
kind of environment now back to the
question of a GI like I don't like the

1854
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:29,070
question of a GI like I don't like the
 

1855
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:33,710
question of a GI like I don't like the
term a GI because it implies that human

1856
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:33,720
term a GI because it implies that human
 

1857
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:36,140
term a GI because it implies that human
intelligence is general and human

1858
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,150
intelligence is general and human
 

1859
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:38,270
intelligence is general and human
intelligence is nothing like general

intelligence is nothing like general
 

1861
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:41,330

it's very very specialized we think it's

1862
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:41,340
it's very very specialized we think it's
 

1863
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,440
it's very very specialized we think it's
general we'd like to think of ourselves

1864
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,450
general we'd like to think of ourselves
 

1865
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,090
general we'd like to think of ourselves
as having your own science we don't

1866
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:44,100
as having your own science we don't
 

1867
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,460
as having your own science we don't
we're very specialized we're only

we're very specialized we're only
 

1869
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,900
we're very specialized we're only
slightly more general than why does it

1870
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:47,910
slightly more general than why does it
 

1871
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,870
slightly more general than why does it
feel general so you kind of the term

1872
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:50,880
feel general so you kind of the term
 

1873
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,630
feel general so you kind of the term
general I think what's impressive about

1874
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:53,640
general I think what's impressive about
 

1875
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:56,660
general I think what's impressive about
humans is ability to learn as we were

1876
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:56,670
humans is ability to learn as we were
 

1877
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,720
humans is ability to learn as we were
talking about learning to learn in just

1878
00:38:59,720 --> 00:38:59,730
talking about learning to learn in just
 

1879
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:02,590
talking about learning to learn in just
so many different domains is perhaps not

1880
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:02,600
so many different domains is perhaps not
 

1881
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,120
so many different domains is perhaps not
arbitrarily general but just you can

1882
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,130
arbitrarily general but just you can
 

1883
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:07,190
arbitrarily general but just you can
learn in many domains and integrate that

1884
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:07,200
learn in many domains and integrate that
 

1885
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,200
learn in many domains and integrate that
knowledge somehow okay that knowledge

1886
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,210
knowledge somehow okay that knowledge
 

1887
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,820
knowledge somehow okay that knowledge
persists so let me take a very specific

1888
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:10,830
persists so let me take a very specific
 

1889
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,130
persists so let me take a very specific
example yes it's not an example it's

1890
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:13,140
example yes it's not an example it's
 

1891
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,100
example yes it's not an example it's
more like a a quasi mathematical

1892
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,110
more like a a quasi mathematical
 

1893
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,780
more like a a quasi mathematical
demonstration so you have about 1

1894
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:17,790
demonstration so you have about 1
 

1895
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:19,549
demonstration so you have about 1
million fibers coming out of

1896
00:39:19,549 --> 00:39:19,559
million fibers coming out of
 

1897
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:21,170
million fibers coming out of
one of your eyes okay two million total

1898
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:21,180
one of your eyes okay two million total
 

1899
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,640
one of your eyes okay two million total
but let's let's talk about just one of

1900
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:22,650
but let's let's talk about just one of
 

1901
00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:25,279
but let's let's talk about just one of
them it's 1 million nerve fibers your

1902
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:25,289
them it's 1 million nerve fibers your
 

1903
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:28,130
them it's 1 million nerve fibers your
optical nerve let's imagine that they

1904
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:28,140
optical nerve let's imagine that they
 

1905
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,660
optical nerve let's imagine that they
are binary so they can be active or

1906
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:29,670
are binary so they can be active or
 

1907
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,609
are binary so they can be active or
inactive right so the input to your

1908
00:39:31,609 --> 00:39:31,619
inactive right so the input to your
 

1909
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,079
inactive right so the input to your
visual cortex is 1 million bits

1910
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:36,089

 

1911
00:39:36,089 --> 00:39:38,870

now they connected to your brain in a

1912
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:38,880
now they connected to your brain in a
 

1913
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,910
now they connected to your brain in a
particular way on your brain has

1914
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:40,920
particular way on your brain has
 

1915
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,160
particular way on your brain has
connections that are kind of a little

1916
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,170
connections that are kind of a little
 

1917
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,390
connections that are kind of a little
bit like accomplish on that they're kind

1918
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:44,400
bit like accomplish on that they're kind
 

1919
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,029
bit like accomplish on that they're kind
of local you know in space and things

1920
00:39:47,029 --> 00:39:47,039
of local you know in space and things
 

1921
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,920
of local you know in space and things
like this I imagine I play a trick on

1922
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:48,930
like this I imagine I play a trick on
 

1923
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,779
like this I imagine I play a trick on
you it's a pretty nasty trick I admit I

1924
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:52,789
you it's a pretty nasty trick I admit I
 

1925
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:56,120
you it's a pretty nasty trick I admit I
I cut your optical nerve and I put a

1926
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:56,130
I cut your optical nerve and I put a
 

1927
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,949
I cut your optical nerve and I put a
device that makes a random perturbation

1928
00:39:57,949 --> 00:39:57,959
device that makes a random perturbation
 

1929
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:01,009
device that makes a random perturbation
of a permutation of all the nerve fibers

1930
00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:01,019
of a permutation of all the nerve fibers
 

1931
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:04,189
of a permutation of all the nerve fibers
so now what comes to your to your brain

1932
00:40:04,189 --> 00:40:04,199
so now what comes to your to your brain
 

1933
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:07,160
so now what comes to your to your brain
is a fixed but random permutation of all

1934
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,170
is a fixed but random permutation of all
 

1935
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:09,799
is a fixed but random permutation of all
the pixels there's no way in hell that

1936
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:09,809
the pixels there's no way in hell that
 

1937
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,920
the pixels there's no way in hell that
your visual cortex even if I do this to

1938
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:12,930
your visual cortex even if I do this to
 

1939
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,069
your visual cortex even if I do this to
you in infancy will actually learn

1940
00:40:16,069 --> 00:40:16,079
you in infancy will actually learn
 

1941
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,829
you in infancy will actually learn
vision to the same level of quality that

1942
00:40:18,829 --> 00:40:18,839
vision to the same level of quality that
 

1943
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:21,259
vision to the same level of quality that
you can got it and you're saying there's

1944
00:40:21,259 --> 00:40:21,269
you can got it and you're saying there's
 

1945
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:23,059
you can got it and you're saying there's
no way you ever learn that no because

1946
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:23,069
no way you ever learn that no because
 

1947
00:40:23,069 --> 00:40:25,069
no way you ever learn that no because
now two pixels that on your body in the

1948
00:40:25,069 --> 00:40:25,079
now two pixels that on your body in the
 

1949
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:27,140
now two pixels that on your body in the
world will end up in very different

1950
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,150
world will end up in very different
 

1951
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,900
world will end up in very different
places in your visual cortex and your

1952
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:29,910
places in your visual cortex and your
 

1953
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,249
places in your visual cortex and your
neurons there have no connections with

1954
00:40:31,249 --> 00:40:31,259
neurons there have no connections with
 

1955
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:32,569
neurons there have no connections with
each other because they only connect it

1956
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:32,579
each other because they only connect it
 

1957
00:40:32,579 --> 00:40:35,150
each other because they only connect it
locally so this whole our entire the

1958
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,160
locally so this whole our entire the
 

1959
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:37,339
locally so this whole our entire the
hardware is built in many ways to

1960
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:37,349
hardware is built in many ways to
 

1961
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:39,620
hardware is built in many ways to
support the locality of the real world

1962
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:39,630
support the locality of the real world
 

1963
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:42,919
support the locality of the real world
yeah yes that's specialization yep okay

1964
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:42,929
yeah yes that's specialization yep okay
 

1965
00:40:42,929 --> 00:40:44,749
yeah yes that's specialization yep okay
it's still now really damn impressive so

1966
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:44,759
it's still now really damn impressive so
 

1967
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:46,669
it's still now really damn impressive so
it's not perfect generalization I even

1968
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:46,679
it's not perfect generalization I even
 

1969
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:49,279
it's not perfect generalization I even
closed no no it's it's it's it's not

1970
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:49,289
closed no no it's it's it's it's not
 

1971
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,959
closed no no it's it's it's it's not
that it's not even close it's not at all

1972
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:50,969
that it's not even close it's not at all
 

1973
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:53,419
that it's not even close it's not at all
yes it's socialize so how many boolean

1974
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:53,429
yes it's socialize so how many boolean
 

1975
00:40:53,429 --> 00:40:55,719
yes it's socialize so how many boolean
functions so let's imagine you want to

1976
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:55,729
functions so let's imagine you want to
 

1977
00:40:55,729 --> 00:41:00,079
functions so let's imagine you want to
train your visual system to you know

1978
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:00,089
train your visual system to you know
 

1979
00:41:00,089 --> 00:41:02,359
train your visual system to you know
recognize particular patterns of those 1

1980
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:02,369
recognize particular patterns of those 1
 

1981
00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:04,789
recognize particular patterns of those 1
million bits ok so that's a boolean

1982
00:41:04,789 --> 00:41:04,799
million bits ok so that's a boolean
 

1983
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:06,349
million bits ok so that's a boolean
function right either the pattern is

1984
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:06,359
function right either the pattern is
 

1985
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,089
function right either the pattern is
here or not here this is a to to a

1986
00:41:08,089 --> 00:41:08,099
here or not here this is a to to a
 

1987
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:10,359
here or not here this is a to to a
classification with 1 million binary

1988
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:10,369
classification with 1 million binary
 

1989
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:13,330
classification with 1 million binary
inputs

1990
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:13,340
inputs
 

1991
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,980
inputs
how many such boolean functions are

1992
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:14,990
how many such boolean functions are
 

1993
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:18,340
how many such boolean functions are
there okay if you have 2 to the 1

1994
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:18,350
there okay if you have 2 to the 1
 

1995
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:21,490
there okay if you have 2 to the 1
million combinations of inputs for each

1996
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:21,500
million combinations of inputs for each
 

1997
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:24,310
million combinations of inputs for each
of those you have an output bit and so

1998
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:24,320
of those you have an output bit and so
 

1999
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,940
of those you have an output bit and so
you have 2 to the 2 to the 1 million

2000
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:26,950
you have 2 to the 2 to the 1 million
 

2001
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:29,410
you have 2 to the 2 to the 1 million
boolean functions of this type okay

2002
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:29,420
boolean functions of this type okay
 

2003
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,260
boolean functions of this type okay
which is an unimaginably large number

2004
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,270
which is an unimaginably large number
 

2005
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,020
which is an unimaginably large number
how many of those functions can actually

2006
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:35,030
how many of those functions can actually
 

2007
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,550
how many of those functions can actually
be computed by your visual cortex and

2008
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:36,560
be computed by your visual cortex and
 

2009
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,910
be computed by your visual cortex and
the answer is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny

2010
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:39,920
the answer is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny
 

2011
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,550
the answer is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny
tiny sliver like an enormous little tiny

2012
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:42,560
tiny sliver like an enormous little tiny
 

2013
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,390
tiny sliver like an enormous little tiny
sliver yeah yeah so we are ridiculously

2014
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:46,400
sliver yeah yeah so we are ridiculously
 

2015
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,550
sliver yeah yeah so we are ridiculously
specialized you know okay but okay

2016
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:51,560
specialized you know okay but okay
 

2017
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,710
specialized you know okay but okay
that's an argument against the word

2018
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:53,720
that's an argument against the word
 

2019
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,220
that's an argument against the word
general I think there's there's a I

2020
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:56,230
general I think there's there's a I
 

2021
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,290
general I think there's there's a I
there's I agree with your intuition but

2022
00:41:59,290 --> 00:41:59,300
there's I agree with your intuition but
 

2023
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:01,630
there's I agree with your intuition but
I'm not sure it's it seems the breath

2024
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:01,640
I'm not sure it's it seems the breath
 

2025
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,480
I'm not sure it's it seems the breath
the the brain is impressively capable of

2026
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:07,490
the the brain is impressively capable of
 

2027
00:42:07,490 --> 00:42:10,090
the the brain is impressively capable of
adjusting to things so it's because we

2028
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:10,100
adjusting to things so it's because we
 

2029
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,260
adjusting to things so it's because we
can't imagine tasks that are outside of

00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:14,270
can't imagine tasks that are outside of
 

2031
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:17,230
can't imagine tasks that are outside of
our comprehension right we think we

2032
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:17,240
our comprehension right we think we
 

2033
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,430

00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:18,440
think we are general because we're
 

2035
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,510
think we are general because we're
general of all the things that we can

2036
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:19,520
general of all the things that we can
 

2037
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,090
general of all the things that we can
apprehend so yeah but there is a huge

2038
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:22,100
apprehend so yeah but there is a huge
 

2039
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,680
apprehend so yeah but there is a huge
world out there of things that we have

2040
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:23,690
world out there of things that we have
 

2041
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:24,340
world out there of things that we have
no idea

2042
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:24,350
no idea
 

2043
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,460
no idea
we call that heat by the way heat heat

2044
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:27,470
we call that heat by the way heat heat
 

2045
00:42:27,470 --> 00:42:30,760
we call that heat by the way heat heat
so at least physicists call that heat or

2046
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:30,770
so at least physicists call that heat or
 

2047
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:32,490
so at least physicists call that heat or
they call it entropy which is kokkonen

2048
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:32,500
they call it entropy which is kokkonen
 

2049
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:39,520
they call it entropy which is kokkonen
you have a thing full of gas right call

2050
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:39,530
you have a thing full of gas right call
 

2051

like that right when you reduce a volume

2060
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:56,360
like that right when you reduce a volume
 

2061
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,670
like that right when you reduce a volume
the temperature goes up the pressure

2062
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:57,680
the temperature goes up the pressure
 

2063
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,520
the temperature goes up the pressure
goes up you know things like that right

2064
00:42:59,520 --> 00:42:59,530
goes up you know things like that right
 

2065
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,680
goes up you know things like that right
for perfect gas at least those are the

2066
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:02,690
for perfect gas at least those are the
 

2067
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:05,400
for perfect gas at least those are the
things you can know about that system

2068

things you can know about that system
 

2069
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,990
things you can know about that system
and it's a tiny tiny number of bits

2070
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:07,000
and it's a tiny tiny number of bits
 

2071
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,480
and it's a tiny tiny number of bits
compared to the complete information of

molecule of the gas and what you don't
 

2081
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:22,440
molecule of the gas and what you don't
know about it is the entropy and you

2082
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:22,450
know about it is the entropy and you
 

2083
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,270
know about it is the entropy and you
interpret it as heat the energy

2084
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:24,280
interpret it as heat the energy
 

2085
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,480
interpret it as heat the energy
containing that thing is is what we call

containing that thing is is what we call
 

2087
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:32,190
containing that thing is is what we call
heat now it's very possible that in fact

how those molecules are moving is just
 

2093
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,110
how those molecules are moving is just
that they are in a way that we are just

beautifully put but you know so we can
 

2123
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,480
beautifully put but you know so we can
just call it artificial intelligence we

2124
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:15,490
just call it artificial intelligence we
 

2125
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:18,120
just call it artificial intelligence we
don't need to have a general whatever

because you know it's just because we
 

2137
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:33,660
because you know it's just because we
attach ourselves to human and it's

2138
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:33,670
attach ourselves to human and it's
 

2139
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,130
attach ourselves to human and it's
difficult to define with human

2140

successes in deep learning have been in
 

2153
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:56,300
successes in deep learning have been in
supervised learning what is your view on

2154
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:56,310
supervised learning what is your view on
 

2155
00:44:56,310 --> 00:44:59,310
supervised learning what is your view on
unsupervised learning is there a hope to

2156
00:44:59,310 --> 00:44:59,320
unsupervised learning is there a hope to
 

2157
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,600
unsupervised learning is there a hope to
reduce involvement of human input and

2158
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:02,610
reduce involvement of human input and
 

2159
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,880
reduce involvement of human input and
still have successful systems that are

2160
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:05,890
still have successful systems that are
 

2161
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,700
still have successful systems that are
have practically used yeah I mean

2162
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:08,710
have practically used yeah I mean
 

2163
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,230
have practically used yeah I mean
there's definitely a hope is it's more

2164
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:10,240
there's definitely a hope is it's more
 

2165
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,300
there's definitely a hope is it's more
than a hope actually it's it's you know

2166
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:12,310
than a hope actually it's it's you know
 

2167
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:14,160
than a hope actually it's it's you know
mounting evidence for it and that's

2168
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:14,170
mounting evidence for it and that's
 

2169
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,010
mounting evidence for it and that's
basically or I do like the only thing

2170
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:17,020
basically or I do like the only thing
 

2171
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,070
basically or I do like the only thing
I'm interested in at the moment is

2172
00:45:19,070 --> 00:45:19,080
I'm interested in at the moment is
 

2173
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:20,660
I'm interested in at the moment is
I call it self supervised running not

2174
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:20,670
I call it self supervised running not
 

2175
00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:22,220
I call it self supervised running not
unsupervised cuz unsupervised running is

2176
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:22,230
unsupervised cuz unsupervised running is
 

2177
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:26,960
unsupervised cuz unsupervised running is
a loaded term people who know something

2178
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:26,970
a loaded term people who know something
 

2179
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,400
a loaded term people who know something
about machine learning you know tell us

2180
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:28,410
about machine learning you know tell us
 

2181
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:30,740
about machine learning you know tell us
how you doing clustering or PCA yeah

2182
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:30,750
how you doing clustering or PCA yeah
 

2183
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,570
how you doing clustering or PCA yeah
she's nice and the way public we know

2184
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:32,580
she's nice and the way public we know
 

2185
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,010
she's nice and the way public we know

you know machines are gonna learn by
 

2189
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:37,400

themselves and without supervision you
 

2191
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:41,930
themselves and without supervision you
know there's the parents yeah so so I

2192
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:41,940
know there's the parents yeah so so I
 

2193
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,190
know there's the parents yeah so so I
could sell supervised learning because

2194
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:43,200
could sell supervised learning because
 

2195
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,740
could sell supervised learning because
in fact the underlying algorithms that I

2196
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:45,750
in fact the underlying algorithms that I
 

2197
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,720
in fact the underlying algorithms that I
use are the same algorithms as the

2198
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:47,730
use are the same algorithms as the
 

2199
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:50,690
use are the same algorithms as the
supervised learning algorithms except

2200
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:50,700
supervised learning algorithms except
 

2201
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:52,700
supervised learning algorithms except
that what we trained them to do is not

2202
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:52,710
that what we trained them to do is not
 

2203
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:55,280
that what we trained them to do is not
predict a particular set of variables

2204
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,290
predict a particular set of variables
 

2205
00:45:55,290 --> 00:46:00,890
predict a particular set of variables
like the category of an image and and

2206
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:00,900
like the category of an image and and
 

2207
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,630
like the category of an image and and
not to predict a set of variables that

2208
00:46:02,630 --> 00:46:02,640
not to predict a set of variables that
 

2209
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:06,530
not to predict a set of variables that
have been provided by human labelers but

2210
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:06,540
have been provided by human labelers but
 

2211
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:07,550
have been provided by human labelers but
what you're trying to machine to do is

2212
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:07,560
what you're trying to machine to do is
 

2213
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,860
what you're trying to machine to do is
basically reconstruct a piece of its

2214
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:09,870
basically reconstruct a piece of its
 

2215
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,800
basically reconstruct a piece of its
input that it's being this being masked

2216
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:12,810
input that it's being this being masked
 

2217
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:14,600
input that it's being this being masked
masked out essentially you can think of

2218
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:14,610
masked out essentially you can think of
 

2219
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,450
masked out essentially you can think of
it this way right so show a piece of a

2220
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:17,460
it this way right so show a piece of a
 

2221
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,880
it this way right so show a piece of a
video to a machine and ask it to predict

2222
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:19,890
video to a machine and ask it to predict
 

2223
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,380
video to a machine and ask it to predict
what's gonna happen next and of course

2224
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:21,390
what's gonna happen next and of course
 

2225
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,360
what's gonna happen next and of course
after a while you can show what what

2226
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:23,370
after a while you can show what what
 

2227
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:25,100
after a while you can show what what
happens and the machine will kind of

2228
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:25,110
happens and the machine will kind of
 

2229
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,940
happens and the machine will kind of
train itself to do better at that task

2230
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:27,950
train itself to do better at that task
 

2231
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,250
train itself to do better at that task
you can do like all the latest most

2232
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:31,260
you can do like all the latest most
 

2233
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,720
you can do like all the latest most
successful models the natural language

2234
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:32,730
successful models the natural language
 

2235
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,660
successful models the natural language
processing use cell supervised running

2236
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:35,670
processing use cell supervised running
 

2237
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:38,120
processing use cell supervised running
you know sort of bird style systems for

2238
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,130
you know sort of bird style systems for
 

2239
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:40,280
you know sort of bird style systems for
example right you show it a window of a

2240
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:40,290
example right you show it a window of a
 

2241
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:44,420

thousand words on a test corpus you take

2242
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:44,430
thousand words on a test corpus you take
 

2243
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,030
thousand words on a test corpus you take
out 15% of the words and then you train

2244
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:47,040
out 15% of the words and then you train
 

2245
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:50,150
out 15% of the words and then you train
a machine to predict the words that are

2246
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:50,160
a machine to predict the words that are
 

2247
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,370
a machine to predict the words that are
missing that's out supervised running

2248
00:46:52,370 --> 00:46:52,380
missing that's out supervised running
 

2249
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,200
missing that's out supervised running
it's not predicting the future it's just

2250
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:54,210
it's not predicting the future it's just
 

2251
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:56,450
it's not predicting the future it's just
you know predicting things in middle but

2252
00:46:56,450 --> 00:46:56,460
you know predicting things in middle but
 

2253
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:57,620
you know predicting things in middle but
you could have you predict the future

2254
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:57,630
you could have you predict the future
 

2255
00:46:57,630 --> 00:46:59,720
you could have you predict the future
that's what language models do so you

2256
00:46:59,720 --> 00:46:59,730
that's what language models do so you
 

2257
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:01,730
that's what language models do so you
construct it so in an unsupervised way

2258
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:01,740
construct it so in an unsupervised way
 

2259
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,310
construct it so in an unsupervised way
you construct a model of language do you

2260
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:04,320
you construct a model of language do you
 

2261
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,850
you construct a model of language do you
think or video or the physical world or

2262
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:07,860
think or video or the physical world or
 

2263
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,430
think or video or the physical world or
whatever right how far do you think that

2264
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:10,440
whatever right how far do you think that
 

2265
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,410
whatever right how far do you think that
can take us do you think very far it

2266
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:14,420
can take us do you think very far it
 

2267
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:18,860
can take us do you think very far it
understands anything to some level it

2268
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:18,870
understands anything to some level it
 

2269
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,120
understands anything to some level it
has you know a shallow understanding of

2270
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:22,130
has you know a shallow understanding of
 

2271
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,070
has you know a shallow understanding of
of text but it needs to I mean to have

2272
00:47:25,070 --> 00:47:25,080
of text but it needs to I mean to have
 

2273
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,930
of text but it needs to I mean to have
kind of true human level intelligence I

2274
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:26,940
kind of true human level intelligence I
 

2275
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,700
kind of true human level intelligence I
think you need to ground language in

2276
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:28,710
think you need to ground language in
 

2277
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:32,120
think you need to ground language in
reality so some people are attempting to

2278
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:32,130
reality so some people are attempting to
 

2279
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,100
reality so some people are attempting to
do this right having systems that can I

2280
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,110
do this right having systems that can I
 

2281
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:35,720
do this right having systems that can I
have some visual representation of what

2282
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:35,730
have some visual representation of what
 

2283
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,940
have some visual representation of what
what is being talked about which is one

2284
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:37,950
what is being talked about which is one
 

2285
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:39,860
what is being talked about which is one
reason you need interactive environments

2286
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:39,870
reason you need interactive environments
 

2287
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,040
reason you need interactive environments
actually this is like a huge technical

2288
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,050
actually this is like a huge technical
 

2289
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,800
actually this is like a huge technical
problem that is not solved and that

2290
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:45,810
problem that is not solved and that
 

2291
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,930
problem that is not solved and that
explains why such super versioning works

2292
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:47,940
explains why such super versioning works
 

2293
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,120
explains why such super versioning works
in the context of natural language that

2294
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,130
in the context of natural language that
 

2295
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:52,010
in the context of natural language that
does not work in the context on at least

2296
00:47:52,010 --> 00:47:52,020
does not work in the context on at least
 

2297
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:53,630
does not work in the context on at least
not well in the context of image

2298
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:53,640
not well in the context of image
 

2299
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:55,760
not well in the context of image
recognition and video although it's

2300
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:55,770
recognition and video although it's
 

2301
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:58,360
recognition and video although it's
making progress quickly and the reason

2302
00:47:58,360 --> 00:47:58,370
making progress quickly and the reason
 

2303
00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:02,240
making progress quickly and the reason
that reason is the fact that it's much

2304
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:02,250
that reason is the fact that it's much
 

2305
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,040
that reason is the fact that it's much
easier to represent uncertainty in the

2306
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:04,050
easier to represent uncertainty in the
 

2307
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:06,500
easier to represent uncertainty in the
prediction you know context of natural

prediction you know context of natural
 

2309
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:08,060
prediction you know context of natural
language than it is in the context of

2310
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:08,070
language than it is in the context of
 

2311
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:10,490
language than it is in the context of
things like video and images so for

2312
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:10,500
things like video and images so for
 

2313
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,160
things like video and images so for
example if I ask you to predict what

2314
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:13,170
example if I ask you to predict what
 

2315
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,810
example if I ask you to predict what
words are missing you know 15 percent of

2316
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:14,820
words are missing you know 15 percent of
 

2317
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:17,440
words are missing you know 15 percent of
the words that I've taken out the

2318
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:17,450
the words that I've taken out the
 

2319
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:19,640
the words that I've taken out the
possibility is small that means small

2320
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:19,650
possibility is small that means small
 

2321
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:22,160
possibility is small that means small
right there is 100,000 words in the in

2322
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,170
right there is 100,000 words in the in
 

2323
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:24,440
right there is 100,000 words in the in
the lexicon and what the Machine spits

2324
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:24,450
the lexicon and what the Machine spits
 

2325
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,140
the lexicon and what the Machine spits
out is a big probability vector right

2326
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:27,150
out is a big probability vector right
 

2327
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:29,570
out is a big probability vector right
it's a bunch of numbers between 0 & 1

2328
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:29,580
it's a bunch of numbers between 0 & 1
 

2329
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,940
it's a bunch of numbers between 0 & 1
that's 1 to 1 and we know how to do how

2330
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:31,950
that's 1 to 1 and we know how to do how
 

2331
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,940
that's 1 to 1 and we know how to do how
to do this with computers so they are

2332
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:34,950
to do this with computers so they are
 

2333
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:36,440
to do this with computers so they are
representing uncertainty in the

2334
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:36,450
representing uncertainty in the
 

2335
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:38,120
representing uncertainty in the
prediction is relatively easy and that's

2336
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:38,130
prediction is relatively easy and that's
 

2337
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,790
prediction is relatively easy and that's
in my opinion why those techniques work

2338
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:40,800
in my opinion why those techniques work
 

2339
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,740
in my opinion why those techniques work
for NLP for images if you ask if you

2340
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:45,750
for NLP for images if you ask if you
 

2341
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:47,240
for NLP for images if you ask if you
block a piece of an image and you as a

2342
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:47,250
block a piece of an image and you as a
 

2343
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,770
block a piece of an image and you as a
system reconstruct that piece of the

2344
00:48:48,770 --> 00:48:48,780
system reconstruct that piece of the
 

2345
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,220

you can't train a system to make one

2356
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:00,510
you can't train a system to make one
 

2357
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:01,940
you can't train a system to make one
prediction you can train a neural net to

2358
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:01,950
prediction you can train a neural net to
 

2359
00:49:01,950 --> 00:49:04,910
prediction you can train a neural net to
say here it is that's the image because

2360
00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:04,920
say here it is that's the image because
 

2361
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:06,470
say here it is that's the image because
it's there's a whole set of things that

2362
00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:06,480
it's there's a whole set of things that
 

2363
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,820
it's there's a whole set of things that
are compatible with it so how do you get

2364
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:07,830
are compatible with it so how do you get
 

2365
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:09,290
are compatible with it so how do you get
the machine to represent not a single

2366
00:49:09,290 --> 00:49:09,300
the machine to represent not a single
 

2367
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,420
the machine to represent not a single
output but all set of outputs and you

2368
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:14,430
output but all set of outputs and you
 

2369
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,520
output but all set of outputs and you
know similarly with video prediction

2370
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:16,530
know similarly with video prediction
 

2371
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:18,320
know similarly with video prediction
there's a lot of things that can happen

2372
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:18,330
there's a lot of things that can happen
 

2373

there's a lot of things that can happen
in the future video you're looking at me

2374
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:20,730
in the future video you're looking at me
 

2375
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:22,040
in the future video you're looking at me
right now I'm not moving my head very

2376
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:22,050
right now I'm not moving my head very
 

2377
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:24,140
right now I'm not moving my head very
much but you know I might you know what

2378
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:24,150
much but you know I might you know what
 

2379
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,610
much but you know I might you know what
turn my my head to the left or to the

2380
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:25,620
turn my my head to the left or to the
 

2381
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,770
turn my my head to the left or to the
right right if you don't have a system

2382
00:49:27,770 --> 00:49:27,780
right right if you don't have a system
 

2383
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,010
right right if you don't have a system
that can predict this and you train it

2384
00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:31,020
that can predict this and you train it
 

2385
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,480
that can predict this and you train it
with least Square to kind of minimize

2386
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:32,490
with least Square to kind of minimize
 

2387
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:33,950
with least Square to kind of minimize
the error with the prediction and what

2388
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:33,960
the error with the prediction and what
 

2389
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:34,430
the error with the prediction and what
I'm doing

2390
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:34,440
I'm doing
 

2391
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,110
I'm doing
what you get is a blurry image of myself

2392
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:36,120
what you get is a blurry image of myself
 

2393
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,900
what you get is a blurry image of myself
in all possible future positions that I

2394
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:38,910
in all possible future positions that I
 

2395
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:40,190
in all possible future positions that I
might be in which is not a good

2396
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:40,200
might be in which is not a good
 

2397
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:42,470
might be in which is not a good
prediction but so there might be other

2398
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:42,480
prediction but so there might be other
 

2399
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,110
prediction but so there might be other
ways to do the self supervision right

2400
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:45,120
ways to do the self supervision right
 

2401
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,570
ways to do the self supervision right
for visual scenes like what if i I mean

2402
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:50,580
for visual scenes like what if i I mean
 

2403
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:52,160
for visual scenes like what if i I mean
if I knew I wouldn't tell you

2404
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,170
if I knew I wouldn't tell you
 

2405
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,730
if I knew I wouldn't tell you
publish it first I don't know I know

2406
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:55,740
publish it first I don't know I know
 

2407
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,820
publish it first I don't know I know
there might be so I mean these are kind

2408
00:49:58,820 --> 00:49:58,830
there might be so I mean these are kind
 

2409
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:01,520
there might be so I mean these are kind
of there might be artificial ways of

2410
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:01,530
of there might be artificial ways of
 

2411
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:03,680
of there might be artificial ways of
like self play in games the way you can

2412
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:03,690
like self play in games the way you can
 

2413
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,390
like self play in games the way you can
simulate part of the environment you can

2414
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:05,400
simulate part of the environment you can
 

2415
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,950
simulate part of the environment you can
oh that doesn't solve the problem it's

2416
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:06,960
oh that doesn't solve the problem it's
 

2417
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,700
oh that doesn't solve the problem it's
just a way of generating data but

2418
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:10,710
just a way of generating data but
 

2419
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,770
just a way of generating data but
because you have more of a country might

2420
00:50:12,770 --> 00:50:12,780
because you have more of a country might
 

2421
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:15,110
because you have more of a country might
mean you can control yeah it's a way to

2422
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:15,120
mean you can control yeah it's a way to
 

2423
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,730
mean you can control yeah it's a way to
generate data and that's right and

2424
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:16,740
generate data and that's right and
 

2425
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,770
generate data and that's right and
because you can do huge amounts of data

2426
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:18,780
because you can do huge amounts of data
 

2427
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,410
because you can do huge amounts of data
generation that doesn't you write this

2428
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:21,420
generation that doesn't you write this
 

2429
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,510
generation that doesn't you write this
well it's it's a creeps up on the

2430
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:23,520
well it's it's a creeps up on the
 

2431
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,270
well it's it's a creeps up on the
problem from the side of data and you

2432
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:26,280
problem from the side of data and you
 

2433
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,770
problem from the side of data and you
don't think that's the right way to it

2434
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:27,780
don't think that's the right way to it
 

2435
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,330
don't think that's the right way to it
doesn't solve this problem of handling

2436
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:29,340
doesn't solve this problem of handling
 

2437
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:31,820
doesn't solve this problem of handling
uncertainty in the world right so if you

2438
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:31,830
uncertainty in the world right so if you
 

2439
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,760
uncertainty in the world right so if you
if you have a machine learn a predictive

2440
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:34,770
if you have a machine learn a predictive
 

2441
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:37,520
if you have a machine learn a predictive
model of the world in a game that is

2442
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:37,530
model of the world in a game that is
 

2443
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:39,670
model of the world in a game that is
deterministic or quasi deterministic

2444
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:39,680
deterministic or quasi deterministic
 

2445
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,520
deterministic or quasi deterministic
it's easy right just you know give a few

2446
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:43,530
it's easy right just you know give a few
 

2447
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:46,100
it's easy right just you know give a few
frames of the game to a combat put a

2448
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,110
frames of the game to a combat put a
 

2449
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:47,870
frames of the game to a combat put a
bunch of layers and then half the game

2450
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:47,880
bunch of layers and then half the game
 

2451
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,810
bunch of layers and then half the game
generates the next few frames and and if

2452
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:50,820
generates the next few frames and and if
 

2453
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,140
generates the next few frames and and if
the game is deterministic it works fine

2454
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:53,150
the game is deterministic it works fine
 

2455
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,160
the game is deterministic it works fine
and that includes you know feeding the

2456
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,170
and that includes you know feeding the
 

2457
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:00,200
and that includes you know feeding the
system with the action that your little

2458
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:00,210
system with the action that your little
 

2459
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,470
system with the action that your little
character is going to take

2460
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:02,480
character is going to take
 

2461
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,130
character is going to take
the problem comes from the fact that the

2462
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:06,140
the problem comes from the fact that the
 

2463
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:08,049
the problem comes from the fact that the
real world and certain most games are

2464
00:51:08,049 --> 00:51:08,059
real world and certain most games are
 

2465
00:51:08,059 --> 00:51:09,910
real world and certain most games are
not entirely predictable that's what

2466
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:09,920
not entirely predictable that's what
 

2467
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,079
not entirely predictable that's what
they're you get those blurry predictions

2468
00:51:11,079 --> 00:51:11,089
they're you get those blurry predictions
 

2469
00:51:11,089 --> 00:51:12,490
they're you get those blurry predictions
and you can't do planning with very

2470
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:12,500
and you can't do planning with very
 

2471
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:15,039
and you can't do planning with very
predictions all right so if you have a

2472
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:15,049
predictions all right so if you have a
 

2473
00:51:15,049 --> 00:51:18,520
predictions all right so if you have a
perfect model of the world you can in

2474
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:18,530
perfect model of the world you can in
 

2475
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,839
perfect model of the world you can in
your head run this model with a

2476
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:21,849
your head run this model with a
 

2477
00:51:21,849 --> 00:51:24,069
your head run this model with a
hypothesis for a sequence of actions and

2478
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:24,079
hypothesis for a sequence of actions and
 

2479
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:25,299
hypothesis for a sequence of actions and
you're going to predict the outcome of

2480
00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:25,309
you're going to predict the outcome of
 

2481
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:28,900
you're going to predict the outcome of
that sequence of actions but if your

2482
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:28,910
that sequence of actions but if your
 

2483
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:32,620
that sequence of actions but if your
model is imperfect how can you plan yeah

2484
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:32,630
model is imperfect how can you plan yeah
 

2485
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,200
model is imperfect how can you plan yeah
it quickly explodes what are your

2486
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,210
it quickly explodes what are your
 

2487
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:37,390
it quickly explodes what are your

2597
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:10,240
have to run into thousands of trees it
will have to run off cliffs and you had

2598
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:10,250
will have to run off cliffs and you had
 

2599
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:11,680
will have to run off cliffs and you had
to run the cliff multiple times before

it figures out it's a bad idea first of

it figures out it's a bad idea first of
 

2603
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:14,890
it figures out it's a bad idea first of
all

all
 

2605
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,660
all
yeah and second of all the figures that

2606
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:16,670
yeah and second of all the figures that
 

2607
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,630
yeah and second of all the figures that
had not to do it and so I mean this type

2608
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:19,640
had not to do it and so I mean this type
 

2609
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:21,640
had not to do it and so I mean this type
of running obviously does not reflect

00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:21,650
of running obviously does not reflect
 

2611

you know we have a pretty good idea of
 

2657
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,640
you know we have a pretty good idea of
the effect of turning the wheel of the

2658
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:15,650
the effect of turning the wheel of the
 

2659
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,530
the effect of turning the wheel of the
car and you know we know we need to stay

2660
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:17,540
car and you know we know we need to stay
 

2661
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:18,880
car and you know we know we need to stay
on the road so there is a lot of things

2662
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:18,890
on the road so there is a lot of things
 

2663
00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:20,770
on the road so there is a lot of things
that we bring to the table which is

2664
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:20,780
that we bring to the table which is
 

2665
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,120
that we bring to the table which is
basically or predictive model of the

2666
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:22,130
basically or predictive model of the
 

2667
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:26,140
basically or predictive model of the
world and that model allows us to not do

2668
00:55:26,140 --> 00:55:26,150
world and that model allows us to not do
 

2669
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:28,150
world and that model allows us to not do
stupid things and to basically stay

2670
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:28,160
stupid things and to basically stay
 

2671
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,970
stupid things and to basically stay
within the context of things we need to

2672
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:30,980
within the context of things we need to
 

2673
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:33,070
within the context of things we need to
do we still face you know unpredictable

2674
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:33,080
do we still face you know unpredictable
 

2675
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:35,470
do we still face you know unpredictable
situations and that's how we learn but

2676
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:35,480
situations and that's how we learn but
 

2677
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,050
situations and that's how we learn but
that allows us to learn really really

2678
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:38,060
that allows us to learn really really
 

2679
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,370
that allows us to learn really really
really quickly so that's called

2680
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:39,380
really quickly so that's called
 

2681
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:42,090
really quickly so that's called
model-based reinforcement running

2682
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:42,100
model-based reinforcement running
 

2683
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:43,890
model-based reinforcement running
there's some imitation and supervised

2684
00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:43,900
there's some imitation and supervised
 

2685
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:45,570
there's some imitation and supervised
running because we have a driving

2686
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:45,580
running because we have a driving
 

2687
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,280
running because we have a driving
instructor that tells us occasionally

2688
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:47,290
instructor that tells us occasionally
 

2689
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,220
instructor that tells us occasionally
what to do but most of the learning is

2690
00:55:50,220 --> 00:55:50,230
what to do but most of the learning is
 

2691
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:53,250
what to do but most of the learning is
Mauro bass is learning the model yeah

2692
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:53,260
Mauro bass is learning the model yeah
 

2693
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:55,560
Mauro bass is learning the model yeah
running physics that we've done since we

2694
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:55,570
running physics that we've done since we
 

2695
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:57,540
running physics that we've done since we
were babies that's where all almost all

2696
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:57,550
were babies that's where all almost all
 

2697
00:55:57,550 --> 00:55:59,460
were babies that's where all almost all
are learning and the physics is somewhat

2698
00:55:59,460 --> 00:55:59,470
are learning and the physics is somewhat

scene to scene stupid things are the

2702
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:04,510
scene to scene stupid things are the
 

2703
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,900
scene to scene stupid things are the
same everywhere yeah I mean if you you

2704
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:06,910
same everywhere yeah I mean if you you
 

2705
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,700
same everywhere yeah I mean if you you
know you have experience of the world

2706
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:08,710
know you have experience of the world
 

2707
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:11,490
know you have experience of the world
you don't need to be particularly from a

2708
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:11,500
you don't need to be particularly from a
 

2709
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,840
you don't need to be particularly from a
particularly intelligent species to know

2710
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:12,850
particularly intelligent species to know
 

2711
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:16,730
particularly intelligent species to know
that if you spill water from a container

2712
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:16,740
that if you spill water from a container
 

2713
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,070
that if you spill water from a container
you know the rest is gonna get wet and

2714
00:56:20,070 --> 00:56:20,080
you know the rest is gonna get wet and
 

2715
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,340
you know the rest is gonna get wet and
you might get wet so you know cats know

2716
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:23,350
you might get wet so you know cats know
 

2717
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:26,520
you might get wet so you know cats know
this right yeah so the main problem we

2718
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:26,530
this right yeah so the main problem we
 

2719
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:29,130
this right yeah so the main problem we
need to solve is how do we learn models

2720
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:29,140
need to solve is how do we learn models
 

2721
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:30,870
need to solve is how do we learn models
of the world that's and that's what I'm

2722
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:30,880
of the world that's and that's what I'm
 

2723
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,070
of the world that's and that's what I'm
interesting that's what's a supervised

2724
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:32,080
interesting that's what's a supervised
 

2725
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:34,800
interesting that's what's a supervised
learning is all about if you were to try

2726
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:34,810
learning is all about if you were to try
 

2727
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:39,900
learning is all about if you were to try
to construct a benchmark for let's let's

2728
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:39,910
to construct a benchmark for let's let's
 

2729
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:41,910
to construct a benchmark for let's let's
look at happiness I'd love that dataset

2730
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:41,920
look at happiness I'd love that dataset
 

2731
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,060
look at happiness I'd love that dataset
but if you do you think it's useful

2732
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:45,070
but if you do you think it's useful
 

2733
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:50,550
but if you do you think it's useful
interesting / possible to perform well

2734
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:50,560
interesting / possible to perform well
 

2735
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,290
interesting / possible to perform well
on eminence with just one example of

2736
00:56:52,290 --> 00:56:52,300
on eminence with just one example of
 

2737
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:56,580
on eminence with just one example of
each digit and how would we solve that

2738
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:56,590
each digit and how would we solve that
 

2739
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:58,620
each digit and how would we solve that
problem

2740
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:58,630
problem
 

2741
00:56:58,630 --> 00:56:59,819
problem
yeah so it's probably yes the question

2742
00:56:59,819 --> 00:56:59,829
yeah so it's probably yes the question
 

2743
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:02,489
yeah so it's probably yes the question
is what other type of running are you

2744
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:02,499
is what other type of running are you
 

2745
00:57:02,499 --> 00:57:04,289
is what other type of running are you
allowed to do so if what you like to do

2746
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:04,299
allowed to do so if what you like to do
 

2747
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:06,120
allowed to do so if what you like to do
is train on some gigantic data set of

2748
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,130
is train on some gigantic data set of
 

2749
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,890
is train on some gigantic data set of
labelled digit that's called transfer

2750
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:07,900
labelled digit that's called transfer
 

2751
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,460
labelled digit that's called transfer
running and we know that works okay

2752
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:11,470
running and we know that works okay
 

2753
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:12,809
running and we know that works okay
we do this at Facebook like in

2754
00:57:12,809 --> 00:57:12,819
we do this at Facebook like in
 

2755
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:15,239
we do this at Facebook like in
production right we we train large

2756
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:15,249
production right we we train large
 

2757
00:57:15,249 --> 00:57:17,130
production right we we train large
commercial nets to predict hashtags that

2758
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:17,140
commercial nets to predict hashtags that
 

2759
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:18,630
commercial nets to predict hashtags that
people type on Instagram and we train on

2760
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:18,640
people type on Instagram and we train on
 

2761
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,009
people type on Instagram and we train on
billions of images literally billions

2762
00:57:20,009 --> 00:57:20,019
billions of images literally billions
 

2763
00:57:20,019 --> 00:57:22,829
billions of images literally billions
and and then we chop off the last layer

2764
00:57:22,829 --> 00:57:22,839
and and then we chop off the last layer
 

2765
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:24,719
and and then we chop off the last layer
and fine-tune on whatever task we want

2766
00:57:24,719 --> 00:57:24,729
and fine-tune on whatever task we want
 

2767
00:57:24,729 --> 00:57:27,329
and fine-tune on whatever task we want
that works really well you can be you

2768
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:27,339
that works really well you can be you
 

2769
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:28,859
that works really well you can be you
know the image net record with we

2770
00:57:28,859 --> 00:57:28,869
know the image net record with we
 

2771
00:57:28,869 --> 00:57:30,210
know the image net record with we
actually open source the whole thing

2772
00:57:30,210 --> 00:57:30,220
actually open source the whole thing
 

2773
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:32,849
actually open source the whole thing
like a few weeks ago yeah that's still

2774
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:32,859
like a few weeks ago yeah that's still
 

2775
00:57:32,859 --> 00:57:34,589
like a few weeks ago yeah that's still
pretty cool but yeah so what in yet

2776
00:57:34,589 --> 00:57:34,599
pretty cool but yeah so what in yet
 

2777
00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:37,499
pretty cool but yeah so what in yet
won't be impressive and what's useful an

2778
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:37,509
won't be impressive and what's useful an
 

2779
00:57:37,509 --> 00:57:38,940
won't be impressive and what's useful an
impressive what kind of transfer

2780
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:38,950
impressive what kind of transfer
 

2781
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:40,380
impressive what kind of transfer
learning would be useful impressive is

2782
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:40,390
learning would be useful impressive is
 

2783
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:42,809
learning would be useful impressive is
it Wikipedia that kind of thing no no I

2784
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:42,819
it Wikipedia that kind of thing no no I
 

2785
00:57:42,819 --> 00:57:45,180
it Wikipedia that kind of thing no no I
don't think transfer learning is really

2786
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:45,190
don't think transfer learning is really
 

2787
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:47,219
don't think transfer learning is really
where we should focus we should try to

2788
00:57:47,219 --> 00:57:47,229
where we should focus we should try to
 

2789
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:49,690
where we should focus we should try to
do

2790
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:49,700

 

2791
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,670

you know have a kind of scenario for

2792
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:51,680
you know have a kind of scenario for
 

2793
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,280
you know have a kind of scenario for
benchmark where you have only ball data

2794
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:54,290
benchmark where you have only ball data
 

2795
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:58,450
benchmark where you have only ball data
and you can and it's very large number

2796
00:57:58,450 --> 00:57:58,460
and you can and it's very large number
 

2797
00:57:58,460 --> 00:58:01,210
and you can and it's very large number
of enabled data it could be video clips

2798
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:01,220
of enabled data it could be video clips
 

2799
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:04,359
of enabled data it could be video clips
it could be what you do you know frame

2800
00:58:04,359 --> 00:58:04,369
it could be what you do you know frame
 

2801
00:58:04,369 --> 00:58:06,460
it could be what you do you know frame
prediction it could be images you could

2802
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:06,470
prediction it could be images you could
 

2803
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:11,319
prediction it could be images you could
choose to you know mask a piece of it it

2804
00:58:11,319 --> 00:58:11,329
choose to you know mask a piece of it it
 

2805

could be whatever but they're only bold

2806
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:13,040
could be whatever but they're only bold
 

2807
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:15,849
could be whatever but they're only bold
and you're not allowed to label them so

2808
00:58:15,849 --> 00:58:15,859
and you're not allowed to label them so
 

2809
00:58:15,859 --> 00:58:19,120
and you're not allowed to label them so
you do some training on this and then

2810
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:19,130
you do some training on this and then
 

2811
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:23,579
you do some training on this and then
you train on a particular supervised

2812
00:58:23,579 --> 00:58:23,589
you train on a particular supervised
 

2813
00:58:23,589 --> 00:58:27,460
you train on a particular supervised
task imagenet or nist and you measure

2814
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:27,470
task imagenet or nist and you measure
 

2815
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:31,329
task imagenet or nist and you measure
how your test our decrease or variation

2816
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:31,339
how your test our decrease or variation
 

2817
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:32,799
how your test our decrease or variation
error decreases as you increase the

2818
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:32,809
error decreases as you increase the
 

2819
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:36,370
error decreases as you increase the
number of label training samples okay

2820
00:58:36,370 --> 00:58:36,380
number of label training samples okay
 

2821
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:40,390
number of label training samples okay
and and what what you would like to see

2822
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:40,400
and and what what you would like to see
 

2823
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,569
and and what what you would like to see
is is that you know your your error

2824
00:58:43,569 --> 00:58:43,579
is is that you know your your error
 

2825
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:45,250
is is that you know your your error
decreases much faster than if you

2826
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:45,260
decreases much faster than if you
 

2827
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,700
decreases much faster than if you
trained from scratch from random weights

2828
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:47,710
trained from scratch from random weights
 

2829
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:49,960
trained from scratch from random weights
so that to reach the same level of

2830
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:49,970
so that to reach the same level of
 

2831
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:51,630
so that to reach the same level of
performance and a completely supervised

2832
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:51,640
performance and a completely supervised
 

2833
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,700
performance and a completely supervised
purely supervised system would reach you

2834
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:54,710
purely supervised system would reach you
 

2835
00:58:54,710 --> 00:58:56,770
purely supervised system would reach you
would need way fewer samples so that's

2836
00:58:56,770 --> 00:58:56,780
would need way fewer samples so that's
 

2837
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:58,299
would need way fewer samples so that's
the crucial question because it will

2838
00:58:58,299 --> 00:58:58,309
the crucial question because it will
 

2839
00:58:58,309 --> 00:59:00,250
the crucial question because it will
answer the question to like you know

just not gonna lead to a quantum leap

2864
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:32,390
just not gonna lead to a quantum leap
 

2865
00:59:32,390 --> 00:59:33,490
just not gonna lead to a quantum leap
it's just gonna make things that we

it's just gonna make things that we
 

2867
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,380
it's just gonna make things that we
already do so you're way smarter than me

I just disagree with you but I don't
 

2871
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:39,730
I just disagree with you but I don't
have anything to back that it's just

00:59:39,730 --> 00:59:39,740
have anything to back that it's just
 

2873
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:41,890
have anything to back that it's just
intuition so I've worked a lot of

2874
00:59:41,890 --> 00:59:41,900
intuition so I've worked a lot of
 

2875
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,270
intuition so I've worked a lot of
large-scale data sets and there's

2876
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:43,280
large-scale data sets and there's
 

2877
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,819
large-scale data sets and there's
something there might be magic and

2878
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:45,829
something there might be magic and
 

2879
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:48,670
something there might be magic and
active learning but okay at least I said

2880
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:48,680
active learning but okay at least I said
 

2881
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,789
active learning but okay at least I said
it publicly at least some being an idea

2882
00:59:51,789 --> 00:59:51,799
it publicly at least some being an idea
 

2883
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:54,400
it publicly at least some being an idea
publicly okay it's not bigoted yet it's

2884
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:54,410
publicly okay it's not bigoted yet it's
 

2885
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,049
publicly okay it's not bigoted yet it's
you know working with the data you have

2886
00:59:56,049 --> 00:59:56,059
you know working with the data you have
 

2887
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:57,730
you know working with the data you have
I mean I mean certainly people are doing

2888
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:57,740
I mean I mean certainly people are doing
 

2889
00:59:57,740 --> 00:59:59,500
I mean I mean certainly people are doing
things like okay I have three thousand

2890
00:59:59,500 --> 00:59:59,510
things like okay I have three thousand
 

2891
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:02,950
things like okay I have three thousand
hours of you know imitation running for

2892
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:02,960
hours of you know imitation running for
 

2893
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,570
hours of you know imitation running for
in car but most of those are incredibly

10% of them that are kind of the most
 

2899
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:10,839
10% of them that are kind of the most
informative and with just that I would

2900
01:00:10,839 --> 01:00:10,849
informative and with just that I would
 

2901
01:00:10,849 --> 01:00:13,089
informative and with just that I would
probably reach the same so it's a weak

2902
01:00:13,089 --> 01:00:13,099
probably reach the same so it's a weak
 

2903
01:00:13,099 --> 01:00:16,150
probably reach the same so it's a weak
form of of active running if you want

2904
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:16,160
form of of active running if you want
 

2905
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:19,480
form of of active running if you want
yes but there might be a much stronger

2906
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:19,490
yes but there might be a much stronger
 

2907
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,099
yes but there might be a much stronger
version yeah that's right that's what

2908
01:00:21,099 --> 01:00:21,109
version yeah that's right that's what
 

2909
01:00:21,109 --> 01:00:24,400
version yeah that's right that's what

too expensive for consumer cars but
 

3001
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:12,980
too expensive for consumer cars but
they're fine if you just run a fleet

3003
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,080

and you engineer the thing the hell out

3004
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:15,090
and you engineer the thing the hell out
 

3005
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:17,180
and you engineer the thing the hell out

01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:17,190
of the everything else you you map the
 

3007
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,130

construction and sort of you know things

3016
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:27,869

3017
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:31,070
construction and sort of you know things
that that weren't in your map and you

3018
01:02:31,070 --> 01:02:31,080
that that weren't in your map and you
 

3019
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,810
that that weren't in your map and you
can engineer a good you know slam system

3020
01:02:32,810 --> 01:02:32,820
can engineer a good you know slam system
 

3021
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:35,000
can engineer a good you know slam system
or eye stuff right so so that's kind of

3022
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,010
or eye stuff right so so that's kind of
 

3023
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:36,380
or eye stuff right so so that's kind of
the current approach that's closest to

3024
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:36,390
the current approach that's closest to
 

3025
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:37,850
the current approach that's closest to
some level of autonomy but I think

3026
01:02:37,850 --> 01:02:37,860
some level of autonomy but I think
 

3027
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,440
some level of autonomy but I think
eventually the long term solution is

3028
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:39,450
eventually the long term solution is
 

3029
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:43,070
eventually the long term solution is
going to rely more and more on learning

3030
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:43,080
going to rely more and more on learning
 

3031
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,050
going to rely more and more on learning
and possibly using a combination of

3032
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:45,060
and possibly using a combination of
 

3033
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:48,280
and possibly using a combination of
supervised learning and model-based

3034
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:48,290
supervised learning and model-based
 

3035
01:02:48,290 --> 01:02:50,960
supervised learning and model-based
reinforcement or something like that but

3036
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:50,970
reinforcement or something like that but
 

3037
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:54,200
reinforcement or something like that but
ultimately learning will be at not just

3038
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:54,210
ultimately learning will be at not just
 

3039
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,910
ultimately learning will be at not just
at the core but really the fundamental

3040
01:02:55,910 --> 01:02:55,920
at the core but really the fundamental
 

3041
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,100
at the core but really the fundamental
part of the system yeah it already is

3042
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:58,110
part of the system yeah it already is
 

3043
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,590
part of the system yeah it already is
but it'll become more and more what do

3044
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:00,600
but it'll become more and more what do
 

3045
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,540
but it'll become more and more what do
you think it takes to build a system

3046
01:03:02,540 --> 01:03:02,550
you think it takes to build a system
 

3047
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:04,460
you think it takes to build a system
with human level intelligence you talked

3048
01:03:04,460 --> 01:03:04,470
with human level intelligence you talked
 

3049
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:06,940
with human level intelligence you talked
about the AI system and then we her

3050
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:06,950
about the AI system and then we her
 

3051
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:09,530
about the AI system and then we her
being way out of reach our current reach

3052
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:09,540
being way out of reach our current reach
 

3053
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,440
being way out of reach our current reach
this might be outdated as well but this

3054
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:12,450
this might be outdated as well but this
 

3055
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:16,280
this might be outdated as well but this
is still way out of reach what would it

3056
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:16,290
is still way out of reach what would it
 

3057
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:20,359
is still way out of reach what would it
take to build her do you think so I can

3058
01:03:20,359 --> 01:03:20,369
take to build her do you think so I can
 

3059
01:03:20,369 --> 01:03:21,890
take to build her do you think so I can
tell you the first two obstacles that we

3060
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:21,900
tell you the first two obstacles that we
 

3061
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,420
tell you the first two obstacles that we
have to clear but I don't know how many

3062
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:23,430
have to clear but I don't know how many
 

3063
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:25,070
have to clear but I don't know how many
obstacles they are after this so the

3064
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:25,080
obstacles they are after this so the
 

3065
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:26,810
obstacles they are after this so the
image I usually use is that there is a

3066
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:26,820
image I usually use is that there is a
 

3067
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,220
image I usually use is that there is a
bunch of mountains that we have to climb

3068
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:28,230
bunch of mountains that we have to climb
 

3069
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,900
bunch of mountains that we have to climb
and we can see the first one but we

3070
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:29,910
and we can see the first one but we
 

3071
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,220
and we can see the first one but we
don't know if there are 50 mountains

3072
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:31,230
don't know if there are 50 mountains
 

3073
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,620
don't know if there are 50 mountains
behind it or not and this might be a

3074
01:03:33,620 --> 01:03:33,630
behind it or not and this might be a
 

3075
01:03:33,630 --> 01:03:37,340
behind it or not and this might be a
good sort of metaphor for why AI

3076
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:37,350
good sort of metaphor for why AI
 

3077
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:38,900
good sort of metaphor for why AI

you have problems okay and of course if

01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:53,850
you have problems okay and of course if
 

3089
01:03:53,850 --> 01:03:54,980
you have problems okay and of course if
it's you realize is that all the

01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:54,990
it's you realize is that all the
 

3091
01:03:54,990 --> 01:03:56,300
it's you realize is that all the

and so you can't actually use it for
 

3095
01:03:57,510 --> 01:04:00,650
and so you can't actually use it for
anything useful but you know yes oh yeah

01:04:02,730 --> 01:04:03,980
all you see is the first peak so in

French University and he he has his
 

3123
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:38,460
French University and he he has his
chart that shows that which how many

3124
01:04:38,460 --> 01:04:38,470
chart that shows that which how many
 

3125
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:40,830
chart that shows that which how many
months of life baby humans kind of

3126
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:40,840
months of life baby humans kind of
 

3127
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,990
months of life baby humans kind of
learned different concepts and you can

3128
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:43,000
learned different concepts and you can
 

3129
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:47,010
learned different concepts and you can
met you can measure this various ways so

3130
01:04:47,010 --> 01:04:47,020
met you can measure this various ways so
 

3131
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:50,970
met you can measure this various ways so
things like distinguishing animate

3132
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:50,980
things like distinguishing animate
 

3133
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,860
things like distinguishing animate
objects from animate inanimate object

3134
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:52,870
objects from animate inanimate object
 

3135
01:04:52,870 --> 01:04:54,360
objects from animate inanimate object
you can you can tell the difference at

3136
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:54,370
you can you can tell the difference at
 

3137
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:58,260
you can you can tell the difference at
age to three months whether an object is

3138
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:58,270
age to three months whether an object is
 

3139
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,820
age to three months whether an object is
going to stay stable is gonna fall you

3140
01:04:59,820 --> 01:04:59,830
going to stay stable is gonna fall you
 

3141
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:03,570
going to stay stable is gonna fall you
know about four months you can tell you

3142
01:05:03,570 --> 01:05:03,580
know about four months you can tell you
 

3143
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:06,330
know about four months you can tell you
know things like this and then things

3144
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:06,340
know things like this and then things
 

3145
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:07,860
know things like this and then things
like gravity the fact that objects are

3146
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:07,870
like gravity the fact that objects are
 

3147
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:09,750
like gravity the fact that objects are
not supposed to float in the air but as

3148
01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:09,760
not supposed to float in the air but as
 

3149
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:11,670
not supposed to float in the air but as
opposed to fall you run this around the

3150
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:11,680
opposed to fall you run this around the
 

3151
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,040
opposed to fall you run this around the
age of eight or nine months if you look

3152
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:14,050
age of eight or nine months if you look
 

3153
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:15,270
age of eight or nine months if you look
at a lot of you know eight month old

3154
01:05:15,270 --> 01:05:15,280
at a lot of you know eight month old
 

3155
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,030
at a lot of you know eight month old
babies you give them a bunch of toys on

3156
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:18,040
babies you give them a bunch of toys on
 

3157
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,620
babies you give them a bunch of toys on
the highchair first thing they do is

3158
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:19,630
the highchair first thing they do is
 

3159
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:20,820
the highchair first thing they do is
it's why I'm on the ground that you look

3160
01:05:20,820 --> 01:05:20,830
it's why I'm on the ground that you look
 

3161
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,650
it's why I'm on the ground that you look
at them it's because you know they're

3162
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:22,660
at them it's because you know they're
 

3163
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,200
at them it's because you know they're
learning about actively learning about

3164
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:25,210
learning about actively learning about
 

3165
01:05:25,210 --> 01:05:28,530
learning about actively learning about
gravity gravity yeah okay so they're not

3166
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:28,540
gravity gravity yeah okay so they're not
 

3167
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:30,840
gravity gravity yeah okay so they're not
trying to know you but they you know

3168
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:30,850
trying to know you but they you know
 

3169
01:05:30,850 --> 01:05:32,250
trying to know you but they you know
they need to do the experiment right

3170
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:32,260
they need to do the experiment right
 

3171
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:34,680
they need to do the experiment right
yeah so you know how do we get machines

3172
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:34,690
yeah so you know how do we get machines
 

3173
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:36,960
yeah so you know how do we get machines
to learn like babies mostly by

3174
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:36,970
to learn like babies mostly by
 

3175
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,010
to learn like babies mostly by
observation with a little bit of

3176
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:38,020
observation with a little bit of
 

3177
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,140
observation with a little bit of
interaction and learning those those

3178
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:40,150
interaction and learning those those
 

3179
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:41,580
interaction and learning those those
those models of the world because I

3180
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:41,590
those models of the world because I
 

3181
01:05:41,590 --> 01:05:43,700
those models of the world because I
think that's really a crucial piece of

3182
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:43,710
think that's really a crucial piece of
 

3183
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:46,530
think that's really a crucial piece of
an intelligent autonomous system so if

3184
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:46,540
an intelligent autonomous system so if
 

3185
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:47,670
an intelligent autonomous system so if
you think about the architecture of an

3186
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:47,680
you think about the architecture of an
 

3187
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,830
you think about the architecture of an
intelligent autonomous system it needs

3188
01:05:49,830 --> 01:05:49,840
intelligent autonomous system it needs
 

3189
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,210
intelligent autonomous system it needs
to have a predictive model of the world

3190
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:51,220
to have a predictive model of the world
 

3191
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:53,400
to have a predictive model of the world
so something that says here is a wall

3192
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:53,410
so something that says here is a wall
 

3193
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:54,900
so something that says here is a wall
that time T here is a stable world at

3194
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:54,910
that time T here is a stable world at
 

3195
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,220
that time T here is a stable world at
time T plus one if I take this action

3196
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:56,230
time T plus one if I take this action
 

3197
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:59,690
time T plus one if I take this action
and it's not a single answer it can be

3198
01:05:59,690 --> 01:05:59,700
and it's not a single answer it can be
 

3199
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:02,430
and it's not a single answer it can be
education yeah yeah well but we don't

3200
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:02,440
education yeah yeah well but we don't
 

3201
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:03,780
education yeah yeah well but we don't
know how to represent distributions in

3202
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:03,790
know how to represent distributions in
 

3203
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,040
know how to represent distributions in
high dimension continuous basis so it's

3204
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:05,050
high dimension continuous basis so it's
 

3205
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:06,270
high dimension continuous basis so it's
got to be something we care that data

3206
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:06,280
got to be something we care that data
 

3207
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:08,910
got to be something we care that data
Hey but with some summer presentation

3208
01:06:08,910 --> 01:06:08,920
Hey but with some summer presentation
 

3209
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:12,240
Hey but with some summer presentation
with certainty if you have that then you

3210
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:12,250
with certainty if you have that then you
 

3211
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:13,920
with certainty if you have that then you
can do what optimal control theory is

3212
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:13,930
can do what optimal control theory is
 

3213
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,630
can do what optimal control theory is
called model predictive control which

3214
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:15,640
called model predictive control which
 

3215
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:17,760
called model predictive control which
means that you can run your model with

3216
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:17,770
means that you can run your model with
 

3217
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:19,770
means that you can run your model with
the hypothesis for a sequence of action

3218
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:19,780
the hypothesis for a sequence of action
 

3219
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:22,320
the hypothesis for a sequence of action
and then see the result now what you

3220
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:22,330
and then see the result now what you
 

3221
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:23,520
and then see the result now what you
need the other thing you need is some

3222
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:23,530
need the other thing you need is some
 

3223
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:25,260
need the other thing you need is some
sort of objective that you want to

3224
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:25,270
sort of objective that you want to
 

3225
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:27,300
sort of objective that you want to
optimize am i reaching the goal of

3226
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:27,310
optimize am i reaching the goal of
 

3227
01:06:27,310 --> 01:06:29,280
optimize am i reaching the goal of
grabbing the subject about minimizing

3228
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:29,290
grabbing the subject about minimizing
 

3229
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:30,570
grabbing the subject about minimizing
energy am I

3230
01:06:30,570 --> 01:06:30,580
energy am I
 

3231
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:32,390
energy am I
whatever right so there is some sort of

3232
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:32,400
whatever right so there is some sort of
 

3233
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,770
whatever right so there is some sort of
objectives that you have to minimize and

3234
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:34,780
objectives that you have to minimize and
 

3235
01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:36,570
objectives that you have to minimize and
so in your head if you had this model

3236
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:36,580
so in your head if you had this model
 

3237
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:37,980
so in your head if you had this model
you can figure out the sequence of

3238
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:37,990
you can figure out the sequence of
 

3239
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,160
you can figure out the sequence of
action that will optimize your objective

3240
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:40,170
action that will optimize your objective
 

3241
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:42,840
action that will optimize your objective
that objective is something that

3242
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:42,850
that objective is something that
 

3243
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,210
that objective is something that
ultimately is rooted in your basal

3244
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:45,220
ultimately is rooted in your basal
 

3245
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:46,440
ultimately is rooted in your basal
ganglia at least in the human brain

3246
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:46,450
ganglia at least in the human brain
 

3247
01:06:46,450 --> 01:06:48,200
ganglia at least in the human brain
that's that's what is available Gambia

3248
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:48,210
that's that's what is available Gambia
 

3249
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:50,880
that's that's what is available Gambia
computes your level of contentment or

3250
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:50,890
computes your level of contentment or
 

3251
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:53,040
computes your level of contentment or
miss contentment oh no noise that's a

3252
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:53,050
miss contentment oh no noise that's a
 

3253
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:56,790
miss contentment oh no noise that's a
word unhappiness okay yeah this

3254
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:56,800
word unhappiness okay yeah this
 

3255
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:59,880
word unhappiness okay yeah this
contentment this contentment and so your

3256
01:06:59,880 --> 01:06:59,890
contentment this contentment and so your
 

3257
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:03,420
contentment this contentment and so your
entire behavior is driven towards kind

3258
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:03,430
entire behavior is driven towards kind
 

3259
01:07:03,430 --> 01:07:05,100
entire behavior is driven towards kind
of minimizing that objective which is

3260
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:05,110
of minimizing that objective which is
 

3261
01:07:05,110 --> 01:07:07,950
of minimizing that objective which is
maximizing your contentment computed by

3262
01:07:07,950 --> 01:07:07,960
maximizing your contentment computed by
 

3263
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,670
maximizing your contentment computed by
your your basal ganglia and what you

3264
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:11,680
your your basal ganglia and what you
 

3265
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:13,650
your your basal ganglia and what you
have is an objective function which is

3266
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:13,660
have is an objective function which is
 

3267
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,390
have is an objective function which is
basically a predictor of what your basal

3268
01:07:15,390 --> 01:07:15,400
basically a predictor of what your basal
 

3269
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,790
basically a predictor of what your basal
ganglia is going to tell you so you're

3270
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:17,800
ganglia is going to tell you so you're
 

3271
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:18,870
ganglia is going to tell you so you're
not going to put your hand on fire

3272
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:18,880
not going to put your hand on fire
 

3273
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,210
not going to put your hand on fire
because you know it's gonna you know

3274
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:21,220
because you know it's gonna you know
 

3275
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:23,220
because you know it's gonna you know
it's gonna burn and you're gonna get

3276
01:07:23,220 --> 01:07:23,230
it's gonna burn and you're gonna get
 

3277
01:07:23,230 --> 01:07:24,840
it's gonna burn and you're gonna get
hurt and you're predicting this because

3278
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:24,850
hurt and you're predicting this because
 

3279
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:27,230
hurt and you're predicting this because
of your model of the world and your your

3280
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:27,240
of your model of the world and your your
 

3281
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,300
of your model of the world and your your
predictor of this objective right so you

3282
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:30,310
predictor of this objective right so you
 

3283
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,190
predictor of this objective right so you
if you have those you have those three

3284
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:32,200
if you have those you have those three
 

3285
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:35,250
if you have those you have those three
components you have four components you

3286
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:35,260
components you have four components you
 

3287
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:38,370
components you have four components you
have the the hard-wired contentment

3288
01:07:38,370 --> 01:07:38,380
have the the hard-wired contentment
 

3289
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:42,090
have the the hard-wired contentment
objective good computer if you want

3290
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:42,100
objective good computer if you want
 

3291
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,550
objective good computer if you want
calculator and then you have the three

3292
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:44,560
calculator and then you have the three
 

3293
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,110
calculator and then you have the three
components one is the objective

3294
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:46,120
components one is the objective
 

3295
01:07:46,120 --> 01:07:47,670
components one is the objective
predictor which basically predicts your

3296
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:47,680
predictor which basically predicts your
 

3297
01:07:47,680 --> 01:07:51,210
predictor which basically predicts your
level of contact and one is the model of

3298
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:51,220
level of contact and one is the model of
 

3299
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:53,490
level of contact and one is the model of
the world and there's a third module I

3300
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:53,500
the world and there's a third module I
 

3301
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:55,440
the world and there's a third module I
didn't mention which is a module that

3302
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:55,450
didn't mention which is a module that
 

3303
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:58,080
didn't mention which is a module that
will figure out the best course of

3304
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:58,090
will figure out the best course of
 

3305
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,720
will figure out the best course of
action to optimize an objective given

3306
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:00,730
action to optimize an objective given
 

3307
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:06,030
action to optimize an objective given
your model okay yeah cool it's a policy

3308
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:06,040
your model okay yeah cool it's a policy
 

3309
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,740
your model okay yeah cool it's a policy
policy network or something like that

3310
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:07,750
policy network or something like that
 

3311
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:11,220
policy network or something like that
right now you need those three

3312
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:11,230
right now you need those three
 

3313
01:08:11,230 --> 01:08:12,720
right now you need those three
components to act autonomously

3314
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:12,730
components to act autonomously
 

3315
01:08:12,730 --> 01:08:14,910
components to act autonomously
intelligently and you can be stupid in

3316
01:08:14,910 --> 01:08:14,920
intelligently and you can be stupid in
 

3317
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,740
intelligently and you can be stupid in
three different ways you can be stupid

3318
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:16,750
three different ways you can be stupid
 

3319
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,630
three different ways you can be stupid
because your model of the world is wrong

3320
01:08:18,630 --> 01:08:18,640
because your model of the world is wrong
 

3321
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:20,880
because your model of the world is wrong
you can be stupid because your objective

3322
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:20,890
you can be stupid because your objective
 

3323
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:23,099
you can be stupid because your objective
is not aligned with what you actually

3324
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:23,109
is not aligned with what you actually
 

3325
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:27,660
is not aligned with what you actually
want to achieve okay and in humans that

3326
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:27,670
want to achieve okay and in humans that
 

3327
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:30,590
want to achieve okay and in humans that
would be a psychopath right and then the

3328
01:08:30,590 --> 01:08:30,600
would be a psychopath right and then the
 

3329
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:32,970
would be a psychopath right and then the
the third thing you the third way you

3330
01:08:32,970 --> 01:08:32,980
the third thing you the third way you
 

3331
01:08:32,980 --> 01:08:34,530
the third thing you the third way you
can be stupid is that you have the right

3332
01:08:34,530 --> 01:08:34,540
can be stupid is that you have the right
 

3333
01:08:34,540 --> 01:08:36,450
can be stupid is that you have the right
model you have the right objective but

3334
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:36,460
model you have the right objective but
 

3335
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:38,099
model you have the right objective but
you're unable to figure out a course of

3336
01:08:38,099 --> 01:08:38,109
you're unable to figure out a course of
 

3337
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:40,079
you're unable to figure out a course of
action to optimize your objective given

3338
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:40,089
action to optimize your objective given
 

3339
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:43,280
action to optimize your objective given
your model

3340
01:08:43,280 --> 01:08:43,290

 

3341
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:45,420

some people who are in charge of big

3342
01:08:45,420 --> 01:08:45,430
some people who are in charge of big
 

3343
01:08:45,430 --> 01:08:46,950
some people who are in charge of big
countries actually have all three that

3344
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:46,960
countries actually have all three that
 

3345
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:51,630
countries actually have all three that
are wrong all right which countries I

3346
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:51,640
are wrong all right which countries I
 

3347
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,300
are wrong all right which countries I
don't know okay so if we think about

3348
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:54,310
don't know okay so if we think about
 

3349
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:56,550
don't know okay so if we think about
this this agent if you think about the

3350
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:56,560
this this agent if you think about the
 

3351
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:02,220
this this agent if you think about the
movie her you've criticized the art

3352
01:09:02,220 --> 01:09:02,230
movie her you've criticized the art
 

3353
01:09:02,230 --> 01:09:04,430
movie her you've criticized the art
project that is Sophia the robot and

3354
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:04,440
project that is Sophia the robot and
 

3355
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,170
project that is Sophia the robot and
what that project essentially does is

3356
01:09:07,170 --> 01:09:07,180
what that project essentially does is
 

3357
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:09,479
what that project essentially does is
uses our natural inclination to

3358
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:09,489
uses our natural inclination to
 

3359
01:09:09,489 --> 01:09:12,450
uses our natural inclination to
anthropomorphize things that look like

3360
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:12,460
anthropomorphize things that look like
 

3361
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:15,360
anthropomorphize things that look like
human and given more do you think that

3362
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:15,370
human and given more do you think that
 

3363
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:18,120
human and given more do you think that
could be used by AI systems like in the

3364
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:18,130
could be used by AI systems like in the
 

3365
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:20,450
could be used by AI systems like in the
movie her

3366
01:09:20,450 --> 01:09:20,460
movie her
 

3367
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:23,510
movie her
so do you think that body is needed to

3368
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:23,520
so do you think that body is needed to
 

3369
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,959
so do you think that body is needed to
create a feeling of intelligence

3370
01:09:26,959 --> 01:09:26,969
create a feeling of intelligence
 

3371
01:09:26,969 --> 01:09:29,300
create a feeling of intelligence
well if Sophia was just an art piece I

3372
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:29,310
well if Sophia was just an art piece I
 

3373
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,620
well if Sophia was just an art piece I
would have no problem with it but it's

3374
01:09:30,620 --> 01:09:30,630
would have no problem with it but it's
 

3375
01:09:30,630 --> 01:09:33,470
would have no problem with it but it's
presented as something else let me add

Sofia could change something about their

3380
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:39,060
Sofia could change something about their
 

3381
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,910

marketing or behavior in general what

3382
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:40,920
marketing or behavior in general what
 

3383
01:09:40,920 --> 01:09:43,280
marketing or behavior in general what
would it be what what's just about

3384
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:43,290
would it be what what's just about
 

3385
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:48,860
would it be what what's just about
everything I mean don't you think here's

3386
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:48,870
everything I mean don't you think here's
 

3387
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:51,410
everything I mean don't you think here's
a tough question I mean so I agree with

3388
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:51,420
a tough question I mean so I agree with
 

3389
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:54,500
a tough question I mean so I agree with
you so Sofia is not in the general

3390
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:54,510
you so Sofia is not in the general
 

3391
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,919
you so Sofia is not in the general
public feels that Sofia can do way more

3392
01:09:57,919 --> 01:09:57,929
public feels that Sofia can do way more
 

3393
01:09:57,929 --> 01:10:00,310
public feels that Sofia can do way more
than she actually can that's right and

3394
01:10:00,310 --> 01:10:00,320
than she actually can that's right and
 

3395
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:04,360
than she actually can that's right and
the people will create a Sofia are not

3396
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:04,370
the people will create a Sofia are not
 

3397
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:08,570

tough question don't you think this the
 

3403
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:21,169
tough question don't you think this the
same thing is scientists in industry and

01:10:21,169 --> 01:10:21,179
same thing is scientists in industry and
 

3405

01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,979
generally not very forgiving of of you
know unsupported claims of this type and

3434
01:10:56,979 --> 01:10:56,989
know unsupported claims of this type and
 

3435
01:10:56,989 --> 01:10:59,149
know unsupported claims of this type and
but there are certainly quite a few

3436
01:10:59,149 --> 01:10:59,159
but there are certainly quite a few
 

3437
01:10:59,159 --> 01:11:01,790
but there are certainly quite a few
startups that have had a huge amount of

3438
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:01,800
startups that have had a huge amount of
 

3439
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:04,850
startups that have had a huge amount of
hype around this that I find extremely

3440
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:04,860
hype around this that I find extremely
 

3441
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:06,530
hype around this that I find extremely
damaging and I've been calling it out

3442
01:11:06,530 --> 01:11:06,540
damaging and I've been calling it out
 

3443
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,350
damaging and I've been calling it out
when I've seen it so yeah but to go back

3444
01:11:09,350 --> 01:11:09,360
when I've seen it so yeah but to go back
 

3445
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,689
when I've seen it so yeah but to go back
to your original question like the

3446
01:11:11,689 --> 01:11:11,699
to your original question like the
 

3447
01:11:11,699 --> 01:11:14,209
to your original question like the
necessity of embodiment I think I don't

3448
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:14,219
necessity of embodiment I think I don't
 

3449
01:11:14,219 --> 01:11:15,709
necessity of embodiment I think I don't
think embodiment is necessary I think

3450
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:15,719
think embodiment is necessary I think
 

3451
01:11:15,719 --> 01:11:18,140
think embodiment is necessary I think
grounding is necessary so I don't think

3452
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:18,150
grounding is necessary so I don't think
 

3453
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,729
grounding is necessary so I don't think
we're gonna get machines that I really

3454
01:11:19,729 --> 01:11:19,739
we're gonna get machines that I really
 

3455
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:21,050
we're gonna get machines that I really
understand language without some level

3456
01:11:21,050 --> 01:11:21,060
understand language without some level
 

3457
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:22,669
understand language without some level
of grounding in the world world and it's

3458
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:22,679
of grounding in the world world and it's
 

3459
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,800
of grounding in the world world and it's
not clear to me that language is a kind

3460
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:24,810
not clear to me that language is a kind
 

3461
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:26,959
not clear to me that language is a kind
of bandwidth medium to communicate how

3462
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:26,969
of bandwidth medium to communicate how
 

3463
01:11:26,969 --> 01:11:30,110
of bandwidth medium to communicate how
the real world works I think what this

3464
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:30,120
the real world works I think what this
 

3465
01:11:30,120 --> 01:11:32,479
the real world works I think what this
doctor ground our grounding means so

3466
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:32,489
doctor ground our grounding means so
 

3467
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,040
doctor ground our grounding means so
running me he's that

3468
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,050
running me he's that
 

3469
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:35,750
running me he's that
so there is this classic problem of

3470
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:35,760
so there is this classic problem of
 

3471
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,300
so there is this classic problem of
common sense reasoning you know the the

3472
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:38,310
common sense reasoning you know the the
 

3473
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:41,750
common sense reasoning you know the the
Winograd Winograd schema right and so I

3474
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:41,760
Winograd Winograd schema right and so I
 

3475
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:44,540
Winograd Winograd schema right and so I
tell you the the trophy doesn't fit in

3476
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:44,550
tell you the the trophy doesn't fit in
 

3477
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:45,860
tell you the the trophy doesn't fit in
the suitcase because this tool is too

3478
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:45,870
the suitcase because this tool is too
 

3479
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,420
the suitcase because this tool is too
big what the trophy doesn't fit in the

3480
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:47,430
big what the trophy doesn't fit in the
 

3481
01:11:47,430 --> 01:11:49,550
big what the trophy doesn't fit in the
suitcase because it's too small and the

3482
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:49,560
suitcase because it's too small and the
 

3483
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:51,410
suitcase because it's too small and the
it in the first case refers to the

3484
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:51,420
it in the first case refers to the
 

3485
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:52,580
it in the first case refers to the
trophy in the second case to the

3486
01:11:52,580 --> 01:11:52,590
trophy in the second case to the
 

3487
01:11:52,590 --> 01:11:54,800
trophy in the second case to the
suitcase and the reason you can figure

3488
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:54,810
suitcase and the reason you can figure
 

3489
01:11:54,810 --> 01:11:56,000
suitcase and the reason you can figure
this out is because you know what the

3490
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:56,010
this out is because you know what the
 

3491
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:57,380
this out is because you know what the
trophy in the suitcase are you know one

3492
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:57,390
trophy in the suitcase are you know one
 

3493
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,790
trophy in the suitcase are you know one
is supposed to fit in the other one and

3494
01:11:58,790 --> 01:11:58,800
is supposed to fit in the other one and
 

3495
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,220
is supposed to fit in the other one and
you know the notion of size and the big

3496
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:01,230
you know the notion of size and the big
 

3497
01:12:01,230 --> 01:12:03,110
you know the notion of size and the big
object doesn't fit in a small object and

3498
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:03,120
object doesn't fit in a small object and
 

3499
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,850
object doesn't fit in a small object and
this is a TARDIS you know it things like

3500
01:12:04,850 --> 01:12:04,860
this is a TARDIS you know it things like
 

3501
01:12:04,860 --> 01:12:06,980
this is a TARDIS you know it things like
that right so you have this got this

3502
01:12:06,980 --> 01:12:06,990
that right so you have this got this
 

3503
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,660
that right so you have this got this
knowledge of how the world works of

3504
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:08,670
knowledge of how the world works of
 

3505
01:12:08,670 --> 01:12:12,740
knowledge of how the world works of
geometry and things like that I don't

3506
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:12,750
geometry and things like that I don't
 

3507
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:14,150
geometry and things like that I don't
believe you can learn everything about

3508
01:12:14,150 --> 01:12:14,160
believe you can learn everything about
 

3509
01:12:14,160 --> 01:12:16,640
believe you can learn everything about
the world by just being told in language

3510
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:16,650
the world by just being told in language
 

3511
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,530
the world by just being told in language
how the world works I think you need

3512
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:18,540
how the world works I think you need
 

3513
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:21,380
how the world works I think you need
some low-level perception of the world

3514
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:21,390
some low-level perception of the world
 

3515
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:23,210
some low-level perception of the world
you know be a visual touch you know

3516
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:23,220
you know be a visual touch you know
 

3517
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:25,180
you know be a visual touch you know
whatever but some higher bandwidth

3518
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:25,190
whatever but some higher bandwidth
 

3519
01:12:25,190 --> 01:12:27,230
whatever but some higher bandwidth
perceptions of the world but by reading

3520
01:12:27,230 --> 01:12:27,240
perceptions of the world but by reading
 

3521
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:29,780
perceptions of the world but by reading
all the world's text you still may not

3522
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:29,790
all the world's text you still may not
 

3523
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,630
all the world's text you still may not
have enough information that's right

3524
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:31,640
have enough information that's right
 

3525
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:34,130
have enough information that's right
there's a lot of things that just will

3526
01:12:34,130 --> 01:12:34,140
there's a lot of things that just will
 

3527
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:35,960
there's a lot of things that just will
never appear in text and that you can't

3528
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:35,970
never appear in text and that you can't
 

3529
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,080
never appear in text and that you can't
really infer so I think common sense

3530
01:12:39,080 --> 01:12:39,090
really infer so I think common sense
 

3531
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:42,110
really infer so I think common sense
will emerge from you know certainly a

3532
01:12:42,110 --> 01:12:42,120
will emerge from you know certainly a
 

3533
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:43,670
will emerge from you know certainly a
lot of language interaction but also

3534
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:43,680
lot of language interaction but also
 

3535
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,160
lot of language interaction but also
with watching videos or perhaps even

3536
01:12:46,160 --> 01:12:46,170
with watching videos or perhaps even
 

3537
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:47,690
with watching videos or perhaps even
interacting in the in virtual

3538
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:47,700
interacting in the in virtual
 

3539
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:50,660
interacting in the in virtual
environments and possibly you know robot

3540
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:50,670
environments and possibly you know robot
 

3541
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:52,070
environments and possibly you know robot
interacting in the real world but I

3542
01:12:52,070 --> 01:12:52,080
interacting in the real world but I
 

3543
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,660
interacting in the real world but I
don't actually believe necessarily that

3544
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:53,670
don't actually believe necessarily that
 

3545
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,490
don't actually believe necessarily that
this last one is absolutely necessary

3546
01:12:55,490 --> 01:12:55,500
this last one is absolutely necessary
 

3547
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:57,770
this last one is absolutely necessary
but I think there's a need for some

3548
01:12:57,770 --> 01:12:57,780
but I think there's a need for some
 

3549
01:12:57,780 --> 01:13:02,090
but I think there's a need for some
grounding but the final product doesn't

3550
01:13:02,090 --> 01:13:02,100
grounding but the final product doesn't
 

3551
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:04,070
grounding but the final product doesn't
necessarily need to be embodied you know

3552
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:04,080
necessarily need to be embodied you know
 

3553
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,930
necessarily need to be embodied you know
who say no it just needs to have an

3554
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:05,940
who say no it just needs to have an
 

3555
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:08,390
who say no it just needs to have an
awareness a grounding right but it needs

3556
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:08,400
awareness a grounding right but it needs
 

3557
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,990
awareness a grounding right but it needs
to know how the world works to have you

3558
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:12,000
to know how the world works to have you
 

3559
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,850
to know how the world works to have you
know to not be frustrated frustrating to

3560
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:13,860
know to not be frustrated frustrating to
 

3561
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:17,480
know to not be frustrated frustrating to
talk to and you talked about emotions

3562
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:17,490
talk to and you talked about emotions
 

3563
01:13:17,490 --> 01:13:20,540
talk to and you talked about emotions
being important that's that's a whole

01:13:23,060 --> 01:13:23,070
nother topic well so you know I talked
 

3567
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:26,090
nother topic well so you know I talked
about this the the basal ganglia ganglia

3568
01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:26,100
about this the the basal ganglia ganglia
 

3569
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:30,080
about this the the basal ganglia ganglia
as the you know this thing that could

to do a prediction of whether you're
going to be content or not that's the

going to be content or not that's the
 

3581
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:40,820
going to be content or not that's the

01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,910
that can happen to you right
you have this inkling that there is some

01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:48,920
you have this inkling that there is some
 

3589
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:50,200
you have this inkling that there is some
chance that something really bad is

3590
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:50,210
chance that something really bad is
 

3591
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,370
chance that something really bad is
gonna happen to you and that creates

3592
01:13:51,370 --> 01:13:51,380
gonna happen to you and that creates
 

3593
01:13:51,380 --> 01:13:52,990
gonna happen to you and that creates
here when you know for sure that

3594
01:13:52,990 --> 01:13:53,000
here when you know for sure that
 

3595
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,550
here when you know for sure that
something bad is gonna happen to you you

3596
01:13:54,550 --> 01:13:54,560
something bad is gonna happen to you you
 

3597
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,260
something bad is gonna happen to you you
cannot give up right it's not bad

3598
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:56,270
cannot give up right it's not bad
 

3599
01:13:56,270 --> 01:13:58,660
cannot give up right it's not bad
anymore it's uncertainty it creates fear

3600
01:13:58,660 --> 01:13:58,670
anymore it's uncertainty it creates fear
 

3601
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,270
anymore it's uncertainty it creates fear
so so the punchline is yes we're not

3602
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:01,280
so so the punchline is yes we're not
 

3603
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,620
so so the punchline is yes we're not
gonna have a ton of intelligence without

3604
01:14:02,620 --> 01:14:02,630
gonna have a ton of intelligence without
 

3605
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:08,680
gonna have a ton of intelligence without
emotions whatever the heck emotions are

3606
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:08,690
emotions whatever the heck emotions are
 

3607
01:14:08,690 --> 01:14:10,390
emotions whatever the heck emotions are
so you mentioned very practical things

3608
01:14:10,390 --> 01:14:10,400
so you mentioned very practical things
 

3609
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,520
so you mentioned very practical things
of fear but there's a lot of other mess

3610
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:12,530
of fear but there's a lot of other mess
 

3611
01:14:12,530 --> 01:14:14,470
of fear but there's a lot of other mess
around but there are kind of the results

3612
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:14,480
around but there are kind of the results
 

3613
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:16,000
around but there are kind of the results
of you know drives

3614
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:16,010
of you know drives
 

3615
01:14:16,010 --> 01:14:18,850
of you know drives
yeah there's deeper biological stuff

3616
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:18,860
yeah there's deeper biological stuff
 

3617
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,100
yeah there's deeper biological stuff
going on and I've talked a few folks on

3618
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:21,110
going on and I've talked a few folks on
 

3619
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:23,470
going on and I've talked a few folks on
this there's a fascinating stuff that

3620
01:14:23,470 --> 01:14:23,480
this there's a fascinating stuff that
 

3621
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,990
this there's a fascinating stuff that
ultimately connects to our joy to our

ultimately connects to our joy to our
 

3623
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,490
ultimately connects to our joy to our
brain if we create an AGI system sorry

3624
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:30,500
brain if we create an AGI system sorry
 

3625
01:14:30,500 --> 01:14:32,260
brain if we create an AGI system sorry
interminable human level intelligence

3626
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:32,270
interminable human level intelligence

system and you get to ask her one

3628
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:35,630
system and you get to ask her one
 

3629
01:14:35,630 --> 01:14:39,970
system and you get to ask her one
question what would that question be you

3630
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:39,980
question what would that question be you
 

3631

know I think the the first one we'll
 

3633
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,620
know I think the the first one we'll
create would probably not be that smart

3634
01:14:44,620 --> 01:14:44,630
create would probably not be that smart
 

3635
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:47,710
create would probably not be that smart
did you like a four-year-old okay so you

3636
01:14:47,710 --> 01:14:47,720
did you like a four-year-old okay so you

she's not that smart
 

3641
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:55,990
she's not that smart
yeah well what's a good question to ask

3642
01:14:55,990 --> 01:14:56,000
yeah well what's a good question to ask

you know to be responsive wind and if

3644
01:15:01,150 --> 01:15:01,160
you know to be responsive wind and if
 

3645
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:03,880
you know to be responsive wind and if
she answers oh it's because the leaves

3646
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:03,890
she answers oh it's because the leaves
 

3647

of the tree are moving in that creates
 

3649
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:09,010
of the tree are moving in that creates
wind she's on to something and if she

3650
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:09,020
wind she's on to something and if she
 

3651
01:15:09,020 --> 01:15:10,890
wind she's on to something and if she
says yeah that's a stupid question

3652
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:10,900
says yeah that's a stupid question
 

3653
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:13,420
says yeah that's a stupid question
she's really obtuse no and then you tell

3654
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:13,430
she's really obtuse no and then you tell
 

3655
01:15:13,430 --> 01:15:16,480
she's really obtuse no and then you tell
her actually you know here is the the

3656
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:16,490
her actually you know here is the the
 

3657
01:15:16,490 --> 01:15:19,270
her actually you know here is the the
real thing and she says oh yeah that

3658
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:19,280
real thing and she says oh yeah that
 

3659
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:19,660
real thing and she says oh yeah that
makes sense

3660
01:15:19,660 --> 01:15:19,670
makes sense
 

3661
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:24,070
makes sense
so questions that that reveal the

3662
01:15:24,070 --> 01:15:24,080
so questions that that reveal the
 

3663
01:15:24,080 --> 01:15:25,420
so questions that that reveal the
ability to do common-sense reasoning

3664
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:25,430
ability to do common-sense reasoning
 

3665
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:27,940
ability to do common-sense reasoning
about the physical world yeah and you

3666
01:15:27,940 --> 01:15:27,950
about the physical world yeah and you
 

3667
01:15:27,950 --> 01:15:30,460
about the physical world yeah and you
know someone will call 20 ferns causal

3668
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:30,470
know someone will call 20 ferns causal
