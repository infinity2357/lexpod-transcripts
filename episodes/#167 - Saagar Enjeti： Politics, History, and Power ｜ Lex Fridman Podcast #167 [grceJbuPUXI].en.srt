00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,510
before he had power he was able to
convince people

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,269
calorama
um which is the richest neighborhood

1774
00:28:11,269 --> 00:28:11,279
um which is the richest neighborhood
 

1775
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,590
um which is the richest neighborhood
here at somebody else's house like it's

1776
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:13,600
here at somebody else's house like it's
 

1777
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,470
here at somebody else's house like it's
the same

1778
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:14,480
the same
 

1779
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,750
the same
thing so you have to think about the

1780
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:15,760
thing so you have to think about the
 

1781
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,510
thing so you have to think about the
system and then the incentives within

1782
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:17,520
system and then the incentives within
 

1783
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,549
system and then the incentives within
that system

1784
00:28:18,549 --> 00:28:18,559
that system
 

1785
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,909
that system
about what the outcomes that they're

1786
00:28:19,909 --> 00:28:19,919
about what the outcomes that they're
 

1787
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,269
about what the outcomes that they're
producing if you actually want to think

1788
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:21,279
producing if you actually want to think
 

1789
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:21,669
producing if you actually want to think
about

1790
00:28:21,669 --> 00:28:21,679
about
 

1791
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,590
about
how can i change this from the outside

1792
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:23,600
how can i change this from the outside
 

1793
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,950
how can i change this from the outside
that's also why it's very difficult to

1794
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:24,960
that's also why it's very difficult to
 

1795
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,510
that's also why it's very difficult to
change

1796
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,520
change
 

1797
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,990
change
because the system is designed in order

1798
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:28,000
because the system is designed in order
 

1799
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,029
because the system is designed in order
to produce

1800
00:28:29,029 --> 00:28:29,039
to produce
 

1801
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,029
to produce
actually pretty specific outcomes that

1802
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:31,039
actually pretty specific outcomes that
 

1803
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,110
actually pretty specific outcomes that
can only be changed in extraordinary

1804
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:33,120
can only be changed in extraordinary
 

1805
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,549
can only be changed in extraordinary
times

1806
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:34,559
times
 

1807
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:37,269
times
yeah and sometimes hard to to predict

1808
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:37,279
yeah and sometimes hard to to predict
 

1809
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:38,230
yeah and sometimes hard to to predict
what kind of

1810
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,240
what kind of
 

1811
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,710
what kind of
outcomes will result from the incentive

1812
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:40,720
outcomes will result from the incentive
 

1813
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,549
outcomes will result from the incentive
uh the system that you create right

1814
00:28:42,549 --> 00:28:42,559
uh the system that you create right
 

1815
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,230
uh the system that you create right
right in the case because especially

1816
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:44,240
right in the case because especially
 

1817
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,389
right in the case because especially
when it's novel kind of situations what

1818
00:28:46,389 --> 00:28:46,399
when it's novel kind of situations what
 

1819
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,909
when it's novel kind of situations what
trump actually created a pretty novel

situation and

1822
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:49,600
situation and
 

1823
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,350
situation and
a lot of the uh things that we've seen

1824
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,360
a lot of the uh things that we've seen
 

1825
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,789
a lot of the uh things that we've seen
in the 20th century

1826
00:28:54,789 --> 00:28:54,799
in the 20th century
 

1827
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,630
in the 20th century
were very novel systems where people

1828
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:56,640
were very novel systems where people
 

1829
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,990
were very novel systems where people
were very optimistic about

1830
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:58,000
were very optimistic about
 

1831
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,070
were very optimistic about
the the the outcomes right and then it

1832
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,080
the the the outcomes right and then it
 

1833
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,269
the the the outcomes right and then it
turned out to

1834
00:29:01,269 --> 00:29:01,279
turned out to
 

1835
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,070
turned out to
not have the results that they predicted

1836
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,080
not have the results that they predicted
 

1837
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:04,710

the most basic level
that's how i would describe it so the

1906
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:20,000
that's how i would describe it so the

00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,669
most of that is because a lot of the
stuff that they had power over has

2054
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:45,679
stuff that they had power over has
 

2055

re-election
 

2173
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,550
re-election
so more what i mean by that is if you

00:34:29,589 --> 00:34:29,599
view about how the department of
 

2183
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,109
view about how the department of
commerce should do its job

they are just gonna go on autopilot so

2186
00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:33,599
they are just gonna go on autopilot so
 

2187
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:34,149
they are just gonna go on autopilot so
there's

2188
00:34:34,149 --> 00:34:34,159
there's
 

2189
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,909
there's
this is part of the problem when you ask

2190
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:35,919
this is part of the problem when you ask
 

2191
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:37,510
this is part of the problem when you ask
me about the presidency it's

2192
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:37,520
me about the presidency it's
 

2193
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,230
me about the presidency it's
not the presidency itself like the

2194
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:40,240
not the presidency itself like the
 

2195
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,349
not the presidency itself like the

president himself
 

2197
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,589
president himself
which has become too powerful it's that

2198
00:34:43,589 --> 00:34:43,599
which has become too powerful it's that
 

2199
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,629
which has become too powerful it's that
we have less

2200
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:44,639
we have less
 

2201
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,069
we have less
democratic checks on the

2202
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:48,079
democratic checks on the
 

2203
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,389
democratic checks on the
people and the systems that are on

2204
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:50,399
people and the systems that are on
 

2205
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,430

autopilot
 

2207
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,790

and i would say that basically since

2208
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:55,800
and i would say that basically since
 

2209
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,310
and i would say that basically since
2008 we have voted

2210
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:58,320
2008 we have voted
 

2211
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,670
2008 we have voted
every single time to disrupt that system

2212
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:01,680
every single time to disrupt that system
 

2213
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,829
every single time to disrupt that system
except in the case of 2020 with joe

reasons around
why that happened and in every single

00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:07,839
why that happened and in every single
 

2221
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,109
why that happened and in every single

obama and trump they all failed in order
 

2225
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,550
obama and trump they all failed in order

to
in order to radically disrupt that and

2228
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:15,040
in order to radically disrupt that and
 

2229
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,790
in order to radically disrupt that and
that just shows you how titanic

2230
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:16,800
that just shows you how titanic
 

2231
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,190
that just shows you how titanic
the task is and i'm using my language

2232
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:19,200
the task is and i'm using my language
 

2233
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,310
the task is and i'm using my language
precisely because i don't want to be

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:20,320
precisely because i don't want to be
 

2235

like deep state and all but like
 

2237
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,030
like deep state and all but like
obviously there's a deep state deep

2238
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,040
obviously there's a deep state deep

obviously there's a deep state deep
state i guess has conspiratorial

attention to it but so you're what

2242
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:27,200
attention to it but so you're what
 

2243
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,310
attention to it but so you're what
you're saying is

2244
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:28,320
you're saying is
 

2245
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,069
you're saying is
the true power currently lies with the

2246
00:35:30,069 --> 00:35:30,079
the true power currently lies with the
 

2247
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,349
the true power currently lies with the

aka deep state well but see it's not

2250
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:34,000
aka deep state well but see it's not
 

2251
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,510
aka deep state well but see it's not
this is the thing too i want to make

2252
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:35,520
this is the thing too i want to make
 

2253
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,470
this is the thing too i want to make
and clear because i think people think

2254
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:37,480
and clear because i think people think
 

2255
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,510
and clear because i think people think
conspiratorially that they're all coming

conspiratorially that they're all coming
 

2257
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,310
conspiratorially that they're all coming
together to

intentionally do something no no no no
 

2261
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:43,990
intentionally do something no no no no
they are doing

2262
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:44,000
they are doing
 

2263
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,349
they are doing
what they know believe they are right

2264
00:35:47,349 --> 00:35:47,359
what they know believe they are right
 

2265

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,550
and don't have real democratic checks
within that

00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:50,560
within that
 

2269
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,710
within that
and so now they have entire generations

2270
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:52,720
and so now they have entire generations
 

2271
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,990
and so now they have entire generations
of cultures within each of these

of cultures within each of these
 

2273

bureaucracies
 

2275
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,349
bureaucracies
where they say this is the way that we

2276
00:35:57,349 --> 00:35:57,359
where they say this is the way that we
 

2277
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,069
where they say this is the way that we
do things

2278

which is that
 

2283
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,710
which is that
we have a culture of within

2284
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:04,720
we have a culture of within
 

2285
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,349

first principles thinking
requires is like we don't give a [\h__\h]

the point is what is the best way to do
 

2357
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,390
the point is what is the best way to do
it and it seems like

2358
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:12,400
it and it seems like
 

2359
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,349

general
 

2363
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,550
general
probably bureaucracies in general are

00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:18,560
probably bureaucracies in general are
 

2365
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,349
probably bureaucracies in general are
just

2366
00:37:19,349 --> 00:37:19,359
just
 

2367
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,510
just
really good at being lazy about never

2368
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:21,520
really good at being lazy about never
 

2369
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,430
really good at being lazy about never
having those conversations

2370
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:23,440
having those conversations
 

2371
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,310
having those conversations
and just it becomes this momentum thing

2372
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:26,320
and just it becomes this momentum thing
 

2373
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,829
and just it becomes this momentum thing
that nobody has the difficult

2374
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:27,839
that nobody has the difficult
 

2375
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:28,870
that nobody has the difficult

it's become a game within a certain set

2378
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,200
it's become a game within a certain set
 

2379
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,310
it's become a game within a certain set
of constraints

2380
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:32,320
of constraints
 

2381
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,069
of constraints
and they never kind of do revolutionary

2382
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:34,079
and they never kind of do revolutionary
 

2383
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,990
and they never kind of do revolutionary
tasks but you did say that the

2384
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:36,000
tasks but you did say that the
 

2385
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,630

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,710
more power than the others and
but that power has to be coupled with

obviously i'm using economics because

2740
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:06,880
obviously i'm using economics because
 

2741
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,230
obviously i'm using economics because
there's obviously a huge interplay there

2742
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:08,240
there's obviously a huge interplay there
 

2743
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:08,790
there's obviously a huge interplay there
but like

2744
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:08,800
but like
 

2745
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,190
but like
in terms of the equitable or lack of

2746
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:11,200
in terms of the equitable or lack of
 

2747
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,790
in terms of the equitable or lack of
equitable distribution of money within

2748
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:12,800
equitable distribution of money within
 

2749
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,589
equitable distribution of money within
our politics

2750
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
our politics
 

2751
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,270
our politics
what we're really pissed off about is

2752
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:15,280
what we're really pissed off about is
 

2753
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,510
what we're really pissed off about is
we're like our politics only seems to

2754
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:17,520
we're like our politics only seems to
 

2755
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:17,990
we're like our politics only seems to
work

2756
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:18,000
work
 

2757
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,150
work
for the people who have money i think

2758
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:20,160
for the people who have money i think
 

2759
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,589
for the people who have money i think
that's largely true

2760
00:43:21,589 --> 00:43:21,599
that's largely true
 

2761
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,670
that's largely true
um i think that the reason why things

2762
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:23,680
um i think that the reason why things
 

2763
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,430
um i think that the reason why things
worked differently in the past

2764
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:25,440
worked differently in the past
 

2765
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,670
worked differently in the past
is because our economy was structured in

2766
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680
is because our economy was structured in
 

2767
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:28,710
is because our economy was structured in
different ways

2768
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:28,720
different ways
 

2769
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,870
different ways
and there's a reason that our politics

2770
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:30,880
and there's a reason that our politics
 

2771
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,710
and there's a reason that our politics
today are very analogous

2772
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:32,720
today are very analogous
 

2773
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,270
today are very analogous
to the last gilded age because we had

2774
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,280
to the last gilded age because we had
 

2775
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,710
to the last gilded age because we had
very similar levels

2776
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:36,720
very similar levels
 

2777
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,670
very similar levels
levels of economic distribution and

2778
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:39,680
levels of economic distribution and
 

2779
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,030
levels of economic distribution and
cultural problems too at the same time i

2780
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:41,040
cultural problems too at the same time i
 

2781
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,069
cultural problems too at the same time i
don't want to erase that because i

2782
00:43:42,069 --> 00:43:42,079
don't want to erase that because i
 

2783
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:43,510
don't want to erase that because i
actually think that's what's driving

2784
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:43,520
actually think that's what's driving
 

2785
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,190
actually think that's what's driving
all of our politics right now so that's

2786
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:45,200
all of our politics right now so that's
 

2787
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,630
all of our politics right now so that's
interesting so yeah

2788
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:46,640
interesting so yeah
 

2789
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,069
interesting so yeah
that's one so in that sense

2790
00:43:48,069 --> 00:43:48,079
that's one so in that sense
 

2791
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,589
that's one so in that sense
representative government is doing a

2792
00:43:49,589 --> 00:43:49,599
representative government is doing a
 

2793

representative government is doing a
pretty good job of representing it is

2794
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:51,280
pretty good job of representing it is
 

2795
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,710
pretty good job of representing it is
the state of culture and the people and

2796
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:52,720
the state of culture and the people and

2805
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,309
there's a lot of talk about so again
from an outsider's perspective

from an outsider's perspective
 

2807
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:06,390
from an outsider's perspective

00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:53,440
so the flip side the response to a lot
 

2851
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,829
so the flip side the response to a lot
of conspiracy theories it's like

2852
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:55,839
of conspiracy theories it's like
 

2853
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,829
of conspiracy theories it's like

no the reason this happened is because
 

2855
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,750
no the reason this happened is because
it's a combination of

2856
00:44:59,750 --> 00:44:59,760
it's a combination of
 

2857
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,950
it's a combination of
just incompetence so where do you land

2858
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:02,960
just incompetence so where do you land
 

2859
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,670
just incompetence so where do you land
on

2860
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:03,680
on
 

2861
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,390
on
some of these uh conspiracy theories i

2862
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:06,400
some of these uh conspiracy theories i
 

2863
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,710
some of these uh conspiracy theories i
think

2864
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:06,720
think
 

2865
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,589
think
most conspiracy theories are wrong some

2866
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:09,599
most conspiracy theories are wrong some
 

2867

most conspiracy theories are wrong some
are true

00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:10,319
are true
 

2869
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:13,589
are true
and those are spectacularly true and

2870
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:13,599
and those are spectacularly true and

process there's a lot of fears tied up
 

2939
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:12,630
process there's a lot of fears tied up
in that first

2940
00:46:12,630 --> 00:46:12,640
in that first
 

2941
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,109
in that first
looking incompetent in the public eye

2942
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:15,119
looking incompetent in the public eye
 

2943
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:16,550
looking incompetent in the public eye
nobody wants to be

2944
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:16,560
nobody wants to be
 

2945
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,550
nobody wants to be
uh looked that way and the other is like

2946
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,560
uh looked that way and the other is like
 

2947
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,230
uh looked that way and the other is like
in revealing it

2948
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:20,240
in revealing it
 

2949
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,550
in revealing it
even though they don't know maybe china

2950
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:22,560
even though they don't know maybe china
 

2951
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,069
even though they don't know maybe china
will figure it out exactly

2952
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:24,079
will figure it out exactly
 

2953
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,750
will figure it out exactly
so like we don't want china to figure it

2954
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:25,760
so like we don't want china to figure it
 

2955
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:27,589
so like we don't want china to figure it
out first and so that

2956
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:27,599
out first and so that
 

2957
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,430
out first and so that
all those kinds of things result in

2958
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:29,440
all those kinds of things result in
 

2959
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,109
all those kinds of things result in
basically secrecy then

2960
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:31,119
basically secrecy then
 

2961
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,190
basically secrecy then
that damages the trust in institutions

2962
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:33,200

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,990
tools that he used
uh to uh convince people and manipulate

3222
00:50:55,990 --> 00:50:56,000
uh to uh convince people and manipulate
 

3223
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,230
uh to uh convince people and manipulate
people but not in some

3224
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:58,240
people but not in some
 

3225
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,990
people but not in some
like um evil way

3226
00:51:01,990 --> 00:51:02,000
like um evil way
 

3227
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,349
like um evil way
but more just really good at the art of

3228
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:05,359
but more just really good at the art of
 

3229
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,950
but more just really good at the art of
conversation

3230
00:51:06,950 --> 00:51:06,960
conversation
 

3231
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,790
conversation
and just winning people over on the side

3232
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:10,800
and just winning people over on the side
 

3233
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,030
and just winning people over on the side
and then by building through that

3234
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:13,040
and then by building through that
 

3235
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,710
and then by building through that
process building a network of other

3236
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:14,720
process building a network of other
 

3237
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,990
process building a network of other
really powerful people

3238
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,000
really powerful people
 

3239
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,030
really powerful people
and not explicitly but

3240
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:19,040
and not explicitly but
 

3241
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,549
and not explicitly but
implicitly having done shady [\h__\h]

3242
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:22,559
implicitly having done shady [\h__\h]
 

3243
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:25,910
implicitly having done shady [\h__\h]
with powerful people yeah like building

3244
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:25,920
with powerful people yeah like building
 

3245
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,349
with powerful people yeah like building
up a kind of

3246
00:51:27,349 --> 00:51:27,359
up a kind of
 

3247
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:31,430
up a kind of
implied power of like

3248
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:31,440
implied power of like
 

3249
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,630
implied power of like
like we did some shady [\h__\h] together

3250
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:34,640
like we did some shady [\h__\h] together
 

3251
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,190
like we did some shady [\h__\h] together
so we're not like you're going to help

3252
00:51:37,190 --> 00:51:37,200
so we're not like you're going to help
 

3253
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,190
so we're not like you're going to help
me out on this extra thing i need to

3254
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,200
me out on this extra thing i need to
 

3255
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,870
me out on this extra thing i need to
know and that builds and builds and

3256
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:40,880
know and that builds and builds and
 

3257
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,750
know and that builds and builds and
builds

3258
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:41,760
builds
 

3259
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,630
builds
to where you're able to actually control

3260
00:51:44,630 --> 00:51:44,640
to where you're able to actually control
 

3261
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,870
to where you're able to actually control
like have quite a lot of power without

3262
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:46,880
like have quite a lot of power without
 

3263
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,030
like have quite a lot of power without
explicitly having like a strategy

3264
00:51:49,030 --> 00:51:49,040
explicitly having like a strategy
 

3265
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:49,990
explicitly having like a strategy
meeting

3266
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:50,000
meeting
 

3267
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,670
meeting
and i think a single person or

3268
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:53,680
and i think a single person or
 

3269
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,510
and i think a single person or
yeah i think a single person can do that

3270
00:51:55,510 --> 00:51:55,520
yeah i think a single person can do that
 

3271
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,990
yeah i think a single person can do that
or can start that ball rolling

3272
00:51:57,990 --> 00:51:58,000
or can start that ball rolling
 

3273
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,390
or can start that ball rolling
and over time it becomes a group thing

3274
00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:00,400
and over time it becomes a group thing
 

3275
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,990
and over time it becomes a group thing
like i don't know if

3276
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:02,000
like i don't know if
 

3277
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,109
like i don't know if
julian maxwell was involved or others

3278
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:05,119
julian maxwell was involved or others
 

3279
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,829
julian maxwell was involved or others
and yeah over time that becomes almost

3280
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:07,839
and yeah over time that becomes almost
 

3281
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:09,750
and yeah over time that becomes almost
like a really powerful organization

3282
00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:09,760
like a really powerful organization
 

3283
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,549
like a really powerful organization
that wasn't that's not a front for

3284
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:12,559
that wasn't that's not a front for
 

3285
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:13,510
that wasn't that's not a front for
something

3286
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:13,520
something
 

3287
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,150
something
much deeper and bigger but it's almost

3288
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,160
much deeper and bigger but it's almost
 

3289
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,829
much deeper and bigger but it's almost
like maybe it's because i love cellular

3290
00:52:17,829 --> 00:52:17,839
like maybe it's because i love cellular
 

3291
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,430
like maybe it's because i love cellular
automata man

3292
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:19,440
automata man
 

3293
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,430
automata man
a system that starts out as a simple

3294
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:21,440
a system that starts out as a simple
 

3295
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,109
a system that starts out as a simple
thing with simple rules

3296
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:23,119
thing with simple rules
 

3297
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,270
thing with simple rules
can create incredible complexity yes and

3298
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:25,280
can create incredible complexity yes and
 

3299
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,630
can create incredible complexity yes and
so i just think that

3300
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:26,640
so i just think that
 

3301
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:29,510
so i just think that
uh we're now looking in retrospect it

3302
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:29,520
uh we're now looking in retrospect it
 

3303
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,589
uh we're now looking in retrospect it
looks like an incredibly complex system

3304
00:52:31,589 --> 00:52:31,599
looks like an incredibly complex system
 

3305
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,790
looks like an incredibly complex system
that's operating in

3306
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:32,800
that's operating in
 

3307
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,790
that's operating in
but like that's just because it's you

3308
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:34,800
but like that's just because it's you
 

3309
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:35,910
but like that's just because it's you
know there could be a lot of other

3310
00:52:35,910 --> 00:52:35,920
know there could be a lot of other
 

3311
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,109
know there could be a lot of other
jeffrey epstein's

3312
00:52:37,109 --> 00:52:37,119
jeffrey epstein's
 

3313
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,589
jeffrey epstein's
in in my perspective that this simple

3314
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:39,599
in in my perspective that this simple
 

3315
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:40,630
in in my perspective that this simple
thing just

3316
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:40,640
thing just
 

3317
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,549
thing just
uh was successful early on it builds and

3318
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:42,559
uh was successful early on it builds and
 

3319
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,230
uh was successful early on it builds and
builds and builds and builds

3320
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:44,240
builds and builds and builds
 

3321
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,470
builds and builds and builds
and then there's uh creepy [\h__\h] that

3322
00:52:46,470 --> 00:52:46,480
and then there's uh creepy [\h__\h] that
 

3323
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,109
and then there's uh creepy [\h__\h] that
like a lot of aspects of the system

3324
00:52:49,109 --> 00:52:49,119
like a lot of aspects of the system
 

3325
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,109
like a lot of aspects of the system
helped it get bigger and bigger and more

3326
00:52:51,109 --> 00:52:51,119
helped it get bigger and bigger and more
 

3327
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,230
helped it get bigger and bigger and more
powerful and so on

3328
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:52,240
powerful and so on
 

3329
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,750
powerful and so on
so the final result is i mean

3330
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:55,760
so the final result is i mean
 

3331
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,270
so the final result is i mean
listen i have a pretty optimistic i have

3332
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
listen i have a pretty optimistic i have
 

3333
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,150
listen i have a pretty optimistic i have
i tend to see the good in people and so

3334
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:02,160
i tend to see the good in people and so
 

3335
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,069
i tend to see the good in people and so
it's been heartbreaking to me in general

3336
00:53:04,069 --> 00:53:04,079
it's been heartbreaking to me in general
 

3337
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,510
it's been heartbreaking to me in general
just to see

3338
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:05,520
just to see
 

3339
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,950
just to see
you know people i look up to not have

3340
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:08,960
you know people i look up to not have
 

3341
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,030
you know people i look up to not have
the level of integrity i thought they

3342
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:11,040
the level of integrity i thought they
 

3343
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:11,829
the level of integrity i thought they
would

3344
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:11,839
would
 

3345
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,069
would
or like the strength of character all

3346
00:53:14,069 --> 00:53:14,079
or like the strength of character all
 

3347
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,270
or like the strength of character all
those kinds of things

3348
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:15,280
those kinds of things
 

3349
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,630
those kinds of things
and it seems like you should be able to

3350
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:18,640
and it seems like you should be able to
 

3351
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,030
and it seems like you should be able to
to see the [\h__\h] that is jeffrey

3352
00:53:21,030 --> 00:53:21,040
to see the [\h__\h] that is jeffrey
 

3353
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,710
to see the [\h__\h] that is jeffrey
epstein like when you meet him

3354
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:22,720
epstein like when you meet him
 

3355
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,630
epstein like when you meet him
right uh we're not talking about like

3356
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:24,640
right uh we're not talking about like
 

3357
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,870
right uh we're not talking about like
eric weinstein like one or two or three

3358
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:26,880
eric weinstein like one or two or three
 

3359
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,470
eric weinstein like one or two or three
or five interactions

3360
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:28,480
or five interactions
 

3361
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,870
or five interactions
but like there's people that had like

3362
00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:30,880
but like there's people that had like
 

3363
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,510
but like there's people that had like
like years of relationship with him yeah

3364
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:33,520
like years of relationship with him yeah
 

3365
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,829
like years of relationship with him yeah
and i don't know i i'm not sure even

3366
00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:35,839
and i don't know i i'm not sure even
 

3367

3377
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,309

okay here's the open question i have i

3378
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:52,319
okay here's the open question i have i
 

3379
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:52,790
okay here's the open question i have i
don't

3380
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:52,800

and then at the same time you have like
a vox rider

cultural power than like the plumber so
you have

4032
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:12,079
you have
 

4033
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,710
you have
to think about where exactly that line

4034
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:14,720
to think about where exactly that line
 

4035
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:15,589
to think about where exactly that line
is and i think

4036
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:15,599
is and i think
 

4037
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:16,950
is and i think
in general that's the way that we're

4038
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:16,960
in general that's the way that we're
 

4039
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:19,109
in general that's the way that we're
trending so

4040
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:19,119
trending so
 

4041
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:20,870
trending so
that's why when i say like what's going

4042
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:20,880
that's why when i say like what's going
 

4043
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,710
that's why when i say like what's going
on are we divided yeah like

4044
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:22,720
on are we divided yeah like
 

4045
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:25,109
on are we divided yeah like
but it's not left and right i mean like

4046
01:04:25,109 --> 01:04:25,119
but it's not left and right i mean like
 

4047
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:25,990
but it's not left and right i mean like
and that's why i hate these

4048
01:04:25,990 --> 01:04:26,000
and that's why i hate these
 

4049
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,230
and that's why i hate these
labels so it's more it's more just red

there's i don't know if you're sort of
 

4065
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,470
there's i don't know if you're sort of
in post analyzing the patterns because

4066
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:42,480
in post analyzing the patterns because
 

4067
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:45,109
in post analyzing the patterns because
it seems like there's a network effects

it seems like there's a network effects
 

4069
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:46,950
it seems like there's a network effects
of like you just pick the team red or

4077
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:52,309
might have to do all those things but
like

4078
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:52,319
like
 

4079
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,510
like
it it seems like it's more about

01:04:55,510 --> 01:04:55,520
it it seems like it's more about
 

4081
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:58,950
it it seems like it's more about
uh just the people around you correct

4082
01:04:58,950 --> 01:04:58,960
uh just the people around you correct
 

4083
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:01,270
uh just the people around you correct
so less than whether you went to college

like
 

4089
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,910
like
it's it's almost like uh weird right

4090
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:05,920
it's it's almost like uh weird right
 

4091
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,589
it's it's almost like uh weird right
like network effects that

4092
01:05:07,589 --> 01:05:07,599
like network effects that
 

4093
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:09,910
like network effects that
are hard there's certain strong patterns

argue that this is like
 

4495
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,830
argue that this is like
a feature not a bug like this is a a

yeah is it also possible that
 

5077
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,189
yeah is it also possible that

that sounds like the c students i don't
think it's that

5130
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:47,280
think it's that
 

5131
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:49,189
think it's that
i think it's that the pipeline of

5132
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:49,199
i think it's that the pipeline of
 

5133
01:21:49,199 --> 01:21:51,030

politician creation
 

5135
01:21:51,040 --> 01:21:53,430

5137
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:54,149
is just totally broken from beginning to

5138
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:54,159
end
 

5139
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:56,629
end
so it's not that ace students don't want

error will be remembered by
the new the like of the space

6756
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,400
the new the like of the space
 

6757
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,430
the new the like of the space
exploration

6758
01:47:51,430 --> 01:47:51,440
exploration
 

6759
01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:53,830

getting into space exploration
 

6763
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:59,669
getting into space exploration
of space travel and perhaps

6764
01:47:59,669 --> 01:47:59,679
of space travel and perhaps
 

6765
01:47:59,679 --> 01:48:01,590
of space travel and perhaps
perhaps like artificial intelligence

6766
01:48:01,590 --> 01:48:01,600
perhaps like artificial intelligence
 

6767
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:03,350
perhaps like artificial intelligence

that might might be very well forgotten
 

6779
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:12,229
that might might be very well forgotten
one way to think about it

6780
01:48:12,229 --> 01:48:12,239
one way to think about it
 

6781
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:15,830
one way to think about it
is that the internet is so young

6782
01:48:15,830 --> 01:48:15,840
is that the internet is so young
 

6783
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:18,790
is that the internet is so young

it took a long time for [\h__\h] to sort out
i think that's where we're at with the

6800
01:48:32,709 --> 01:48:32,719
i think that's where we're at with the
 

6801
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:34,149
i think that's where we're at with the
internet like at a certain level it

6802
01:48:34,149 --> 01:48:34,159
internet like at a certain level it
 

6803
01:48:34,159 --> 01:48:35,189
internet like at a certain level it
disrupts

6804
01:48:35,189 --> 01:48:35,199
disrupts
 

6805
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:37,350
disrupts
everything and that's a good thing it

6806
01:48:37,350 --> 01:48:37,360
everything and that's a good thing it
 

6807
01:48:37,360 --> 01:48:39,030
everything and that's a good thing it
can be very tumultuous

primaries happened during coronavirus
 

6845
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:13,910
primaries happened during coronavirus
so that we because like then we can see

6846
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:13,920
so that we because like then we can see
 

6847
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:16,470
so that we because like then we can see
so okay here's a bunch of people facing

6848
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:16,480
so okay here's a bunch of people facing
 

6849
01:49:16,480 --> 01:49:17,270
so okay here's a bunch of people facing
crisis

6850
01:49:17,270 --> 01:49:17,280
crisis
 

6851
01:49:17,280 --> 01:49:18,870
crisis
and it's an opportunity for leaders to

6852
01:49:18,870 --> 01:49:18,880
and it's an opportunity for leaders to
 

6853
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:20,709
and it's an opportunity for leaders to
step up like

6854
01:49:20,709 --> 01:49:20,719
step up like
 

6855
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:23,270
step up like
i still believe the optimistic view is

6856
01:49:23,270 --> 01:49:23,280
i still believe the optimistic view is
 

6857
01:49:23,280 --> 01:49:24,149
i still believe the optimistic view is
uh

6858
01:49:24,149 --> 01:49:24,159
uh
 

6859
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:27,350
uh
the game theory of like influencers

6860
01:49:27,350 --> 01:49:27,360
the game theory of like influencers
 

6861
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,149
the game theory of like influencers
will always be defeated by actual great

6862
01:49:30,149 --> 01:49:30,159
will always be defeated by actual great
 

6863
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:31,189
will always be defeated by actual great
leaders

6864
01:49:31,189 --> 01:49:31,199
leaders
 

6865
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:33,990
leaders
so like maybe the great leaders are rare

6866
01:49:33,990 --> 01:49:34,000
so like maybe the great leaders are rare
 

6867
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:35,910
so like maybe the great leaders are rare
but i think they're sufficiently

6868
01:49:35,910 --> 01:49:35,920
but i think they're sufficiently
 

6869
01:49:35,920 --> 01:49:37,669
but i think they're sufficiently
out there that they will step up

6870
01:49:37,669 --> 01:49:37,679
out there that they will step up
 

6871
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:39,750
out there that they will step up
especially in the moments of crisis

6872
01:49:39,750 --> 01:49:39,760
especially in the moments of crisis
 

6873
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,030
especially in the moments of crisis
and coronavirus is is obviously a crisis

6874
01:49:43,030 --> 01:49:43,040
and coronavirus is is obviously a crisis
 

6875
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,709
and coronavirus is is obviously a crisis
where like

6876
01:49:44,709 --> 01:49:44,719
where like
 

6877
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:48,470
where like
you know mass manufacture of tests uh

6878
01:49:48,470 --> 01:49:48,480
you know mass manufacture of tests uh
 

6879
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:50,550
you know mass manufacture of tests uh
all kinds of infrastructure building

6883
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:54,229
that you could have done in 2020
there's so many possibilities for just

6884
01:49:54,229 --> 01:49:54,239
there's so many possibilities for just
 

6885
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:56,229
there's so many possibilities for just
like bold action

6886
01:49:56,229 --> 01:49:56,239
like bold action
 

6887
01:49:56,239 --> 01:49:59,589
like bold action
and sad uh none of that

and sad uh none of that
 

6889
01:49:59,599 --> 01:50:01,830
and sad uh none of that

obvious and the reason they're not
 

7907
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:16,310
obvious and the reason they're not

sharing it is because of this
 

7909

7933
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:40,470
people begged him to i know for a fact
because i pushed

02:12:38,629 --> 02:12:38,639
problems and in many ways that
 

8333
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:39,669
problems and in many ways that
contributed to

8334
02:12:39,669 --> 02:12:39,679
contributed to
 

8335
02:12:39,679 --> 02:12:41,270

like i'm obsessed with world war one for

8338
02:12:43,030 --> 02:12:43,040
like i'm obsessed with world war one for
 

8339
02:12:43,040 --> 02:12:43,750
like i'm obsessed with world war one for
this reason

8340
02:12:43,750 --> 02:12:43,760
this reason
 

8341
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:45,910
this reason
which is that it's just like the root oh

8342
02:12:45,910 --> 02:12:45,920
which is that it's just like the root oh
 

8343
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:47,270
which is that it's just like the root oh
it's like the culmination

8344
02:12:47,270 --> 02:12:47,280
it's like the culmination
 

8345
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,750
it's like the culmination
of the monarchies then the fall and then

8346
02:12:49,750 --> 02:12:49,760
of the monarchies then the fall and then
 

8347
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,750
of the monarchies then the fall and then
just all the [\h__\h] spills out

8348
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:51,760
just all the [\h__\h] spills out
 

8349
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,510
just all the [\h__\h] spills out
so from there for like a hundred years

8350
02:12:53,510 --> 02:12:53,520
so from there for like a hundred years
 

8351
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,270
so from there for like a hundred years
so world war one is like the most

8352
02:12:55,270 --> 02:12:55,280
so world war one is like the most
 

8353
02:12:55,280 --> 02:12:57,990
so world war one is like the most
important shift in human history

8354
02:12:57,990 --> 02:12:58,000
important shift in human history
 

8355

02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:05,520
of the thing is that we would focus a
 

8363
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:06,950
of the thing is that we would focus a
lot on that is like war

around for a long time but this is a

9558
02:32:58,309 --> 02:32:58,319
around for a long time but this is a
 

9559
02:32:58,319 --> 02:32:59,750
around for a long time but this is a
fascinating question that you ask which

9560
02:32:59,750 --> 02:32:59,760
fascinating question that you ask which
 

9561
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:00,389
fascinating question that you ask which
is like

9562
02:33:00,389 --> 02:33:00,399

that's the question i don't i uh
 

9567
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:06,550
that's the question i don't i uh
and this is where i think given all of

9568
02:33:06,550 --> 02:33:06,560
and this is where i think given all of
 

9569
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:07,670
and this is where i think given all of
his behavior and more

9570
02:33:07,670 --> 02:33:07,680
his behavior and more
 

9571
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:09,429
his behavior and more
i don't know if it's about money i don't

9572
02:33:09,429 --> 02:33:09,439
i don't know if it's about money i don't
 

9573
02:33:09,439 --> 02:33:11,030
i don't know if it's about money i don't
know if it's about enriching himself

9574
02:33:11,030 --> 02:33:11,040
know if it's about enriching himself
 

9575
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,950

and billions and billions of dollars
 

9579
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:17,990
and billions and billions of dollars

02:33:17,990 --> 02:33:18,000
but i think he probably he's as close to
 

9581
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:18,870

and i know that's a very normal
 

10623
02:50:35,680 --> 02:50:37,990
and i know that's a very normal
normie answer yeah um one of the best

10624
02:50:37,990 --> 02:50:38,000
normie answer yeah um one of the best
 

10625
02:50:38,000 --> 02:50:39,349
normie answer yeah um one of the best
selling but i think there's a reason for

10626
02:50:39,349 --> 02:50:39,359
selling but i think there's a reason for
 

10627

that yeah you've all know harari
 

10629
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:43,510
that yeah you've all know harari
of course okay look yes he didn't do any

10630
02:50:43,510 --> 02:50:43,520
of course okay look yes he didn't do any
 

10631
02:50:43,520 --> 02:50:44,469
of course okay look yes he didn't do any
new research

10632
02:50:44,469 --> 02:50:44,479
new research
 

10633
02:50:44,479 --> 02:50:46,469
new research
i get that all he did was aggregate i'm

10634
02:50:46,469 --> 02:50:46,479
i get that all he did was aggregate i'm
 

10635

i get that all he did was aggregate i'm
sure he's very controversial in the

10636
02:50:47,670 --> 02:50:47,680
sure he's very controversial in the
 

10637
02:50:47,680 --> 02:50:48,790
sure he's very controversial in the
scientific community

10638

scientific community
 

10639
02:50:48,800 --> 02:50:50,550

but guess what he wrote a great book

10640
02:50:50,550 --> 02:50:50,560
but guess what he wrote a great book
 

10641
02:50:50,560 --> 02:50:52,150
but guess what he wrote a great book
it's a very

10642

it's a very
 

10643
02:50:52,160 --> 02:50:56,230
it's a very
easy to read general explanation of the

10644

so clearly and well that for your

10670
02:51:21,590 --> 02:51:21,600
so clearly and well that for your
 

10671
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:23,349
so clearly and well that for your
average person to be able to read that

10672
02:51:23,349 --> 02:51:23,359
average person to be able to read that
 

10673
02:51:23,359 --> 02:51:24,469
average person to be able to read that
you will come away

10674
02:51:24,469 --> 02:51:24,479
you will come away
 

10675
02:51:24,479 --> 02:51:26,230
you will come away
with a more clear understanding of the
