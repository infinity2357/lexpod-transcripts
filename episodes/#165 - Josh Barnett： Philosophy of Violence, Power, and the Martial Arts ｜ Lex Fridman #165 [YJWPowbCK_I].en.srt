can
get to that point now the likelihood is

ruin them more than anything else
and you will tell yourself that you

388
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:28,400
and you will tell yourself that you
 

389
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,790
and you will tell yourself that you
ruined them on purpose for a good reason

390
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:30,800
ruined them on purpose for a good reason
 

391
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,749
ruined them on purpose for a good reason
or you'll say that

392
00:06:31,749 --> 00:06:31,759
or you'll say that
 

393
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,350
or you'll say that
you'll figure out a way to put it on

394
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:33,360
you'll figure out a way to put it on
 

395
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,430
you'll figure out a way to put it on
everything else but yourself

everything else but yourself
 

397
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,469
everything else but yourself
and so the idea of thinking of

398
00:06:38,469 --> 00:06:38,479
and so the idea of thinking of
 

399
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,550
and so the idea of thinking of
well as i'm starting off on this whole

400
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,560
well as i'm starting off on this whole
 

401
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,309
well as i'm starting off on this whole
thing i got a lot of work to do

402
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:42,319
thing i got a lot of work to do
 

403
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,749
thing i got a lot of work to do
and that's just the way it is and i got

404
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:43,759
and that's just the way it is and i got
 

405
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,029
and that's just the way it is and i got
to figure out what areas those are going

406
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:45,039
to figure out what areas those are going
 

407
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:45,749
to figure out what areas those are going
to be

408
00:06:45,749 --> 00:06:45,759
to be
 

409
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,070
to be
and so you know i thought oh yeah if i

410
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,080
and so you know i thought oh yeah if i
 

411
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,270
and so you know i thought oh yeah if i
think of original sin

412
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:49,280
think of original sin
 

413
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,510
think of original sin
actually can be that can be kind of a

414
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:51,520
actually can be that can be kind of a
 

415
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,589
actually can be that can be kind of a
clever idea but it's also

416
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:53,599
clever idea but it's also
 

417
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,029
clever idea but it's also
just accepting that we're all

418
00:06:57,029 --> 00:06:57,039
just accepting that we're all
 

419
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,990
just accepting that we're all
uniquely strange and unequal in our own

420
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:00,000
uniquely strange and unequal in our own
 

421
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,950
uniquely strange and unequal in our own
ways

422
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:00,960
ways
 

423
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,550
ways
but we have to figure out how that fits

424
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:02,560
but we have to figure out how that fits
 

425
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,710
but we have to figure out how that fits
in the word authenticity kind of

426
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:04,720
in the word authenticity kind of
 

427
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,309
in the word authenticity kind of
connects to all of that so

428
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:06,319
connects to all of that so
 

429
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,629
connects to all of that so
striving to be your authentic self means

430
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:08,639
striving to be your authentic self means
 

431
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,309
striving to be your authentic self means
figuring out exactly the shape of the

00:07:10,309 --> 00:07:10,319
figuring out exactly the shape of the

00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,430
figuring out exactly the shape of the
flaws

434
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:11,440
flaws
 

435
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,309
flaws
the the character of your like little

00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:14,319
the the character of your like little
 

437
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,150
the the character of your like little
demons you get to play with and

438
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:16,160
demons you get to play with and
 

439
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,990
demons you get to play with and
around them finding a path to whatever

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,309
the hell uh
ideal versions of yourself you can carve

444
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:22,319
ideal versions of yourself you can carve
 

445
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,589
ideal versions of yourself you can carve
and pretending like that's

446
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:23,599
and pretending like that's
 

447
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,670
and pretending like that's
such a thing is even possible the other

00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,400
you know there's not such a thing as
 

459
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,309
you know there's not such a thing as
good and evil and these are all kind of

460
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:38,319
good and evil and these are all kind of
 

461
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,469
good and evil and these are all kind of
constructs do you think there's such a

462
00:07:40,469 --> 00:07:40,479
constructs do you think there's such a
 

463

objective reality
 

469
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,830
objective reality
i think that there are some i

470
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:47,840
i think that there are some i
 

471
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,110
i think that there are some i
actually do believe that there are some

472
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,120
actually do believe that there are some
 

473
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,350
actually do believe that there are some
universals i'm not kantian in any way

474
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,360
universals i'm not kantian in any way
 

475
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,550
universals i'm not kantian in any way
but i do think that there are some

476
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:52,560
but i do think that there are some
 

477
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,510
but i do think that there are some
universals and

478
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:53,520
universals and
 

479
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,710
universals and
the thing that actually brought me to

480
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:54,720
the thing that actually brought me to
 

481
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,950
the thing that actually brought me to
even the concept of that was jung

482
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:56,960
even the concept of that was jung
 

483
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,830
even the concept of that was jung
so you know jung's concept of the

484
00:07:59,830 --> 00:07:59,840
so you know jung's concept of the
 

485
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,230
so you know jung's concept of the
collective unconsciousness

486
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:02,240
collective unconsciousness
 

487
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,110
collective unconsciousness
and then taking that thought and then

488
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,120
and then taking that thought and then
 

489
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,390
and then taking that thought and then
applying it to

490
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:06,400
applying it to
 

491
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,670
applying it to
looking through his history and uh

492
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:09,680
looking through his history and uh
 

493
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,909
looking through his history and uh
the most varied history you can find so

494
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:11,919
the most varied history you can find so
 

495
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,749
the most varied history you can find so
i would say probably religion is your

496
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:13,759
i would say probably religion is your
 

497
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,110
i would say probably religion is your
earliest one

498
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:15,120

he did this uh much earlier than
me thinking about it but uh i think that

concept as if it only applies to this

00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,040
concept as if it only applies to this
 

559
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,389
concept as if it only applies to this
time this people like

560
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:16,399
time this people like
 

561
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,870
time this people like
getting overly pomo about it is just a

562
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:18,880
getting overly pomo about it is just a
 

563
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,070
getting overly pomo about it is just a
really idiotic

564
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,080
really idiotic
 

565
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,790
really idiotic
post-modern so you think that there is

566
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:22,800
post-modern so you think that there is
 

567
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,190
post-modern so you think that there is
uh

568
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:23,200
uh
 

569
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,870
uh
just like joseph campbell there's a

570
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:24,880
just like joseph campbell there's a
 

571
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,710
just like joseph campbell there's a
thread that connects

572
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:26,720
thread that connects
 

573
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,470
thread that connects
all of these stories narratives that we

574
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:28,480
all of these stories narratives that we
 

575
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,870
all of these stories narratives that we
constructed for ourselves as we evolve

576
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:30,880
constructed for ourselves as we evolve
 

577
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,670
constructed for ourselves as we evolve
and that thread is grounded in some kind

578
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:33,680
and that thread is grounded in some kind
 

579
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,550
and that thread is grounded in some kind
of absolute ideas of maybe on the

580
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:36,560
of absolute ideas of maybe on the
 

581
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,470
of absolute ideas of maybe on the
morality side which is the trickiest one

582
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:38,480
morality side which is the trickiest one
 

583
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,430
morality side which is the trickiest one
of good and evil

584
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:39,440
of good and evil
 

585
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,269
of good and evil
somewhat yeah i think that a lot of this

586
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:41,279
somewhat yeah i think that a lot of this
 

587
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,590
somewhat yeah i think that a lot of this
stuff is just derived from a biological

588
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:43,600
stuff is just derived from a biological
 

589
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,590
stuff is just derived from a biological
perspective i feel like these things are

590
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:45,600
perspective i feel like these things are
 

591
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,190
perspective i feel like these things are
innate within us

592
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:47,200
innate within us
 

593
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,509
innate within us
do you think our innately humans are

594
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:49,519
do you think our innately humans are
 

595
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,630
do you think our innately humans are
good like we

596
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:50,640
good like we
 

597
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,750

groups
 

611
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,509
groups
in terms of scale you know what is this

612
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:05,519
in terms of scale you know what is this
 

613
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,870
in terms of scale you know what is this
thing about like at a

at this other level then it goes on at
the widest level he's a libertarian

dodos my bad
 

665
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,030
dodos my bad
but don't you think the particular

666
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,040
but don't you think the particular
 

667
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,110
but don't you think the particular
flavor of the complexity that is the

668
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,120
flavor of the complexity that is the
 

669
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,190
flavor of the complexity that is the
human mind

670
00:10:59,190 --> 00:10:59,200
human mind
 

671
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,069
human mind
was created like let me make an argument

672
00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:02,079
was created like let me make an argument
 

673
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:02,870
was created like let me make an argument
for that

674
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:02,880
for that
 

675
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,670
for that
all people are fundamentally good okay

676
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:05,680
all people are fundamentally good okay
 

677
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,550
all people are fundamentally good okay
is uh

678
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,560
is uh
 

679
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,030
is uh
there's an evolutionary advantage to

680
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:09,040
there's an evolutionary advantage to
 

681
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,670
there's an evolutionary advantage to

to add more love to the world of like

advantage
and scale yes so when we're dealing with

702
00:11:30,949 --> 00:11:30,959
and scale yes so when we're dealing with
 

703
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,310
and scale yes so when we're dealing with
a small tribe

704
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:32,320
a small tribe
 

705
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,670
a small tribe
sure yeah when you meet another tribe

706
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:35,680
sure yeah when you meet another tribe
 

707
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,509
sure yeah when you meet another tribe
maybe there are other factors that are

708
00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:37,519
maybe there are other factors that are
 

709
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,870
maybe there are other factors that are
going into that

710
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:38,880
going into that
 

711
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,190
going into that
let's say you scale up and so

712
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:43,200
let's say you scale up and so
 

713
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,389
let's say you scale up and so
your 150 has exceeded their 150 and

714
00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:46,399
your 150 has exceeded their 150 and
 

715
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,389
your 150 has exceeded their 150 and
like you start to get to a certain point

716
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:48,399
like you start to get to a certain point
 

717
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,509
like you start to get to a certain point
where

718
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:49,519
where
 

719
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,030
where
um you can't really be

720
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,040
um you can't really be
 

721
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,590
um you can't really be
close enough to someone down the line of

722
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:55,600
close enough to someone down the line of
 

723
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,069
close enough to someone down the line of
some of of that next like that 150s 150

724
00:11:58,069 --> 00:11:58,079
some of of that next like that 150s 150
 

725
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,030
some of of that next like that 150s 150

it's less about scale and more about the

it's less about scale and more about the

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,590
it's less about scale and more about the

if we have more than enough resources

if we have more than enough resources
then the way we treat a stranger

then the way we treat a stranger

then the way we treat a stranger
the way we position ourselves towards

the way we position ourselves towards
 

801
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,509
the way we position ourselves towards

00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:21,519
that stranger might be
 

803
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,790
that stranger might be
in a way that uh allows us to be our

00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:24,800
in a way that uh allows us to be our

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,470
in a way that uh allows us to be our

real human selves as opposed to sort of

and therefore it's mostly about how
 

811
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:31,190
and therefore it's mostly about how

to uh

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,350
to uh
efficiently use the resources we have

820
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:39,360
efficiently use the resources we have
 

821
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,030
efficiently use the resources we have
such that we're not constrained

such that we're not constrained
 

823
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,470
such that we're not constrained

and my hope is that we can

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,230
that are starving for resources
yes uh i think that there's a lot of uh

832
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:56,240
yes uh i think that there's a lot of uh
 

833
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,430
yes uh i think that there's a lot of uh
rationality behind uh this argument and

834
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:01,440
rationality behind uh this argument and
 

835
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,910
rationality behind uh this argument and
you know in in some ways i agree and and

836
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:03,920
you know in in some ways i agree and and
 

837
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,829
you know in in some ways i agree and and
in a lot of ways i see it as

has been playing out across time when
 

845
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,670
has been playing out across time when
you look at uh what

you look at uh what
 

847
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,389
you look at uh what
for one it's like define resources you

848
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:18,399
for one it's like define resources you
 

849
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,189
for one it's like define resources you
know what is a

850
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:19,199
know what is a

what is a resource of of as
 

853
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,670
what is a resource of of as
humans uh would would define it right

854
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:25,680
humans uh would would define it right
 

855
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,710
humans uh would would define it right
or wealth even and so you can say

00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,030
water obviously is a resource but if we
weigh them

water internet or iphones
 

869
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,990
water internet or iphones
it's water right so if we look at

00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:44,000
it's water right so if we look at
 

871
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,790
it's water right so if we look at

going to be highly detrimental to

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,350
going to be highly detrimental to
to your group because not knowing how to

941
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,189
clean and cook the game once you have it
could be lethal that's fascinating to

942
00:15:59,189 --> 00:15:59,199
could be lethal that's fascinating to
 

943
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,790
could be lethal that's fascinating to
think of that as a basic resource the

944
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:00,800
think of that as a basic resource the
 

945
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,629
think of that as a basic resource the
knowledge to attain the very

946
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:02,639
knowledge to attain the very
 

947
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,230
knowledge to attain the very
low level things of water right and

948
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:04,240
low level things of water right and
 

949
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,150
low level things of water right and
we'll figure it out we did it once

950
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:06,160
we'll figure it out we did it once
 

951
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,710
we'll figure it out we did it once
before

952
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:06,720
before
 

953
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,710
before
and we've done it over and over and over

954
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
and we've done it over and over and over
 

955
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,030
and we've done it over and over and over
and over again it's just costly

956
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:11,040
and over again it's just costly
 

957
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,470
and over again it's just costly
yes it has costs for sure um

958
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:14,480
yes it has costs for sure um
 

959
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,670
yes it has costs for sure um
but when you think of how

960
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:17,680
but when you think of how
 

961
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,389
but when you think of how
you look at the well we'll just deal

962
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:20,399
you look at the well we'll just deal
 

963
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,269
you look at the well we'll just deal
with

964
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:21,279
with
 

965
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,910
with
the first world of the west you look at

966
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:23,920
the first world of the west you look at
 

967
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,829
the first world of the west you look at
the the

968
00:16:25,829 --> 00:16:25,839
the the
 

969
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,389
the the
the pathline the pathway of of western

970
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:28,399
the pathline the pathway of of western
 

971
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:29,430
the pathline the pathway of of western
civilization

972
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:29,440
civilization
 

973
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,910
civilization
and its growth and then you look at how

974
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:31,920
and its growth and then you look at how
 

975
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,389
and its growth and then you look at how
technology injected into it over time

976
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:34,399
technology injected into it over time
 

977
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,590
technology injected into it over time
you know how it magnifies uh

978
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:37,600
you know how it magnifies uh
 

979
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,150
you know how it magnifies uh
things or how pushes things at uh orders

980
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:40,160
things or how pushes things at uh orders
 

981
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,590
things or how pushes things at uh orders
of magnitude faster

982
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:41,600
of magnitude faster
 

983
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,030
of magnitude faster
and then the internet comes along and

984
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:43,040
and then the internet comes along and
 

985
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,629
and then the internet comes along and
even faster you know so you're watching

986
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:44,639
even faster you know so you're watching
 

987
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,629
even faster you know so you're watching
industrial evolution to

988
00:16:46,629 --> 00:16:46,639
industrial evolution to
 

989
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,749
industrial evolution to
what is it the uh the capacitor and then

990
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:49,759
what is it the uh the capacitor and then
 

991
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,550
what is it the uh the capacitor and then
so on it goes further and further and as

992
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:52,560
so on it goes further and further and as
 

993
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,150
so on it goes further and further and as
the internet and technology

994
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,160

basic you're the exactly right person to
 

1477
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,310
basic you're the exactly right person to
ask

1478
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:54,320
ask
 

1479
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,190
ask
what is catch wrestling and what are its

1480
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:57,200
what is catch wrestling and what are its
 

1481
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,470
what is catch wrestling and what are its
defining principles

1482
00:24:58,470 --> 00:24:58,480
defining principles
 

1483
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,830
defining principles
i would say the easiest way for us to

1484
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:01,840
i would say the easiest way for us to
 

1485
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,549
i would say the easiest way for us to
talk about

1486
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:02,559
talk about
 

1487
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,669
talk about
and give uh

1488
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:05,679
and give uh
 

1489
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,830
and give uh
an overview of what catch is in the

1490
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:07,840
an overview of what catch is in the
 

1491
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,149
an overview of what catch is in the
simplest terms is

1492
00:25:10,149 --> 00:25:10,159
simplest terms is
 

1493
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,630
simplest terms is
think of collegiate wrestling with

1494
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:12,640
think of collegiate wrestling with
 

1495
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,669
think of collegiate wrestling with
submissions

1496
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:13,679
submissions
 

1497
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,990
submissions
that is essentially what catch is and

1498
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:16,000
that is essentially what catch is and
 

1499
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,750
that is essentially what catch is and
it's not surprising because collegiate

1500
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:17,760
it's not surprising because collegiate
 

1501
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,909
it's not surprising because collegiate
wrestling is actually derived from

1502
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:19,919
wrestling is actually derived from
 

1503
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,390
wrestling is actually derived from
catch's catch can it's just that over

1504
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,400
catch's catch can it's just that over
 

1505
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:22,950
catch's catch can it's just that over
time

1506
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:22,960
time
 

1507
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,070
time
certain aspects were were

1508
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,080
certain aspects were were
 

1509
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,870
certain aspects were were
removed from the competition structure

1510
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:28,880
removed from the competition structure
 

1511
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,390
removed from the competition structure
so that they became

1512
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:30,400
so that they became
 

1513
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,190
so that they became
null elements things that were discarded

1514
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:33,200
null elements things that were discarded
 

1515
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,510
null elements things that were discarded
but

1516
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:33,520
but
 

1517
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:38,070
but
it's funny that you can take high level

1518
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,080
it's funny that you can take high level
 

1519
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,630
it's funny that you can take high level
amateur collegiate types and you can

1520
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:40,640
amateur collegiate types and you can
 

1521
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,269
amateur collegiate types and you can
show them

1522
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:41,279
show them
 

1523
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,070
show them
a move and then add a little bit to it

1524
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,080
a move and then add a little bit to it
 

1525
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,909
a move and then add a little bit to it
and go oh well hey that was just like

1526
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:45,919
and go oh well hey that was just like
 

1527
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,710
and go oh well hey that was just like
what we already do here but except oh i

1528
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
what we already do here but except oh i
 

1529
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,750
what we already do here but except oh i
didn't know you could take it all the

1530
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:49,760
didn't know you could take it all the
 

1531
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,430
didn't know you could take it all the
way to this point or

1532
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:51,440
way to this point or
 

1533
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,870
way to this point or
you know things of that nature

1534
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:52,880
you know things of that nature
 

1535
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,230
you know things of that nature
especially when it comes to professional

1536
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:54,240
especially when it comes to professional
 

1537
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,070
especially when it comes to professional
wrestling like uh teaching people like

1538

wrestling like uh teaching people like
 

1539
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,029
wrestling like uh teaching people like
no that that

1540
00:25:57,029 --> 00:25:57,039
no that that
 

1541
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,950
no that that
i know you're just using this for in a

1542
00:25:58,950 --> 00:25:58,960
i know you're just using this for in a
 

1543
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,549
i know you're just using this for in a
show but this is actually a real move

1544
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:00,559
show but this is actually a real move
 

1545
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,990
show but this is actually a real move
and here's how it really feels

1546
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:02,000
and here's how it really feels
 

1547
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,070
and here's how it really feels
and so collegiate wrestling and

1548
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:04,080
and so collegiate wrestling and
 

1549
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,430
and so collegiate wrestling and
wrestling in general for people who are

1550
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:05,440
wrestling in general for people who are
 

1551
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,029
wrestling in general for people who are
not aware is basically

1552
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:07,039
not aware is basically
 

1553
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,789
not aware is basically
two people started on their feet and

1554
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:08,799
two people started on their feet and
 

1555
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,470
two people started on their feet and
that's a score

1556
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:10,480
that's a score
 

1557
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,669
that's a score
that they're trying to take each other

1558
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:11,679
that they're trying to take each other
 

1559
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,070
that they're trying to take each other
down and they have to um

1560
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:14,080
down and they have to um
 

1561
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,149
down and they have to um
they score points along the way you can

1562
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:16,159
they score points along the way you can
 

1563
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,269
they score points along the way you can
end matches by

1564
00:26:17,269 --> 00:26:17,279
end matches by
 

1565
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,310
end matches by
pinning them for example on their back

1566
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:20,320
pinning them for example on their back
 

1567
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,350
pinning them for example on their back
i think one way to describe wrestling

1568
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:23,360
i think one way to describe wrestling
 

1569
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,630
i think one way to describe wrestling
is uh it's very much about figuring out

1570
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:26,640
is uh it's very much about figuring out
 

1571
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,830
is uh it's very much about figuring out
ways to establish

1572
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:27,840
ways to establish
 

1573
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,149
ways to establish
control and leverage in these kind of uh

1574
00:26:32,149 --> 00:26:32,159
control and leverage in these kind of uh
 

1575
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,789
control and leverage in these kind of uh
tie ups or there's different styles

1576
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:34,799
tie ups or there's different styles
 

1577
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,549
tie ups or there's different styles
where you can do more from a distance to

1578
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:36,559
where you can do more from a distance to
 

1579
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,070
where you can do more from a distance to
where it's more about the timing and all

1580
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:38,080
where it's more about the timing and all
 

1581
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,430
where it's more about the timing and all
that kind of stuff

1582
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:39,440
that kind of stuff
 

1583
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,149
that kind of stuff
ultimately it's an art of like both

1584
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:42,159
ultimately it's an art of like both
 

1585
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:43,750
ultimately it's an art of like both
upper body and lower body and you could

1586
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:43,760
upper body and lower body and you could
 

1587
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,269
upper body and lower body and you could
choose the different puzzles that you

1588
00:26:45,269 --> 00:26:45,279
choose the different puzzles that you
 

1589
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,230
choose the different puzzles that you
solved there

1590
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:46,240
solved there
 

1591
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,430
solved there
you could be attacking the head the arms

1592
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:49,440
you could be attacking the head the arms
 

1593
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,190
you could be attacking the head the arms
you could be attacking the legs

1594
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,200
you could be attacking the legs
 

1595
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,549
you could be attacking the legs
there's also part of collegiate

1596
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:52,559
there's also part of collegiate
 

1597
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,549
there's also part of collegiate
wrestling that's on the ground

1598
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:54,559
wrestling that's on the ground
 

1599
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,029
wrestling that's on the ground
that has more uh what's called like a

1600
00:26:57,029 --> 00:26:57,039
that has more uh what's called like a
 

1601
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:57,990
that has more uh what's called like a
referee's position

1602
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:58,000
referee's position
 

1603
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,669
referee's position
right the referee's position where

1604
00:26:59,669 --> 00:26:59,679
right the referee's position where
 

1605
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,669
right the referee's position where
you're on uh your hands and knees

1606
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:01,679
you're on uh your hands and knees
 

1607
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,549
you're on uh your hands and knees
basically and so uh do you do you

1608
00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:04,559
basically and so uh do you do you
 

1609
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,750
basically and so uh do you do you
understand what that's supposed to

1610
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:05,760
understand what that's supposed to
 

1611
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,830
understand what that's supposed to
simulate why is that one of the standard

1612
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:07,840
simulate why is that one of the standard
 

1613
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,390
simulate why is that one of the standard
positions

1614
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:08,400
positions
 

1615
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,510
positions
it's one of the standard positions

1616
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:09,520
it's one of the standard positions
 

1617
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,190
it's one of the standard positions
because one it's one of the easiest ways

1618
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:11,200
because one it's one of the easiest ways
 

1619
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,390
because one it's one of the easiest ways
to actually get up

1620
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:12,400
to actually get up
 

1621
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,269
to actually get up
um but two it's because you cannot be on

1622
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:15,279
um but two it's because you cannot be on
 

1623
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:15,909
um but two it's because you cannot be on
your back

1624
00:27:15,909 --> 00:27:15,919
your back
 

1625
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,110
your back
if you're on your back you're getting

1626
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:17,120
if you're on your back you're getting
 

1627
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,269
if you're on your back you're getting
pinned and

1628
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:19,279
pinned and
 

1629
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,389
pinned and
the back exposure or being pinned is

1630
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:22,399
the back exposure or being pinned is
 

1631
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,310
the back exposure or being pinned is
pretty much the universal wrestling

1632
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:26,320
pretty much the universal wrestling
 

1633
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,430
pretty much the universal wrestling
thing one taking the guy from their feet

1634
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:29,440
thing one taking the guy from their feet
 

1635
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,470
thing one taking the guy from their feet
to the floor and two

1636
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:32,480
to the floor and two
 

1637
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,909
to the floor and two

tribe right so if people think that
 

2305

tribalism in this idea of of this uh

2316
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:25,760
tribalism in this idea of of this uh
 

2317
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,870
tribalism in this idea of of this uh
antagonistic concept but and while sure

antagonistic concept but and while sure
 

2319
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,870
antagonistic concept but and while sure
tribalism can be antagonistic tribalism

2320
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:30,880
tribalism can be antagonistic tribalism
 

2321
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,069
tribalism can be antagonistic tribalism
can also be

2322
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:32,079
can also be
 

2323
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,310
can also be
uh a positive thing or i could just say

2324
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:34,320
uh a positive thing or i could just say
 

2325
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,990
uh a positive thing or i could just say
it just seems to be a natural thing

2326
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,000
it just seems to be a natural thing
 

2327
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,310
it just seems to be a natural thing
people you know they create their their

2328
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:38,320
people you know they create their their
 

2329
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,990
people you know they create their their
groups of one sort or another

2330

groups of one sort or another
 

2331
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,589
groups of one sort or another
and so when you have

2332
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:43,599
and so when you have
 

2333
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:45,510
and so when you have
well when you think about where when

2334
00:39:45,510 --> 00:39:45,520
well when you think about where when
 

2335
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,109
well when you think about where when
nation states really started to become a

2336
00:39:47,109 --> 00:39:47,119
nation states really started to become a
 

2337
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:47,589
nation states really started to become a
thing

2338
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:47,599
thing
 

2339
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,190
thing
uh and i don't mean even the more modern

2340
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:51,200
uh and i don't mean even the more modern
 

2341
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,630
uh and i don't mean even the more modern
looking variants that we could think

2342
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:52,640
looking variants that we could think
 

2343
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,630
looking variants that we could think
back of and say the 19th century or

2344
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:54,640
back of and say the 19th century or
 

2345
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,550
back of and say the 19th century or
something like that right

2346
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:56,560
something like that right
 

2347
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,750
something like that right
even older than that i mean you think

2348
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:57,760
even older than that i mean you think
 

2349
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,430
even older than that i mean you think
the assyrians didn't have a state of

2350
00:39:59,430 --> 00:39:59,440
the assyrians didn't have a state of
 

2351
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,270
the assyrians didn't have a state of
some sort of course they did

2352
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:01,280
some sort of course they did
 

2353
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,270
some sort of course they did
um they how do you increase your your

2354
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:03,280
um they how do you increase your your
 

2355
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,750
um they how do you increase your your
your your empire if you don't actually

2356
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:05,760
your your empire if you don't actually
 

2357
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,430
your your empire if you don't actually
have a place to start from

2358
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:07,440
have a place to start from
 

2359
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,589
have a place to start from
a ruler so you're saying like naturally

2360
00:40:09,589 --> 00:40:09,599
a ruler so you're saying like naturally
 

2361
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,349
a ruler so you're saying like naturally
when you start talking thinking about

2362
00:40:11,349 --> 00:40:11,359
when you start talking thinking about
 

2363
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:13,109
when you start talking thinking about
scale of humans

2364
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:13,119
scale of humans
 

2365
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,230
scale of humans
naturally states emerge

2366
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:16,240
naturally states emerge
 

2367
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,270
naturally states emerge
and so can we try to make an argument

2368
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:19,280
and so can we try to make an argument
 

2369
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:19,589
and so can we try to make an argument
for

2370
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:19,599
for
 

2371
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:23,270
for
anarchism which is okay

2372
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:23,280
anarchism which is okay
 

2373
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,270
anarchism which is okay
okay so uh

2374
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:27,280
okay so uh
 

2375
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,069
okay so uh
anarchy in a sense is in opposition to

2376
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:30,079
anarchy in a sense is in opposition to
 

2377
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,190
anarchy in a sense is in opposition to
the

2378
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:31,200
the
 

2379
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,190
the
unhelpful unproductive inefficient

2380
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,200
unhelpful unproductive inefficient
 

2381
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,430
unhelpful unproductive inefficient
bureaucracies that eventually

2382
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:35,440
bureaucracies that eventually
 

2383
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,309
bureaucracies that eventually
the states lead to yes and that's what

2384
00:40:38,309 --> 00:40:38,319
the states lead to yes and that's what
 

2385
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:38,870
the states lead to yes and that's what
we can see

2386
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:38,880
we can see
 

2387
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,950
we can see
i mean i would say less anarchy let more

2388
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:42,960
i mean i would say less anarchy let more
 

2389
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,069
i mean i would say less anarchy let more

2399
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,550
so you you have a sense i hope
maybe let's think like what is the path

2400
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:00,560
maybe let's think like what is the path
 

2401
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,550
maybe let's think like what is the path
forward with the

2402
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:02,560
forward with the
 

2403
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,750
forward with the
inefficient state is it revolution or

2404
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:05,760
inefficient state is it revolution or
 

2405
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,510
inefficient state is it revolution or
is it to work within the system to

2406
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:07,520
is it to work within the system to
 

2407
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,950
is it to work within the system to
constantly improve it

2408
00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:08,960
constantly improve it
 

2409
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,950
constantly improve it
man i don't know that one i mean my

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,000
general sense
 

2413
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,910
general sense
uh and maybe this is the nietzschean

2414
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:13,920
uh and maybe this is the nietzschean
 

2415
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,190
uh and maybe this is the nietzschean
part of me is that

2416
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:15,200
part of me is that
 

2417
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,309
part of me is that
yeah it'll it would take maybe not even

2418
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:18,319
yeah it'll it would take maybe not even
 

2419
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,710
yeah it'll it would take maybe not even
just maybe not even defining uh it

2420
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:20,720
just maybe not even defining uh it
 

2421
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,309
just maybe not even defining uh it
specifically as revolution maybe it

2422
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:22,319
specifically as revolution maybe it
 

2423
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:23,270
specifically as revolution maybe it
would just take

2424
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:23,280
would just take
 

2425
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,470
would just take
just total calamity to to get people to

2426
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:26,480
just total calamity to to get people to
 

2427
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:26,790
just total calamity to to get people to
stop

2428
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:26,800
stop
 

2429
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,430
stop
being shitty to not stop being a lesser

2430
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:29,440
being shitty to not stop being a lesser
 

2431
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,349
being shitty to not stop being a lesser

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:35,589
version of themselves to stop
thinking more about uh things from

00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:35,599
thinking more about uh things from
 

2435
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,349
thinking more about uh things from

and i don't just mean like whether we
 

2449

oh man maybe we should take this off of

00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:50,400
oh man maybe we should take this off of
 

2453
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,510
oh man maybe we should take this off of
our platform because this is too

even
even more it's even more detrimental to

women than men
 

2485
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,710
women than men
because i think uh women have a more

because i think uh women have a more
 

2487
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,829
because i think uh women have a more

now and with also coupled with

00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:42,319
now and with also coupled with
 

2497
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,470

psychic you know i have a sixth sense
 

2507
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,829
psychic you know i have a sixth sense
and what have you and i think that's

2508
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:55,839
and what have you and i think that's
 

2509
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:56,870
and what have you and i think that's
just a

2510
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:56,880
just a
 

2511
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,870
just a
uh a way of

uh a way of
 

2513
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,589
uh a way of
uh simplifying what i think is that

2514
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:03,599
uh simplifying what i think is that
 

2515
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,589
uh simplifying what i think is that
women may be more in tune with

2516
00:43:05,589 --> 00:43:05,599
women may be more in tune with
 

2517
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,829
women may be more in tune with
picking up on the unsaid like they might

2518
00:43:07,829 --> 00:43:07,839
picking up on the unsaid like they might
 

2519
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,950
picking up on the unsaid like they might
be better at seeing

2520
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:10,960
be better at seeing
 

2521
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,589
be better at seeing
physical cues uh inflection and tone

2522
00:43:13,589 --> 00:43:13,599
physical cues uh inflection and tone
 

2523
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:14,710
physical cues uh inflection and tone
like different like they may

2524
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:14,720
like different like they may
 

2525
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,390
like different like they may
be far more sensitive to these things

2526
00:43:16,390 --> 00:43:16,400
be far more sensitive to these things
 

2527
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,750
be far more sensitive to these things
which to me would make sense because

2528
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:17,760
which to me would make sense because
 

2529
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,270
which to me would make sense because
dealing with

2530
00:43:19,270 --> 00:43:19,280
dealing with
 

2531
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,109
dealing with
children that can't uh communicate

2532
00:43:23,109 --> 00:43:23,119
children that can't uh communicate
 

2533
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,750
children that can't uh communicate
uh so so generally more understanding

2534
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:25,760
uh so so generally more understanding
 

2535
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,670
uh so so generally more understanding
and all the full form right now okay

2536
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:27,680
and all the full form right now okay
 

2537
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,550
and all the full form right now okay
now whether it be a woman or a man but

2538
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:30,560
now whether it be a woman or a man but
 

2539
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,829
now whether it be a woman or a man but
especially

2540
00:43:31,829 --> 00:43:31,839
especially
 

2541
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,630
especially
with even the social uh push on this

2542
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:34,640
with even the social uh push on this
 

2543
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,069
with even the social uh push on this
concept of empathy

2544
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:36,079
concept of empathy
 

2545
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:37,270
concept of empathy
which of course it gets to the point

2546
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:37,280
which of course it gets to the point
 

2547
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,270
which of course it gets to the point
where it loses any meaning anymore like

2548
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:39,280
where it loses any meaning anymore like
 

2549
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:39,990
where it loses any meaning anymore like
people use the word

2550
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:40,000
people use the word
 

2551
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,069
people use the word
empathy absolutely incorrectly all the

empathy absolutely incorrectly all the
 

2553
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,150
empathy absolutely incorrectly all the
time and they don't even understand

2554
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:44,160
time and they don't even understand
 

2555
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,030
time and they don't even understand
what you're really asking of people but

2556
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:47,040
what you're really asking of people but
 

2557
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,470
what you're really asking of people but
let's just take it as

let's just take it as
 

2559
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,150
let's just take it as
as we're using empathy in the correct

2560
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:50,160
as we're using empathy in the correct
 

2561
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,829
as we're using empathy in the correct
sense and you're taking on

sense and you're taking on
 

2563
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:54,150
sense and you're taking on
the emotional content of the thing

2564
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:54,160
the emotional content of the thing
 

2565
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,270
the emotional content of the thing
itself

now you open that up to thousands of

00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,440
now you open that up to thousands of
 

2569
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,109
now you open that up to thousands of
people maybe hundreds of thousands of

as far as i can tell i've been banging
this around in my head

2760
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:06,079
this around in my head

you need two units of

2764
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:10,240
you need two units of
 

2765
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,270
you need two units of
accountability and if you don't have

2766
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:13,280
accountability and if you don't have
 

2767

2769
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:18,790
that
what you end up with is

2770
00:47:18,790 --> 00:47:18,800

 

2771
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,549

human self-interest we're not even going

2772
00:47:20,549 --> 00:47:20,559
human self-interest we're not even going
 

2773
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,030
human self-interest we're not even going
to get into evil human self-interest

2774
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:23,040
to get into evil human self-interest
 

2775
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,750

sabotaging other things even not in a
 

2777
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:26,870

okay so in terms of uh let's let's put
 

2781
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,109
okay so in terms of uh let's let's put
this as mathematically speaking

2782

hitler's evil
but it's just not full of ideas no it is

3182
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:12,319
but it's just not full of ideas no it is

but it's just not full of ideas no it is
not

but the starting point for me with
 

3191
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,390
but the starting point for me with
hitler is like

3192
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:20,400
hitler is like
 

3193
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,230
hitler is like
to acknowledge that he's human and

3194
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:24,240
to acknowledge that he's human and
 

3195
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,910
to acknowledge that he's human and
to at least consider the possibility

3196
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:25,920
to at least consider the possibility
 

3197
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,430
to at least consider the possibility
that any one of us could have been

3198
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:27,440
that any one of us could have been
 

3199
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,230
that any one of us could have been
hitler

3200
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:28,240
hitler
 

3201
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,950
hitler
so like that not that peterson kind of

3202
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:30,960
so like that not that peterson kind of
 

3203
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:31,990
so like that not that peterson kind of
concept also

3204
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:32,000
concept also
 

3205
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,790
concept also
um jonathan height has a thing about uh

3206

um jonathan height has a thing about uh
 

3207
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,630
um jonathan height has a thing about uh
the difference between

the difference between
hate and disgust mechanisms and things

3210
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,640
hate and disgust mechanisms and things
 

3211
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,470
hate and disgust mechanisms and things
like that and so he used he

3212
00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:40,480
like that and so he used he

uh and see it more as the the discuss
mechanism then also try and see like if

3224
00:54:51,349 --> 00:54:51,359
mechanism then also try and see like if
 

3225
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:52,390
mechanism then also try and see like if
there's any

3226

probably jarring for people to think but

3238
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:07,920
probably jarring for people to think but
 

3239
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,069
probably jarring for people to think but
we're

3240
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:10,079
we're
 

3241
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,030
we're
we're all i guess supposed potentially

3242
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:13,040
we're all i guess supposed potentially
 

3243
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,789
we're all i guess supposed potentially
capable of just being in

3244
00:55:14,789 --> 00:55:14,799
capable of just being in
 

3245
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:17,030
capable of just being in
and all these evil people in the world

3246
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:17,040
and all these evil people in the world
 

3247
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,030
and all these evil people in the world
think they're doing it for the sake

3248
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:19,040
think they're doing it for the sake
 

3249
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,910
think they're doing it for the sake
of good yeah which makes them the most

3250
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:21,920
of good yeah which makes them the most
 

3251
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,710
of good yeah which makes them the most
dangerous

3252
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:22,720
dangerous
 

3253
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,549
dangerous
and there's some there's differences in

3254
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:24,559
and there's some there's differences in
 

3255
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,390
and there's some there's differences in
levels of insane

3256
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:26,400
levels of insane
 

3257
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,390
levels of insane
i think hitler was way more insane than

3258
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:28,400
i think hitler was way more insane than
 

3259
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,390
i think hitler was way more insane than
stalin i think stalin legitimately

3260
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:30,400
stalin i think stalin legitimately
 

3261
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,030
stalin i think stalin legitimately
thought he was

3262
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:31,040
thought he was
 

3263
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,710
thought he was
being doing good i would say that's

3264
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:34,720
being doing good i would say that's
 

3265
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,230
being doing good i would say that's
probably true stalin it was just

3266
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:38,240
probably true stalin it was just
 

3267
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:41,270
probably true stalin it was just
outright brutal like yeah he had he had

3268
00:55:41,270 --> 00:55:41,280
outright brutal like yeah he had he had
 

3269
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,710
outright brutal like yeah he had he had
his five-year plan he had all those

3270
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:42,720
his five-year plan he had all those
 

3271
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:43,829
his five-year plan he had all those
other things uh

3272
00:55:43,829 --> 00:55:43,839
other things uh
 

3273
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,829
other things uh
he's just had a much lower value for

3274
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:45,839
he's just had a much lower value for
 

3275
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,030
he's just had a much lower value for
human life yes

3276
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:47,040
human life yes
 

3277
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,109
human life yes
and so he was willing to take make

3278
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:49,119
and so he was willing to take make
 

3279
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,349
and so he was willing to take make
decisions about what he actually

3280
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:51,359
decisions about what he actually
 

3281
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,789
decisions about what he actually
as a as a good executive of

3282
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:54,799
as a as a good executive of
 

3283
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,510
as a as a good executive of
which he was of managing different uh

3284
00:55:57,510 --> 00:55:57,520
which he was of managing different uh
 

3285
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,270
which he was of managing different uh
bureaucracies and so on

3286
00:55:59,270 --> 00:55:59,280
bureaucracies and so on
 

3287
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,670
bureaucracies and so on
he was willing to make decisions that

3288
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:01,680
he was willing to make decisions that
 

3289
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,549
he was willing to make decisions that
resulted in

3290
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:02,559
resulted in
 

3291
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,789
resulted in
mass human suffering where hitler was

3292
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:06,799
mass human suffering where hitler was
 

3293
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:10,069
mass human suffering where hitler was
it seems like to me what much moodier so

3294
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:10,079
it seems like to me what much moodier so
 

3295
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,309
it seems like to me what much moodier so
allowed emotions and moves to make his

3296
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:12,319
allowed emotions and moves to make his
 

3297
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,109
allowed emotions and moves to make his
decisions we also have to consider

3298
00:56:15,109 --> 00:56:15,119
decisions we also have to consider
 

3299
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,750
decisions we also have to consider
the different trajectories and how where

3300
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:17,760
the different trajectories and how where
 

3301
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,789
the different trajectories and how where
and when they were making their

3302
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:18,799
and when they were making their
 

3303
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:19,990
and when they were making their
decisions and i mean

3304
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:20,000
decisions and i mean
 

3305
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,990
decisions and i mean
not by time specifically but you know

3306
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:22,000
not by time specifically but you know
 

3307
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,349
not by time specifically but you know
hitler engaged into this

3308
00:56:23,349 --> 00:56:23,359
hitler engaged into this
 

3309
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:27,190
hitler engaged into this
this conflict across multiple continents

3310
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:27,200
this conflict across multiple continents
 

3311
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,470
this conflict across multiple continents
and then that everything that comes with

3312
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:30,480
and then that everything that comes with
 

3313
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,829
and then that everything that comes with
basically fighting the whole world

3314
00:56:33,829 --> 00:56:33,839
basically fighting the whole world
 

3315
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:37,349
basically fighting the whole world
stalin had his conflict and then

3316
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:37,359
stalin had his conflict and then
 

3317
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,549
stalin had his conflict and then
he really mostly compartmentalized the

3318
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:40,559
he really mostly compartmentalized the
 

3319
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:41,589
he really mostly compartmentalized the
rest of it

3320
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:41,599
rest of it
 

3321
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,510
rest of it
so he was dealing with his own internal

3322
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:43,520
so he was dealing with his own internal
 

3323
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:45,109
so he was dealing with his own internal
instead of dealing with the internal and

3324
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:45,119
instead of dealing with the internal and
 

3325
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,309
instead of dealing with the internal and
the external

3326
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:46,319
the external
 

3327
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,390
the external
so if stalin was put under a world war

3328
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:48,400
so if stalin was put under a world war
 

3329
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:49,829
so if stalin was put under a world war
scenario i don't know maybe he would

3330
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:49,839
scenario i don't know maybe he would
 

3331
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,990
scenario i don't know maybe he would
have eventually lost his marbles too

3332
00:56:51,990 --> 00:56:52,000
have eventually lost his marbles too
 

3333
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,390
have eventually lost his marbles too
yeah i'm not sure that you that's you're

3334
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:54,400
yeah i'm not sure that you that's you're
 

3335
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,710
yeah i'm not sure that you that's you're
right the hunger for power

3336
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:56,720
right the hunger for power
 

3337
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,710
right the hunger for power
was more internalized for stalin he

3338
00:56:58,710 --> 00:56:58,720
was more internalized for stalin he
 

3339
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:00,549
was more internalized for stalin he
wanted to control the land that already

3340
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:00,559
wanted to control the land that already
 

3341
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:01,990
wanted to control the land that already
existed as opposed to wanting to

3342
00:57:01,990 --> 00:57:02,000
existed as opposed to wanting to
 

3343
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,670
existed as opposed to wanting to
colonize other lands he was

3344
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:03,680
colonize other lands he was
 

3345
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,030
colonize other lands he was
as nationalistic as hitler but uh

3346
00:57:07,030 --> 00:57:07,040
as nationalistic as hitler but uh
 

3347
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:11,829
as nationalistic as hitler but uh
and was as capable and willing for

3348
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:11,839
and was as capable and willing for
 

3349
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:14,230
and was as capable and willing for
violent conflict as hitler for than the

3350
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:14,240
violent conflict as hitler for than the
 

3351
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,190
violent conflict as hitler for than the
aims of

3352
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:15,200
aims of
 

3353
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,230
aims of
the state but

3354
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:18,240
the state but
 

3355
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,430
the state but
he he he centered and

3356
00:57:21,430 --> 00:57:21,440
he he he centered and
 

3357
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,470
he he he centered and
internalized prior to then

3358
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
internalized prior to then
 

3359
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:26,789
internalized prior to then
externalizing and moving outwards

3360
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:26,799
externalizing and moving outwards
 

3361
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,870
externalizing and moving outwards
whereas even maybe prior to him there

3362
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:28,880
whereas even maybe prior to him there
 

3363
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,069
whereas even maybe prior to him there
was an interest to

3364
00:57:30,069 --> 00:57:30,079
was an interest to
 

3365
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,390
was an interest to
continually push communism in an

3366
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,400
continually push communism in an
 

3367
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,750
continually push communism in an
aggressive sense following on the

3368
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:33,760
aggressive sense following on the
 

3369
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,430
aggressive sense following on the
momentum from the

3370
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:35,440
momentum from the
 

3371
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:38,829
momentum from the
the 1918 revolution and

3372
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:38,839
the 1918 revolution and
 

3373
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,069
the 1918 revolution and
that the halting of that uh

3374
00:57:42,069 --> 00:57:42,079
that the halting of that uh
 

3375
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:44,789
that the halting of that uh
through various aspects i guess in

3376
00:57:44,789 --> 00:57:44,799
through various aspects i guess in
 

3377
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,230
through various aspects i guess in
germany part of that was

3378
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:46,240
germany part of that was
 

3379
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,230
germany part of that was
the the national socialist like they

3380
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:48,240
the the national socialist like they
 

3381
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,670
the the national socialist like they
they came up and then they were the

3382
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:49,680
they came up and then they were the
 

3383
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,030
they came up and then they were the
other ones to fight the communists and

3384
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:51,040
other ones to fight the communists and
 

3385
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,789
other ones to fight the communists and
so you had the two totalitarians going

3386
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:52,799
so you had the two totalitarians going
 

3387
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,069
so you had the two totalitarians going
after it

3388
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:54,079
after it
 

3389
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:55,910
after it
but then in the rest of the world that

3390
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:55,920
but then in the rest of the world that
 

3391
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,829
but then in the rest of the world that
was not dealing with

3392
00:57:57,829 --> 00:57:57,839
was not dealing with
 

3393
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,870
was not dealing with
um totalitarian aspects

3394
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:00,880
um totalitarian aspects
 

3395
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,789
um totalitarian aspects
it was just it wasn't going to stick

3396
00:58:02,789 --> 00:58:02,799
it was just it wasn't going to stick
 

3397
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:04,710
it was just it wasn't going to stick
especially in the west and other places

3398
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:04,720
especially in the west and other places
 

3399
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,069
especially in the west and other places

4415
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,310
that's uh that's i tend to think what it
comes down to is like

4416
01:15:34,310 --> 01:15:34,320
comes down to is like
 

4417
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,470
comes down to is like
strength is fine until you beat me with

4418
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:36,480
strength is fine until you beat me with

uh without even the rules being broken
 

6243
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,189
uh without even the rules being broken
and once that's figured out

and once that's figured out
 

6245
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:51,350
and once that's figured out
you need to make an adjustment no

you need to make an adjustment no

01:58:07,510 --> 01:58:07,520
the point being
 

6883
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:09,109
the point being
i need to find a way to like this is

6884
01:58:09,109 --> 01:58:09,119
i need to find a way to like this is
 

6885
01:58:09,119 --> 01:58:10,629
i need to find a way to like this is
definitive

6886
01:58:10,629 --> 01:58:10,639
definitive
 

6887
01:58:10,639 --> 01:58:12,470
definitive
you don't get to say [\h__\h] about it

6888
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:12,480
you don't get to say [\h__\h] about it
 

6889
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,070
you don't get to say [\h__\h] about it
because i'm the only one who can stand

6890
01:58:14,070 --> 01:58:14,080
because i'm the only one who can stand
 

6891
01:58:14,080 --> 01:58:14,950
because i'm the only one who can stand
right now

6892
01:58:14,950 --> 01:58:14,960
right now
 

6893
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:16,709
right now
that's the way it's got to be anything

6894
01:58:16,709 --> 01:58:16,719
that's the way it's got to be anything
 

6895
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:18,390
that's the way it's got to be anything
less than that is

6896
01:58:18,390 --> 01:58:18,400
less than that is
 

6897
01:58:18,400 --> 01:58:21,109
less than that is
not good enough and even if i achieve

6898
01:58:21,109 --> 01:58:21,119
not good enough and even if i achieve
 

6899
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:21,589
not good enough and even if i achieve
that

6900
01:58:21,589 --> 01:58:21,599
that
 

6901
01:58:21,599 --> 01:58:23,910
that
then i gotta figure out okay it's not a

6902
01:58:23,910 --> 01:58:23,920
then i gotta figure out okay it's not a
 

6903
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,109
then i gotta figure out okay it's not a
given
