sure but i mean sartre was a defender of
 

909
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,269
sure but i mean sartre was a defender of
the soviet union uh he said explicitly

910
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:47,279
the soviet union uh he said explicitly
 

911
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,110
the soviet union uh he said explicitly
about things like gulags like even if

912
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:49,120
about things like gulags like even if
 

913
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,670

915
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,870
it's true we shouldn't talk about it um
so he

916
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:52,880
so he
 

917
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,590
so he
it's what people don't appreciate is how

918

it's what people don't appreciate is how
 

919
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,350
it's what people don't appreciate is how
uh human beings can have contradictory

920
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:57,360
uh human beings can have contradictory
 

921
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,350
uh human beings can have contradictory
ideas in their minds at the same time so

922
00:15:59,350 --> 00:15:59,360
ideas in their minds at the same time so
 

923
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,110
ideas in their minds at the same time so
one would think okay someone's a

924
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:01,120
one would think okay someone's a
 

925
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,110
one would think okay someone's a

think def people that have all sorts of

928
00:16:05,749 --> 00:16:05,759

929
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,509
think def people that have all sorts of

930
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:07,519
contradictions and it's not at all clear
 

931
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,710
contradictions and it's not at all clear
and they'll have a clean conscience

932
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:08,720
and they'll have a clean conscience
 

933
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,670
and they'll have a clean conscience
because the human mind is very

934
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:09,680
because the human mind is very
 

935
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,990
because the human mind is very
sophisticated um and is capable of doing

936
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:12,000
sophisticated um and is capable of doing
 

937
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,949
sophisticated um and is capable of doing
this so

938
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:12,959
this so
 

939
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,590
this so

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,630
discussion about how to create societies
that get more and more people to be free

2998
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:56,640
that get more and more people to be free
 

2999
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,270
that get more and more people to be free
actors and free thinkers that's that's

3000
00:52:59,270 --> 00:52:59,280
actors and free thinkers that's that's
 

3001
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,030
actors and free thinkers that's that's
the question and that that probably

3002
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:01,040
the question and that that probably
 

3003
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,790
the question and that that probably
leads us into a discussion of anarchism

3004
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:02,800
leads us into a discussion of anarchism
 

3005
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,030
leads us into a discussion of anarchism
and so on but yeah i just think we are

3006
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:05,040
and so on but yeah i just think we are
 

3007
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,270
and so on but yeah i just think we are
very young as a species

3008
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:07,280
very young as a species
 

3009
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,670
very young as a species
we're trying to figure out how to

3010
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:09,680
we're trying to figure out how to
 

3011
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,829
we're trying to figure out how to
get ourselves to first be

3012
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:12,839
get ourselves to first be
 

3013
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,109
get ourselves to first be
collaborative but at the same time be

3014
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:15,119
collaborative but at the same time be
 

3015
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,349
collaborative but at the same time be
free spirits and i think both of those

3016
00:53:17,349 --> 00:53:17,359
free spirits and i think both of those
 

3017
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,430
free spirits and i think both of those
are within human nature

3018
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:19,440
are within human nature
 

3019
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,069
are within human nature
i think another big concern

3020
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:22,079
i think another big concern
 

3021
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,109
i think another big concern
is that there's enormous disincentives

3022
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:25,119
is that there's enormous disincentives
 

3023
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,190
is that there's enormous disincentives
and this is michael malus speaking yeah

3024
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,200
and this is michael malus speaking yeah
 

3025
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,309
and this is michael malus speaking yeah
uh for human beings to be kind and for

3026
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:30,319
uh for human beings to be kind and for
 

3027
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:31,589
uh for human beings to be kind and for
tenderness

3028
00:53:31,589 --> 00:53:31,599
tenderness

let's take a step back because whatever

4660
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:37,760
let's take a step back because whatever
 

4661
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,830
let's take a step back because whatever
led to this is not tenable we need to go

4662
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:39,840
led to this is not tenable we need to go
 

4663
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,030
led to this is not tenable we need to go
back to the drawing board if the

4664
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:41,040
back to the drawing board if the
 

4665
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:43,510
back to the drawing board if the
consequence is people are having these

4666
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:43,520
consequence is people are having these
 

4667
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,830
consequence is people are having these
as a result of my decisions and actions

as a result of my decisions and actions
 

4669
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,590
as a result of my decisions and actions
so i think that aspect of anarchism uh

4670
01:21:49,590 --> 01:21:49,600
so i think that aspect of anarchism uh
 

4671
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,350
so i think that aspect of anarchism uh
is very very in certain context healthy

4672
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:53,360
is very very in certain context healthy
 

4673

01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:01,040
exactly do you think that's ultimately a
 

4905
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,550
exactly do you think that's ultimately a
good way to implement

4906
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:02,560
good way to implement
 

4907
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:05,189

you then have to take uh case by case

4922
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:23,040
you then have to take uh case by case
 

4923
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:24,950
you then have to take uh case by case
like there's so many human interactions

4924
01:26:24,950 --> 01:26:24,960
like there's so many human interactions
 

4925
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:27,430
like there's so many human interactions
that are required for life

that are required for life
 

4927
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,110
that are required for life
and there's tension and all those kinds

4928

and there's tension and all those kinds
 

4929
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:32,470
and there's tension and all those kinds
of things it's not always

interactions
 

4953
01:26:53,679 --> 01:26:57,510
interactions
that can't be simply um

you know
 

4957
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,790
you know
it's not as simple as saying you want to

4958
01:27:00,790 --> 01:27:00,800
it's not as simple as saying you want to
 

4959

you both have to agree on stuff and work

4964
01:27:09,669 --> 01:27:09,679
you both have to agree on stuff and work
 

4965
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:11,910
you both have to agree on stuff and work
something out and the mechanisms of that

4966
01:27:11,910 --> 01:27:11,920
something out and the mechanisms of that
 

4967
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:13,430
something out and the mechanisms of that
agreement the game theory of that

4968
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:13,440
agreement the game theory of that
 

4969
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:15,669
agreement the game theory of that
agreement requires different hacks and

01:27:15,669 --> 01:27:15,679
agreement requires different hacks and
 

4971
01:27:15,679 --> 01:27:19,430
agreement requires different hacks and
strategies and the the the question is

4972
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:19,440
strategies and the the the question is
 

4973
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:20,550
strategies and the the the question is
for an

that's well functioning
what kind of hacks

4980
01:27:26,470 --> 01:27:26,480
what kind of hacks
 

4981
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:27,510
what kind of hacks
uh

4982
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:27,520
uh
 

4983
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,070

what kind of ways of behavior are more
 

4985
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:32,790
what kind of ways of behavior are more
likely to be productive and not

you turn the other cheek and give them a
chance to rise to the best version of

chance to rise to the best version of
 

5003

themselves and then find a common ground
 

5005
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,790
themselves and then find a common ground
kind of thing it's it's an open question

5006
01:27:52,790 --> 01:27:52,800
kind of thing it's it's an open question
 

5007
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:54,870
kind of thing it's it's an open question
of how to form those collectives when

01:27:54,870 --> 01:27:54,880
of how to form those collectives when
 

5009

01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:11,510
hurt yeah but then i'd be like this is
out of character for lex i'm sure i

5028
01:28:11,510 --> 01:28:11,520
out of character for lex i'm sure i
 

5029
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:13,430
out of character for lex i'm sure i
could be like let's take a pause here

5030
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:13,440
could be like let's take a pause here
 

5031

like you're getting heated i'm trying to
work this out what's going on here and

5034
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:17,199
work this out what's going on here and
 

5035
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:18,950
work this out what's going on here and
you get a kind of a meta conversation

5036
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:18,960
you get a kind of a meta conversation
 

5037
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:20,550
you get a kind of a meta conversation
but again you and i have a relationship

5038
01:28:20,550 --> 01:28:20,560
but again you and i have a relationship
 

5039

it was a stranger you know who

5042
01:28:25,750 --> 01:28:25,760
it was a stranger you know who
 

5043

5047
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,750
i don't you are coming at me not correct
i don't have to reciprocate in kind i'm

5048
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:31,760
i don't have to reciprocate in kind i'm
 

5049

01:28:35,990 --> 01:28:36,000
to pretend that you deserve respect when
 

5053
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,310
to pretend that you deserve respect when
you're treating me with such contempt

5054
01:28:38,310 --> 01:28:38,320
you're treating me with such contempt
 

5055
01:28:38,320 --> 01:28:40,870
you're treating me with such contempt
i i do defer

5056
01:28:40,870 --> 01:28:40,880
i i do defer
 

5057
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:42,470
i i do defer
especially with people i know because

5058
01:28:42,470 --> 01:28:42,480
especially with people i know because
 

5059
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,149
especially with people i know because
it's just this is smart long-term game

5060
01:28:44,149 --> 01:28:44,159
it's just this is smart long-term game
 

5061
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,070
it's just this is smart long-term game
theory as well as the right thing to do

5062
01:28:46,070 --> 01:28:46,080
theory as well as the right thing to do
 

5063
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,430
theory as well as the right thing to do
i do try to give them the benefit of the

5064
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:47,440
i do try to give them the benefit of the
 

5065
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:49,030
i do try to give them the benefit of the
data first right yeah because if you're

5066
01:28:49,030 --> 01:28:49,040
data first right yeah because if you're
 

5067
01:28:49,040 --> 01:28:51,189
data first right yeah because if you're
gonna go aggro you can't go back but you

5068
01:28:51,189 --> 01:28:51,199
gonna go aggro you can't go back but you
 

5069
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,790
gonna go aggro you can't go back but you
could always go from like let me hear

5070
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:52,800
could always go from like let me hear
 

5071
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,790
could always go from like let me hear
them out and then then i could go aggro

5072
01:28:54,790 --> 01:28:54,800
them out and then then i could go aggro
 

5073
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,430
them out and then then i could go aggro
so there's a big asymmetry there

5074
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:57,440
so there's a big asymmetry there
 

5075
01:28:57,440 --> 01:28:59,110
so there's a big asymmetry there
yeah and that's i mean i don't think

5076
01:28:59,110 --> 01:28:59,120
yeah and that's i mean i don't think
 

5077
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:01,590
yeah and that's i mean i don't think
anyone has the answer to this question

5078
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:01,600
anyone has the answer to this question
 

5079
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:04,070
anyone has the answer to this question
is is that the right strategy to me game

5080
01:29:04,070 --> 01:29:04,080
is is that the right strategy to me game
 

5081
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:05,270
is is that the right strategy to me game
theoretically it seems the right

5082
01:29:05,270 --> 01:29:05,280
theoretically it seems the right
 

5083
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,430
theoretically it seems the right
strategy is to uh with reciprocity is

5084
01:29:07,430 --> 01:29:07,440
strategy is to uh with reciprocity is
 

5085
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:08,950
strategy is to uh with reciprocity is
what game theory says is the right

5086
01:29:08,950 --> 01:29:08,960
what game theory says is the right
 

5087
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:10,629
what game theory says is the right
strategy they did the prisoner's dilemma

5088
01:29:10,629 --> 01:29:10,639
strategy they did the prisoner's dilemma
 

5089
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:12,070
strategy they did the prisoner's dilemma
and they found tit for tat is the one

5090
01:29:12,070 --> 01:29:12,080
and they found tit for tat is the one
 

5091
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,910
and they found tit for tat is the one
that's the most advantageous so that's

5092
01:29:13,910 --> 01:29:13,920
that's the most advantageous so that's
 

5093
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,990
that's the most advantageous so that's
for when it's perfectly rational actors

5094
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:16,000
for when it's perfectly rational actors
 

5095
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,990
for when it's perfectly rational actors
but when you have i mean there's noise

5096
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:18,000
but when you have i mean there's noise
 

5097
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,990
but when you have i mean there's noise
the the

5098
01:29:19,990 --> 01:29:20,000
the the
 

5099
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:23,590
the the
there's uh i think benefit to just even

5100
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:23,600
there's uh i think benefit to just even
 

5101
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,550
there's uh i think benefit to just even
if they keep being shitty to you still

5102
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:26,560
if they keep being shitty to you still
 

5103
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:28,310
if they keep being shitty to you still
being nice to them well then there's the

5104
01:29:28,310 --> 01:29:28,320
being nice to them well then there's the
 

5105
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,070
being nice to them well then there's the
universe where girls are turned off some

5106
01:29:30,070 --> 01:29:30,080
universe where girls are turned off some
 

5107
01:29:30,080 --> 01:29:31,270
universe where girls are turned off some
people are like if you're in a

5108
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:31,280
people are like if you're in a
 

5109
01:29:31,280 --> 01:29:33,189
people are like if you're in a
relationship and not just girls but girl

5110
01:29:33,189 --> 01:29:33,199
relationship and not just girls but girl
 

5111
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:34,950
relationship and not just girls but girl
like some people when you're kind to

5112
01:29:34,950 --> 01:29:34,960
like some people when you're kind to
 

5113

01:30:23,430 --> 01:30:23,440
that's end up being the circumstances
 

5161
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,510
that's end up being the circumstances
but yeah it's it's it's a lot of times

5162

01:30:27,510 --> 01:30:27,520
we're also in plato's cave when you're
 

5165
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,270
we're also in plato's cave when you're
dealing with somebody else you have very

5166
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:29,280
dealing with somebody else you have very
 

5167
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:30,870
dealing with somebody else you have very
very limited information about their

5168
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:30,880
very limited information about their
 

5169
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:32,790
very limited information about their
background and circumstances and that's

5170
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:32,800
background and circumstances and that's
 

5171
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:34,950
background and circumstances and that's
why i will always if it's someone i even

5172
01:30:34,950 --> 01:30:34,960
why i will always if it's someone i even
 

5173
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,990
why i will always if it's someone i even

because i've found especially this comes

5178
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:41,760
because i've found especially this comes
 

5179
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:42,790
because i've found especially this comes
from being a co-author when you

5180
01:30:42,790 --> 01:30:42,800
from being a co-author when you
 

5181
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,149
from being a co-author when you
co-author books and you're walking other

5182

co-author books and you're walking other
 

5183

co-author books and you're walking other
people's shoes you don't know what's a

5184
01:30:46,390 --> 01:30:46,400
people's shoes you don't know what's a
 

5185
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,950
people's shoes you don't know what's a
lot of the information so if it's a lot

5186
01:30:48,950 --> 01:30:48,960
lot of the information so if it's a lot
 

5187
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,950
lot of the information so if it's a lot
of times it's just a misunderstanding

5188
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:50,960
of times it's just a misunderstanding
 

5189
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,709
of times it's just a misunderstanding
but isn't that a fundamentally anarchist

5190
01:30:52,709 --> 01:30:52,719
but isn't that a fundamentally anarchist
 

5191
01:30:52,719 --> 01:30:54,070
but isn't that a fundamentally anarchist
question of

5192
01:30:54,070 --> 01:30:54,080
question of
 

5193
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,470
question of
uh how we figure out this puzzle of

5194
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:56,480
uh how we figure out this puzzle of
 

5195
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,470
uh how we figure out this puzzle of
human complexities in order to form

5196
01:30:58,470 --> 01:30:58,480
human complexities in order to form
 

5197
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,070
human complexities in order to form
voluntary collectives like we have to

5198
01:31:00,070 --> 01:31:00,080
voluntary collectives like we have to
 

5199
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:02,149
voluntary collectives like we have to
figure that out how to make people feel

5200
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:02,159
figure that out how to make people feel
 

5201
01:31:02,159 --> 01:31:04,790
figure that out how to make people feel
good how to make people i agree that's

5202
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:04,800
good how to make people i agree that's
 

5203
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,510
good how to make people i agree that's
fair and that i think i think not only

5204
01:31:07,510 --> 01:31:07,520
fair and that i think i think not only
 

5205
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,709
fair and that i think i think not only
anarchists have to think about this as

5206
01:31:08,709 --> 01:31:08,719
anarchists have to think about this as
 

5207
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:09,750
anarchists have to think about this as
my point

5208
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:09,760
my point
 

5209
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:11,590
my point
of course well

5210
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:11,600
of course well
 

5211
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:12,709
of course well
but we have to think about it more than

5212
01:31:12,709 --> 01:31:12,719
but we have to think about it more than
 

5213
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:13,830
but we have to think about it more than
others do

5214
01:31:13,830 --> 01:31:13,840
others do
 

5215
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,390
others do
right i feel like i should try to argue

5216
01:31:16,390 --> 01:31:16,400
right i feel like i should try to argue
 

5217
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,470
right i feel like i should try to argue
against anarchism at some point out of

5218
01:31:18,470 --> 01:31:18,480
against anarchism at some point out of
 

5219
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:20,470
against anarchism at some point out of
love out of love

so anarchism as opposed to hierarchies

5242
01:31:43,350 --> 01:31:43,360
so anarchism as opposed to hierarchies
 

5243
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:44,709
so anarchism as opposed to hierarchies
well that's left anarchism yeah

5244
01:31:44,709 --> 01:31:44,719
well that's left anarchism yeah
 

5245
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:46,629
well that's left anarchism yeah
anarcho-communism yeah the state but

5246
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:46,639
anarcho-communism yeah the state but
 

5247
01:31:46,639 --> 01:31:47,910
anarcho-communism yeah the state but
there are many hierarchies that are not

5248
01:31:47,910 --> 01:31:47,920
there are many hierarchies that are not
 

5249
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:49,430
there are many hierarchies that are not
the state you we have a hierarchy here

5250
01:31:49,430 --> 01:31:49,440
the state you we have a hierarchy here
 

5251
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,030
the state you we have a hierarchy here
this is your show on differential to you

5252
01:31:51,030 --> 01:31:51,040
this is your show on differential to you
 

5253
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:53,110
this is your show on differential to you
right but they're okay rigid hierarchies

5254
01:31:53,110 --> 01:31:53,120
right but they're okay rigid hierarchies
 

5255
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:55,189
right but they're okay rigid hierarchies
forced hierarchies is the first time yes

5256
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:55,199
forced hierarchies is the first time yes
 

5257
01:31:55,199 --> 01:31:57,430
forced hierarchies is the first time yes
forced hierarchies okay so

5258
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:57,440
forced hierarchies okay so
 

5259
01:31:57,440 --> 01:31:59,510
forced hierarchies okay so
do you think it's possible that

5260
01:31:59,510 --> 01:31:59,520
do you think it's possible that
 

5261
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:02,629
do you think it's possible that
humans when left on their own

5262
01:32:02,629 --> 01:32:02,639
humans when left on their own
 

5263
01:32:02,639 --> 01:32:04,229
humans when left on their own
chord they they form hierarchies

5264
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:04,239
chord they they form hierarchies
 

5265
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:06,070
chord they they form hierarchies
naturally yes inevitably it might be

5266
01:32:06,070 --> 01:32:06,080
naturally yes inevitably it might be
 

5267
01:32:06,080 --> 01:32:07,669
naturally yes inevitably it might be
inevitably which is why i disagree with

5268
01:32:07,669 --> 01:32:07,679
inevitably which is why i disagree with
 

5269
01:32:07,679 --> 01:32:09,350
inevitably which is why i disagree with
the left anarchist i i think it's not a

5270
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:09,360
the left anarchist i i think it's not a
 

5271
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:10,790
the left anarchist i i think it's not a
coherent thing to

5272
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:10,800
coherent thing to
 

5273
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:13,110
coherent thing to
argue for uh non-hierarchical

5274
01:32:13,110 --> 01:32:13,120
argue for uh non-hierarchical
 

5275
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:15,110
argue for uh non-hierarchical
relationships even in theory it doesn't

5276
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:15,120
relationships even in theory it doesn't
 

5277
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:17,990
relationships even in theory it doesn't
make sense to me and i i know the the

5278
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:18,000
make sense to me and i i know the the
 

5279
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:19,830
make sense to me and i i know the the
the old school anarchist will call me

5280
01:32:19,830 --> 01:32:19,840
the old school anarchist will call me
 

5281
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:22,070
the old school anarchist will call me
stupid or uninformed but i i've never

5282
01:32:22,070 --> 01:32:22,080
stupid or uninformed but i i've never
 

5283
01:32:22,080 --> 01:32:23,910
stupid or uninformed but i i've never
been able to even wrap my head around

5284
01:32:23,910 --> 01:32:23,920
been able to even wrap my head around
 

5285
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:24,870
been able to even wrap my head around
this claim that you could have

5286
01:32:24,870 --> 01:32:24,880
this claim that you could have
 

5287
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:26,629
this claim that you could have
relationships with that hierarchy

5288
01:32:26,629 --> 01:32:26,639
relationships with that hierarchy
 

5289
01:32:26,639 --> 01:32:27,669
relationships with that hierarchy
right so

5290
01:32:27,669 --> 01:32:27,679
right so
 

5291
01:32:27,679 --> 01:32:29,110
right so
i guess there's a certain sense in which

5292
01:32:29,110 --> 01:32:29,120
i guess there's a certain sense in which
 

5293
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,110
i guess there's a certain sense in which
we're living in anarchism now and i

5294
01:32:31,110 --> 01:32:31,120
we're living in anarchism now and i
 

5295
01:32:31,120 --> 01:32:32,790
we're living in anarchism now and i
don't mean just like because the the

5296
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:32,800
don't mean just like because the the
 

5297
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,550
don't mean just like because the the
nations as you've said

5298
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:34,560
nations as you've said
 

5299
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,110
nations as you've said
are uh in anarchism relative to each

5300
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:37,120
are uh in anarchism relative to each
 

5301
01:32:37,120 --> 01:32:39,750
are uh in anarchism relative to each
other but isn't the united states just a

5302
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:39,760
other but isn't the united states just a
 

5303
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:42,470
other but isn't the united states just a
collective that was formed in anarchy

5304
01:32:42,470 --> 01:32:42,480
collective that was formed in anarchy
 

5305
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:44,149
collective that was formed in anarchy
and this is just the collective that

5306
01:32:44,149 --> 01:32:44,159
and this is just the collective that
 

5307
01:32:44,159 --> 01:32:45,990
and this is just the collective that
we're operating under this hierarchy

5308
01:32:45,990 --> 01:32:46,000
we're operating under this hierarchy
 

5309
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,149
we're operating under this hierarchy
that was naturally formed it wasn't well

5310
01:32:48,149 --> 01:32:48,159
that was naturally formed it wasn't well
 

5311
01:32:48,159 --> 01:32:49,270
that was naturally formed it wasn't well
the united states was not naturally

5312
01:32:49,270 --> 01:32:49,280
the united states was not naturally
 

5313
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:51,030
the united states was not naturally
formed it was formed by force and and by

5314
01:32:51,030 --> 01:32:51,040
formed it was formed by force and and by
 

5315
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,310
formed it was formed by force and and by
fiat but

5316
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:52,320
fiat but
 

5317
01:32:52,320 --> 01:32:55,030
fiat but
to your point um i i stress this

5318
01:32:55,030 --> 01:32:55,040
to your point um i i stress this
 

5319
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:57,510
to your point um i i stress this
throughout the book uh i always say this

5320
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:57,520
throughout the book uh i always say this
 

5321
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,110
throughout the book uh i always say this
anarchism is not a location it's a

5322
01:32:59,110 --> 01:32:59,120
anarchism is not a location it's a
 

5323
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:00,310
anarchism is not a location it's a
relationship

5324
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:00,320
relationship
 

5325
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:02,229
relationship
so yeah you and i do have a hierarchy in

5326
01:33:02,229 --> 01:33:02,239
so yeah you and i do have a hierarchy in
 

5327
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:04,149
so yeah you and i do have a hierarchy in
that this is your show but not but

5328
01:33:04,149 --> 01:33:04,159
that this is your show but not but
 

5329
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:05,830
that this is your show but not but
neither of us really has an authority

5330
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:05,840
neither of us really has an authority
 

5331
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,910
neither of us really has an authority
over the other like i'm here voluntarily

5332
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:07,920
over the other like i'm here voluntarily

5411
01:34:25,199 --> 01:34:27,430
your money or your life you are making a
choice but what the anarchist argument

5412
01:34:27,430 --> 01:34:27,440
choice but what the anarchist argument
 

5413
01:34:27,440 --> 01:34:29,750
choice but what the anarchist argument
is they're not a position to force you

5414
01:34:29,750 --> 01:34:29,760
is they're not a position to force you
 

5415
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,229
is they're not a position to force you
to make that choice that is not morally

5416
01:34:32,229 --> 01:34:32,239
to make that choice that is not morally
 

5417
01:34:32,239 --> 01:34:33,510
to make that choice that is not morally
binding even though they have

5418
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:33,520
binding even though they have
 

5419
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:35,910
binding even though they have
practically the power to force you into

5420
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:35,920
practically the power to force you into
 

5421
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,550
practically the power to force you into
that dilemma but you have the freedom to

5422
01:34:38,550 --> 01:34:38,560
that dilemma but you have the freedom to
 

5423
01:34:38,560 --> 01:34:41,750
that dilemma but you have the freedom to
live on the united states or not so so

5424
01:34:41,750 --> 01:34:41,760
live on the united states or not so so
 

5425
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,270
live on the united states or not so so
even

5426
01:34:43,270 --> 01:34:43,280
even
 

5427
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,109
even
i see yeah the argument is if you don't

5428
01:34:45,109 --> 01:34:45,119
i see yeah the argument is if you don't
 

5429
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,350
i see yeah the argument is if you don't
like it leave right not necessarily

5430
01:34:47,350 --> 01:34:47,360
like it leave right not necessarily
 

5431
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,590
like it leave right not necessarily
leave like geographically but there's

5432
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:49,600
leave like geographically but there's
 

5433
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:52,310
leave like geographically but there's
there's ways to live

5434
01:34:52,310 --> 01:34:52,320
there's ways to live
 

5435
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:55,030
there's ways to live
outside the force of the united states

5436
01:34:55,030 --> 01:34:55,040
outside the force of the united states
 

5437
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:56,470
outside the force of the united states
there's ways it's just very difficult to

5438
01:34:56,470 --> 01:34:56,480
there's ways it's just very difficult to
 

5439
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:57,990
there's ways it's just very difficult to
operate that way but that's like saying

5440
01:34:57,990 --> 01:34:58,000
operate that way but that's like saying
 

5441
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,590
operate that way but that's like saying
you could outrun the mugger which is

5442
01:34:59,590 --> 01:34:59,600
you could outrun the mugger which is
 

5443
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,470
you could outrun the mugger which is
true but the issue is does that mugger

5444
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:02,480
true but the issue is does that mugger
 

5445
01:35:02,480 --> 01:35:03,910
true but the issue is does that mugger
have the right

5446
01:35:03,910 --> 01:35:03,920
have the right
 

5447
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,109

is that person a moral actor and the
 

5455
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:16,629
is that person a moral actor and the
anarchist answer is never and the

5456
01:35:16,629 --> 01:35:16,639
anarchist answer is never and the
 

5457
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:18,950
anarchist answer is never and the
difference one more thing the anarchist

5458

difference one more thing the anarchist
 

5459
01:35:18,960 --> 01:35:20,229
difference one more thing the anarchist
view is the difference between that

an air of legitimacy literally they're
 

5465
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,629
an air of legitimacy literally they're
morally identical so is it possible that

01:35:28,629 --> 01:35:28,639
morally identical so is it possible that
 

5467
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:29,910
morally identical so is it possible that
every

uh
that's not worst case scenario

6426
01:51:55,189 --> 01:51:55,199
that's not worst case scenario
 

6427

01:57:50,470 --> 01:57:50,480

 

6785
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,709

oblivious to how bad things were that we

01:57:52,709 --> 01:57:52,719
oblivious to how bad things were that we
 

6787
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:54,390
oblivious to how bad things were that we
see things are bad now so we assume that

6788
01:57:54,390 --> 01:57:54,400
see things are bad now so we assume that
 

6789
01:57:54,400 --> 01:57:55,990

they were better than in some context
 

6791
01:57:56,000 --> 01:57:57,990

6796
01:58:02,310 --> 01:58:02,320
argument for government for me the
 

6797
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:04,629
argument for government for me the
strongest argument is like food stamps

6798
01:58:04,629 --> 01:58:04,639
strongest argument is like food stamps
 

6799
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:06,950

that's gonna have deleterious effects
 

6819
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:26,149
that's gonna have deleterious effects
but if the choice is an inefficient

6829
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:37,589

charity would be more efficient and

01:58:38,950 --> 01:58:38,960
charity would be more efficient and
 

6833
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,629
charity would be more efficient and
distributed more effectively but i at

01:58:40,629 --> 01:58:40,639
distributed more effectively but i at
 

6835
01:58:40,639 --> 01:58:41,669
distributed more effectively but i at
that point i don't really care about

6836
01:58:41,669 --> 01:58:41,679
that point i don't really care about
 

6837
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:43,990
that point i don't really care about
efficiency i if you're throwing out food

6838
01:58:43,990 --> 01:58:44,000
efficiency i if you're throwing out food

the state at its worst so if we take

6850
01:59:00,629 --> 01:59:00,639
the state at its worst so if we take
 

6851
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:04,709
the state at its worst so if we take
away

6852
01:59:04,709 --> 01:59:04,719

 

6853
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:06,550

yeah i mean wouldn't that be a huge step

6854
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:06,560
yeah i mean wouldn't that be a huge step
 

6855
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:08,870
yeah i mean wouldn't that be a huge step
forward yeah instead of regarded we're

01:59:13,510 --> 01:59:13,520
we're taught as kids in school that war
 

6861
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:16,310
we're taught as kids in school that war
is a last resort and i agree with that

is a last resort and i agree with that
 

6863
01:59:16,320 --> 01:59:18,229
is a last resort and i agree with that
and yet when you look at the corporate

6864
01:59:18,229 --> 01:59:18,239
and yet when you look at the corporate
 

6865
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:21,350
and yet when you look at the corporate
press war is always the first response

6866
01:59:21,350 --> 01:59:21,360
press war is always the first response
 

6867
01:59:21,360 --> 01:59:25,189
press war is always the first response
and these people do not talk about what

6868
01:59:25,189 --> 01:59:25,199
and these people do not talk about what
 

6869
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:28,149
and these people do not talk about what
war means they'll show examples during

6870
01:59:28,149 --> 01:59:28,159
war means they'll show examples during
 

6871
01:59:28,159 --> 01:59:30,470
war means they'll show examples during
the bush years of soldiers coming home

6872
01:59:30,470 --> 01:59:30,480
the bush years of soldiers coming home
 

6873
01:59:30,480 --> 01:59:32,310
the bush years of soldiers coming home
in caskets which already is an

6874
01:59:32,310 --> 01:59:32,320
in caskets which already is an
 

6875
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:34,390
in caskets which already is an
unacceptable price in many cases for me

6876
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:34,400
unacceptable price in many cases for me
 

6877
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,870
unacceptable price in many cases for me
but they don't even pretend to care

6878
01:59:36,870 --> 01:59:36,880
but they don't even pretend to care
 

6879
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:38,390
but they don't even pretend to care
about the people overseas whose

6880
01:59:38,390 --> 01:59:38,400
about the people overseas whose
 

6881
01:59:38,400 --> 01:59:40,870
about the people overseas whose
countries we've ransacked and uh lives

6882
01:59:40,870 --> 01:59:40,880
countries we've ransacked and uh lives
 

6883
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:42,149
countries we've ransacked and uh lives
we've ruined and it's just like well

6884
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:42,159
we've ruined and it's just like well
 

6885
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:43,589
we've ruined and it's just like well
what are you gonna do not ransack those

6886
01:59:43,589 --> 01:59:43,599
what are you gonna do not ransack those
 

6887
01:59:43,599 --> 01:59:44,470
what are you gonna do not ransack those
countries

6888
01:59:44,470 --> 01:59:44,480
countries
 

6889
01:59:44,480 --> 01:59:45,189
countries
so

6890
01:59:45,189 --> 01:59:45,199
so
 

6891
01:59:45,199 --> 01:59:48,310
so
that war is it to me is the state at its

6892
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:48,320
that war is it to me is the state at its
 

6893
01:59:48,320 --> 01:59:50,310
that war is it to me is the state at its
worst see i

6894
01:59:50,310 --> 01:59:50,320
worst see i
 

6895
01:59:50,320 --> 01:59:52,709
worst see i
think that there is value from small

6896
01:59:52,709 --> 01:59:52,719
think that there is value from small
 

6897
01:59:52,719 --> 01:59:55,270
think that there is value from small
