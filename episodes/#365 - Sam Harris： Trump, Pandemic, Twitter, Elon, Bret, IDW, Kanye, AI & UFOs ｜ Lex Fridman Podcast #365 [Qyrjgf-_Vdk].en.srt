00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,110
the and we find
the story boring and we'll change the

330
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:36,120
the story boring and we'll change the
 

331
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,850
the story boring and we'll change the
channel in the face of a genocide right

332
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:37,860
channel in the face of a genocide right
 

333
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,890
channel in the face of a genocide right
it doesn't matter and it literally it

334
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:39,900
it doesn't matter and it literally it
 

335
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,890
it doesn't matter and it literally it
perversely it could be 500 000 little

336
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:42,900
perversely it could be 500 000 little

girls have fallen down wells in that

338
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:45,300
girls have fallen down wells in that
 

339
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,650
girls have fallen down wells in that
country and we still don't care right so

340
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:48,660
country and we still don't care right so
 

341
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,590
country and we still don't care right so
um it's uh you know many of us have come

342
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:51,600
um it's uh you know many of us have come
 

343
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,210
um it's uh you know many of us have come
to believe that this is a bug rather

344
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:53,220
to believe that this is a bug rather
 

345
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,770
to believe that this is a bug rather
than a feature of our moral psychology

346
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:54,780
than a feature of our moral psychology
 

347
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,350
than a feature of our moral psychology
and so the the empathy plays an

348
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:57,360
and so the the empathy plays an
 

349
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,749
and so the the empathy plays an
unhelpful role there so ultimately I

350
00:06:59,749 --> 00:06:59,759
unhelpful role there so ultimately I
 

351
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,650
unhelpful role there so ultimately I
think

352
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:00,660
think
 

353
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,450
think
when we're making big decisions about

354
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:02,460
when we're making big decisions about
 

355
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,969
when we're making big decisions about
what we should do and how to mitigate

356
00:07:04,969 --> 00:07:04,979
what we should do and how to mitigate
 

357
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:07,790
what we should do and how to mitigate
human suffering and what's worth valuing

358
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:07,800
human suffering and what's worth valuing
 

359
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,969
human suffering and what's worth valuing
and how we should protect those values

360
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:10,979
and how we should protect those values
 

361
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:11,629
and how we should protect those values
um

362
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:11,639
um
 

363
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,090
um
I think reason is the better tool but

364
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,100
I think reason is the better tool but
 

365
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,290
I think reason is the better tool but
it's not that I would want to dispense

366
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:15,300
it's not that I would want to dispense
 

367
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,629
it's not that I would want to dispense
with any part of empathy either well

368
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:17,639
with any part of empathy either well
 

369
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,010
with any part of empathy either well
there's a lot of tangents to go on there

370
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:19,020
there's a lot of tangents to go on there
 

371
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,110
there's a lot of tangents to go on there

horribly misquote you but
 

381
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,189
horribly misquote you but
that you'd rather live in a world like

that you'd rather live in a world like
 

383
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,990
that you'd rather live in a world like
it doesn't really make sense but you'd

the right answer is there or even

this part of the moral landscape but so
 

411
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,189
this part of the moral landscape but so
the the opposition is between an ethic

I don't deserve to have a strong opinion
 

933
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,770
I don't deserve to have a strong opinion

1297
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,710
the that was one minute to midnight for
our democracy as far as I'm concerned

1298
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:39,720

1299
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,549
our democracy as far as I'm concerned
and I think it really was but for

1300
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:43,559
and I think it really was but for
 

1301
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:48,470
and I think it really was but for
the the Integrity of a few people that

1302
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:48,480
the the Integrity of a few people that
 

1303
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,110
the the Integrity of a few people that
we didn't suffer some real

1304
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:50,120
we didn't suffer some real
 

1305
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,149
we didn't suffer some real
constitutional crisis and and real

1306
00:25:53,149 --> 00:25:53,159
constitutional crisis and and real
 

1307
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:55,610
constitutional crisis and and real
emergency you know after January 6. I

1308
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:55,620
emergency you know after January 6. I
 

1309
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,850
emergency you know after January 6. I
mean if Mike Pence had caved in and

1310
00:25:58,850 --> 00:25:58,860
mean if Mike Pence had caved in and
 

1311
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,230
mean if Mike Pence had caved in and
decided to non-certify the election

1312
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:00,240
decided to non-certify the election
 

1313
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,230
decided to non-certify the election
right uh if it literally you can count

1314
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:03,240
right uh if it literally you can count
 

1315
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,269
right uh if it literally you can count
on two hands the number of people who

1316
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:05,279
on two hands the number of people who
 

1317
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,870
on two hands the number of people who
held things together at that moment and

1318
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:08,880
held things together at that moment and
 

1319
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,850
held things together at that moment and
so it was so it wasn't for want of

1320
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:10,860
so it was so it wasn't for want of
 

1321
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,570
so it was so it wasn't for want of
trying on Trump's part that we we um

1322
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:14,580
trying on Trump's part that we we um
 

1323
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,230
trying on Trump's part that we we um
didn't succumb to some you know real

1324
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:17,240
didn't succumb to some you know real
 

1325
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,529
didn't succumb to some you know real
truly Uncharted uh uh catastrophe with

1326
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:21,539
truly Uncharted uh uh catastrophe with
 

1327
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,210
truly Uncharted uh uh catastrophe with
our democracy so the fact that that

1328
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:23,220
our democracy so the fact that that
 

1329
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:24,350
our democracy so the fact that that
didn't happen

1330
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:24,360
didn't happen
 

1331
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,890
didn't happen
is not a sign that those of us who were

1332
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:27,900
is not a sign that those of us who were
 

1333
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,450
is not a sign that those of us who were
worried that it was

1334
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:29,460
worried that it was
 

1335
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,490
worried that it was
so close to happening were exaggerating

1336
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:31,500
so close to happening were exaggerating
 

1337
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,110
so close to happening were exaggerating
the problem I mean it's like you know

1338
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:33,120
the problem I mean it's like you know
 

1339
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,990
the problem I mean it's like you know
you almost got run over by a car but you

1340
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,000
you almost got run over by a car but you
 

1341
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,390
you almost got run over by a car but you
didn't and so you know you're the fact

1342
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:38,400
didn't and so you know you're the fact
 

1343
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,710
didn't and so you know you're the fact
that you're adrenalized and you're

1344
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:39,720
that you're adrenalized and you're
 

1345
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,029
that you're adrenalized and you're
thinking you know but boy that was

1346
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:41,039
thinking you know but boy that was
 

1347
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,409
thinking you know but boy that was
dangerous I probably shouldn't you know

1348
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:42,419
dangerous I probably shouldn't you know
 

1349
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:43,909
dangerous I probably shouldn't you know
you know wander in the middle of the

1350
00:26:43,909 --> 00:26:43,919
you know wander in the middle of the
 

1351
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,610
you know wander in the middle of the
street uh with my eyes closed

1352
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:46,620
street uh with my eyes closed
 

1353
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,830
street uh with my eyes closed
um you weren't wrong to feel that you

1354
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:48,840
um you weren't wrong to feel that you
 

1355
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,049
um you weren't wrong to feel that you
really had a problem right

1356
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:51,059
really had a problem right
 

1357
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:52,070
really had a problem right
um

1358
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,080
um
 

1359
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,289
um
and came very close to something truly

1360
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:54,299
and came very close to something truly
 

1361
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:57,409
and came very close to something truly
uh terrible so I think that's where we

1362
00:26:57,409 --> 00:26:57,419
uh terrible so I think that's where we
 

1363
00:26:57,419 --> 00:26:58,970
uh terrible so I think that's where we
were and I think we shouldn't do that

1364
00:26:58,970 --> 00:26:58,980
were and I think we shouldn't do that
 

1365
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,830
were and I think we shouldn't do that
again right so the fact that he's he's

still he's coming back around as
 

1369
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,669
still he's coming back around as
potentially a viable candidate you know

1370

it's all it all can be taken in the
spirit of kind of reality television

1442
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,080
spirit of kind of reality television
 

1443
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,210
spirit of kind of reality television
it's like this is just this is the part

1444
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:23,220
it's like this is just this is the part
 

1445
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,470
it's like this is just this is the part
of the movie that's just fun to watch

1446
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:24,480
of the movie that's just fun to watch
 

1447
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,930
of the movie that's just fun to watch
right and

1448
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:26,940
right and
 

1449
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,630
right and
I understand that I can even inhabit

1450
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:29,640
I understand that I can even inhabit
 

1451
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,210
I understand that I can even inhabit
that space for a few minutes at a time

1452
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:32,220
that space for a few minutes at a time
 

1453
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,310
that space for a few minutes at a time
but

1454
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,320
but
 

1455
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,169
but
there's a deeper concern that we're in

1456
00:28:36,169 --> 00:28:36,179
there's a deeper concern that we're in
 

1457
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,210
there's a deeper concern that we're in
the process of entertaining ourselves to

1458
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:38,220
the process of entertaining ourselves to
 

1459
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,370
the process of entertaining ourselves to
death right that we're just not taking

1460
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,380
death right that we're just not taking
 

1461
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,289
death right that we're just not taking
things seriously and this is it's a

1462
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:42,299
things seriously and this is it's a
 

1463
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,610
things seriously and this is it's a
problem I've had with several other

1464
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:43,620
problem I've had with several other
 

1465
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,549

00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:46,559
people we might name who just who just
 

1467
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,549
people we might name who just who just

appear to me to be goofing around at
 

1469
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,370
appear to me to be goofing around at
scale and they lack a kind of moral

1470
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:52,380
scale and they lack a kind of moral
 

1471
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,590
scale and they lack a kind of moral
seriousness I mean they're touching big

1472
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:54,600
seriousness I mean they're touching big
 

1473
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,990
seriousness I mean they're touching big
problems where lives hang in the balance

1474
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:57,000
problems where lives hang in the balance
 

1475
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,169
problems where lives hang in the balance
but they're just [\h__\h] around and

1476
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:00,179
but they're just [\h__\h] around and
 

1477
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:01,669
but they're just [\h__\h] around and
I think they're really important

1478
00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:01,679
I think they're really important
 

1479
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,769
I think they're really important
problems that we have to get our head

1480
00:29:03,769 --> 00:29:03,779
problems that we have to get our head
 

1481
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:04,850
problems that we have to get our head
straight around

1482
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:04,860
straight around
 

1483
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,610
straight around
and we need you know it's not to say

1484
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:07,620
and we need you know it's not to say
 

1485
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,169
and we need you know it's not to say
that that institutions don't become

00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:09,179
that that institutions don't become
 

1487
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:11,269
that that institutions don't become
corrupt I think they do and I think and

1488
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:11,279
corrupt I think they do and I think and
 

1489
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,549
corrupt I think they do and I think and
I'm quite worried that you know both

1490
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:13,559
I'm quite worried that you know both
 

1491
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:15,529
I'm quite worried that you know both
about the the loss of trust in our

1492
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:15,539
about the the loss of trust in our
 

1493
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:18,529
about the the loss of trust in our
institutions and the

1494
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:18,539
institutions and the
 

1495
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:20,930
institutions and the
the fact that trust has eroded for good

1496
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:20,940
the fact that trust has eroded for good
 

1497
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,310
the fact that trust has eroded for good
reason right that they have become less

1498
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:22,320
reason right that they have become less
 

1499
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,110
reason right that they have become less
trustworthy I I think you know they've

1500
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,120
trustworthy I I think you know they've
 

1501
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,669
trustworthy I I think you know they've
become infected by

1502
00:29:25,669 --> 00:29:25,679

1503
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,590
become infected by
you know political ideologies that are

about and then you
 

1559
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,769
about and then you
you in the process of getting more

1560
00:30:24,769 --> 00:30:24,779
you in the process of getting more
 

1561
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,750
you in the process of getting more
informed yourself your your audience is

1562
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:26,760
informed yourself your your audience is
 

1563
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,010
informed yourself your your audience is
getting more informed so you're asking

1564
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:28,020
getting more informed so you're asking
 

1565
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,350
getting more informed so you're asking
smart questions and you might be pushing

1566
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:30,360
smart questions and you might be pushing
 

1567
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,090
smart questions and you might be pushing
back at the margins

1568
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:32,100
back at the margins
 

1569
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,950
back at the margins
but you know that when push comes to

1570
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:33,960
but you know that when push comes to
 

1571
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,649
but you know that when push comes to
shove on that topic you really don't

1572
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:36,659
shove on that topic you really don't
 

1573
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:39,289
shove on that topic you really don't
have a basis to have a a strong opinion

1574
00:30:39,289 --> 00:30:39,299
have a basis to have a a strong opinion
 

1575
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:41,149
have a basis to have a a strong opinion
and

1576
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:41,159
and
 

1577
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:43,730
and
if you were going to form a a a strong

00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:43,740
if you were going to form a a a strong
 

1579
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,470
if you were going to form a a a strong
opinion that was this counter to the

1580
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:45,480
opinion that was this counter to the
 

1581
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,149
opinion that was this counter to the
expert you have in front of you it's

1582
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:47,159
expert you have in front of you it's
 

1583
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,070
expert you have in front of you it's
going to be by deference to some other

1584
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:49,080
going to be by deference to some other
 

1585
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,690
going to be by deference to some other
expert who you've brought in or who

1586
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:50,700
expert who you've brought in or who
 

1587
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,730
expert who you've brought in or who
you've heard about or whose work you've

1588
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:52,740
you've heard about or whose work you've
 

1589
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:55,190
you've heard about or whose work you've
read or whatever but there's a paradox

1590
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:55,200
read or whatever but there's a paradox
 

1591
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,269
read or whatever but there's a paradox
to

1592
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:56,279
to
 

1593
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,269
to
how we value Authority in science that

1594
00:30:59,269 --> 00:30:59,279
how we value Authority in science that
 

1595
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,310
how we value Authority in science that
most people don't understand and I think

1596
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:01,320
most people don't understand and I think
 

1597
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,409
most people don't understand and I think
we should at some point unravel that

1598
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:03,419
we should at some point unravel that
 

1599

agree with
 

2239
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,030
agree with
many many of us probably so uh

2240
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:20,040
many many of us probably so uh
 

2241
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,490
many many of us probably so uh
probably more often than not at least on

policy that you know we should take

2246
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:26,460
policy that you know we should take
 

2247
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,329
policy that you know we should take
China seriously as an adversary right

2248

China seriously as an adversary right
 

2249

China seriously as an adversary right
and

2250
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:31,560
and
 

2251
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:34,550
and
um I think I mean again that you have to

2252
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:34,560
um I think I mean again that you have to
 

2253

um I think I mean again that you have to
there's a lot of fine print to a lot of

2254
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:36,119
there's a lot of fine print to a lot of

2256
00:43:37,970 --> 00:43:37,980
this because the way he talks about
 

2257
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,490
this because the way he talks about
these things and and many of his motives

2258
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:40,500
these things and and many of his motives
 

2259
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,589
these things and and many of his motives
that are obvious or things that I um

2260
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:42,599
that are obvious or things that I um
 

2261
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,510
that are obvious or things that I um
don't support but I'm gonna take

2262
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:44,520
don't support but I'm gonna take
 

2263
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,609
don't support but I'm gonna take
immigration I think there's

2264
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:46,619
immigration I think there's
 

2265
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:48,589
immigration I think there's
it's obvious that we should have control

2266
00:43:48,589 --> 00:43:48,599
it's obvious that we should have control
 

2267
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,349
it's obvious that we should have control
of our borders right like I I don't see

2268
00:43:51,349 --> 00:43:51,359
of our borders right like I I don't see
 

2269
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,870
of our borders right like I I don't see
the argument for not having control of

2270
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:53,880
the argument for not having control of
 

2271
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,790
the argument for not having control of
our borders we should let in who we want

2272
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:55,800
our borders we should let in who we want
 

2273
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,770
our borders we should let in who we want
to let in and we should keep out who we

2274
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:57,780
to let in and we should keep out who we
 

2275
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:59,450
to let in and we should keep out who we
want to keep out and we should have a

2276
00:43:59,450 --> 00:43:59,460
want to keep out and we should have a
 

2277
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:01,849
want to keep out and we should have a
sane immigration policy so

2278
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:01,859
sane immigration policy so
 

2279
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:03,530
sane immigration policy so
um I don't I didn't necessarily think it

2280
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:03,540
um I don't I didn't necessarily think it
 

2281
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,750
um I don't I didn't necessarily think it
was a priority to build the wall but I

2282
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:05,760
was a priority to build the wall but I
 

2283
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,690
was a priority to build the wall but I
didn't I never criticized the impulse to

2284
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:08,700
didn't I never criticized the impulse to
 

2285
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,670
didn't I never criticized the impulse to
build the wall because if you know tens

2286
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:10,680
build the wall because if you know tens
 

2287
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,050
build the wall because if you know tens
of thousands hundreds of thousands of

2288
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:12,060
of thousands hundreds of thousands of
 

2289
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,430
of thousands hundreds of thousands of
people are coming across that border and

2290
00:44:13,430 --> 00:44:13,440
people are coming across that border and
 

2291
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,109
people are coming across that border and
we are not in a position to know who's

2292
00:44:15,109 --> 00:44:15,119
we are not in a position to know who's
 

2293
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:16,309
we are not in a position to know who's
coming

2294
00:44:16,309 --> 00:44:16,319
coming
 

2295
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,250
coming
that seems untenable to me so

2296
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:19,260
that seems untenable to me so
 

2297
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,050
that seems untenable to me so
um and I can recognize that many people

2298
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:21,060
um and I can recognize that many people
 

2299
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,030
um and I can recognize that many people
in our society

2300
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:23,040
in our society
 

2301
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,430
in our society
are on balance the victims of

2302
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:25,440
are on balance the victims of
 

2303
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,510
are on balance the victims of
immigration

2304
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:26,520
immigration
 

2305
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:29,210
immigration
because and there is a in in many cases

2306
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:29,220
because and there is a in in many cases
 

2307
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,190
because and there is a in in many cases
a zero-sum contest between the interests

2308
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:31,200
a zero-sum contest between the interests
 

2309
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,530
a zero-sum contest between the interests
of actual citizens and the interests of

2310
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:33,540
of actual citizens and the interests of
 

2311
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,750
of actual citizens and the interests of
immigrants right so I think we should

2315
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,990
have a we should have control of our
borders we should have a sane and

2316
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:39,000
borders we should have a sane and
 

2317

borders we should have a sane and
compassionate immigration policy we

compassionate immigration policy we
should have we should let in refugees

2850
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:06,180
at least non-pathological people in Us
 

2851
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,809
at least non-pathological people in Us
in the system

2852
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:07,819
in the system
 

2853
00:55:07,819 --> 00:55:11,150
in the system
trying to navigate against the grain of

2854
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:11,160
trying to navigate against the grain of
 

2855
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,270
trying to navigate against the grain of
bad incentives and better still

2856
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:14,280
bad incentives and better still
 

2857
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,490
bad incentives and better still
all of us can get together and try to

2858
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:16,500
all of us can get together and try to
 

2859
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,010
all of us can get together and try to
diagnose those incentives and change

2860
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:19,020
diagnose those incentives and change
 

2861
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,530
diagnose those incentives and change
them right and and and we will really

2862
00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:21,540
them right and and and we will really
 

2863
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,210
them right and and and we will really
succeed when we have a system of

2864
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:23,220
succeed when we have a system of
 

2865
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,250
succeed when we have a system of
incentives where

2866
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:25,260
incentives where
 

2867
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:28,549
incentives where
the the good incentives are so strong

2868
00:55:28,549 --> 00:55:28,559
the the good incentives are so strong
 

2869
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,569
the the good incentives are so strong
that even bad people are effortlessly

2870
00:55:32,569 --> 00:55:32,579
that even bad people are effortlessly
 

2871
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,250
that even bad people are effortlessly
behaving as though they're good people

2872
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:34,260
behaving as though they're good people
 

2873
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:35,690
behaving as though they're good people
because they're so successfully

2874
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:35,700
because they're so successfully
 

2875
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:37,809
because they're so successfully
incentivized to behave that way right

2876
00:55:37,809 --> 00:55:37,819
incentivized to behave that way right
 

2877
00:55:37,819 --> 00:55:40,430
incentivized to behave that way right
that's you know so so it's it's almost

2878
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:40,440
that's you know so so it's it's almost
 

2879
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,470
that's you know so so it's it's almost
the inversion of our current situation

2880
00:55:42,470 --> 00:55:42,480
the inversion of our current situation
 

2881
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,670
the inversion of our current situation
so yes

2882
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:43,680
so yes
 

2883
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,530
so yes
and you say I changed my mind about the

2884
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:45,540
and you say I changed my mind about the
 

2885
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,510
and you say I changed my mind about the
War uh I not quite I mean I I was never

2886
00:55:49,510 --> 00:55:49,520
War uh I not quite I mean I I was never
 

2887
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,790
War uh I not quite I mean I I was never
a supporter of the war in Iraq I was

2888
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:52,800
a supporter of the war in Iraq I was
 

2889
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:55,130
a supporter of the war in Iraq I was
always worried that it was a distraction

2890
00:55:55,130 --> 00:55:55,140
always worried that it was a distraction
 

2891
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,809
always worried that it was a distraction
from the war in Afghanistan I was a

2892
00:55:56,809 --> 00:55:56,819
from the war in Afghanistan I was a
 

2893
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:58,670
from the war in Afghanistan I was a
supporter of the war in Afghanistan and

2894
00:55:58,670 --> 00:55:58,680
supporter of the war in Afghanistan and
 

2895
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:00,829
supporter of the war in Afghanistan and
I will admit in hindsight that looks

2896
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:00,839
I will admit in hindsight that looks
 

2897
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:02,870
I will admit in hindsight that looks
like uh

2898
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:02,880
like uh
 

2899
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,109
like uh
you know at best a highly ambiguous and

2900
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:06,119
you know at best a highly ambiguous and
 

2901
00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:08,750
you know at best a highly ambiguous and
painful exercise you know more likely a

2902
00:56:08,750 --> 00:56:08,760
painful exercise you know more likely a
 

2903
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,790
painful exercise you know more likely a
Fool's errand right I was like that

2904
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:10,800
Fool's errand right I was like that
 

2905
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,589
Fool's errand right I was like that
would you know it did not turn out well

2906
00:56:12,589 --> 00:56:12,599
would you know it did not turn out well
 

2907
00:56:12,599 --> 00:56:14,329
would you know it did not turn out well
it's it's

2908
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:14,339
it's it's
 

2909
00:56:14,339 --> 00:56:16,549
it's it's
it wasn't for want of trying I I don't

2910
00:56:16,549 --> 00:56:16,559
it wasn't for want of trying I I don't
 

2911
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,710
it wasn't for want of trying I I don't
you know I have not done a deep dive on

2912
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:18,720
you know I have not done a deep dive on
 

2913
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,069
you know I have not done a deep dive on
on all of the failures there and maybe

2914
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,079
on all of the failures there and maybe
 

2915
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:23,809
on all of the failures there and maybe
all of these failures or failures in

2916
00:56:23,809 --> 00:56:23,819
all of these failures or failures in
 

2917
00:56:23,819 --> 00:56:25,309
all of these failures or failures in
principle I mean maybe it's just maybe

2918
00:56:25,309 --> 00:56:25,319
principle I mean maybe it's just maybe
 

2919
00:56:25,319 --> 00:56:26,870
principle I mean maybe it's just maybe
that's not the kind of thing that can be

2920
00:56:26,870 --> 00:56:26,880
that's not the kind of thing that can be
 

2921
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,510
that's not the kind of thing that can be
done well by anybody whatever our

2922
00:56:29,510 --> 00:56:29,520
done well by anybody whatever our
 

2923
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,250
done well by anybody whatever our
intentions

2924
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:31,260
intentions
 

2925
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:33,589
intentions
um but yeah the move to Iraq always

2926
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:33,599
um but yeah the move to Iraq always
 

2927
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,730
um but yeah the move to Iraq always
seemed questionable to me and um

2928
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:37,740
seemed questionable to me and um
 

2929
00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:40,190
seemed questionable to me and um
when we knew the problem the immediate

2930
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:40,200
when we knew the problem the immediate
 

2931
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,290
when we knew the problem the immediate
problem at that moment you know Al Qaeda

2932
00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:42,300
problem at that moment you know Al Qaeda
 

2933
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,089
problem at that moment you know Al Qaeda
uh

2934
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:44,099
uh
 

2935

00:56:47,150 --> 00:56:47,160
was in Afghanistan and you know and then
 

2937
00:56:47,160 --> 00:56:49,549
was in Afghanistan and you know and then
bouncing to Pakistan

2938
00:56:49,549 --> 00:56:49,559
bouncing to Pakistan
 

2939
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:50,630
bouncing to Pakistan

00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:50,640
um
 

2941
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,990
um
anyway all you know so yes but my

anyway all you know so yes but my
 

2943
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,690
anyway all you know so yes but my
my sense of the possibility of nation

my sense of the possibility of nation
 

2945
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,510
my sense of the possibility of nation
building my sense of of

um
a spirit of of

a spirit of of
 

2957
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,790
a spirit of of
you know responsibility and idealism

2958
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:10,800
you know responsibility and idealism
 

2959
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,650
you know responsibility and idealism
that you know America was the kind of

2960
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:12,660
that you know America was the kind of
 

2961
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:14,990
that you know America was the kind of
nation that should be functioning in

2962
00:57:14,990 --> 00:57:15,000
nation that should be functioning in
 

2963
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,730
nation that should be functioning in
this way as as the world's cop and we've

2964
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:16,740
this way as as the world's cop and we've
 

2965
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,410
this way as as the world's cop and we've
got we have to get in there and and

2966
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:18,420
got we have to get in there and and
 

2967
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:21,650
got we have to get in there and and
untangle some of these knots by force

2968
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:21,660
untangle some of these knots by force
 

2969
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,470
untangle some of these knots by force
um uh rather often because

2970
00:57:24,470 --> 00:57:24,480
um uh rather often because
 

2971
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,849
um uh rather often because
you know if we don't do it over there

2972
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:25,859
you know if we don't do it over there
 

2973
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:27,290
you know if we don't do it over there
we're gonna have to do it over here kind

2974
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:27,300
we're gonna have to do it over here kind
 

2975
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,609
we're gonna have to do it over here kind
of thing

2976
00:57:28,609 --> 00:57:28,619
of thing
 

2977
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:30,589
of thing
um yeah some of that has definitely

2978
00:57:30,589 --> 00:57:30,599
um yeah some of that has definitely
 

2979
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:33,170
um yeah some of that has definitely
changed for me in my thinking

2980
00:57:33,170 --> 00:57:33,180
changed for me in my thinking
 

2981
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:34,790
changed for me in my thinking
I mean they're obviously cultural

2982
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:34,800
I mean they're obviously cultural
 

2983
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,829
I mean they're obviously cultural
reasons why it failed in Afghanistan and

2984
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:36,839
reasons why it failed in Afghanistan and
 

2985
00:57:36,839 --> 00:57:39,710
reasons why it failed in Afghanistan and
if you can't change the culture

2986
00:57:39,710 --> 00:57:39,720
if you can't change the culture
 

2987
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,290
if you can't change the culture
um it's uh

2988
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:42,300
um it's uh
 

2989
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,329
um it's uh
you're not going to force a change at

2990
00:57:44,329 --> 00:57:44,339
you're not going to force a change at
 

2991
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:46,849
you're not going to force a change at
gunpoint in the culture or it certainly

2992
00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:46,859
gunpoint in the culture or it certainly
 

2993
00:57:46,859 --> 00:57:48,410
gunpoint in the culture or it certainly
seems that that's not going to happen

2994
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:48,420
seems that that's not going to happen
 

2995
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,309
seems that that's not going to happen
and it took us you know over 20 years to

2996
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:52,319
and it took us you know over 20 years to
 

2997
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:54,109
and it took us you know over 20 years to
apparently realize that that's one of

2998
00:57:54,109 --> 00:57:54,119
apparently realize that that's one of
 

2999
00:57:54,119 --> 00:57:55,549
apparently realize that that's one of
the things you realize with the war is

3000
00:57:55,549 --> 00:57:55,559
the things you realize with the war is
 

3001
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,589
the things you realize with the war is
there's not going to be a strong signal

3002
00:57:57,589 --> 00:57:57,599
there's not going to be a strong signal
 

3003
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,230
there's not going to be a strong signal
that things are not working you can just

3004
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:00,240
that things are not working you can just
 

3005
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,730
that things are not working you can just
keep pouring money into a thing a

3006
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:01,740
keep pouring money into a thing a
 

3007
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,470
keep pouring money into a thing a
military effort well also there are

honestly in my case almost a hundred

3320
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:57,240
honestly in my case almost a hundred
 

3321
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,430
honestly in my case almost a hundred
percent of it was Twitter the

3322
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:58,440
percent of it was Twitter the
 

3323
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,890
percent of it was Twitter the
controversies I would get into the

3324
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:00,900
controversies I would get into the
 

3325
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,329
controversies I would get into the
things I would think I would have to

3326
01:04:02,329 --> 01:04:02,339
things I would think I would have to
 

3327
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,829
things I would think I would have to
respond to in a pot like I would release

3328
01:04:03,829 --> 01:04:03,839
respond to in a pot like I would release
 

3329
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,049
respond to in a pot like I would release
a podcast on a certain topic I would see

3330
01:04:06,049 --> 01:04:06,059
a podcast on a certain topic I would see
 

3331
01:04:06,059 --> 01:04:08,690
a podcast on a certain topic I would see
some blowback on Twitter

3332
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:08,700
some blowback on Twitter
 

3333
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,450
some blowback on Twitter
you know it would give me the sense that

3334
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:11,460
you know it would give me the sense that
 

3335
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:13,250
you know it would give me the sense that
there was some signal that I really had

3336
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:13,260
there was some signal that I really had
 

3337
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:15,829
there was some signal that I really had
to respond to now that I'm off Twitter I

3338
01:04:15,829 --> 01:04:15,839
to respond to now that I'm off Twitter I
 

3339
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:18,890
to respond to now that I'm off Twitter I
recognize that most of that was just

3340
01:04:18,890 --> 01:04:18,900
recognize that most of that was just
 

3341
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,809
recognize that most of that was just
it was totally specious right it was it

3342
01:04:20,809 --> 01:04:20,819
it was totally specious right it was it
 

3343
01:04:20,819 --> 01:04:22,250
it was totally specious right it was it
was not something I had to respond to

3344
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:22,260
was not something I had to respond to
 

3345
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:25,490
was not something I had to respond to
but yet I would then do a cycle of

3346
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:25,500
but yet I would then do a cycle of
 

3347
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,589
but yet I would then do a cycle of
podcasts responding to that thing that

3348
01:04:27,589 --> 01:04:27,599
podcasts responding to that thing that
 

3349
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,450
podcasts responding to that thing that
like to taking my foot out of my mouth

3350
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:29,460
like to taking my foot out of my mouth
 

3351
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:30,890
like to taking my foot out of my mouth
or taking someone else's foot out of my

3352
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:30,900
or taking someone else's foot out of my
 

3353
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,950
or taking someone else's foot out of my
mouth and it became this this

3354
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:33,960
mouth and it became this this
 

3355
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:36,710
mouth and it became this this
self-perpetuating

3356
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:36,720
self-perpetuating
 

3357
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:40,609
self-perpetuating
uh cycle which

3358
01:04:40,609 --> 01:04:40,619

 

3359
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:42,589

3363
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:48,250
having fun great I mean if it's if it's
if it's generative of useful information

3364
01:04:48,250 --> 01:04:48,260
if it's generative of useful information
 

3365
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,589
if it's generative of useful information
and and engagement professionally and

and psychologically great but and and
 

3369
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,250
and psychologically great but and and
there you know there was some of that on

3370
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:58,260
there you know there was some of that on
 

3371
01:04:58,260 --> 01:04:59,510
there you know there was some of that on
Twitter I mean there were people who

3372
01:04:59,510 --> 01:04:59,520
Twitter I mean there were people who
 

3373
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,970
Twitter I mean there were people who
I've connected with because because I

3374
01:05:01,970 --> 01:05:01,980
I've connected with because because I
 

3375
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:03,950
I've connected with because because I
just you know one one of us dm'd the

3376
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:03,960
just you know one one of us dm'd the
 

3377
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,150
just you know one one of us dm'd the
other on Twitter and it was hard to see

3378
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:05,160
other on Twitter and it was hard to see
 

3379
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,950
other on Twitter and it was hard to see
how that was going to happen otherwise

3380
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:06,960
how that was going to happen otherwise
 

3381
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:08,750
how that was going to happen otherwise
but

3382
01:05:08,750 --> 01:05:08,760
but
 

3383
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:13,609
but
it was largely just a machine for

3384
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:13,619
it was largely just a machine for
 

3385
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:16,370
it was largely just a machine for
manufacturing unnecessary controversy do

3386
01:05:16,370 --> 01:05:16,380
manufacturing unnecessary controversy do
 

3387
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:17,450
manufacturing unnecessary controversy do
you think it's possible to avoid the

3388
01:05:17,450 --> 01:05:17,460
you think it's possible to avoid the
 

3389
01:05:17,460 --> 01:05:19,670
you think it's possible to avoid the
drug of that so now that you've achieved

3390
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:19,680
drug of that so now that you've achieved
 

3391
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,010
drug of that so now that you've achieved
the Zen state is it possible for

3392
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:22,020
the Zen state is it possible for
 

3393
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:24,650
the Zen state is it possible for
somebody like you to use it in a way

3394
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:24,660
somebody like you to use it in a way
 

3395
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,150
somebody like you to use it in a way
that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool

3396
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:26,160
that doesn't pull you into the whirlpool

Twitter where I'm hearing from a smart

3428
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:02,220
Twitter where I'm hearing from a smart
 

3429
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:05,210
Twitter where I'm hearing from a smart
person who's detected an error or I made

3430
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:05,220
person who's detected an error or I made

01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,890
in my podcast or in a book or they've
just got some great idea about something

3434
01:06:09,890 --> 01:06:09,900
just got some great idea about something
 

3435
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,250
just got some great idea about something
that I should spend time on and I would

3436
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:13,260
that I should spend time on and I would
 

3437
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,930
that I should spend time on and I would
never have heard from this person in any

3438
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:14,940
never have heard from this person in any
 

3439
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,910
never have heard from this person in any
other format and now I'm actually in

3440
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:16,920
other format and now I'm actually in
 

3441
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:19,069
other format and now I'm actually in
dialogue with them and it's fantastic

3442
01:06:19,069 --> 01:06:19,079
dialogue with them and it's fantastic
 

3443
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:20,750
dialogue with them and it's fantastic
that's the promise of it to actually

3444
01:06:20,750 --> 01:06:20,760
that's the promise of it to actually
 

3445
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,849
that's the promise of it to actually
talk to people and so I kept getting

3446
01:06:22,849 --> 01:06:22,859
talk to people and so I kept getting
 

3447
01:06:22,859 --> 01:06:25,250
talk to people and so I kept getting
lured back into that

3448
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:25,260
lured back into that
 

3449
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:28,309
lured back into that

sanity preserving way of of using it is
 

3453
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:32,089
sanity preserving way of of using it is
is

3454
01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:32,099

01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:57,780
and I was noticing
 

3529
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:00,710
and I was noticing
that it was insidiously changing

3530
01:08:00,710 --> 01:08:00,720
that it was insidiously changing
 

3531
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:03,589
that it was insidiously changing

and then that became a signal I felt
 

3543
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,189
and then that became a signal I felt
like I had to take into account somehow

3544
01:08:16,189 --> 01:08:16,199
like I had to take into account somehow
 

3545

um and I I felt that it was as much as I
could sort of try to recalibrate for it

3552

could sort of try to recalibrate for it
 

3553
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:30,169
could sort of try to recalibrate for it
I felt that I was losing touch with what

and this this goes to
 

4169
01:20:13,620 --> 01:20:15,290
and this this goes to
anyone else we might talk about you know

4170
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:15,300
anyone else we might talk about you know
 

4171

01:20:17,630 --> 01:20:17,640
who who's more where the where the case
 

4173
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:21,189
who who's more where the where the case
is much more confusing but yeah so

4174
01:20:21,189 --> 01:20:21,199
is much more confusing but yeah so
 

4175
01:20:21,199 --> 01:20:24,530
is much more confusing but yeah so
everyone's care it's just so direct and

4176
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:24,540
everyone's care it's just so direct and

everyone's care it's just so direct and
then I'm sure we're gonna get to AI but

4178
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:26,820
then I'm sure we're gonna get to AI but
 

4179
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,209
then I'm sure we're gonna get to AI but
you know the prospect of being able to

4180
01:20:29,209 --> 01:20:29,219
you know the prospect of being able to
 

4181
01:20:29,219 --> 01:20:33,830
you know the prospect of being able to
manufacture Clips with AI and deep fakes

4182
01:20:33,830 --> 01:20:33,840
manufacture Clips with AI and deep fakes
 

4183
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,229
manufacture Clips with AI and deep fakes
and that where it's going to be hard for

4184
01:20:36,229 --> 01:20:36,239
and that where it's going to be hard for
 

4185
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:37,430
and that where it's going to be hard for
most people most of the time to even

4186
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:37,440
most people most of the time to even
 

4187
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:39,229
most people most of the time to even
figure out that the the whether they're

right on the cusp of and you know it's
 

4201
01:20:54,659 --> 01:20:56,750
right on the cusp of and you know it's
it's terrifying well it could be just a

01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:48,000
they just don't even know what's at
 

4299
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,729
they just don't even know what's at
stake and then they're the people who

4300
01:22:49,729 --> 01:22:49,739
stake and then they're the people who
 

4301
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:51,290
stake and then they're the people who
have met the few people

4302
01:22:51,290 --> 01:22:51,300
have met the few people
 

4303
01:22:51,300 --> 01:22:53,209
have met the few people
who we could count on a few hands who

4304
01:22:53,209 --> 01:22:53,219
who we could count on a few hands who
 

4305
01:22:53,219 --> 01:22:54,890
who we could count on a few hands who
have managed to insulate themselves or

4306
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:54,900
have managed to insulate themselves or
 

4307
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,209
have managed to insulate themselves or
at least imagine they've insulated

4308
01:22:56,209 --> 01:22:56,219
at least imagine they've insulated
 

4309
01:22:56,219 --> 01:22:58,010
at least imagine they've insulated
insulated themselves from the downside

4310
01:22:58,010 --> 01:22:58,020
insulated themselves from the downside
 

4311
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,270
insulated themselves from the downside
here enough

4312
01:22:59,270 --> 01:22:59,280
here enough
 

4313
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,790
here enough
that they're not implicated in the great

4314
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:01,800
that they're not implicated in the great
 

4315
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:04,490
that they're not implicated in the great
unraveling we are witnessing or could

4316
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:04,500
unraveling we are witnessing or could
 

4317
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:06,890
unraveling we are witnessing or could
could witness the shaking up of what is

4318
01:23:06,890 --> 01:23:06,900
could witness the shaking up of what is
 

4319
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,870
could witness the shaking up of what is
true uh so actually that returns us to

4320
01:23:08,870 --> 01:23:08,880
true uh so actually that returns us to
 

4321
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,910
true uh so actually that returns us to
experts do you think experts can save us

4322
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:10,920
experts do you think experts can save us
 

4323
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,610
experts do you think experts can save us
is there such thing as expertise and

4324
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:13,620
is there such thing as expertise and
 

4325
01:23:13,620 --> 01:23:15,410
is there such thing as expertise and
experts in something how do you know if

4326
01:23:15,410 --> 01:23:15,420
experts in something how do you know if
 

4327
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:17,330
experts in something how do you know if
you've achieved it I think it's it's

4328
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:17,340
you've achieved it I think it's it's
 

4329
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,970
you've achieved it I think it's it's
important to acknowledge up front that

4330
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:19,980
important to acknowledge up front that
 

4331
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:22,250
important to acknowledge up front that
this there's something paradoxical about

4332
01:23:22,250 --> 01:23:22,260
this there's something paradoxical about
 

4333
01:23:22,260 --> 01:23:27,169
this there's something paradoxical about
how we relate to to Authority especially

4334
01:23:27,169 --> 01:23:27,179
how we relate to to Authority especially
 

4335
01:23:27,179 --> 01:23:29,390
how we relate to to Authority especially
within science

4336
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:29,400
within science
 

4337
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:30,770
within science
um and I don't think a paradox is going

4338
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:30,780
um and I don't think a paradox is going
 

4339
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:32,570
um and I don't think a paradox is going
away and it's just it doesn't have to be

4340
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:32,580
away and it's just it doesn't have to be
 

4341
01:23:32,580 --> 01:23:34,370
away and it's just it doesn't have to be
confusing it's just and it's not it's

4342
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:34,380
confusing it's just and it's not it's
 

4343
01:23:34,380 --> 01:23:35,930
confusing it's just and it's not it's
not truly a paradox it's just like there

4344
01:23:35,930 --> 01:23:35,940
not truly a paradox it's just like there
 

4345
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,910
not truly a paradox it's just like there
are different moments in time

4346
01:23:37,910 --> 01:23:37,920
are different moments in time
 

4347
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,709
are different moments in time
so

4348
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:39,719
so
 

4349
01:23:39,719 --> 01:23:42,110
so
it is true to say

4350
01:23:42,110 --> 01:23:42,120
it is true to say
 

4351
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,390
it is true to say
that

4352
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:44,400
that
 

4353
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:46,790
that
within science or within a within

4354
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:46,800
within science or within a within
 

4355
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:48,470
within science or within a within
rationality generally I mean just

4356
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:48,480
rationality generally I mean just
 

4357
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,030
rationality generally I mean just
whenever you're making having a

4358
01:23:50,030 --> 01:23:50,040
whenever you're making having a
 

4359
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,689
whenever you're making having a
fact-based discussion about anything

4360
01:23:53,689 --> 01:23:53,699
fact-based discussion about anything
 

4361
01:23:53,699 --> 01:23:56,330
fact-based discussion about anything
it is true to say that the truth or

4362
01:23:56,330 --> 01:23:56,340
it is true to say that the truth or
 

4363
01:23:56,340 --> 01:23:58,430
it is true to say that the truth or
falsity of a statement

4364
01:23:58,430 --> 01:23:58,440
falsity of a statement
 

4365
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,290
falsity of a statement
does not even slightly depend on the

4366
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:02,300
does not even slightly depend on the
 

4367
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:04,370
does not even slightly depend on the
credentials of the person making the

01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:04,380
credentials of the person making the
 

4369
01:24:04,380 --> 01:24:07,130
credentials of the person making the
statement right so it doesn't matter if

4370
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:07,140
statement right so it doesn't matter if
 

4371
01:24:07,140 --> 01:24:08,630

you're a Nobel Laureate you can be wrong
 

4373
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:10,430
you're a Nobel Laureate you can be wrong
right the thing you could either the

they're middling cases where you have
like a a backyard astronomer who's got

4392
01:24:29,930 --> 01:24:29,940
like a a backyard astronomer who's got
 

4393
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:31,790

no credentials but he just loves
 

4395
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:33,890
no credentials but he just loves
astronomy and he's got a telescope and

astronomy and he's got a telescope and
 

4397
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,390
astronomy and he's got a telescope and
it's he's spends a lot of time looking

4398
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:35,400
it's he's spends a lot of time looking
 

4399
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:36,830
it's he's spends a lot of time looking
at the nice guy

4400
01:24:36,830 --> 01:24:36,840
at the nice guy
 

4401
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,470
at the nice guy
and he discovers a comet that no one

01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:44,940
the professional expert astronomers
 

4407
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:45,530
the professional expert astronomers
um

4408
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:45,540
um
 

4409
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,149
um
my God I think that happens less and

4410
01:24:47,149 --> 01:24:47,159
my God I think that happens less and
 

4411
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:49,430
my God I think that happens less and
less now but but some version of that

4412
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:49,440
less now but but some version of that
 

4413
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:51,649
less now but but some version of that
keeps happening and it may always keep

4414
01:24:51,649 --> 01:24:51,659
keeps happening and it may always keep
 

4415
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:54,050
keeps happening and it may always keep
happening in every area of expertise

4416
01:24:54,050 --> 01:24:54,060
happening in every area of expertise
 

4417
01:24:54,060 --> 01:24:55,550
happening in every area of expertise
right

4418
01:24:55,550 --> 01:24:55,560
right
 

4419
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:56,870
right
um

4420
01:24:56,870 --> 01:24:56,880
um
 

4421
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:58,850
um
so

4422
01:24:58,850 --> 01:24:58,860
so
 

4423
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:03,350
so
it's true that truth is orthogonal to

4424
01:25:03,350 --> 01:25:03,360
it's true that truth is orthogonal to
 

4425
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,930
it's true that truth is orthogonal to
the reputational concerns we have among

4426
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:05,940
the reputational concerns we have among
 

4427
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:09,050
the reputational concerns we have among
Apes who are talking about the truth

4428
01:25:09,050 --> 01:25:09,060
Apes who are talking about the truth
 

4429
01:25:09,060 --> 01:25:11,810
Apes who are talking about the truth
um but it is also true that most of the

4430
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:11,820
um but it is also true that most of the
 

4431
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:13,310
um but it is also true that most of the
time

4432
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:13,320
time
 

4433
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:17,649
time
real experts are much more reliable than

4434
01:25:17,649 --> 01:25:17,659
real experts are much more reliable than
 

4435
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:20,750
real experts are much more reliable than
frauds or people who are not experts

4436
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:20,760
frauds or people who are not experts
 

4437
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:23,209
frauds or people who are not experts
right you know so and expertise really

4438
01:25:23,209 --> 01:25:23,219
right you know so and expertise really
 

4439
01:25:23,219 --> 01:25:25,610
right you know so and expertise really
is a thing right and when it's you know

4440
01:25:25,610 --> 01:25:25,620
is a thing right and when it's you know
 

4441
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:27,709
is a thing right and when it's you know
when you're flying an airplane in a in a

4442
01:25:27,709 --> 01:25:27,719
when you're flying an airplane in a in a
 

4443
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:28,550
when you're flying an airplane in a in a
storm

4444
01:25:28,550 --> 01:25:28,560
storm
 

4445
01:25:28,560 --> 01:25:31,669
storm
you don't want just randos come into the

4446
01:25:31,669 --> 01:25:31,679
you don't want just randos come into the
 

4447
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:33,050
you don't want just randos come into the
cockpit saying listen I've got a new

4448
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:33,060
cockpit saying listen I've got a new
 

4449
01:25:33,060 --> 01:25:34,729
cockpit saying listen I've got a new
idea about how to you know how we should

4450
01:25:34,729 --> 01:25:34,739
idea about how to you know how we should
 

4451
01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:37,130
idea about how to you know how we should
tweak these controls right you want

4452
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:37,140
tweak these controls right you want
 

4453
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,750
tweak these controls right you want
someone who's a trained pilot and and

4454
01:25:38,750 --> 01:25:38,760
someone who's a trained pilot and and
 

4455
01:25:38,760 --> 01:25:40,850
someone who's a trained pilot and and
that training gave them something right

4456
01:25:40,850 --> 01:25:40,860
that training gave them something right
 

4457
01:25:40,860 --> 01:25:43,070
that training gave them something right
it gave them a set of competences and

4458
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:43,080
it gave them a set of competences and
 

4459
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:46,189
it gave them a set of competences and
intuitions and they they know what all

4460
01:25:46,189 --> 01:25:46,199
intuitions and they they know what all
 

4461
01:25:46,199 --> 01:25:49,310
intuitions and they they know what all
those dials and switches do right and I

4462
01:25:49,310 --> 01:25:49,320
those dials and switches do right and I
 

4463
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,810
those dials and switches do right and I
don't right I shouldn't be flying that

4464
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:50,820
don't right I shouldn't be flying that
 

4465
01:25:50,820 --> 01:25:52,130
don't right I shouldn't be flying that
plane

4466

plane
 

4467
01:25:52,140 --> 01:25:53,209
plane
um

4468
01:25:53,209 --> 01:25:53,219
um
 

4469
01:25:53,219 --> 01:25:55,850
um
and so when things really matter

4470
01:25:55,850 --> 01:25:55,860
and so when things really matter
 

4471
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:58,790
and so when things really matter
you know and put in this at 30 000 feet

4472
01:25:58,790 --> 01:25:58,800
you know and put in this at 30 000 feet
 

4473
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:02,330
you know and put in this at 30 000 feet
in a storm sharpens this up

4474
01:26:02,330 --> 01:26:02,340
in a storm sharpens this up
 

4475
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:04,910
in a storm sharpens this up
we want real experts to be in charge

4476
01:26:04,910 --> 01:26:04,920
we want real experts to be in charge
 

4477
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,010
we want real experts to be in charge
right and

4478
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:07,020
right and
 

4479
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:09,950
right and
we are at 30 000 feet a lot of the time

4480
01:26:09,950 --> 01:26:09,960
we are at 30 000 feet a lot of the time
 

4481
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:12,590
we are at 30 000 feet a lot of the time
on a lot of issues right and whether

4482
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:12,600
on a lot of issues right and whether
 

4483
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,450
on a lot of issues right and whether
they're public health issues whether

4484
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:14,460
they're public health issues whether
 

4485
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:16,550
they're public health issues whether
it's issue whether it's a geopolitical

4486
01:26:16,550 --> 01:26:16,560
it's issue whether it's a geopolitical
 

4487
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,030
it's issue whether it's a geopolitical
emergency like Ukraine

4488
01:26:19,030 --> 01:26:19,040
emergency like Ukraine
 

4489
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:21,290
emergency like Ukraine
climate change

4490
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:21,300
climate change
 

4491
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:24,530
climate change
I mean just pick your pick your topic

4492
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:24,540
I mean just pick your pick your topic
 

4493
01:26:24,540 --> 01:26:25,129
I mean just pick your pick your topic
um

4494
01:26:25,129 --> 01:26:25,139
um
 

4495
01:26:25,139 --> 01:26:27,410
um
there are real problems

4496
01:26:27,410 --> 01:26:27,420
there are real problems
 

4497
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:30,530
there are real problems
and the clock is rather often ticking

4498
01:26:30,530 --> 01:26:30,540
and the clock is rather often ticking
 

4499
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:32,930
and the clock is rather often ticking
and their Solutions are non-obvious

4500
01:26:32,930 --> 01:26:32,940
and their Solutions are non-obvious
 

4501
01:26:32,940 --> 01:26:36,050
and their Solutions are non-obvious
right and and so expertise is a thing

4502
01:26:36,050 --> 01:26:36,060
right and and so expertise is a thing
 

4503
01:26:36,060 --> 01:26:39,649
right and and so expertise is a thing
and deferring to experts much of the

4504
01:26:39,649 --> 01:26:39,659
and deferring to experts much of the
 

4505
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:40,610
and deferring to experts much of the
time

4506
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:40,620
time
 

4507
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:43,970
time
makes a lot of sense it's at minimum it

4508
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:43,980
makes a lot of sense it's at minimum it
 

4509
01:26:43,980 --> 01:26:45,110
makes a lot of sense it's at minimum it
it

4510
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:45,120
it
 

4511
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,910
it
prevents

4512
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:46,920
prevents
 

4513
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,830
prevents
you know spectacular errors of

01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:48,840
you know spectacular errors of
 

4515
01:26:48,840 --> 01:26:52,850
you know spectacular errors of
incompetence and and uh

4516
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:52,860
incompetence and and uh
 

4517
01:26:52,860 --> 01:26:55,790
incompetence and and uh
just uh you know foolhardiness but it

4518
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:55,800
just uh you know foolhardiness but it
 

4519
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:57,950
just uh you know foolhardiness but it
even in in the case of some where you're

4520
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:57,960
even in in the case of some where you're
 

4521
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,870
even in in the case of some where you're
talking about someone I mean people like

we're fairly alert to the possibility

we're fairly alert to the possibility

01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:14,810
we're fairly alert to the possibility
that we don't you know it's not as

that we don't you know it's not as
 

4537
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:16,550
that we don't you know it's not as
simple as things seem at first and we

4543
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,570
tools translate to this new area we can
be fairly circumspect but we're also

4544
01:27:23,570 --> 01:27:23,580
be fairly circumspect but we're also
 

4545
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,430
be fairly circumspect but we're also
because we're well educated

4546
01:27:25,430 --> 01:27:25,440
because we're well educated
 

4547
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:28,189
because we're well educated
we can work and we're pretty quick

4548
01:27:28,189 --> 01:27:28,199
we can work and we're pretty quick
 

4549
01:27:28,199 --> 01:27:29,870
we can work and we're pretty quick
studies we can learn a lot of things

4550
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:29,880
studies we can learn a lot of things
 

4551
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:32,689
studies we can learn a lot of things
pretty fast and we can begin to play a

4552
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:32,699
pretty fast and we can begin to play a
 

4553
01:27:32,699 --> 01:27:35,870
pretty fast and we can begin to play a
language game that sounds fairly expert

4554
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:35,880
language game that sounds fairly expert
 

4555
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:38,870
language game that sounds fairly expert
right and

4556
01:27:38,870 --> 01:27:38,880
right and
 

4557
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:41,330
right and
in that case

4558
01:27:41,330 --> 01:27:41,340
in that case
 

4559
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,189
in that case
the the invitation to do your own

4560
01:27:43,189 --> 01:27:43,199
the the invitation to do your own
 

4561
01:27:43,199 --> 01:27:47,090
the the invitation to do your own
research right is in once when times are

4562
01:27:47,090 --> 01:27:47,100
research right is in once when times are
 

4563
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,290
research right is in once when times are
good

4564
01:27:48,290 --> 01:27:48,300
good
 

4565
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:50,750

4579
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:10,129
obviously corrupted by bad incentives
we've got experts who you know

01:28:10,129 --> 01:28:10,139
we've got experts who you know
 

4581
01:28:10,139 --> 01:28:11,870
we've got experts who you know
perversely won't admit they were wrong

perversely won't admit they were wrong

01:28:23,219 --> 01:28:26,990
um
uh encroachment into really every place

you know whether it's universities or

4598
01:28:29,090 --> 01:28:29,100
you know whether it's universities or
 

4599
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:31,370
you know whether it's universities or
science journals or government or I mean

4600
01:28:31,370 --> 01:28:31,380
science journals or government or I mean
 

4601
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:33,410
science journals or government or I mean
it's just like that is that has been

4602
01:28:33,410 --> 01:28:33,420
it's just like that is that has been
 

4603
01:28:33,420 --> 01:28:35,450
it's just like that is that has been
genuinely deranging

genuinely deranging
 

4605
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:36,649
genuinely deranging
um

4606
01:28:36,649 --> 01:28:36,659
um
 

4607
01:28:36,659 --> 01:28:38,629
um
so there's a lot going on that where

4608
01:28:38,629 --> 01:28:38,639
so there's a lot going on that where
 

4609
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,030
so there's a lot going on that where
experts and and the Very concept of

4610
01:28:41,030 --> 01:28:41,040
experts and and the Very concept of
 

4611
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:43,070
experts and and the Very concept of
expertise has seemed to discredit itself

4612
01:28:43,070 --> 01:28:43,080
expertise has seemed to discredit itself
 

4613
01:28:43,080 --> 01:28:45,110
expertise has seemed to discredit itself
but the reality is that there is a

4614
01:28:45,110 --> 01:28:45,120
but the reality is that there is a
 

4615
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:46,729
but the reality is that there is a
massive difference when anything matters

4616
01:28:46,729 --> 01:28:46,739
massive difference when anything matters
 

4617
01:28:46,739 --> 01:28:48,169
massive difference when anything matters
when there's anything to know about

4618
01:28:48,169 --> 01:28:48,179
when there's anything to know about
 

4619
01:28:48,179 --> 01:28:50,330
when there's anything to know about
anything there is a massive difference

4620
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:50,340
anything there is a massive difference
 

4621
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:52,910
anything there is a massive difference
most of the time between someone who has

4622
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:52,920
most of the time between someone who has
 

4623
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:55,490
most of the time between someone who has
really done the work to understand that

4624
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:55,500
really done the work to understand that
 

4625
01:28:55,500 --> 01:28:59,570
really done the work to understand that
domain and someone who hasn't and

if I get sick or someone close to me

I'm alert to all of those things but
 

4673
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:46,430
I'm alert to all of those things but
when I get sick or when someone close to

an oncologist but what I want to do is I
want to know everything I can know about

cancer right so I'm going to take the

4726
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:50,280
cancer right so I'm going to take the
 

4727
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:53,090
cancer right so I'm going to take the
next four years and spend most of my

4728
01:30:53,090 --> 01:30:53,100
next four years and spend most of my
 

4729
01:30:53,100 --> 01:30:55,610
next four years and spend most of my
time on cancer okay I could do that

4730
01:30:55,610 --> 01:30:55,620
time on cancer okay I could do that
 

4731
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:57,830
time on cancer okay I could do that
right I still think that's a waste of my

going to be the best person to to form
 

4739
01:31:05,280 --> 01:31:07,070
going to be the best person to to form
intuitions about what to do in the face

4740
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:07,080
intuitions about what to do in the face
 

4741
01:31:07,080 --> 01:31:09,290
intuitions about what to do in the face
of the next cancer that I have to

4742
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:09,300
of the next cancer that I have to
 

4743
01:31:09,300 --> 01:31:10,790
of the next cancer that I have to
confront

4744
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:10,800
confront
 

4745
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:11,570

it's it's just it it there's we're
 

4785
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,149
it's it's just it it there's we're
swimming in a sea of misinformation

01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:56,159
swimming in a sea of misinformation
 

4787
01:31:56,159 --> 01:31:57,890
swimming in a sea of misinformation
where you've got people

4788
01:31:57,890 --> 01:31:57,900
where you've got people
 

4789
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:00,770

these topics like there's no there is no
 

4797
01:32:09,560 --> 01:32:12,169
these topics like there's no there is no
scenario in which you should be getting

4798
01:32:12,169 --> 01:32:12,179
scenario in which you should be getting
 

4799
01:32:12,179 --> 01:32:15,169
scenario in which you should be getting
your opinion about vaccine safety or or

4800

your opinion about vaccine safety or or

uh the war in Ukraine or anything else
 

4805
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:22,209
uh the war in Ukraine or anything else
that we might want to talk about from

4806
01:32:22,209 --> 01:32:22,219
that we might want to talk about from
 

4807
01:32:22,219 --> 01:32:24,709
that we might want to talk about from
Candace Owens right it's just like it

4808
01:32:24,709 --> 01:32:24,719
Candace Owens right it's just like it
 

4809
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:27,890
Candace Owens right it's just like it
like like she she's not a relevant

4810
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:27,900
like like she she's not a relevant
 

4811
01:32:27,900 --> 01:32:30,470
like like she she's not a relevant
expert on any of those topics and what's

4812
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:30,480
expert on any of those topics and what's
 

4813
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:32,510
expert on any of those topics and what's
more she doesn't seem to care right and

4814
01:32:32,510 --> 01:32:32,520
more she doesn't seem to care right and
 

4815
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,570
more she doesn't seem to care right and
and she's living in a culture that has

4816
01:32:35,570 --> 01:32:35,580
and she's living in a culture that has
 

4817
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,129
and she's living in a culture that has
that has

4818
01:32:37,129 --> 01:32:37,139
that has
 

4819
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:39,530
that has
Amplified that not caring into a

4820
01:32:39,530 --> 01:32:39,540
Amplified that not caring into a
 

4821
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:41,390
Amplified that not caring into a
business model and an effective business

4822
01:32:41,390 --> 01:32:41,400
business model and an effective business
 

4823
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,270
business model and an effective business
model right so it's just it's um and

4824
01:32:44,270 --> 01:32:44,280
model right so it's just it's um and
 

4825
01:32:44,280 --> 01:32:45,350
model right so it's just it's um and
then there's something very trumpy and

4826
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:45,360
then there's something very trumpy and
 

4827
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:46,910
then there's something very trumpy and
about all that or like that's that's the

4828
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:46,920
about all that or like that's that's the
 

4829
01:32:46,920 --> 01:32:49,550
about all that or like that's that's the
pro the problem is is the culture it's

4830
01:32:49,550 --> 01:32:49,560
pro the problem is is the culture it's
 

4831
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:52,850
pro the problem is is the culture it's
not these specific individuals

4832
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:52,860
not these specific individuals
 

4833
01:32:52,860 --> 01:32:55,490
not these specific individuals
um so so the Paradox here is that

4834
01:32:55,490 --> 01:32:55,500
um so so the Paradox here is that
 

4835
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:58,430
um so so the Paradox here is that
expertise is a real thing

4836
01:32:58,430 --> 01:32:58,440
expertise is a real thing
 

4837
01:32:58,440 --> 01:33:01,550
expertise is a real thing
and we defer to it a lot as a as a

4838
01:33:01,550 --> 01:33:01,560
and we defer to it a lot as a as a
 

4839
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,950
and we defer to it a lot as a as a
labor-saving device as just as and just

4840
01:33:03,950 --> 01:33:03,960
labor-saving device as just as and just
 

4841
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,410
labor-saving device as just as and just
based on the the

4842
01:33:06,410 --> 01:33:06,420
based on the the
 

4843
01:33:06,420 --> 01:33:09,350
based on the the
the the reality that it's very hard to

4844
01:33:09,350 --> 01:33:09,360
the the reality that it's very hard to
 

4845
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,209
the the reality that it's very hard to
be a polymath right and specialization

4846
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:11,219
be a polymath right and specialization
 

4847
01:33:11,219 --> 01:33:12,770
be a polymath right and specialization
is a thing right and so there are people

4848
01:33:12,770 --> 01:33:12,780
is a thing right and so there are people
 

4849
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:14,510
is a thing right and so there are people
who specialize in a very narrow topic

4850
01:33:14,510 --> 01:33:14,520
who specialize in a very narrow topic
 

4851
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,430
who specialize in a very narrow topic
they know more about that topic than the

4852
01:33:16,430 --> 01:33:16,440
they know more about that topic than the
 

4853
01:33:16,440 --> 01:33:18,229
they know more about that topic than the
next guy no matter how smart that that

4854
01:33:18,229 --> 01:33:18,239
next guy no matter how smart that that
 

4855
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:21,530
next guy no matter how smart that that
guy or gal is uh

4856
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:21,540
guy or gal is uh
 

4857
01:33:21,540 --> 01:33:23,990
guy or gal is uh
and and that those differences matter

4858
01:33:23,990 --> 01:33:24,000
and and that those differences matter
 

4859
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,870
and and that those differences matter
but it's also true

4860
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:26,880
but it's also true
 

4861
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:29,330
but it's also true
that when you're talking about facts

4862
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:29,340
that when you're talking about facts
 

4863
01:33:29,340 --> 01:33:31,850
that when you're talking about facts
sometimes

4864
01:33:31,850 --> 01:33:31,860
sometimes
 

4865
01:33:31,860 --> 01:33:34,490
sometimes
the the the the best experts are wrong

4866
01:33:34,490 --> 01:33:34,500
the the the the best experts are wrong
 

4867
01:33:34,500 --> 01:33:37,370
the the the the best experts are wrong
the scientific consensus is wrong you

4868
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:37,380
the scientific consensus is wrong you
 

4869
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:39,830
the scientific consensus is wrong you
get a a sea change in the thinking of a

4870
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:39,840
get a a sea change in the thinking of a
 

4871
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,709
get a a sea change in the thinking of a
whole field because one person who's an

4872
01:33:42,709 --> 01:33:42,719
whole field because one person who's an
 

4873
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:44,930
whole field because one person who's an
outlier for whatever reason decides okay

4874
01:33:44,930 --> 01:33:44,940
outlier for whatever reason decides okay
 

4875
01:33:44,940 --> 01:33:47,930
outlier for whatever reason decides okay
I'm uh you know I'm gonna prove this

4876
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:47,940
I'm uh you know I'm gonna prove this
 

4877
01:33:47,940 --> 01:33:49,970
I'm uh you know I'm gonna prove this
point and they prove it right so

4878
01:33:49,970 --> 01:33:49,980
point and they prove it right so
 

4879
01:33:49,980 --> 01:33:51,950
point and they prove it right so
somebody like uh

4880
01:33:51,950 --> 01:33:51,960
somebody like uh
 

4881
01:33:51,960 --> 01:33:55,070
somebody like uh
the Doctor Who uh believed that that

4882
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:55,080
the Doctor Who uh believed that that
 

4883
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:56,870
the Doctor Who uh believed that that
stomach ulcers were not due to stress

4884
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
stomach ulcers were not due to stress
 

4885
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,330
stomach ulcers were not due to stress
but were due to to um H pylori

4886
01:33:59,330 --> 01:33:59,340
but were due to to um H pylori
 

4887
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,370
but were due to to um H pylori
infections right so he just drank a vial

4888
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:01,380
infections right so he just drank a vial
 

4889
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,890
infections right so he just drank a vial
of H pylori bacteria and and prove that

4890
01:34:03,890 --> 01:34:03,900
of H pylori bacteria and and prove that
 

4891
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,649
of H pylori bacteria and and prove that
and quickly got an ulcer and convinced

4892
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:06,659
and quickly got an ulcer and convinced
 

4893
01:34:06,659 --> 01:34:09,229
and quickly got an ulcer and convinced
the field that that at minimum H pylori

4894
01:34:09,229 --> 01:34:09,239
the field that that at minimum H pylori
 

4895
01:34:09,239 --> 01:34:12,649
the field that that at minimum H pylori
was involved in in that process okay so

4896
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:12,659
was involved in in that process okay so
 

4897
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:15,729
was involved in in that process okay so
yes everyone was wrong that doesn't

4898
01:34:15,729 --> 01:34:15,739
yes everyone was wrong that doesn't
 

4899
01:34:15,739 --> 01:34:19,550
yes everyone was wrong that doesn't
disprove the reality of expertise it

4900
01:34:19,550 --> 01:34:19,560
disprove the reality of expertise it
 

4901
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:21,830
disprove the reality of expertise it
doesn't disprove the utility of relying

4902
01:34:21,830 --> 01:34:21,840
doesn't disprove the utility of relying
 

4903
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:24,350
doesn't disprove the utility of relying
on Experts most of the time especially

4904
01:34:24,350 --> 01:34:24,360
on Experts most of the time especially
 

4905
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:26,149
on Experts most of the time especially
in an emergency especially when the

4906
01:34:26,149 --> 01:34:26,159
in an emergency especially when the
 

4907
01:34:26,159 --> 01:34:28,490
in an emergency especially when the
clock is ticking especially when you're

4908
01:34:28,490 --> 01:34:28,500
clock is ticking especially when you're
 

4909
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:30,169
clock is ticking especially when you're
you know you're in this particular

4910
01:34:30,169 --> 01:34:30,179
you know you're in this particular
 

4911
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:32,930
you know you're in this particular
cockpit and you only have one chance to

4912
01:34:32,930 --> 01:34:32,940
cockpit and you only have one chance to
 

4913
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,390
cockpit and you only have one chance to
land this plane right you want the real

4914
01:34:35,390 --> 01:34:35,400
land this plane right you want the real
 

4915
01:34:35,400 --> 01:34:38,629
land this plane right you want the real
pilot uh at the controls but there's

4916
01:34:38,629 --> 01:34:38,639
pilot uh at the controls but there's
 

4917
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:41,470
pilot uh at the controls but there's
just a few things to say

4918
01:34:41,470 --> 01:34:41,480
just a few things to say
 

4919
01:34:41,480 --> 01:34:44,270
just a few things to say
so one you mentioned this example with

4920
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:44,280
so one you mentioned this example with
 

4921
01:34:44,280 --> 01:34:46,430
so one you mentioned this example with
cancer and doing your own research there

4922
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:46,440
cancer and doing your own research there
 

4923
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:47,629
cancer and doing your own research there
there are several things that are

4924
01:34:47,629 --> 01:34:47,639
there are several things that are
 

4925
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:48,830
there are several things that are
different about

4926
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:48,840
different about
 

4927
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:51,890
different about
our particular time in history one doing

4928
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:51,900
our particular time in history one doing
 

4929
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:53,810
our particular time in history one doing
your own research has become more and

4930
01:34:53,810 --> 01:34:53,820
your own research has become more and
 

4931
01:34:53,820 --> 01:34:57,290
your own research has become more and
more effective because you can read the

um
 

4957
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:25,430
um
good faith interpretations for example I

4958
01:35:25,430 --> 01:35:25,440
good faith interpretations for example I
 

4959
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,810
good faith interpretations for example I
don't know I don't want to overstate

4960
01:35:26,810 --> 01:35:26,820
don't know I don't want to overstate
 

4961
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:28,430
don't know I don't want to overstate
things but

4962
01:35:28,430 --> 01:35:28,440
things but
 

4963
01:35:28,440 --> 01:35:30,229
things but
um if you suffer from depression for

4964
01:35:30,229 --> 01:35:30,239
um if you suffer from depression for
 

4965
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:31,430
um if you suffer from depression for
example

4966
01:35:31,430 --> 01:35:31,440
example
 

4967
01:35:31,440 --> 01:35:34,550
example
then there you could go to an expert and

4968
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:34,560
then there you could go to an expert and
 

4969
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:35,930
then there you could go to an expert and
a doctor that prescribes you some

4970
01:35:35,930 --> 01:35:35,940
a doctor that prescribes you some
 

4971
01:35:35,940 --> 01:35:37,030
a doctor that prescribes you some
medication

4972
01:35:37,030 --> 01:35:37,040
medication
 

4973
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:39,290
medication
but you could also challenge some of

4974
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:39,300
but you could also challenge some of
 

4975
01:35:39,300 --> 01:35:40,850
but you could also challenge some of
those ideas and seeing like what are the

4976
01:35:40,850 --> 01:35:40,860
those ideas and seeing like what are the
 

4977
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,930
those ideas and seeing like what are the
different medications what are the

4978
01:35:41,930 --> 01:35:41,940
different medications what are the
 

4979
01:35:41,940 --> 01:35:43,250
different medications what are the
different side effects what are the

4980
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:43,260
different side effects what are the
 

4981
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:44,990
different side effects what are the
different solutions to depression all

4982
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:45,000
different solutions to depression all
 

4983
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,370
different solutions to depression all
that kind of stuff and I think

4984
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:46,380
that kind of stuff and I think
 

4985
01:35:46,380 --> 01:35:48,110
that kind of stuff and I think
depression is just a really difficult

4986
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:48,120
depression is just a really difficult
 

4987
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:50,750
depression is just a really difficult
problem that's very

4988
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:50,760
problem that's very
 

4989
01:35:50,760 --> 01:35:52,669
problem that's very
um I don't want to Again State incorrect

4990
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:52,679
um I don't want to Again State incorrect
 

4991
01:35:52,679 --> 01:35:54,890
um I don't want to Again State incorrect
things but I think it's

4992
01:35:54,890 --> 01:35:54,900
things but I think it's
 

4993
01:35:54,900 --> 01:35:57,229
things but I think it's
um there's a lot of variability of what

4994
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:57,239
um there's a lot of variability of what
 

4995
01:35:57,239 --> 01:35:59,510
um there's a lot of variability of what
depression really means so it being

4996
01:35:59,510 --> 01:35:59,520
depression really means so it being
 

4997
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:01,430
depression really means so it being
introspective about the type of

4998
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:01,440
introspective about the type of
 

4999
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:02,870
introspective about the type of
depression you have and the different

5000
01:36:02,870 --> 01:36:02,880
depression you have and the different
 

5001
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:05,090
depression you have and the different
possible solutions you have just doing

5002
01:36:05,090 --> 01:36:05,100
possible solutions you have just doing
 

5003
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:07,790
possible solutions you have just doing
your own research as a first step before

5004
01:36:07,790 --> 01:36:07,800
your own research as a first step before
 

5005
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,770
your own research as a first step before
approaching a doctor or as you have

5006
01:36:09,770 --> 01:36:09,780
approaching a doctor or as you have
 

5007
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:11,750
approaching a doctor or as you have
multiple opinions could be very

5008
01:36:11,750 --> 01:36:11,760
multiple opinions could be very
 

5009
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:13,430
multiple opinions could be very
beneficial in that case

5010
01:36:13,430 --> 01:36:13,440
beneficial in that case
 

5011
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:15,350
beneficial in that case
now that's depression that's something

5012
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:15,360
now that's depression that's something
 

5013
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,790
now that's depression that's something
that's been studied for a very long time

5014
01:36:16,790 --> 01:36:16,800
that's been studied for a very long time
 

5015
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,669
that's been studied for a very long time
with a new pandemic that's affecting

5016
01:36:19,669 --> 01:36:19,679
with a new pandemic that's affecting
 

5017
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:21,709
with a new pandemic that's affecting
everybody

5018
01:36:21,709 --> 01:36:21,719
everybody
 

5019
01:36:21,719 --> 01:36:24,250
everybody
it's uh you know with the airplane

5020
01:36:24,250 --> 01:36:24,260
it's uh you know with the airplane
 

5021
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:27,350
it's uh you know with the airplane
equated to like 9 11 or something like

5022
01:36:27,350 --> 01:36:27,360
equated to like 9 11 or something like
 

5023
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:30,649
equated to like 9 11 or something like
the new emergency just happened and

5024
01:36:30,649 --> 01:36:30,659
the new emergency just happened and
 

5025
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:34,550
the new emergency just happened and
everybody every expert in the world is

5026
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:34,560
everybody every expert in the world is
 

5027
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:37,070
everybody every expert in the world is
publishing on it and talking about it so

5028
01:36:37,070 --> 01:36:37,080
publishing on it and talking about it so
 

5029
01:36:37,080 --> 01:36:38,990
publishing on it and talking about it so
doing your own research there could be

5030
01:36:38,990 --> 01:36:39,000
doing your own research there could be
 

5031
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,090
doing your own research there could be
exceptionally effective in asking

5032
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:41,100
exceptionally effective in asking
 

5033
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:43,669
exceptionally effective in asking
questions and then there's a difference

5034
01:36:43,669 --> 01:36:43,679
questions and then there's a difference
 

5035
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,910
questions and then there's a difference
between experts virologists and it's

5036
01:36:46,910 --> 01:36:46,920
between experts virologists and it's
 

5037
01:36:46,920 --> 01:36:48,770
between experts virologists and it's
actually a good question who is exactly

5038
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:48,780
actually a good question who is exactly
 

5039
01:36:48,780 --> 01:36:52,310
actually a good question who is exactly
the expert in a pandemic yeah but

5040
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:52,320
the expert in a pandemic yeah but
 

5041
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:55,910
the expert in a pandemic yeah but
there's the actual experts doing the

5042
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:55,920
there's the actual experts doing the
 

5043
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,830
there's the actual experts doing the
research and Publishing stuff

5044
01:36:57,830 --> 01:36:57,840
research and Publishing stuff
 

5045
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:59,930
research and Publishing stuff
and then there's the communicators of

5046
01:36:59,930 --> 01:36:59,940
and then there's the communicators of
 

5047
01:36:59,940 --> 01:37:01,189
and then there's the communicators of
that expertise

5048
01:37:01,189 --> 01:37:01,199
that expertise
 

5049
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:04,129
that expertise
and the question is uh if the

5050
01:37:04,129 --> 01:37:04,139
and the question is uh if the
 

5051
01:37:04,139 --> 01:37:06,830
and the question is uh if the
communicators are flawed

5052
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:06,840
communicators are flawed
 

5053
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,410
communicators are flawed
to to a degree we're doing your own

5054
01:37:09,410 --> 01:37:09,420
to to a degree we're doing your own
 

5055
01:37:09,420 --> 01:37:11,810
to to a degree we're doing your own
research is actually the more effective

5056
01:37:11,810 --> 01:37:11,820
research is actually the more effective
 

5057
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:13,669
research is actually the more effective
way to figure out policies and solutions

5058
01:37:13,669 --> 01:37:13,679
way to figure out policies and solutions
 

5059

experts you're competing with the
 

5063
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:19,370
experts you're competing with the
communicators of expertise that could be

01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:19,380
communicators of expertise that could be
 

5065
01:37:19,380 --> 01:37:22,189
communicators of expertise that could be
who CDC in the case of the pandemic or

01:37:27,709 --> 01:37:27,719
figures like Anthony fauci there's a
 

5071
01:37:27,719 --> 01:37:29,270

of
the effectiveness of doing your research

the effectiveness of doing your research

the effectiveness of doing your research
your own research in that context

your own research in that context
 

5079
01:37:35,900 --> 01:37:38,570
your own research in that context
and the competing

and the competing
 

5081
01:37:38,580 --> 01:37:40,430
and the competing
forces there incentives that you've

5082
01:37:40,430 --> 01:37:40,440
forces there incentives that you've
 

5083
01:37:40,440 --> 01:37:42,410
forces there incentives that you've
mentioned is you can be become quite

5084
01:37:42,410 --> 01:37:42,420
mentioned is you can be become quite
 

5085
01:37:42,420 --> 01:37:44,689
mentioned is you can be become quite
popular by being contrarian

5086
01:37:44,689 --> 01:37:44,699
popular by being contrarian
 

5087
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:46,250
popular by being contrarian
by saying everybody's lying to you all

5088
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:46,260
by saying everybody's lying to you all
 

5089
01:37:46,260 --> 01:37:47,510
by saying everybody's lying to you all
the authorities aligned to all the

5090
01:37:47,510 --> 01:37:47,520
the authorities aligned to all the
 

5091
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,790
the authorities aligned to all the
institutions aligned to you so those are

01:37:49,790 --> 01:37:49,800
institutions aligned to you so those are
 

5093
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,490
institutions aligned to you so those are
the waters you're swimming in but I

5094
01:37:52,490 --> 01:37:52,500
the waters you're swimming in but I
 

5095
01:37:52,500 --> 01:37:54,410
the waters you're swimming in but I
think doing your own research in that

5096
01:37:54,410 --> 01:37:54,420
think doing your own research in that
 

5097
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:57,530
think doing your own research in that
kind of context could be quite effective

5098
01:37:57,530 --> 01:37:57,540
kind of context could be quite effective
 

5099
01:37:57,540 --> 01:38:00,470
kind of context could be quite effective
let me be clear I'm not saying

5100
01:38:00,470 --> 01:38:00,480
let me be clear I'm not saying
 

5101
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,510
let me be clear I'm not saying
you shouldn't do any research right I'm

5102
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:02,520
you shouldn't do any research right I'm
 

5103
01:38:02,520 --> 01:38:03,709
you shouldn't do any research right I'm
not saying that you shouldn't be

5104
01:38:03,709 --> 01:38:03,719
not saying that you shouldn't be
 

5105
01:38:03,719 --> 01:38:05,209
not saying that you shouldn't be
informed about an issue I'm not saying

5106
01:38:05,209 --> 01:38:05,219
informed about an issue I'm not saying
 

5107
01:38:05,219 --> 01:38:07,370
informed about an issue I'm not saying
you shouldn't read articles on on

5108
01:38:07,370 --> 01:38:07,380
you shouldn't read articles on on
 

5109
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:10,129
you shouldn't read articles on on
whatever the topic is and yeah yes if I

5110
01:38:10,129 --> 01:38:10,139
whatever the topic is and yeah yes if I
 

5111
01:38:10,139 --> 01:38:11,510
whatever the topic is and yeah yes if I
got cancer or someone close to me got

5112
01:38:11,510 --> 01:38:11,520
got cancer or someone close to me got
 

5113
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:13,850
got cancer or someone close to me got
cancer I I I probably would read more

5114
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:13,860
cancer I I I probably would read more
 

5115
01:38:13,860 --> 01:38:15,649
cancer I I I probably would read more
about cancer than I've read thus far

5116
01:38:15,649 --> 01:38:15,659
about cancer than I've read thus far
 

5117
01:38:15,659 --> 01:38:18,649
about cancer than I've read thus far
about cancer and I've read some

5118
01:38:18,649 --> 01:38:18,659
about cancer and I've read some
 

5119
01:38:18,659 --> 01:38:19,910
about cancer and I've read some
um

5120
01:38:19,910 --> 01:38:19,920
um
 

5121
01:38:19,920 --> 01:38:22,729
um
so I'm not I'm not making a virtue of

5122
01:38:22,729 --> 01:38:22,739
so I'm not I'm not making a virtue of
 

5123
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,110
so I'm not I'm not making a virtue of
ignorance

5124
01:38:24,110 --> 01:38:24,120
ignorance
 

5125
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:27,229
ignorance
and a blind obedience to Authority and I

5126
01:38:27,229 --> 01:38:27,239
and a blind obedience to Authority and I
 

5127
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:29,450
and a blind obedience to Authority and I
again I recognize that that authorities

5128
01:38:29,450 --> 01:38:29,460
again I recognize that that authorities
 

5129
01:38:29,460 --> 01:38:31,250
again I recognize that that authorities
can discredit themselves or they can be

5130
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:31,260
can discredit themselves or they can be
 

5131
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:32,209
can discredit themselves or they can be
wrong

5132
01:38:32,209 --> 01:38:32,219
wrong
 

5133
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:33,890
wrong
uh they can be wrong even when they had

5134
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:33,900
uh they can be wrong even when they had
 

5135
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:35,510
uh they can be wrong even when they had
when there's no discredit there's just

5136
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:35,520
when there's no discredit there's just
 

5137
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,310
when there's no discredit there's just
there's a lot we don't understand about

5138
01:38:37,310 --> 01:38:37,320
there's a lot we don't understand about
 

5139
01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:40,370
there's a lot we don't understand about
the the nature of the world

5140
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:40,380
the the nature of the world
 

5141
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,510
the the nature of the world
um

5142
01:38:41,510 --> 01:38:41,520
um
 

5143
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:45,310
um
but still this this vast Gulf between

5144
01:38:45,310 --> 01:38:45,320
but still this this vast Gulf between
 

5145
01:38:45,320 --> 01:38:49,070
but still this this vast Gulf between
truly informed opinion and [\h__\h]

5146
01:38:49,070 --> 01:38:49,080
truly informed opinion and [\h__\h]
 

5147
01:38:49,080 --> 01:38:53,090
truly informed opinion and [\h__\h]
exists it always exists and

5148
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:53,100
exists it always exists and
 

5149
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:57,290
exists it always exists and
um and conspiracy thinking is

5150
01:38:57,290 --> 01:38:57,300

 

5151
01:38:57,300 --> 01:38:59,810

rather often you know most of the time

5152
01:38:59,810 --> 01:38:59,820
rather often you know most of the time
 

5153
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:02,689
rather often you know most of the time
the species of [\h__\h] but it's not

5154
01:39:02,689 --> 01:39:02,699
the species of [\h__\h] but it's not
 

5155
01:39:02,699 --> 01:39:04,010
the species of [\h__\h] but it's not
always wrong right there are real

5156
01:39:04,010 --> 01:39:04,020
always wrong right there are real
 

5157
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,090
always wrong right there are real
conspiracies and there there really are

5158
01:39:07,090 --> 01:39:07,100
conspiracies and there there really are
 

5159
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:10,129
conspiracies and there there really are
just awful

5160
01:39:10,129 --> 01:39:10,139
just awful
 

5161
01:39:10,139 --> 01:39:12,410
just awful
Corruptions of you know but born of bad

Corruptions of you know but born of bad
 

5163
01:39:12,420 --> 01:39:14,990

01:39:17,270 --> 01:39:17,280
scientific processes within institutions
 

5167
01:39:17,280 --> 01:39:20,149
scientific processes within institutions
and again we've mentioned a lot of these

5168
01:39:20,149 --> 01:39:20,159
and again we've mentioned a lot of these
 

5169
01:39:20,159 --> 01:39:22,450
and again we've mentioned a lot of these
things in passing but you know what what

5170
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:22,460
things in passing but you know what what
 

5171
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:25,129
things in passing but you know what what
woke political ideology did to

5172
01:39:25,129 --> 01:39:25,139
woke political ideology did to
 

5173
01:39:25,139 --> 01:39:27,229
woke political ideology did to
Scientific communication during the

5174
01:39:27,229 --> 01:39:27,239
Scientific communication during the
 

5175
01:39:27,239 --> 01:39:29,870
Scientific communication during the
pandemic was awful and it was really

5176
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:29,880
pandemic was awful and it was really
 

5177
01:39:29,880 --> 01:39:32,030
pandemic was awful and it was really
corrosive of public trust especially on

5178
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:32,040
corrosive of public trust especially on
 

5179
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:34,370
corrosive of public trust especially on
the on the right

5180
01:39:34,370 --> 01:39:34,380
the on the right
 

5181
01:39:34,380 --> 01:39:36,350
the on the right
um for understandable reasons and it was

5182
01:39:36,350 --> 01:39:36,360
um for understandable reasons and it was
 

5183
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:37,729
um for understandable reasons and it was
just it was crazy some of the things

5184
01:39:37,729 --> 01:39:37,739
just it was crazy some of the things
 

5185
01:39:37,739 --> 01:39:40,610
just it was crazy some of the things
that were being said and still is

5186
01:39:40,610 --> 01:39:40,620
that were being said and still is
 

5187
01:39:40,620 --> 01:39:42,530
that were being said and still is
and these cases are all different so you

5188
01:39:42,530 --> 01:39:42,540
and these cases are all different so you
 

5189
01:39:42,540 --> 01:39:44,209
and these cases are all different so you
take depression but we just don't know

5190
01:39:44,209 --> 01:39:44,219
take depression but we just don't know
 

5191
01:39:44,219 --> 01:39:46,490
take depression but we just don't know
enough about depression for you know

5192
01:39:46,490 --> 01:39:46,500
enough about depression for you know
 

5193
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,590
enough about depression for you know
anyone to be that confident about

5194
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:48,600
anyone to be that confident about
 

5195
01:39:48,600 --> 01:39:50,510
anyone to be that confident about
anything right and there are many

5196
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:50,520
anything right and there are many
 

5197
01:39:50,520 --> 01:39:52,910
anything right and there are many
different modalities in which to

5198
01:39:52,910 --> 01:39:52,920
different modalities in which to
 

5199
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:54,590
different modalities in which to
interact with it as a problem right so

5200
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:54,600
interact with it as a problem right so
 

5201
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:56,750
interact with it as a problem right so
there's Pharmaceuticals have whatever

5202
01:39:56,750 --> 01:39:56,760
there's Pharmaceuticals have whatever
 

5203
01:39:56,760 --> 01:39:58,430
there's Pharmaceuticals have whatever
promise they have but there's there's

5204
01:39:58,430 --> 01:39:58,440
promise they have but there's there's
 

5205
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:00,410
promise they have but there's there's
certainly reason to be concerned that

5206
01:40:00,410 --> 01:40:00,420
certainly reason to be concerned that
 

5207
01:40:00,420 --> 01:40:02,750
certainly reason to be concerned that
they don't work well for everybody and

5208
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:02,760
they don't work well for everybody and
 

5209
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,850
they don't work well for everybody and
and

5210
01:40:03,850 --> 01:40:03,860
and
 

5211
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:06,709
and
uh yeah I mean that's it's obvious they

5212
01:40:06,709 --> 01:40:06,719
uh yeah I mean that's it's obvious they
 

5213
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:08,270
uh yeah I mean that's it's obvious they
don't work well for everybody but they

5214
01:40:08,270 --> 01:40:08,280
don't work well for everybody but they
 

5215
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:10,370
don't work well for everybody but they
do work for some people

5216
01:40:10,370 --> 01:40:10,380
do work for some people
 

5217
01:40:10,380 --> 01:40:13,129
do work for some people
um

5218
01:40:13,129 --> 01:40:13,139

 

5219
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:16,010

but again depression is a multifactorial

5220
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:16,020
but again depression is a multifactorial
 

5221
01:40:16,020 --> 01:40:18,350
but again depression is a multifactorial
problem and they're they're different

5222
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:18,360
problem and they're they're different
 

5223
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,510
problem and they're they're different
levels at which to to influence it and

5224
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:20,520
levels at which to to influence it and
 

5225
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:21,530
levels at which to to influence it and
they're you know the things like

5226
01:40:21,530 --> 01:40:21,540
they're you know the things like
 

5227
01:40:21,540 --> 01:40:23,629
they're you know the things like
meditation they're things like just life

5228
01:40:23,629 --> 01:40:23,639
meditation they're things like just life
 

5229
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:25,370
meditation they're things like just life
changes and

5230
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:25,380
changes and
 

5231
01:40:25,380 --> 01:40:26,870
changes and
and uh

5232
01:40:26,870 --> 01:40:26,880
and uh
 

5233
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:28,370
and uh
you know one of the perverse things

5234
01:40:28,370 --> 01:40:28,380
you know one of the perverse things
 

5235
01:40:28,380 --> 01:40:29,810
you know one of the perverse things
about depression is that when you're

5236
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:29,820
about depression is that when you're
 

5237
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,970
about depression is that when you're
depressed all of the things that would

5238
01:40:31,970 --> 01:40:31,980
depressed all of the things that would
 

5239
01:40:31,980 --> 01:40:33,229
depressed all of the things that would
be good for you to do or precisely

5240
01:40:33,229 --> 01:40:33,239
be good for you to do or precisely
 

5241
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:34,669
be good for you to do or precisely
things you don't want to do you don't

5242
01:40:34,669 --> 01:40:34,679
things you don't want to do you don't
 

5243
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:36,350
things you don't want to do you don't
have any energy to socialize you don't

5244
01:40:36,350 --> 01:40:36,360
have any energy to socialize you don't
 

5245
01:40:36,360 --> 01:40:37,850
have any energy to socialize you don't
want to get things done you don't want

5246
01:40:37,850 --> 01:40:37,860
want to get things done you don't want
 

5247
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:40,790
want to get things done you don't want
to exercise you don't and

5248
01:40:40,790 --> 01:40:40,800
to exercise you don't and
 

5249
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,350
to exercise you don't and
um all of those things if you've got

5250
01:40:42,350 --> 01:40:42,360
um all of those things if you've got
 

5251
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,729
um all of those things if you've got
those up and running they do make you

5252
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:43,739
those up and running they do make you
 

5253
01:40:43,739 --> 01:40:46,370
those up and running they do make you
feel better in you know in the aggregate

5254
01:40:46,370 --> 01:40:46,380
feel better in you know in the aggregate
 

5255
01:40:46,380 --> 01:40:49,490
feel better in you know in the aggregate
but um the reality is that they're you

5256
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:49,500
but um the reality is that they're you
 

5257
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:50,510
but um the reality is that they're you
know there are clinical level

5258
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:50,520
know there are clinical level
 

5259
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:52,490
know there are clinical level
depressions that are so bad that it's

5260
01:40:52,490 --> 01:40:52,500
depressions that are so bad that it's
 

5261
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:55,070
depressions that are so bad that it's
just we just don't have good tools for

5262
01:40:55,070 --> 01:40:55,080
just we just don't have good tools for
 

5263
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,709
just we just don't have good tools for
them and it's not enough to tell there's

5264
01:40:57,709 --> 01:40:57,719
them and it's not enough to tell there's
 

5265
01:40:57,719 --> 01:41:00,290
them and it's not enough to tell there's
no life change someone's gonna gonna

5266
01:41:00,290 --> 01:41:00,300
no life change someone's gonna gonna
 

5267
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,510
no life change someone's gonna gonna
Embrace that it's going to be an obvious

5268
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:02,520
Embrace that it's going to be an obvious
 

5269
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:04,310
Embrace that it's going to be an obvious
remedy for that

5270
01:41:04,310 --> 01:41:04,320
remedy for that
 

5271
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:05,870
remedy for that
um

5272
01:41:05,870 --> 01:41:05,880
um
 

5273
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:07,850
um
the pan I mean pandemics are are

5274
01:41:07,850 --> 01:41:07,860
the pan I mean pandemics are are
 

5275
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:11,390
the pan I mean pandemics are are
obviously a complicated problem but I I

5276
01:41:11,390 --> 01:41:11,400
obviously a complicated problem but I I
 

5277
01:41:11,400 --> 01:41:13,129
obviously a complicated problem but I I
would consider it much simpler than

5278
01:41:13,129 --> 01:41:13,139
would consider it much simpler than
 

5279
01:41:13,139 --> 01:41:15,350
would consider it much simpler than
depression in terms of

5280
01:41:15,350 --> 01:41:15,360
depression in terms of
 

5281
01:41:15,360 --> 01:41:17,750
depression in terms of
you know what's on the menu to be this

5282
01:41:17,750 --> 01:41:17,760
you know what's on the menu to be this
 

5283
01:41:17,760 --> 01:41:20,930
you know what's on the menu to be this
chosen among the various choices just

5284
01:41:20,930 --> 01:41:20,940
chosen among the various choices just
 

5285
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,910
chosen among the various choices just
less multifactorial the logic by which

5286
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:22,920
less multifactorial the logic by which
 

5287
01:41:22,920 --> 01:41:24,169
less multifactorial the logic by which
you would make those choices yeah so

5288
01:41:24,169 --> 01:41:24,179
you would make those choices yeah so
 

5289
01:41:24,179 --> 01:41:26,450
you would make those choices yeah so
it's like we have a virus we have a new

5290
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:26,460
it's like we have a virus we have a new
 

5291
01:41:26,460 --> 01:41:27,490
it's like we have a virus we have a new
virus

5292
01:41:27,490 --> 01:41:27,500
virus
 

5293
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:30,590
virus
it's some version of bad you know it's

5294
01:41:30,590 --> 01:41:30,600
it's some version of bad you know it's
 

5295
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,149
it's some version of bad you know it's
human transmissible

5296
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:32,159
human transmissible
 

5297
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,010
human transmissible
we're still catching up we're catching

5298
01:41:34,010 --> 01:41:34,020
we're still catching up we're catching
 

5299
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,570
we're still catching up we're catching
up to every aspect of we don't know how

5300
01:41:35,570 --> 01:41:35,580
up to every aspect of we don't know how
 

5301
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,609
up to every aspect of we don't know how
it spreads we don't know how how

5302
01:41:37,609 --> 01:41:37,619
it spreads we don't know how how
 

5303
01:41:37,619 --> 01:41:39,530
it spreads we don't know how how
effective masks are at a certain point

5304
01:41:39,530 --> 01:41:39,540
effective masks are at a certain point
 

5305
01:41:39,540 --> 01:41:42,070
effective masks are at a certain point
we knew it was respiratory but we knew

5306
01:41:42,070 --> 01:41:42,080
we knew it was respiratory but we knew
 

5307
01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:44,990
we knew it was respiratory but we knew
and whether it's spread by fomites like

5308
01:41:44,990 --> 01:41:45,000
and whether it's spread by fomites like
 

5309
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,250
and whether it's spread by fomites like
all we were confused about a lot of

5310
01:41:46,250 --> 01:41:46,260
all we were confused about a lot of
 

5311
01:41:46,260 --> 01:41:48,590
all we were confused about a lot of
things and was still confused it's been

5312
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:48,600
things and was still confused it's been
 

5313
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:50,209
things and was still confused it's been
a moving Target this whole time and it's

5314
01:41:50,209 --> 01:41:50,219
a moving Target this whole time and it's
 

5315
01:41:50,219 --> 01:41:52,609
a moving Target this whole time and it's
been changing this whole time and our

5316
01:41:52,609 --> 01:41:52,619
been changing this whole time and our
 

5317
01:41:52,619 --> 01:41:54,830
been changing this whole time and our
responses to it have been

5318
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:54,840
responses to it have been
 

5319
01:41:54,840 --> 01:41:57,950
responses to it have been
you know we we ramped up the vaccines as

5320
01:41:57,950 --> 01:41:57,960
you know we we ramped up the vaccines as
 

5321
01:41:57,960 --> 01:42:00,169
you know we we ramped up the vaccines as
quickly as we as we could but you know

5322
01:42:00,169 --> 01:42:00,179
quickly as we as we could but you know
 

5323
01:42:00,179 --> 01:42:02,629
quickly as we as we could but you know
too quick for some not as not quick

5324
01:42:02,629 --> 01:42:02,639
too quick for some not as not quick
 

5325
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,310
too quick for some not as not quick
enough for others we could have done

5326
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:04,320
enough for others we could have done
 

5327
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:06,290
enough for others we could have done
human challenge trials and got them out

5328
01:42:06,290 --> 01:42:06,300
human challenge trials and got them out
 

5329
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:09,590
human challenge trials and got them out
more quickly with with better data

5330
01:42:09,590 --> 01:42:09,600
more quickly with with better data
 

5331
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:10,790
more quickly with with better data
um and I think that's something we

5332
01:42:10,790 --> 01:42:10,800
um and I think that's something we
 

5333
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:11,930
um and I think that's something we
should probably look at in the future

5334
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:11,940
should probably look at in the future
 

5335
01:42:11,940 --> 01:42:14,209
should probably look at in the future
because you know that you know to my eye

5336
01:42:14,209 --> 01:42:14,219
because you know that you know to my eye
 

5337
01:42:14,219 --> 01:42:15,830
because you know that you know to my eye
that would make ethical sense to do to

5338
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:15,840
that would make ethical sense to do to
 

5339
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:17,689
that would make ethical sense to do to
do challenge trials

5340
01:42:17,689 --> 01:42:17,699
do challenge trials
 

5341
01:42:17,699 --> 01:42:18,530
do challenge trials
um

5342
01:42:18,530 --> 01:42:18,540
um
 

5343
01:42:18,540 --> 01:42:20,209
um
but

5344
01:42:20,209 --> 01:42:20,219
but
 

5345
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:22,250
but
and and so much of my concern about

5346
01:42:22,250 --> 01:42:22,260
and and so much of my concern about
 

5347
01:42:22,260 --> 01:42:24,050
and and so much of my concern about
covid I mean many people are confused

5348
01:42:24,050 --> 01:42:24,060
covid I mean many people are confused
 

5349
01:42:24,060 --> 01:42:25,910
covid I mean many people are confused
about my concern about covet my concern

5350
01:42:25,910 --> 01:42:25,920
about my concern about covet my concern
 

5351
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,470
about my concern about covet my concern
about covet has

5352
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:27,480
about covet has
 

5353

initial period
 

5383
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:10,790
initial period
when we had a sense of what we were

5384
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:10,800
when we had a sense of what we were
 

5385
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:12,649
when we had a sense of what we were
dealing with and we had every hope that

the vaccines are actually going to work
 

5389
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:14,930
the vaccines are actually going to work
and we're getting and we knew we were

5390
01:43:14,930 --> 01:43:14,940
and we're getting and we knew we were
 

5391
01:43:14,940 --> 01:43:16,550
and we're getting and we knew we were
getting those vaccines in short order

5392
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:16,560
getting those vaccines in short order
 

5393
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,310
getting those vaccines in short order
right beyond that and and we had and and

5394
01:43:19,310 --> 01:43:19,320
right beyond that and and we had and and
 

5395
01:43:19,320 --> 01:43:21,770
right beyond that and and we had and and
we knew just how dangerous the illness

5396
01:43:21,770 --> 01:43:21,780
we knew just how dangerous the illness
 

5397
01:43:21,780 --> 01:43:24,770
we knew just how dangerous the illness
was and how dangerous it wasn't

5398
01:43:24,770 --> 01:43:24,780
was and how dangerous it wasn't
 

5399
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:25,490
was and how dangerous it wasn't

um
 

5401
01:43:25,500 --> 01:43:28,250
um
for years now I've just been worrying

5402
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:28,260
for years now I've just been worrying
 

5403
01:43:28,260 --> 01:43:30,410
for years now I've just been worrying
about this as a failed dress rehearsal

5404
01:43:30,410 --> 01:43:30,420
about this as a failed dress rehearsal
 

5405
01:43:30,420 --> 01:43:32,390
about this as a failed dress rehearsal
for something much worse right I think

5406
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:32,400
for something much worse right I think
 

5407
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,609
for something much worse right I think
what we proved to ourselves at this

5408
01:43:34,609 --> 01:43:34,619
what we proved to ourselves at this
 

5409
01:43:34,619 --> 01:43:36,290
what we proved to ourselves at this
moment in history is that

5410
01:43:36,290 --> 01:43:36,300
moment in history is that
 

5411
01:43:36,300 --> 01:43:38,930
moment in history is that
we have built informational tools that

5412
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:38,940
we have built informational tools that
 

5413
01:43:38,940 --> 01:43:41,990
we have built informational tools that
we do not know how to use to and we have

5414
01:43:41,990 --> 01:43:42,000
we do not know how to use to and we have
 

5415
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,149
we do not know how to use to and we have
made ourselves we've basically enrolled

01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:44,159
made ourselves we've basically enrolled

psychological experiment
 

5421
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:50,570

that is

01:43:50,570 --> 01:43:50,580
that is
 

5423
01:43:50,580 --> 01:43:53,450
that is
deranging us and making it

01:43:53,450 --> 01:43:53,460
deranging us and making it
 

5425
01:43:53,460 --> 01:43:55,790
deranging us and making it
virtually impossible to solve

all of this is getting signal boosted by
 

5599
01:47:26,639 --> 01:47:29,209
all of this is getting signal boosted by
a a an outrage machine that is

it's just a small tangent yeah how do
 

5611
01:47:39,659 --> 01:47:42,229
it's just a small tangent yeah how do
you defend yourself against the claim

5612
01:47:42,229 --> 01:47:42,239
you defend yourself against the claim
 

5613
01:47:42,239 --> 01:47:44,629
you defend yourself against the claim
that you're a pedophile accountable

5614

I get that that's fun if you're a

I get that that's fun if you're a
 

5671
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:44,689
I get that that's fun if you're a
teenager and you just want to vandalize

01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:51,229
our our new sphere but
at a certain point you we have to

at a certain point you we have to
 

5677
01:48:51,239 --> 01:48:53,990
at a certain point you we have to
recognize that real questions of human

5678

getting fought or not fought and there's

5684
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:00,600
getting fought or not fought and there's
 

5685
01:49:00,600 --> 01:49:02,689
getting fought or not fought and there's
a pandemic raging and

5686
01:49:02,689 --> 01:49:02,699
a pandemic raging and
 

5687
01:49:02,699 --> 01:49:05,090
a pandemic raging and
there's medicine to take or not take but

there's medicine to take or not take but
 

5689
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,590
there's medicine to take or not take but
I mean to come back to this issue of

5690
01:49:06,590 --> 01:49:06,600
I mean to come back to this issue of
 

5691
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:07,790
I mean to come back to this issue of
covid

5692
01:49:07,790 --> 01:49:07,800
covid
 

5693
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:11,030
covid
I don't think my I don't think I got so

5694
01:49:11,030 --> 01:49:11,040
I don't think my I don't think I got so
 

5695
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:12,890
I don't think my I don't think I got so
out of balance around covid I think

5696
01:49:12,890 --> 01:49:12,900
out of balance around covid I think
 

5697
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:15,590
out of balance around covid I think
people are quite confused about what I

5698
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:15,600
people are quite confused about what I
 

5699
01:49:15,600 --> 01:49:17,990
people are quite confused about what I
was concerned about I mean like there

5700
01:49:17,990 --> 01:49:18,000
was concerned about I mean like there
 

5701
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,510
was concerned about I mean like there
was a yes there was a period where

5702
01:49:20,510 --> 01:49:20,520
was a yes there was a period where
 

5703
01:49:20,520 --> 01:49:23,090
was a yes there was a period where
I was crazy because anyone who has taken

5704
01:49:23,090 --> 01:49:23,100
I was crazy because anyone who has taken
 

5705
01:49:23,100 --> 01:49:24,290
I was crazy because anyone who has taken
it seriously was crazy because they had

5706
01:49:24,290 --> 01:49:24,300
it seriously was crazy because they had
 

5707
01:49:24,300 --> 01:49:25,790
it seriously was crazy because they had
no idea what was going on and so it's

5708
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:25,800
no idea what was going on and so it's
 

5709
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,430
no idea what was going on and so it's
like yes I was wiping down packages with

5710
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:28,440
like yes I was wiping down packages with
 

5711
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:31,370
like yes I was wiping down packages with
with alcohol wipes right because

5712
01:49:31,370 --> 01:49:31,380
with alcohol wipes right because
 

5713
01:49:31,380 --> 01:49:33,590
with alcohol wipes right because
people thought it was tremendous

5714
01:49:33,590 --> 01:49:33,600
people thought it was tremendous
 

5715
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:36,470
people thought it was tremendous
transmissible by touch right that so and

5716
01:49:36,470 --> 01:49:36,480
transmissible by touch right that so and
 

5717
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,030
transmissible by touch right that so and
then when we realized that was no longer

5718
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:38,040
then when we realized that was no longer
 

5719
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:40,370
then when we realized that was no longer
the case I stopped doing that but so

5720
01:49:40,370 --> 01:49:40,380
the case I stopped doing that but so
 

5721
01:49:40,380 --> 01:49:43,790
the case I stopped doing that but so
there again it was a moving Target and a

5722
01:49:43,790 --> 01:49:43,800
there again it was a moving Target and a
 

5723
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:45,649
there again it was a moving Target and a
lot of things we did in hindsight around

5724
01:49:45,649 --> 01:49:45,659
lot of things we did in hindsight around
 

5725
01:49:45,659 --> 01:49:49,149
lot of things we did in hindsight around
masking and school closures

5726
01:49:49,149 --> 01:49:49,159
masking and school closures
 

5727
01:49:49,159 --> 01:49:52,490
masking and school closures
looked fairly dysfunctional right but

5728
01:49:52,490 --> 01:49:52,500
looked fairly dysfunctional right but
 

5729
01:49:52,500 --> 01:49:54,169
looked fairly dysfunctional right but
it's unnecessary I think the criticism

5730
01:49:54,169 --> 01:49:54,179
it's unnecessary I think the criticism
 

5731
01:49:54,179 --> 01:49:55,790
it's unnecessary I think the criticism
that people would

5732
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:55,800
that people would
 

5733
01:49:55,800 --> 01:49:59,149
that people would
uh would say about your uh talking about

5734
01:49:59,149 --> 01:49:59,159
uh would say about your uh talking about
 

5735
01:49:59,159 --> 01:50:01,910
uh would say about your uh talking about
covet and maybe you can correct me but

5736
01:50:01,910 --> 01:50:01,920
covet and maybe you can correct me but
 

5737
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,050
covet and maybe you can correct me but
you were skeptical or you were against

5738
01:50:05,050 --> 01:50:05,060
you were skeptical or you were against
 

5739
01:50:05,060 --> 01:50:08,570
you were skeptical or you were against
skepticism of the safety and efficacy of

5740
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:08,580
skepticism of the safety and efficacy of
 

5741
01:50:08,580 --> 01:50:09,830
skepticism of the safety and efficacy of
the vaccine

5742
01:50:09,830 --> 01:50:09,840
the vaccine
 

5743
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:13,729
the vaccine
so people who get nervous about

5744
01:50:13,729 --> 01:50:13,739
so people who get nervous about
 

5745
01:50:13,739 --> 01:50:16,570
so people who get nervous about
the vaccine but don't fall into the

5746
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:16,580
the vaccine but don't fall into the
 

5747
01:50:16,580 --> 01:50:19,850
the vaccine but don't fall into the
usual anti-vaxx Camp which I think there

5748
01:50:19,850 --> 01:50:19,860
usual anti-vaxx Camp which I think there
 

5749
01:50:19,860 --> 01:50:22,010
usual anti-vaxx Camp which I think there
was a significant yeah enough number

5750
01:50:22,010 --> 01:50:22,020
was a significant yeah enough number
 

5751
01:50:22,020 --> 01:50:24,530
was a significant yeah enough number
they're asking they're getting nervous I

5752
01:50:24,530 --> 01:50:24,540
they're asking they're getting nervous I
 

5753
01:50:24,540 --> 01:50:27,709
they're asking they're getting nervous I
mean I especially after the warn of

5754
01:50:27,709 --> 01:50:27,719
mean I especially after the warn of
 

5755
01:50:27,719 --> 01:50:31,129
mean I especially after the warn of
Afghanistan and rock I too was nervous

5756
01:50:31,129 --> 01:50:31,139
Afghanistan and rock I too was nervous
 

5757
01:50:31,139 --> 01:50:33,470
Afghanistan and rock I too was nervous
about anything where a lot of money

5758
01:50:33,470 --> 01:50:33,480
about anything where a lot of money
 

5759
01:50:33,480 --> 01:50:37,310
about anything where a lot of money
could be made hmm and you start you just

5760
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:37,320
could be made hmm and you start you just
 

5761
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:39,530
could be made hmm and you start you just
see how the people who are greedy who

5762
01:50:39,530 --> 01:50:39,540
see how the people who are greedy who
 

5763
01:50:39,540 --> 01:50:41,030
see how the people who are greedy who
come they come to the surface all of a

5764
01:50:41,030 --> 01:50:41,040
come they come to the surface all of a
 

5765
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,370
come they come to the surface all of a
sudden and a lot of them that run

5766
01:50:43,370 --> 01:50:43,380
sudden and a lot of them that run
 

5767
01:50:43,380 --> 01:50:44,930
sudden and a lot of them that run
institutions actually really good human

5768
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:44,940
institutions actually really good human
 

5769
01:50:44,940 --> 01:50:46,790
institutions actually really good human
beings and I know a lot of them but it's

5770
01:50:46,790 --> 01:50:46,800
beings and I know a lot of them but it's
 

5771
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:47,990
beings and I know a lot of them but it's
hard to know

5772
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:48,000
hard to know
 

5773
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,970
hard to know
how those two combine together when

5774
01:50:49,970 --> 01:50:49,980
how those two combine together when
 

5775
01:50:49,980 --> 01:50:51,709
how those two combine together when
there's hundreds of billions trillions

5776
01:50:51,709 --> 01:50:51,719
there's hundreds of billions trillions
 

5777
01:50:51,719 --> 01:50:53,990
there's hundreds of billions trillions
of dollars to be made and so that

5778
01:50:53,990 --> 01:50:54,000
of dollars to be made and so that
 

5779
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,649
of dollars to be made and so that
skepticism I I guess you this the sense

5780
01:50:57,649 --> 01:50:57,659
skepticism I I guess you this the sense
 

5781
01:50:57,659 --> 01:50:59,209
skepticism I I guess you this the sense
was that you weren't open enough to the

5782
01:50:59,209 --> 01:50:59,219
was that you weren't open enough to the
 

5783
01:50:59,219 --> 01:51:00,890
was that you weren't open enough to the
skepticism I understand that people have

5784
01:51:00,890 --> 01:51:00,900
skepticism I understand that people have
 

5785
01:51:00,900 --> 01:51:02,810
skepticism I understand that people have
that sense I'll tell you how I thought

5786
01:51:02,810 --> 01:51:02,820
that sense I'll tell you how I thought
 

5787
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:05,510
that sense I'll tell you how I thought
about it and think about it one again it

5788
01:51:05,510 --> 01:51:05,520
about it and think about it one again it
 

5789
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:07,490
about it and think about it one again it
was a moving Target so there was a point

5790
01:51:07,490 --> 01:51:07,500
was a moving Target so there was a point
 

5791
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:09,470
was a moving Target so there was a point
in the timeline where

5792
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:09,480
in the timeline where
 

5793
01:51:09,480 --> 01:51:13,970
in the timeline where
it was totally rational to expect that

5794
01:51:13,970 --> 01:51:13,980
it was totally rational to expect that
 

5795
01:51:13,980 --> 01:51:16,330
it was totally rational to expect that
the vaccines

5796
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:16,340
the vaccines
 

5797
01:51:16,340 --> 01:51:20,390
the vaccines
were were both working but both they

5798
01:51:20,390 --> 01:51:20,400
were were both working but both they
 

5799
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:21,169
were were both working but both they
were

5800
01:51:21,169 --> 01:51:21,179
were
 

5801
01:51:21,179 --> 01:51:24,410
were
they were reasonably safe and that and

5802
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:24,420
they were reasonably safe and that and
 

5803
01:51:24,420 --> 01:51:27,050
they were reasonably safe and that and
that covid was reasonably dangerous and

5804
01:51:27,050 --> 01:51:27,060
that covid was reasonably dangerous and
 

5805
01:51:27,060 --> 01:51:28,669
that covid was reasonably dangerous and
that the trade-off for basically

5806
01:51:28,669 --> 01:51:28,679
that the trade-off for basically
 

5807
01:51:28,679 --> 01:51:30,290
that the trade-off for basically
everyone was it was rational to get

5808
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:30,300
everyone was it was rational to get
 

5809
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:32,330
everyone was it was rational to get
vaccinated given how many given the

5810
01:51:32,330 --> 01:51:32,340
vaccinated given how many given the
 

5811
01:51:32,340 --> 01:51:34,310
vaccinated given how many given the
level of testing and how many people had

5812
01:51:34,310 --> 01:51:34,320
level of testing and how many people had
 

5813
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,350
level of testing and how many people had
been vaccinated before you given what we

5814
01:51:36,350 --> 01:51:36,360
been vaccinated before you given what we
 

5815
01:51:36,360 --> 01:51:38,689
been vaccinated before you given what we
were seeing with covid right

5816
01:51:38,689 --> 01:51:38,699
were seeing with covid right
 

5817
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:40,790
were seeing with covid right
um that that was a forced choice you're

5818
01:51:40,790 --> 01:51:40,800
um that that was a forced choice you're
 

5819
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,870
um that that was a forced choice you're
either gonna you're eventually going to

5820
01:51:41,870 --> 01:51:41,880
either gonna you're eventually going to
 

5821
01:51:41,880 --> 01:51:43,070
either gonna you're eventually going to
get coveted and the question is do you

5822
01:51:43,070 --> 01:51:43,080
get coveted and the question is do you
 

5823
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,350
get coveted and the question is do you
want to be vaccinated when you do right

5824
01:51:45,350 --> 01:51:45,360
want to be vaccinated when you do right
 

5825
01:51:45,360 --> 01:51:47,209
want to be vaccinated when you do right
there was a period where that Force

5826
01:51:47,209 --> 01:51:47,219
there was a period where that Force
 

5827
01:51:47,219 --> 01:51:49,070
there was a period where that Force
choice where it was just obviously

5828
01:51:49,070 --> 01:51:49,080
choice where it was just obviously
 

5829
01:51:49,080 --> 01:51:51,950
choice where it was just obviously
reasonable to get vaccinated

5830
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:51,960
reasonable to get vaccinated
 

5831
01:51:51,960 --> 01:51:55,010
reasonable to get vaccinated
in especially because there was every

5832
01:51:55,010 --> 01:51:55,020
in especially because there was every
 

5833
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:57,410
in especially because there was every
reason to expect that while it wasn't a

5834
01:51:57,410 --> 01:51:57,420
reason to expect that while it wasn't a
 

5835
01:51:57,420 --> 01:52:00,109
reason to expect that while it wasn't a
perfectly sterilizing vaccine it was

5836
01:52:00,109 --> 01:52:00,119
perfectly sterilizing vaccine it was
 

5837
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:02,750
perfectly sterilizing vaccine it was
going to knock down transmission a lot

5838
01:52:02,750 --> 01:52:02,760
going to knock down transmission a lot
 

5839
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:04,729
going to knock down transmission a lot
and that matters and so it wasn't just a

5840
01:52:04,729 --> 01:52:04,739
and that matters and so it wasn't just a
 

5841
01:52:04,739 --> 01:52:07,609
and that matters and so it wasn't just a
personal choice you were actually being

5842
01:52:07,609 --> 01:52:07,619
personal choice you were actually being
 

5843
01:52:07,619 --> 01:52:10,129
personal choice you were actually being
a good citizen when you decided to run

5844
01:52:10,129 --> 01:52:10,139
a good citizen when you decided to run
 

5845
01:52:10,139 --> 01:52:11,930
a good citizen when you decided to run
whatever risk you you were going to run

5846
01:52:11,930 --> 01:52:11,940
whatever risk you you were going to run
 

5847
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:15,350
whatever risk you you were going to run
to get vaccinated because there are

5848
01:52:15,350 --> 01:52:15,360
to get vaccinated because there are
 

5849
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:16,850
to get vaccinated because there are
people in our society who can't actually

5850
01:52:16,850 --> 01:52:16,860
people in our society who can't actually
 

5851
01:52:16,860 --> 01:52:18,350
people in our society who can't actually
can't get vaccinated I mean I know

5852
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:18,360
can't get vaccinated I mean I know
 

5853
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:19,669
can't get vaccinated I mean I know
people who can't take any vaccines

5854
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:19,679
people who can't take any vaccines
 

5855
01:52:19,679 --> 01:52:21,530
people who can't take any vaccines
they're so they're so allergic to I mean

5856
01:52:21,530 --> 01:52:21,540
they're so they're so allergic to I mean
 

5857
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:24,950
they're so they're so allergic to I mean
they they in their own person seem to

5858
01:52:24,950 --> 01:52:24,960
they they in their own person seem to
 

5859
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,810
they they in their own person seem to
justify all of the fears of the

5860
01:52:26,810 --> 01:52:26,820
justify all of the fears of the
 

5861
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,189
justify all of the fears of the
anti-vaxx cult I mean it's like they're

5862
01:52:28,189 --> 01:52:28,199
anti-vaxx cult I mean it's like they're
 

5863
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:30,470
anti-vaxx cult I mean it's like they're
the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr

5864
01:52:30,470 --> 01:52:30,480
the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr
 

5865
01:52:30,480 --> 01:52:32,450
the kind of person who Robert Kennedy Jr
can point to and say see vaccines are

5866
01:52:32,450 --> 01:52:32,460
can point to and say see vaccines are
 

5867
01:52:32,460 --> 01:52:34,970
can point to and say see vaccines are
will [\h__\h] kill you right because

01:52:34,970 --> 01:52:34,980
will [\h__\h] kill you right because
 

5869
01:52:34,980 --> 01:52:37,189
will [\h__\h] kill you right because
because of the experience and they and

5870
01:52:37,189 --> 01:52:37,199
because of the experience and they and
 

5871
01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:38,810
because of the experience and they and
were still they I know people who have

5872
01:52:38,810 --> 01:52:38,820
were still they I know people who have
 

5873
01:52:38,820 --> 01:52:42,169
were still they I know people who have
kids who fit that description right so

5874
01:52:42,169 --> 01:52:42,179
kids who fit that description right so
 

5875
01:52:42,179 --> 01:52:43,850
kids who fit that description right so
um we should all feel a civic

5876
01:52:43,850 --> 01:52:43,860
um we should all feel a civic
 

5877
01:52:43,860 --> 01:52:47,709
um we should all feel a civic
responsibility to be vaccinated against

5878
01:52:47,709 --> 01:52:47,719
responsibility to be vaccinated against
 

5879
01:52:47,719 --> 01:52:50,930
responsibility to be vaccinated against
egregiously awful and transmissible

5880
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:50,940
egregiously awful and transmissible
 

5881
01:52:50,940 --> 01:52:53,270
egregiously awful and transmissible
diseases for which we have relatively

5882
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:53,280
diseases for which we have relatively
 

5883
01:52:53,280 --> 01:52:54,770
diseases for which we have relatively
safe vaccines

5884
01:52:54,770 --> 01:52:54,780
safe vaccines
 

5885
01:52:54,780 --> 01:52:56,930
safe vaccines
to keep those sorts of people safe and

5886
01:52:56,930 --> 01:52:56,940
to keep those sorts of people safe and
 

5887
01:52:56,940 --> 01:52:58,310
to keep those sorts of people safe and
there was a period of time when it was

5888
01:52:58,310 --> 01:52:58,320
there was a period of time when it was
 

5889
01:52:58,320 --> 01:52:59,450
there was a period of time when it was
thought that the vaccine could stop

5890
01:52:59,450 --> 01:52:59,460
thought that the vaccine could stop
 

5891
01:52:59,460 --> 01:53:01,550
thought that the vaccine could stop
transmission yes and so again all of

5892
01:53:01,550 --> 01:53:01,560
transmission yes and so again all of
 

5893
01:53:01,560 --> 01:53:04,910
transmission yes and so again all of
this is it has begun to shift

5894
01:53:04,910 --> 01:53:04,920
this is it has begun to shift
 

5895
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:06,590
this is it has begun to shift
um I don't think it has shifted as much

5896
01:53:06,590 --> 01:53:06,600
um I don't think it has shifted as much
 

5897
01:53:06,600 --> 01:53:08,870
um I don't think it has shifted as much
as Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted

5898
01:53:08,870 --> 01:53:08,880
as Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted
 

5899
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,530
as Brett Weinstein thinks it's shifted
but yes there are safety concerns around

5900
01:53:12,530 --> 01:53:12,540
but yes there are safety concerns around
 

5901
01:53:12,540 --> 01:53:14,689
but yes there are safety concerns around
the MRNA vaccines

5902
01:53:14,689 --> 01:53:14,699
the MRNA vaccines
 

5903
01:53:14,699 --> 01:53:17,930
the MRNA vaccines
especially for young men right as far as

5904
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:17,940
especially for young men right as far as
 

5905
01:53:17,940 --> 01:53:20,510
especially for young men right as far as
I know that's the that's the purview of

5906
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:20,520
I know that's the that's the purview of
 

5907
01:53:20,520 --> 01:53:24,590
I know that's the that's the purview of
the of of actual heightened concern

5908
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:24,600
the of of actual heightened concern
 

5909
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,990
the of of actual heightened concern
um but also

5910
01:53:26,990 --> 01:53:27,000
um but also
 

5911
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,149
um but also
there's there's now a lot of natural

5912
01:53:29,149 --> 01:53:29,159
there's there's now a lot of natural
 

5913
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:30,830
there's there's now a lot of natural
immunity out there a lot of basically

5914
01:53:30,830 --> 01:53:30,840
immunity out there a lot of basically
 

5915
01:53:30,840 --> 01:53:32,810
immunity out there a lot of basically
everyone who was going to get vaccinated

5916
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:32,820
everyone who was going to get vaccinated
 

5917
01:53:32,820 --> 01:53:35,149
everyone who was going to get vaccinated
has gotten vaccinated the virus has

5918
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:35,159
has gotten vaccinated the virus has
 

5919
01:53:35,159 --> 01:53:37,850
has gotten vaccinated the virus has
evolved to the point in in in this

5920
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:37,860
evolved to the point in in in this
 

5921
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,410
evolved to the point in in in this
context where

5922
01:53:39,410 --> 01:53:39,420
context where
 

5923
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:43,550
context where
it seems less uh dangerous you know

5924
01:53:43,550 --> 01:53:43,560
it seems less uh dangerous you know
 

5925
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:46,370
it seems less uh dangerous you know
again I don't I I I'm going more on on

5926
01:53:46,370 --> 01:53:46,380
again I don't I I I'm going more on on
 

5927
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:49,129
again I don't I I I'm going more on on
the Siemens than on on Research that

5928
01:53:49,129 --> 01:53:49,139
the Siemens than on on Research that
 

5929
01:53:49,139 --> 01:53:50,990
the Siemens than on on Research that
I've done it at this point but I'm

5930
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:51,000
I've done it at this point but I'm
 

5931
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,010
I've done it at this point but I'm
certainly less worried about getting

5932
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:52,020
certainly less worried about getting
 

5933
01:53:52,020 --> 01:53:53,689
certainly less worried about getting
covet I've had it once I've been

5934
01:53:53,689 --> 01:53:53,699
covet I've had it once I've been
 

5935
01:53:53,699 --> 01:53:56,090
covet I've had it once I've been
vaccinated I feel like it's like so you

5936
01:53:56,090 --> 01:53:56,100
vaccinated I feel like it's like so you
 

5937
01:53:56,100 --> 01:53:57,890
vaccinated I feel like it's like so you
ask me now how do I feel about getting

5938
01:53:57,890 --> 01:53:57,900
ask me now how do I feel about getting
 

5939
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:00,050
ask me now how do I feel about getting
the next booster

5940
01:54:00,050 --> 01:54:00,060
the next booster
 

5941
01:54:00,060 --> 01:54:01,609
the next booster
I don't know that I'm going to get the

5942
01:54:01,609 --> 01:54:01,619
I don't know that I'm going to get the
 

5943
01:54:01,619 --> 01:54:03,950
I don't know that I'm going to get the
next booster right so so I I was

5944
01:54:03,950 --> 01:54:03,960
next booster right so so I I was
 

5945
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:06,830
next booster right so so I I was
somebody who was waiting in line at four

5946
01:54:06,830 --> 01:54:06,840
somebody who was waiting in line at four
 

5947
01:54:06,840 --> 01:54:09,050
somebody who was waiting in line at four
in the morning you know hoping to get

5948
01:54:09,050 --> 01:54:09,060
in the morning you know hoping to get
 

5949
01:54:09,060 --> 01:54:11,510
in the morning you know hoping to get
get a some overflow vaccine when it was

5950
01:54:11,510 --> 01:54:11,520
get a some overflow vaccine when it was
 

5951
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:12,649
get a some overflow vaccine when it was
first available

5952
01:54:12,649 --> 01:54:12,659
first available
 

5953
01:54:12,659 --> 01:54:15,290
first available
and I that was at that point given what

5954
01:54:15,290 --> 01:54:15,300
and I that was at that point given what
 

5955
01:54:15,300 --> 01:54:16,430
and I that was at that point given what
we knew

5956
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:16,440
we knew
 

5957
01:54:16,440 --> 01:54:19,010
we knew
or given what I thought I knew based on

5958
01:54:19,010 --> 01:54:19,020
or given what I thought I knew based on
 

5959
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:20,870
or given what I thought I knew based on
the best sources I could consult and

5960
01:54:20,870 --> 01:54:20,880
the best sources I could consult and

based on
 

5963
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:24,410
based on
you know based on anecdotes that were

5964
01:54:24,410 --> 01:54:24,420
you know based on anecdotes that were
 

5965
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:26,510
you know based on anecdotes that were
too Vivid to ignore you know both data

5966
01:54:26,510 --> 01:54:26,520
too Vivid to ignore you know both data
 

5967
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:29,450
too Vivid to ignore you know both data
and and personal experience

5968
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:29,460
and and personal experience
 

5969
01:54:29,460 --> 01:54:30,169
and and personal experience
um

5970
01:54:30,169 --> 01:54:30,179
um
 

5971
01:54:30,179 --> 01:54:32,510
um
it was totally rational for me to to

5972
01:54:32,510 --> 01:54:32,520
it was totally rational for me to to
 

5973
01:54:32,520 --> 01:54:34,609
it was totally rational for me to to
want to get that vaccine as as soon as I

5974
01:54:34,609 --> 01:54:34,619
want to get that vaccine as as soon as I
 

5975
01:54:34,619 --> 01:54:35,390
want to get that vaccine as as soon as I
could

5976
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:35,400
could
 

5977
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:37,430
could
and now I think it's totally rational

5978
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:37,440
and now I think it's totally rational
 

5979
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:40,490
and now I think it's totally rational
for me to to do a a different kind of

5980
01:54:40,490 --> 01:54:40,500
for me to to do a a different kind of

you know like how many of the how many
 

5987
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:49,010
you know like how many of the how many
of these boosters am I going to get for

5988

is the MRNA vaccine for a man of my age
right and do I need to be worried about

5994
01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:57,420
right and do I need to be worried about
 

5995
01:54:57,420 --> 01:54:59,689
right and do I need to be worried about
myocarditis for you know

5996
01:54:59,689 --> 01:54:59,699
myocarditis for you know
 

5997
01:54:59,699 --> 01:55:01,490
myocarditis for you know
all of that is completely rational to

5998

all of that is completely rational to
 

5999
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:02,510
all of that is completely rational to
talk about now

6000
01:55:02,510 --> 01:55:02,520

talk about now
my concern is that

6002
01:55:05,090 --> 01:55:05,100
my concern is that
 

6003
01:55:05,100 --> 01:55:08,090
my concern is that
at every point along the way

01:55:08,090 --> 01:55:08,100
at every point along the way
 

6005

Weinstein was the wrong person and
 

6009
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:14,689
Weinstein was the wrong person and
there's many other people I could add to

6010

there's many other people I could add to
 

6011
01:55:14,699 --> 01:55:17,810
there's many other people I could add to
this list to have strong opinions about

6012
01:55:17,810 --> 01:55:17,820
this list to have strong opinions about
 

6013
01:55:17,820 --> 01:55:19,970
this list to have strong opinions about
any of this stuff I just disagree with

that I think
 

6017
01:55:21,360 --> 01:55:25,310
that I think
yes in theory I agree 100 but I feel

6018
01:55:25,310 --> 01:55:25,320
yes in theory I agree 100 but I feel
 

6019
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:28,070
yes in theory I agree 100 but I feel
like experts failed at communicating not

like experts failed at communicating not
 

6021
01:55:28,080 --> 01:55:30,350

at doing they did I I and I just feel
like you and Brett Weinstein actually

6024
01:55:33,470 --> 01:55:33,480
like you and Brett Weinstein actually
 

6025
01:55:33,480 --> 01:55:36,229
like you and Brett Weinstein actually
have the tools with the internet given

6026

have the tools with the internet given
 

6027
01:55:36,239 --> 01:55:38,689
have the tools with the internet given
the engine you have in your brain of

the engine you have in your brain of
 

6029
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:41,209
the engine you have in your brain of

thinking for months at a time deeply
 

6031
01:55:41,219 --> 01:55:44,030
thinking for months at a time deeply
about the problems that face our world

6032
01:55:44,030 --> 01:55:44,040
about the problems that face our world
 

6033
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:46,189
about the problems that face our world
that you actually have the tools to do

6034
01:55:46,189 --> 01:55:46,199
that you actually have the tools to do
 

6035
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:47,930
that you actually have the tools to do
pretty good thinking here it's the

6036
01:55:47,930 --> 01:55:47,940
pretty good thinking here it's the
 

6037
01:55:47,940 --> 01:55:49,910
pretty good thinking here it's the
problem I have with that but there would

6038
01:55:49,910 --> 01:55:49,920
problem I have with that but there would
 

6039
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:51,950
problem I have with that but there would
be deference to experts and pseudo

6040
01:55:51,950 --> 01:55:51,960
be deference to experts and pseudo
 

6041
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:53,629
be deference to experts and pseudo
experts behind all of that well the

6042
01:55:53,629 --> 01:55:53,639
experts behind all of that well the
 

6043
01:55:53,639 --> 01:55:54,890
experts behind all of that well the
papers you would stand on the shoulders

6044
01:55:54,890 --> 01:55:54,900
papers you would stand on the shoulders
 

6045
01:55:54,900 --> 01:55:56,390
papers you would stand on the shoulders
of giants but you can surf those

6046
01:55:56,390 --> 01:55:56,400
of giants but you can surf those
 

6047
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,950

shoulders better than the Giants

6048
01:55:57,950 --> 01:55:57,960
shoulders better than the Giants
 

6049
01:55:57,960 --> 01:55:59,209
shoulders better than the Giants
themselves but I knew we were going to

6050
01:55:59,209 --> 01:55:59,219
themselves but I knew we were going to
 

6051
01:55:59,219 --> 01:56:01,490
themselves but I knew we were going to
disagree about that like I I I saw his

6052
01:56:01,490 --> 01:56:01,500
disagree about that like I I I saw his
 

6053
01:56:01,500 --> 01:56:02,870
disagree about that like I I I saw his
podcast where he brought on these

6054
01:56:02,870 --> 01:56:02,880
podcast where he brought on these
 

6055
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:06,410
podcast where he brought on these
experts who had many of them had the

6056
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:06,420
experts who had many of them had the
 

6057
01:56:06,420 --> 01:56:09,290
experts who had many of them had the
right credentials but for a variety of

6058
01:56:09,290 --> 01:56:09,300
right credentials but for a variety of
 

6059
01:56:09,300 --> 01:56:11,870
right credentials but for a variety of
reasons they didn't pass the smell test

6060
01:56:11,870 --> 01:56:11,880
reasons they didn't pass the smell test
 

6061
01:56:11,880 --> 01:56:14,330
reasons they didn't pass the smell test
for Me Maybe One larger problem this

6062
01:56:14,330 --> 01:56:14,340
for Me Maybe One larger problem this
 

6063
01:56:14,340 --> 01:56:17,149
for Me Maybe One larger problem this
goes back to the the problem of of how

6064
01:56:17,149 --> 01:56:17,159
goes back to the the problem of of how
 

6065
01:56:17,159 --> 01:56:19,550
goes back to the the problem of of how
we rely on Authority in science is that

6066
01:56:19,550 --> 01:56:19,560
we rely on Authority in science is that
 

6067
01:56:19,560 --> 01:56:22,910
we rely on Authority in science is that
you can always find a PhD or an MD

01:58:12,530 --> 01:58:12,540
climate science I mean this this old uh
 

6171
01:58:12,540 --> 01:58:14,870
climate science I mean this this old uh
it's received as a Canard for for in

6172
01:58:14,870 --> 01:58:14,880
it's received as a Canard for for in
 

6173

half of our society now but the claim

6174
01:58:17,209 --> 01:58:17,219
half of our society now but the claim
 

6175
01:58:17,219 --> 01:58:19,609
half of our society now but the claim
that 97 of climate scientists agree that

6176
01:58:19,609 --> 01:58:19,619
that 97 of climate scientists agree that
 

6177
01:58:19,619 --> 01:58:22,129
that 97 of climate scientists agree that
human cause climate change is a thing

6178
01:58:22,129 --> 01:58:22,139
human cause climate change is a thing
 

6179
01:58:22,139 --> 01:58:25,910
human cause climate change is a thing
right so do you go with the 97 most of

6180
01:58:25,910 --> 01:58:25,920
right so do you go with the 97 most of
 

6181
01:58:25,920 --> 01:58:27,470
right so do you go with the 97 most of
the time or do you go with the three

6182
01:58:27,470 --> 01:58:27,480
the time or do you go with the three
 

6183
01:58:27,480 --> 01:58:30,229
the time or do you go with the three
percent most of the time it's obvious

6184
01:58:30,229 --> 01:58:30,239
percent most of the time it's obvious
 

6185
01:58:30,239 --> 01:58:32,629
percent most of the time it's obvious
you go with the 97 most of the time for

6186
01:58:32,629 --> 01:58:32,639
you go with the 97 most of the time for
 

6187
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:34,729
you go with the 97 most of the time for
anything that matters it's not to say

6188
01:58:34,729 --> 01:58:34,739
anything that matters it's not to say
 

6189
01:58:34,739 --> 01:58:36,350
anything that matters it's not to say
that the three percent are always wrong

6190
01:58:36,350 --> 01:58:36,360
that the three percent are always wrong
 

6191
01:58:36,360 --> 01:58:39,169
that the three percent are always wrong
again the the there are things get

6192
01:58:39,169 --> 01:58:39,179
again the the there are things get
 

6193
01:58:39,179 --> 01:58:40,609
again the the there are things get
overturned and yes

6194
01:58:40,609 --> 01:58:40,619
overturned and yes
 

6195
01:58:40,619 --> 01:58:42,830

as you say I've spent much more time

6196
01:58:42,830 --> 01:58:42,840
as you say I've spent much more time
 

6197
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:44,330
as you say I've spent much more time
worrying about this on my podcast than

6198
01:58:44,330 --> 01:58:44,340
worrying about this on my podcast than

institutions have lost Trust
 

6203
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:54,649

for good reason right and and it's it

6204
01:58:54,649 --> 01:58:54,659
for good reason right and and it's it
 

6205
01:58:54,659 --> 01:58:57,950
for good reason right and and it's it
it's an open question whether

01:58:57,950 --> 01:58:57,960
it's an open question whether
 

6207
01:58:57,960 --> 01:59:01,129
it's an open question whether
we can actually get things done with

6208
01:59:01,129 --> 01:59:01,139
we can actually get things done with
 

6209
01:59:01,139 --> 01:59:04,030
we can actually get things done with
this level of transparency and and

6210
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:04,040
this level of transparency and and
 

6211
01:59:04,040 --> 01:59:05,870
this level of transparency and and
pseudo-transparency given our

01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:05,880
pseudo-transparency given our
 

6213
01:59:05,880 --> 01:59:08,570
pseudo-transparency given our
information ecosystems like can we fight

6214
01:59:08,570 --> 01:59:08,580
information ecosystems like can we fight
 

6215
01:59:08,580 --> 01:59:09,770
information ecosystems like can we fight
a war

panopticon of just you know everyone's a

6238
01:59:36,050 --> 01:59:36,060
panopticon of just you know everyone's a
 

6239
01:59:36,060 --> 01:59:37,970
panopticon of just you know everyone's a
journalist right everyone's a scientist

6240
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:37,980
journalist right everyone's a scientist
 

6241
01:59:37,980 --> 01:59:39,830
journalist right everyone's a scientist
Everyone's an expert everyone's got

6242
01:59:39,830 --> 01:59:39,840
Everyone's an expert everyone's got
 

6243
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:43,609
Everyone's an expert everyone's got
direct contact with the facts or or some

6244
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:43,619
direct contact with the facts or or some
 

6245
01:59:43,619 --> 01:59:45,830
direct contact with the facts or or some
or a semblance of the facts I don't know

6246
01:59:45,830 --> 01:59:45,840
or a semblance of the facts I don't know
 

6247
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:48,169
or a semblance of the facts I don't know
I think yes and I think voices like

6248
01:59:48,169 --> 01:59:48,179
I think yes and I think voices like
 

6249
01:59:48,179 --> 01:59:49,910
I think yes and I think voices like
yours are exceptionally important and I

6250
01:59:49,910 --> 01:59:49,920
yours are exceptionally important and I
 

6251
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:51,890
yours are exceptionally important and I
think there's certain signals you send

6252
01:59:51,890 --> 01:59:51,900
think there's certain signals you send
 

6253
01:59:51,900 --> 01:59:54,169
think there's certain signals you send
in your ability to steal me on the other

6254
01:59:54,169 --> 01:59:54,179
in your ability to steal me on the other
 

6255
01:59:54,179 --> 01:59:57,350
in your ability to steal me on the other
side in your empathy essentially

6256
01:59:57,350 --> 01:59:57,360
side in your empathy essentially
 

6257
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:00,770
side in your empathy essentially
so that's the fight that's the mechanism

6258
02:00:00,770 --> 02:00:00,780
so that's the fight that's the mechanism
 

6259
02:00:00,780 --> 02:00:04,609
so that's the fight that's the mechanism
by which you resist uh

6260
02:00:04,609 --> 02:00:04,619
by which you resist uh
 

6261
02:00:04,619 --> 02:00:07,790
by which you resist uh
the dogmatism of these this binary

6262
02:00:07,790 --> 02:00:07,800
the dogmatism of these this binary
 

6263
02:00:07,800 --> 02:00:10,669
the dogmatism of these this binary
thinking and then if you become a

6264
02:00:10,669 --> 02:00:10,679
thinking and then if you become a
 

6265
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:13,070
thinking and then if you become a
trusted person that's able to consider

6266
02:00:13,070 --> 02:00:13,080
trusted person that's able to consider
 

6267
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:15,050
trusted person that's able to consider
the other side then people will listen

6268
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:15,060
the other side then people will listen
 

6269
02:00:15,060 --> 02:00:17,930
the other side then people will listen
to you as as the aggregators the

6270
02:00:17,930 --> 02:00:17,940
to you as as the aggregators the
 

6271
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:19,729
to you as as the aggregators the
communicator of expertise because the

6272
02:00:19,729 --> 02:00:19,739

6273
02:00:19,739 --> 02:00:21,950

the communication that's out there

6302
02:00:51,589 --> 02:00:51,599
the communication that's out there
 

6303
02:00:51,599 --> 02:00:54,290
the communication that's out there
and actually aggregating it together and

6304
02:00:54,290 --> 02:00:54,300
and actually aggregating it together and
 

6305
02:00:54,300 --> 02:00:56,270
and actually aggregating it together and
be able to say this is actually what's

6306
02:00:56,270 --> 02:00:56,280
be able to say this is actually what's
 

6307
02:00:56,280 --> 02:00:59,330
be able to say this is actually what's
most likely the truth and also some of

6308
02:00:59,330 --> 02:00:59,340
most likely the truth and also some of
 

6309
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:02,030
most likely the truth and also some of
that has to do with humility

6310
02:01:02,030 --> 02:01:02,040
that has to do with humility
 

6311
02:01:02,040 --> 02:01:04,070
that has to do with humility
epistemic humility knowing that you

6312
02:01:04,070 --> 02:01:04,080
epistemic humility knowing that you
 

6313
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:05,990
epistemic humility knowing that you
can't really know for sure

6314
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:06,000
can't really know for sure
 

6315
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,430
can't really know for sure
just like with depression you can't

6316
02:01:07,430 --> 02:01:07,440
just like with depression you can't
 

6317
02:01:07,440 --> 02:01:09,649
just like with depression you can't
really know for sure yeah where is the

6318
02:01:09,649 --> 02:01:09,659
really know for sure yeah where is the
 

6319
02:01:09,659 --> 02:01:11,330
really know for sure yeah where is the
I'm not seeing those Communications

6320
02:01:11,330 --> 02:01:11,340
I'm not seeing those Communications
 

6321
02:01:11,340 --> 02:01:13,790
I'm not seeing those Communications
being effectively done even still today

6322

6329
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:22,370
Target and and some of it I mean it's
complicated some of it's a

02:01:22,370 --> 02:01:22,380
complicated some of it's a
 

6331
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:23,950

6762
02:10:03,169 --> 02:10:03,179
I think he's either obviously in the
 

6763
02:10:03,179 --> 02:10:05,510
I think he's either obviously in the
midst of a mental health crisis

6764
02:10:05,510 --> 02:10:05,520
midst of a mental health crisis
 

6765
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:08,570
midst of a mental health crisis
or he's a colossal [\h__\h]

6766
02:10:08,570 --> 02:10:08,580
or he's a colossal [\h__\h]
 

6767
02:10:08,580 --> 02:10:10,010
or he's a colossal [\h__\h]
or both I mean there's actually those

6768
02:10:10,010 --> 02:10:10,020
or both I mean there's actually those
 

6769
02:10:10,020 --> 02:10:11,450
or both I mean there's actually those
aren't mutually exclusive so one of

6770
02:10:11,450 --> 02:10:11,460
aren't mutually exclusive so one of
 

6771
02:10:11,460 --> 02:10:13,669
aren't mutually exclusive so one of
three possibilities he's either mentally

6772
02:10:13,669 --> 02:10:13,679
three possibilities he's either mentally
 

6773
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:16,609
three possibilities he's either mentally
ill he's an [\h__\h] or he's a he's

02:10:16,619 --> 02:10:18,350
ill he's an [\h__\h] or he's a he's
mentally ill and an [\h__\h] I think all

6776
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:18,360
mentally ill and an [\h__\h] I think all
 

6777
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:19,669
mentally ill and an [\h__\h] I think all
three of those possibilities are

6778
02:10:19,669 --> 02:10:19,679
three of those possibilities are
 

6779
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:21,589
three of those possibilities are
possible for the both of us as well no

diminishes it I don't know so let me say
just a couple of things so one my belief

likelihood of that it does might it
 

7147
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:14,330
likelihood of that it does might it
might on the surface look like it's

7148
02:17:14,330 --> 02:17:14,340

7149
02:17:14,340 --> 02:17:16,070
might on the surface look like it's
increasing it but that's simply because

well yeah but until it doesn't like if
because you can

7438
02:22:54,230 --> 02:22:54,240

far right you could like it can be
 

7443
02:22:59,580 --> 02:23:01,130

02:24:39,359 --> 02:24:42,349
them to signal boost their
their views you're just trying to if

7534
02:24:42,349 --> 02:24:42,359
their views you're just trying to if
 

7535
02:24:42,359 --> 02:24:44,389
their views you're just trying to if
they're sufficiently evil you can go

7536
02:24:44,389 --> 02:24:44,399
they're sufficiently evil you can go
 

7537
02:24:44,399 --> 02:24:46,490
they're sufficiently evil you can go
into it very much as an anthropologist

7538
02:24:46,490 --> 02:24:46,500
into it very much as an anthropologist
 

7539
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:48,349
into it very much as an anthropologist
would

7540
02:24:48,349 --> 02:24:48,359
would
 

7541
02:24:48,359 --> 02:24:50,809
would
uh just you just want to understand the

7542
02:24:50,809 --> 02:24:50,819
uh just you just want to understand the
 

7543
02:24:50,819 --> 02:24:52,190
uh just you just want to understand the
nature of evil right you just want to

7544
02:24:52,190 --> 02:24:52,200
nature of evil right you just want to
 

7545
02:24:52,200 --> 02:24:53,990
nature of evil right you just want to
understand this phenomenon like how is

7546
02:24:53,990 --> 02:24:54,000
understand this phenomenon like how is
 

7547
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:57,830
understand this phenomenon like how is
this person who they are right

7548
02:24:57,830 --> 02:24:57,840
this person who they are right
 

7549
02:24:57,840 --> 02:25:00,349
this person who they are right
um and that strikes me as a

7550
02:25:00,349 --> 02:25:00,359
um and that strikes me as a
 

7551
02:25:00,359 --> 02:25:03,349
um and that strikes me as a
intellectually interesting and

7552
02:25:03,349 --> 02:25:03,359
intellectually interesting and
 

7553
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:05,990
intellectually interesting and
and morally necessary thing to do right

7554
02:25:05,990 --> 02:25:06,000
and morally necessary thing to do right
 

7555
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:08,090
and morally necessary thing to do right
so yes you I think you always interview

7556
02:25:08,090 --> 02:25:08,100
so yes you I think you always interview
 

7557
02:25:08,100 --> 02:25:17,110
so yes you I think you always interview
Hitler

7558
02:25:17,110 --> 02:25:17,120

 

7559
02:25:17,120 --> 02:25:20,590

really happening

7560
02:25:20,590 --> 02:25:20,600

 

7561
02:25:20,600 --> 02:25:22,969

if you're on the cusp of it where it's

7562
02:25:22,969 --> 02:25:22,979
if you're on the cusp of it where it's
 

7563
02:25:22,979 --> 02:25:25,190
if you're on the cusp of it where it's
just he's someone who's gaining power

7564
02:25:25,190 --> 02:25:25,200
just he's someone who's gaining power
 

7565
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:26,570
just he's someone who's gaining power
and you don't want to you don't want to

7566
02:25:26,570 --> 02:25:26,580
and you don't want to you don't want to
 

7567
02:25:26,580 --> 02:25:28,790
and you don't want to you don't want to
help facilitate that

7568
02:25:28,790 --> 02:25:28,800
help facilitate that
 

7569
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,290
help facilitate that
um then there's a question of whether

7570
02:25:30,290 --> 02:25:30,300
um then there's a question of whether
 

7571
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:32,929
um then there's a question of whether
you can you can undermine him in while

7572
02:25:32,929 --> 02:25:32,939
you can you can undermine him in while
 

7573
02:25:32,939 --> 02:25:34,490
you can you can undermine him in while
pushing back against him in that

7574
02:25:34,490 --> 02:25:34,500
pushing back against him in that
 

7575
02:25:34,500 --> 02:25:35,750
pushing back against him in that
interview right so there are people I

7576
02:25:35,750 --> 02:25:35,760
interview right so there are people I
 

7577
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:38,150
interview right so there are people I
wouldn't talk to just because I don't

7578
02:25:38,150 --> 02:25:38,160
wouldn't talk to just because I don't
 

7579
02:25:38,160 --> 02:25:39,830
wouldn't talk to just because I don't
want to give them oxygen and I don't

7580
02:25:39,830 --> 02:25:39,840
want to give them oxygen and I don't
 

7581
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:42,309
want to give them oxygen and I don't
think that in the in the context of my

7582
02:25:42,309 --> 02:25:42,319
think that in the in the context of my
 

7583
02:25:42,319 --> 02:25:44,750
think that in the in the context of my
interviewing them I'm going to be able

7584
02:25:44,750 --> 02:25:44,760
interviewing them I'm going to be able
 

7585
02:25:44,760 --> 02:25:46,849
interviewing them I'm going to be able
to to take the wind out of their sails

7586
02:25:46,849 --> 02:25:46,859
to to take the wind out of their sails
 

7587
02:25:46,859 --> 02:25:49,010
to to take the wind out of their sails
at all right so it's like for whatever

7588
02:25:49,010 --> 02:25:49,020
at all right so it's like for whatever
 

7589
02:25:49,020 --> 02:25:51,950
at all right so it's like for whatever
either because in asymmetric Advantage

7590
02:25:51,950 --> 02:25:51,960
either because in asymmetric Advantage
 

7591
02:25:51,960 --> 02:25:53,990
either because in asymmetric Advantage
because I just know that they can

7592
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:54,000
because I just know that they can
 

7593
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,870
because I just know that they can
do something that they they within the

7594
02:25:56,870 --> 02:25:56,880
do something that they they within the
 

7595
02:25:56,880 --> 02:25:59,929
do something that they they within the
span of an hour that I can't that I

7596
02:25:59,929 --> 02:25:59,939
span of an hour that I can't that I
 

7597
02:25:59,939 --> 02:26:01,670
span of an hour that I can't that I
can't correct for sure you know is it's

7598
02:26:01,670 --> 02:26:01,680
can't correct for sure you know is it's
 

7599
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:03,469
can't correct for sure you know is it's
like they can they can light many small

7600
02:26:03,469 --> 02:26:03,479
like they can they can light many small
 

7601
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:04,910
like they can they can light many small
fires and it just takes too much time to

7602
02:26:04,910 --> 02:26:04,920
fires and it just takes too much time to
 

7603
02:26:04,920 --> 02:26:06,050
fires and it just takes too much time to
put them in that's more like on the

7604
02:26:06,050 --> 02:26:06,060
put them in that's more like on the
 

7605
02:26:06,060 --> 02:26:07,550
put them in that's more like on the
topic of vaccines for example having a

7606
02:26:07,550 --> 02:26:07,560
topic of vaccines for example having a
 

7607
02:26:07,560 --> 02:26:09,469
topic of vaccines for example having a
debate on the efficacy of vaccines yeah

7608
02:26:09,469 --> 02:26:09,479
debate on the efficacy of vaccines yeah
 

7609
02:26:09,479 --> 02:26:10,910
debate on the efficacy of vaccines yeah
okay it's not that I don't think

7610
02:26:10,910 --> 02:26:10,920
okay it's not that I don't think
 

7611
02:26:10,920 --> 02:26:12,889
okay it's not that I don't think
sunlight is usually the best

7612
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:12,899
sunlight is usually the best
 

7613
02:26:12,899 --> 02:26:15,410
sunlight is usually the best
disinfectant I think it is you know even

7614
02:26:15,410 --> 02:26:15,420
disinfectant I think it is you know even
 

7615
02:26:15,420 --> 02:26:17,750
disinfectant I think it is you know even
these asymmetries aside I mean there are

7616
02:26:17,750 --> 02:26:17,760
these asymmetries aside I mean there are
 

7617
02:26:17,760 --> 02:26:21,349
these asymmetries aside I mean there are
there it is true that a person can

7618
02:26:21,349 --> 02:26:21,359
there it is true that a person can
 

7619
02:26:21,359 --> 02:26:23,389
there it is true that a person can
always make a mess faster than you can

7620
02:26:23,389 --> 02:26:23,399
always make a mess faster than you can
 

7621
02:26:23,399 --> 02:26:25,070
always make a mess faster than you can
clean it up right but still their

7622
02:26:25,070 --> 02:26:25,080
clean it up right but still their
 

7623
02:26:25,080 --> 02:26:26,929
clean it up right but still their
debates worth having even given that

7624
02:26:26,929 --> 02:26:26,939
debates worth having even given that
 

7625
02:26:26,939 --> 02:26:28,610
debates worth having even given that
limitation

7626
02:26:28,610 --> 02:26:28,620
limitation
 

7627
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:29,990
limitation
um and they're the right people to have

7865
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:00,590
uh these just myths or or or is there
really a Continuum of of insight to be

7866
02:31:00,590 --> 02:31:00,600
really a Continuum of of insight to be
 

7867
02:31:00,600 --> 02:31:02,809
really a Continuum of of insight to be
had here that is interesting so I spent

7868
02:31:02,809 --> 02:31:02,819
had here that is interesting so I spent
 

7869
02:31:02,819 --> 02:31:06,050
had here that is interesting so I spent
a lot of time on that question

7870
02:31:06,050 --> 02:31:06,060
a lot of time on that question
 

7871
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:07,969
a lot of time on that question
through my 20 the full decade in my 20s

7872
02:31:07,969 --> 02:31:07,979
through my 20 the full decade in my 20s
 

7873
02:31:07,979 --> 02:31:09,830
through my 20 the full decade in my 20s
and that was launched in part by 9 11

7874
02:31:09,830 --> 02:31:09,840
and that was launched in part by 9 11
 

7875
02:31:09,840 --> 02:31:13,070
and that was launched in part by 9 11
truth or no but then when 9 11 happened

7876
02:31:13,070 --> 02:31:13,080
truth or no but then when 9 11 happened
 

7877
02:31:13,080 --> 02:31:14,870
truth or no but then when 9 11 happened
I had spent all this time you know

7878
02:31:14,870 --> 02:31:14,880
I had spent all this time you know
 

7879
02:31:14,880 --> 02:31:17,230
I had spent all this time you know
reading religious books understanding

7880
02:31:17,230 --> 02:31:17,240
reading religious books understanding
 

7881
02:31:17,240 --> 02:31:18,950
reading religious books understanding
empathically understanding the

7882
02:31:18,950 --> 02:31:18,960
empathically understanding the
 

7883
02:31:18,960 --> 02:31:21,170
empathically understanding the
motivations of religious people right

7884
02:31:21,170 --> 02:31:21,180
motivations of religious people right
 

7885
02:31:21,180 --> 02:31:24,110
motivations of religious people right
knowing just how fully certain people

7886
02:31:24,110 --> 02:31:24,120
knowing just how fully certain people
 

7887
02:31:24,120 --> 02:31:25,670
knowing just how fully certain people
believe what they say they believe right

7888
02:31:25,670 --> 02:31:25,680
believe what they say they believe right
 

7889
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:27,889
believe what they say they believe right
so I took religious convictions very

7890
02:31:27,889 --> 02:31:27,899
so I took religious convictions very
 

7891
02:31:27,899 --> 02:31:29,210
so I took religious convictions very
seriously

7892
02:31:29,210 --> 02:31:29,220
seriously
 

7893
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:30,710
seriously
and then people started flying planes

7894
02:31:30,710 --> 02:31:30,720
and then people started flying planes
 

7895
02:31:30,720 --> 02:31:33,290
and then people started flying planes
into our buildings and I so I knew that

7896
02:31:33,290 --> 02:31:33,300
into our buildings and I so I knew that
 

7897
02:31:33,300 --> 02:31:35,030
into our buildings and I so I knew that
there was something to be said about

7898
02:31:35,030 --> 02:31:35,040
there was something to be said about
 

7899
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,190
there was something to be said about
allegedly the the core doctrines of

7900
02:31:37,190 --> 02:31:37,200
allegedly the the core doctrines of
 

7901
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:38,809
allegedly the the core doctrines of
Islam exactly

7902
02:31:38,809 --> 02:31:38,819
Islam exactly
 

7903
02:31:38,819 --> 02:31:41,150
Islam exactly
so so I went down so that was that

7904
02:31:41,150 --> 02:31:41,160
so so I went down so that was that
 

7905
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:43,490
so so I went down so that was that
became my wheelhouse for a time

7906
02:31:43,490 --> 02:31:43,500
became my wheelhouse for a time
 

7907
02:31:43,500 --> 02:31:45,950
became my wheelhouse for a time
um you know terrorism and and uh

7908
02:31:45,950 --> 02:31:45,960
um you know terrorism and and uh
 

7909
02:31:45,960 --> 02:31:49,490
um you know terrorism and and uh
jihadism and related topics and so the

7910
02:31:49,490 --> 02:31:49,500
jihadism and related topics and so the
 

7911
02:31:49,500 --> 02:31:52,910
jihadism and related topics and so the
911 truth conspiracy thing kept you know

7912
02:31:52,910 --> 02:31:52,920
911 truth conspiracy thing kept you know
 

7913
02:31:52,920 --> 02:31:55,370
911 truth conspiracy thing kept you know
uh getting aimed at me

7914
02:31:55,370 --> 02:31:55,380
uh getting aimed at me
 

7915
02:31:55,380 --> 02:31:56,870
uh getting aimed at me
and

7916
02:31:56,870 --> 02:31:56,880
and
 

7917
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,450
and
the question was well do I do I want to

7918
02:31:59,450 --> 02:31:59,460
the question was well do I do I want to
 

7919
02:31:59,460 --> 02:32:01,550
the question was well do I do I want to
debate these people right like Alex

7920
02:32:01,550 --> 02:32:01,560
debate these people right like Alex
 

7921
02:32:01,560 --> 02:32:03,410
debate these people right like Alex
Jones perhaps yeah I mean yeah so Alex

7922
02:32:03,410 --> 02:32:03,420
Jones perhaps yeah I mean yeah so Alex
 

7923
02:32:03,420 --> 02:32:05,150
Jones perhaps yeah I mean yeah so Alex
Jones I think was an early purveyor of

7924
02:32:05,150 --> 02:32:05,160
Jones I think was an early purveyor of
 

7925
02:32:05,160 --> 02:32:06,230
Jones I think was an early purveyor of
it although I don't think I knew who he

7926
02:32:06,230 --> 02:32:06,240
it although I don't think I knew who he
 

7927
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:07,910
it although I don't think I knew who he
was at that point

7928
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:07,920
was at that point
 

7929
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:09,230
was at that point
um

7930
02:32:09,230 --> 02:32:09,240
um
 

7931
02:32:09,240 --> 02:32:12,170
um
and so and privately I had some very

7932
02:32:12,170 --> 02:32:12,180
and so and privately I had some very
 

7933
02:32:12,180 --> 02:32:14,330
and so and privately I had some very
long debates with people who you know

7934
02:32:14,330 --> 02:32:14,340
long debates with people who you know
 

7935
02:32:14,340 --> 02:32:16,190
long debates with people who you know
one person in my family went way down

7936
02:32:16,190 --> 02:32:16,200
one person in my family went way down
 

7937
02:32:16,200 --> 02:32:17,750
one person in my family went way down
that rabbit hole and I just you know

7938
02:32:17,750 --> 02:32:17,760
that rabbit hole and I just you know
 

7939
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:19,550
that rabbit hole and I just you know
every six months or so I'd literally

7940
02:32:19,550 --> 02:32:19,560
every six months or so I'd literally
 

7941
02:32:19,560 --> 02:32:21,530
every six months or so I'd literally
write the two-hour email you know that

7942
02:32:21,530 --> 02:32:21,540
write the two-hour email you know that
 

7943
02:32:21,540 --> 02:32:23,750
write the two-hour email you know that
would try to

7944
02:32:23,750 --> 02:32:23,760
would try to
 

7945
02:32:23,760 --> 02:32:25,670
would try to
try to deprogram them you know however

7946
02:32:25,670 --> 02:32:25,680
try to deprogram them you know however
 

7947
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:27,410
try to deprogram them you know however
ineffectually and

7948
02:32:27,410 --> 02:32:27,420
ineffectually and
 

7949
02:32:27,420 --> 02:32:29,929
ineffectually and
uh so I went back and forth three years

7950
02:32:29,929 --> 02:32:29,939
uh so I went back and forth three years
 

7951
02:32:29,939 --> 02:32:32,570
uh so I went back and forth three years
on that topic with with in private with

7952
02:32:32,570 --> 02:32:32,580
on that topic with with in private with
 

7953
02:32:32,580 --> 02:32:34,670
on that topic with with in private with
people but I could see the structure of

7954
02:32:34,670 --> 02:32:34,680
people but I could see the structure of
 

7955
02:32:34,680 --> 02:32:36,290
people but I could see the structure of
the conspiracy I could see the nature of

7956
02:32:36,290 --> 02:32:36,300
the conspiracy I could see the nature of
 

7957
02:32:36,300 --> 02:32:39,170
the conspiracy I could see the nature of
of of of of how

7958
02:32:39,170 --> 02:32:39,180
of of of of how
 

7959
02:32:39,180 --> 02:32:42,770
of of of of how
of how impossible it was to

7960
02:32:42,770 --> 02:32:42,780
of how impossible it was to
 

7961
02:32:42,780 --> 02:32:45,410
of how impossible it was to
to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well

7962
02:32:45,410 --> 02:32:45,420
to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well
 

7963
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:48,110
to play whack-a-mole sufficiently well
so as to so as to convince anyone of

the
the problematic structure of that way of

the problematic structure of that way of

I've I've dealt with that style of
 

8041
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:05,870
I've I've dealt with that style of
thinking and I've I know what it's like

8042
02:34:05,870 --> 02:34:05,880
thinking and I've I know what it's like
 

8043
02:34:05,880 --> 02:34:07,730
thinking and I've I know what it's like
to be in the weeds of a conversation

8044
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:07,740
to be in the weeds of a conversation
 

8045
02:34:07,740 --> 02:34:10,969
to be in the weeds of a conversation
like that and and the person will say

8046
02:34:10,969 --> 02:34:10,979
like that and and the person will say
 

8047
02:34:10,979 --> 02:34:13,130
like that and and the person will say
okay well but what do you make of the

8048
02:34:13,130 --> 02:34:13,140
okay well but what do you make of the
 

8049
02:34:13,140 --> 02:34:16,670
okay well but what do you make of the
fact that um all those f-16s were flown

8050
02:34:16,670 --> 02:34:16,680
fact that um all those f-16s were flown
 

8051
02:34:16,680 --> 02:34:19,969
fact that um all those f-16s were flown
800 miles out to sea on the morning of 9

11 to doing an exercise that hadn't even

8054
02:34:22,070 --> 02:34:22,080
11 to doing an exercise that hadn't even
 

8055
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:23,570
11 to doing an exercise that hadn't even
been scheduled for that day but it was

8056
02:34:23,570 --> 02:34:23,580
been scheduled for that day but it was
 

8057
02:34:23,580 --> 02:34:27,349
been scheduled for that day but it was
and now all of these are I dimly recall

8058
02:34:27,349 --> 02:34:27,359
and now all of these are I dimly recall
 

8059
02:34:27,359 --> 02:34:29,030
and now all of these are I dimly recall
some thesis of that kind but I'm just

8060
02:34:29,030 --> 02:34:29,040
some thesis of that kind but I'm just
 

8061
02:34:29,040 --> 02:34:31,250
some thesis of that kind but I'm just
making these things up now right so I

8062
02:34:31,250 --> 02:34:31,260
making these things up now right so I
 

8063
02:34:31,260 --> 02:34:32,570
making these things up now right so I
got that detail hadn't even been

8064
02:34:32,570 --> 02:34:32,580
got that detail hadn't even been
 

8065
02:34:32,580 --> 02:34:33,710
got that detail hadn't even been
scheduled for that day it was

8066
02:34:33,710 --> 02:34:33,720
scheduled for that day it was
 

8067
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:35,809
scheduled for that day it was
inexplicably run that day like so what

8068
02:34:35,809 --> 02:34:35,819
inexplicably run that day like so what
 

8069
02:34:35,819 --> 02:34:38,389
inexplicably run that day like so what
how long would it take to track that

8070
02:34:38,389 --> 02:34:38,399
how long would it take to track that
 

8071
02:34:38,399 --> 02:34:40,849
how long would it take to track that
down right the idea that this is

8072
02:34:40,849 --> 02:34:40,859
down right the idea that this is
 

8073
02:34:40,859 --> 02:34:43,990
down right the idea that this is
anomalous like that there was a f f 16

8074
02:34:43,990 --> 02:34:44,000
anomalous like that there was a f f 16
 

8075
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,150
anomalous like that there was a f f 16
uh exercise run

8076

uh exercise run
 

8077
02:34:47,160 --> 02:34:48,710
uh exercise run
on it on and it wasn't even supposed to

8078
02:34:48,710 --> 02:34:48,720
on it on and it wasn't even supposed to
 

8079
02:34:48,720 --> 02:34:50,870
on it on and it wasn't even supposed to
be run that day right

8080
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:50,880
be run that day right

proliferate for understandable reasons
 

9271
02:57:55,380 --> 02:57:56,690
proliferate for understandable reasons
and that's gonna

9272

and that's gonna
 

9273
02:57:56,700 --> 02:57:59,510
and that's gonna
it's it's not going to be good next time

actually that the best time to figure
 

9401
03:00:27,359 --> 03:00:30,349
actually that the best time to figure
out the origin of this is immediately

9402
03:00:30,349 --> 03:00:30,359
out the origin of this is immediately

03:00:37,610 --> 03:00:37,620
um
 

9413
03:00:37,620 --> 03:00:39,170
um
you know there are certain facts you

9414
03:00:39,170 --> 03:00:39,180
you know there are certain facts you
 

9415
03:00:39,180 --> 03:00:40,490
you know there are certain facts you
might not be able to get in hand but

9416
03:00:40,490 --> 03:00:40,500
might not be able to get in hand but
 

9417
03:00:40,500 --> 03:00:43,429
might not be able to get in hand but
I've always felt that

9418
03:00:43,429 --> 03:00:43,439
I've always felt that
 

9419
03:00:43,439 --> 03:00:47,630
I've always felt that
it didn't matter for two reasons one is

9420
03:00:47,630 --> 03:00:47,640
it didn't matter for two reasons one is
 

9421
03:00:47,640 --> 03:00:49,910
it didn't matter for two reasons one is
we had the Genome of the virus and and

9422
03:00:49,910 --> 03:00:49,920
we had the Genome of the virus and and
 

9423
03:00:49,920 --> 03:00:52,130
we had the Genome of the virus and and
we could design we're very quickly

9424
03:00:52,130 --> 03:00:52,140
we could design we're very quickly
 

9425
03:00:52,140 --> 03:00:53,809
we could design we're very quickly
designed immediately designing vaccines

9426
03:00:53,809 --> 03:00:53,819
designed immediately designing vaccines
 

9427
03:00:53,819 --> 03:00:55,730
designed immediately designing vaccines
against that genome and that's what we

9428
03:00:55,730 --> 03:00:55,740
against that genome and that's what we
 

9429
03:00:55,740 --> 03:00:56,809
against that genome and that's what we
had to do and then we had to figure out

9430
03:00:56,809 --> 03:00:56,819
had to do and then we had to figure out
 

9431
03:00:56,819 --> 03:00:59,570
had to do and then we had to figure out
how to vaccinate and to

9432
03:00:59,570 --> 03:00:59,580
how to vaccinate and to
 

9433
03:00:59,580 --> 03:01:02,090
how to vaccinate and to
and to mitigate and to develop

9434
03:01:02,090 --> 03:01:02,100
and to mitigate and to develop
 

9435
03:01:02,100 --> 03:01:03,650
and to mitigate and to develop
treatments and all of that

9436
03:01:03,650 --> 03:01:03,660
treatments and all of that
 

9437
03:01:03,660 --> 03:01:06,490
treatments and all of that
so the origin story didn't matter

9438
03:01:06,490 --> 03:01:06,500
so the origin story didn't matter
 

9439
03:01:06,500 --> 03:01:08,570
so the origin story didn't matter
generically speaking

9440
03:01:08,570 --> 03:01:08,580
generically speaking
 

9441
03:01:08,580 --> 03:01:11,150
generically speaking
either or origin story

9442
03:01:11,150 --> 03:01:11,160
either or origin story
 

9443
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:12,590
either or origin story
was

9444
03:01:12,590 --> 03:01:12,600
was
 

9445
03:01:12,600 --> 03:01:16,070
was
politically inflammatory and made the

9446
03:01:16,070 --> 03:01:16,080
politically inflammatory and made the
 

9447
03:01:16,080 --> 03:01:17,450
politically inflammatory and made the
Chinese look bad right and the Chinese

9448
03:01:17,450 --> 03:01:17,460
Chinese look bad right and the Chinese
 

9449
03:01:17,460 --> 03:01:19,309
Chinese look bad right and the Chinese
response to this looked bad whatever the

9450
03:01:19,309 --> 03:01:19,319
response to this looked bad whatever the
 

9451
03:01:19,319 --> 03:01:20,450
response to this looked bad whatever the
origin story right they're not

9452
03:01:20,450 --> 03:01:20,460
origin story right they're not
 

9453
03:01:20,460 --> 03:01:23,269
origin story right they're not
cooperating they're letting they're

9454
03:01:23,269 --> 03:01:23,279
cooperating they're letting they're
 

9455
03:01:23,279 --> 03:01:24,830
cooperating they're letting they're
stopping their domestic flights but

9456
03:01:24,830 --> 03:01:24,840
stopping their domestic flights but
 

9457
03:01:24,840 --> 03:01:27,110
stopping their domestic flights but
letting their international flights go I

9458
03:01:27,110 --> 03:01:27,120
letting their international flights go I
 

9459
03:01:27,120 --> 03:01:29,389
letting their international flights go I
mean it's just they were bad actors and

9460
03:01:29,389 --> 03:01:29,399
mean it's just they were bad actors and
 

9461
03:01:29,399 --> 03:01:30,650
mean it's just they were bad actors and
they should be treated as such

9462
03:01:30,650 --> 03:01:30,660
they should be treated as such
 

9463
03:01:30,660 --> 03:01:33,410
they should be treated as such
regardless of the origin right and you

9464
03:01:33,410 --> 03:01:33,420
regardless of the origin right and you
 

9465
03:01:33,420 --> 03:01:35,870
regardless of the origin right and you
know I would argue that the wet Market

9466
03:01:35,870 --> 03:01:35,880
know I would argue that the wet Market
 

9467
03:01:35,880 --> 03:01:38,389
know I would argue that the wet Market
origin is even more politically

9468
03:01:38,389 --> 03:01:38,399
origin is even more politically
 

9469
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:41,030
origin is even more politically
invidious than the lab League origin I

9470
03:01:41,030 --> 03:01:41,040
invidious than the lab League origin I
 

9471
03:01:41,040 --> 03:01:42,590
invidious than the lab League origin I
mean why do you think because for lab

9472
03:01:42,590 --> 03:01:42,600
mean why do you think because for lab
 

9473
03:01:42,600 --> 03:01:44,809
mean why do you think because for lab
leak to my eye

9474
03:01:44,809 --> 03:01:44,819
leak to my eye
 

9475
03:01:44,819 --> 03:01:46,429
leak to my eye
the lab leak could happen to anyone

9476
03:01:46,429 --> 03:01:46,439
the lab leak could happen to anyone
 

9477
03:01:46,439 --> 03:01:48,230
the lab leak could happen to anyone
right we're all running all these

9478
03:01:48,230 --> 03:01:48,240
right we're all running all these
 

9479
03:01:48,240 --> 03:01:50,030
right we're all running all these
Advanced countries are running these

9480
03:01:50,030 --> 03:01:50,040
Advanced countries are running these
 

9481
03:01:50,040 --> 03:01:51,469
Advanced countries are running these
dangerous labs

9482
03:01:51,469 --> 03:01:51,479
dangerous labs
 

9483
03:01:51,479 --> 03:01:53,269
dangerous labs
that's a practice that we should be

9484
03:01:53,269 --> 03:01:53,279
that's a practice that we should be
 

9485
03:01:53,279 --> 03:01:56,750
that's a practice that we should be
worried about you know in general

9486
03:01:56,750 --> 03:01:56,760
worried about you know in general
 

9487
03:01:56,760 --> 03:01:58,969
worried about you know in general
we know lab leaks are a problem there

9488
03:01:58,969 --> 03:01:58,979
we know lab leaks are a problem there
 

9489
03:01:58,979 --> 03:02:00,650
we know lab leaks are a problem there
have been multiple lab leaks of even

9490
03:02:00,650 --> 03:02:00,660
have been multiple lab leaks of even
 

9491
03:02:00,660 --> 03:02:03,110
have been multiple lab leaks of even
worse things that haven't gotten out of

9492
03:02:03,110 --> 03:02:03,120
worse things that haven't gotten out of
 

9493
03:02:03,120 --> 03:02:05,630
worse things that haven't gotten out of
hand in this way but you know worse

9494
03:02:05,630 --> 03:02:05,640
hand in this way but you know worse
 

9495
03:02:05,640 --> 03:02:07,250
hand in this way but you know worse

pathogens
 

9497
03:02:07,260 --> 03:02:08,510

um

9498
03:02:08,510 --> 03:02:08,520
um
 

9499
03:02:08,520 --> 03:02:10,010
um
we're

9500
03:02:10,010 --> 03:02:10,020
we're
 

9501
03:02:10,020 --> 03:02:12,469
we're
we're wise to be worried about this and

9502
03:02:12,469 --> 03:02:12,479
we're wise to be worried about this and
 

9503
03:02:12,479 --> 03:02:14,750
we're wise to be worried about this and
on some level it could happen to anyone

9504
03:02:14,750 --> 03:02:14,760
on some level it could happen to anyone
 

9505
03:02:14,760 --> 03:02:17,809
on some level it could happen to anyone
right the wet Market makes them look

9506
03:02:17,809 --> 03:02:17,819
right the wet Market makes them look
 

9507
03:02:17,819 --> 03:02:20,269
right the wet Market makes them look
like barbarians live in another Century

9508
03:02:20,269 --> 03:02:20,279
like barbarians live in another Century
 

9509
03:02:20,279 --> 03:02:21,889
like barbarians live in another Century
like you got to clean up those wet

9510
03:02:21,889 --> 03:02:21,899
like you got to clean up those wet
 

9511
03:02:21,899 --> 03:02:23,450
like you got to clean up those wet
markets like what the you what are you

9512
03:02:23,450 --> 03:02:23,460
markets like what the you what are you
 

9513
03:02:23,460 --> 03:02:25,550
markets like what the you what are you
doing putting a bat on top of a Pangolin

9514
03:02:25,550 --> 03:02:25,560
doing putting a bat on top of a Pangolin
 

9515
03:02:25,560 --> 03:02:28,370
doing putting a bat on top of a Pangolin
on top of a duck it's like get your [\h__\h]

9516
03:02:28,370 --> 03:02:28,380
on top of a duck it's like get your [\h__\h]
 

9517
03:02:28,380 --> 03:02:30,830
on top of a duck it's like get your [\h__\h]
together so like if anything

9518
03:02:30,830 --> 03:02:30,840
together so like if anything
 

9519
03:02:30,840 --> 03:02:33,410
together so like if anything
the wet Market makes them look worse in

9520
03:02:33,410 --> 03:02:33,420
the wet Market makes them look worse in
 

9521
03:02:33,420 --> 03:02:35,570
the wet Market makes them look worse in
my view now I'm sure there's I'm sure

9522
03:02:35,570 --> 03:02:35,580
my view now I'm sure there's I'm sure
 

9523
03:02:35,580 --> 03:02:38,510
my view now I'm sure there's I'm sure
that what they actually did to conceal a

9524
03:02:38,510 --> 03:02:38,520
that what they actually did to conceal a
 

9525
03:02:38,520 --> 03:02:40,250
that what they actually did to conceal a
lab leak if it was a lab League all of

9526
03:02:40,250 --> 03:02:40,260
lab leak if it was a lab League all of
 

9527
03:02:40,260 --> 03:02:42,950
lab leak if it was a lab League all of
that's going to look odious

9528
03:02:42,950 --> 03:02:42,960
that's going to look odious
 

9529
03:02:42,960 --> 03:02:44,030
that's going to look odious
um do you think we'll ever get to the

9530
03:02:44,030 --> 03:02:44,040
um do you think we'll ever get to the
 

9531
03:02:44,040 --> 03:02:46,610
um do you think we'll ever get to the
bottom of that I mean one of the big

9532
03:02:46,610 --> 03:02:46,620
bottom of that I mean one of the big
 

9533
03:02:46,620 --> 03:02:49,490
bottom of that I mean one of the big
negative

9534
03:02:49,490 --> 03:02:49,500

 

9535
03:02:49,500 --> 03:02:51,950

um I would say failures of Anthony fauci

9536
03:02:51,950 --> 03:02:51,960
um I would say failures of Anthony fauci
 

9537
03:02:51,960 --> 03:02:54,349
um I would say failures of Anthony fauci
and so on is to be transparent and clear

9538
03:02:54,349 --> 03:02:54,359
and so on is to be transparent and clear
 

9539
03:02:54,359 --> 03:02:55,730
and so on is to be transparent and clear
and it's just a good communicator about

9540
03:02:55,730 --> 03:02:55,740
and it's just a good communicator about
 

9541
03:02:55,740 --> 03:02:57,469
and it's just a good communicator about
getting functional research the dangers

9542
03:02:57,469 --> 03:02:57,479
getting functional research the dangers
 

9543
03:02:57,479 --> 03:03:00,610
getting functional research the dangers
of that the success like the you know

9544
03:03:00,610 --> 03:03:00,620
of that the success like the you know
 

9545
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:03,710
of that the success like the you know
why it's a useful way of research but

9546
03:03:03,710 --> 03:03:03,720
why it's a useful way of research but
 

9547
03:03:03,720 --> 03:03:06,170
why it's a useful way of research but
it's also dangerous right you know just

9548
03:03:06,170 --> 03:03:06,180
it's also dangerous right you know just
 

9549
03:03:06,180 --> 03:03:07,910
it's also dangerous right you know just
being transparent about that as opposed

9550
03:03:07,910 --> 03:03:07,920
being transparent about that as opposed
 

9551
03:03:07,920 --> 03:03:09,950
being transparent about that as opposed
to just coming off really shady of

9552
03:03:09,950 --> 03:03:09,960
to just coming off really shady of
 

9553
03:03:09,960 --> 03:03:11,809
to just coming off really shady of
course the conspiracy theorists and the

9554
03:03:11,809 --> 03:03:11,819
course the conspiracy theorists and the
 

9555
03:03:11,819 --> 03:03:14,990
course the conspiracy theorists and the
the politicians are not helping but this

9556
03:03:14,990 --> 03:03:15,000
the politicians are not helping but this
 

9557
03:03:15,000 --> 03:03:16,510
the politicians are not helping but this
just created a

9558
03:03:16,510 --> 03:03:16,520
just created a
 

9559
03:03:16,520 --> 03:03:19,550
just created a
giant mess yeah no I would agree that so

9560
03:03:19,550 --> 03:03:19,560
giant mess yeah no I would agree that so
 

9561
03:03:19,560 --> 03:03:22,969
giant mess yeah no I would agree that so
that exchange with fauci and Rand Paul

9562
03:03:22,969 --> 03:03:22,979
that exchange with fauci and Rand Paul
 

9563
03:03:22,979 --> 03:03:26,510
that exchange with fauci and Rand Paul
they went viral yeah I would agree that

9564
03:03:26,510 --> 03:03:26,520
they went viral yeah I would agree that
 

9565
03:03:26,520 --> 03:03:29,090
they went viral yeah I would agree that
fauci looked like he was

9566
03:03:29,090 --> 03:03:29,100
fauci looked like he was
 

9567
03:03:29,100 --> 03:03:32,389
fauci looked like he was
taking refuge in kind of very lawyered

9568
03:03:32,389 --> 03:03:32,399
taking refuge in kind of very lawyered
 

9569
03:03:32,399 --> 03:03:33,650
taking refuge in kind of very lawyered

and not
 

9573
03:03:35,580 --> 03:03:37,849
and not
giving a straightforward account of what

9574
03:03:37,849 --> 03:03:37,859
giving a straightforward account of what
 

9575
03:03:37,859 --> 03:03:40,550
giving a straightforward account of what
we do and why we do it and so yeah I

9576
03:03:40,550 --> 03:03:40,560
we do and why we do it and so yeah I
 

9577
03:03:40,560 --> 03:03:42,410
we do and why we do it and so yeah I
think it looked Shady it played shady

9578
03:03:42,410 --> 03:03:42,420
think it looked Shady it played shady
 

9579
03:03:42,420 --> 03:03:44,809
think it looked Shady it played shady
and it probably was shady I mean I don't

9580
03:03:44,809 --> 03:03:44,819
and it probably was shady I mean I don't
 

9581
03:03:44,819 --> 03:03:46,969
and it probably was shady I mean I don't
know how personally entangled he is with

9582
03:03:46,969 --> 03:03:46,979
know how personally entangled he is with
 

9583
03:03:46,979 --> 03:03:48,230
know how personally entangled he is with
any of this but

9584
03:03:48,230 --> 03:03:48,240
any of this but
 

9585
03:03:48,240 --> 03:03:50,929
any of this but
yeah the the gain of function research

9586
03:03:50,929 --> 03:03:50,939
yeah the the gain of function research
 

9587
03:03:50,939 --> 03:03:53,090
yeah the the gain of function research
is something that

9588
03:03:53,090 --> 03:03:53,100
is something that
 

9589
03:03:53,100 --> 03:03:55,910
is something that
I think we're wise to be worried about

9590
03:03:55,910 --> 03:03:55,920
I think we're wise to be worried about
 

9591
03:03:55,920 --> 03:03:59,690
I think we're wise to be worried about
and insofar as I judge myself adequate

9592
03:03:59,690 --> 03:03:59,700
and insofar as I judge myself adequate
 

9593
03:03:59,700 --> 03:04:02,450
and insofar as I judge myself adequate
to have an opinion on this

9594
03:04:02,450 --> 03:04:02,460
to have an opinion on this
 

9595
03:04:02,460 --> 03:04:05,150
to have an opinion on this
I think it should be banned right like I

9596
03:04:05,150 --> 03:04:05,160
I think it should be banned right like I
 

9597
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:08,870
I think it should be banned right like I
I I'm probably a podcast I'll do you

9598
03:04:08,870 --> 03:04:08,880
I I'm probably a podcast I'll do you
 

9599
03:04:08,880 --> 03:04:10,670
I I'm probably a podcast I'll do you
know if you or somebody else doesn't do

9600
03:04:10,670 --> 03:04:10,680
know if you or somebody else doesn't do
 

9601
03:04:10,680 --> 03:04:12,469
know if you or somebody else doesn't do
it in the meantime

9602
03:04:12,469 --> 03:04:12,479
it in the meantime
 

9603
03:04:12,479 --> 03:04:13,490
it in the meantime
um

9604
03:04:13,490 --> 03:04:13,500
um
 

9605
03:04:13,500 --> 03:04:16,790
um
you know I I would like a virologist on

9606
03:04:16,790 --> 03:04:16,800
you know I I would like a virologist on
 

9607
03:04:16,800 --> 03:04:20,150
you know I I would like a virologist on
to defend it against a virologist who

9608
03:04:20,150 --> 03:04:20,160
to defend it against a virologist who
 

9609
03:04:20,160 --> 03:04:22,670
to defend it against a virologist who
who who would uh criticize it forget

9610
03:04:22,670 --> 03:04:22,680
who who would uh criticize it forget
 

9611
03:04:22,680 --> 03:04:25,250
who who would uh criticize it forget
about the gain of function research

9612
03:04:25,250 --> 03:04:25,260
about the gain of function research
 

9613
03:04:25,260 --> 03:04:27,349
about the gain of function research
I don't even understand virus hunting at

9614
03:04:27,349 --> 03:04:27,359
I don't even understand virus hunting at
 

9615
03:04:27,359 --> 03:04:28,969
I don't even understand virus hunting at
this point it's like I don't know I

9616
03:04:28,969 --> 03:04:28,979
this point it's like I don't know I
 

9617
03:04:28,979 --> 03:04:30,590
this point it's like I don't know I
don't even know why you need to go into

9618
03:04:30,590 --> 03:04:30,600
don't even know why you need to go into
 

9619
03:04:30,600 --> 03:04:33,469
don't even know why you need to go into
a cave to find this next virus that

9620
03:04:33,469 --> 03:04:33,479
a cave to find this next virus that
 

9621
03:04:33,479 --> 03:04:36,050
a cave to find this next virus that
could be circulating among bats that may

9622
03:04:36,050 --> 03:04:36,060
could be circulating among bats that may
 

9623
03:04:36,060 --> 03:04:39,050
could be circulating among bats that may
jump zoonotically to us

9624
03:04:39,050 --> 03:04:39,060
jump zoonotically to us
 

9625
03:04:39,060 --> 03:04:41,389
jump zoonotically to us
why do that when we can make when we

9626
03:04:41,389 --> 03:04:41,399
why do that when we can make when we
 

9627
03:04:41,399 --> 03:04:43,429
why do that when we can make when we
when we can seek once in a day and and

9628
03:04:43,429 --> 03:04:43,439
when we can seek once in a day and and
 

9629
03:04:43,439 --> 03:04:46,250
when we can seek once in a day and and
make vaccines in a weekend I mean like

9630
03:04:46,250 --> 03:04:46,260
make vaccines in a weekend I mean like
 

9631
03:04:46,260 --> 03:04:48,410
make vaccines in a weekend I mean like
like what kind of Head Start do you

9632
03:04:48,410 --> 03:04:48,420
like what kind of Head Start do you
 

9633
03:04:48,420 --> 03:04:49,429
like what kind of Head Start do you
think you're getting that's a surprising

9634
03:04:49,429 --> 03:04:49,439
think you're getting that's a surprising
 

9635
03:04:49,439 --> 03:04:51,110
think you're getting that's a surprising
new thing how quickly you can develop a

9636
03:04:51,110 --> 03:04:51,120
new thing how quickly you can develop a
 

9637
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:54,110
new thing how quickly you can develop a
vaccine exactly that's uh

9638
03:04:54,110 --> 03:04:54,120
vaccine exactly that's uh
 

9639
03:04:54,120 --> 03:04:55,670
vaccine exactly that's uh
yeah that's that's really interesting

9640
03:04:55,670 --> 03:04:55,680
yeah that's that's really interesting
 

9641
03:04:55,680 --> 03:04:58,070
yeah that's that's really interesting
but the shadiness around lab League

9642
03:04:58,070 --> 03:04:58,080
but the shadiness around lab League
 

9643
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:00,910
but the shadiness around lab League
I think the point I didn't make about

9644
03:05:00,910 --> 03:05:00,920
I think the point I didn't make about
 

9645
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:03,170
I think the point I didn't make about
Brett's style of engaging this issue is

9646
03:05:03,170 --> 03:05:03,180
Brett's style of engaging this issue is
 

9647
03:05:03,180 --> 03:05:04,610
Brett's style of engaging this issue is
people are using the fact that he was

9648
03:05:04,610 --> 03:05:04,620
people are using the fact that he was
 

9649
03:05:04,620 --> 03:05:07,429
people are using the fact that he was
early on lab leak to suggest that he was

9650
03:05:07,429 --> 03:05:07,439
early on lab leak to suggest that he was
 

9651
03:05:07,439 --> 03:05:10,690
early on lab leak to suggest that he was
right about Ivermectin and about mRNA

9652
03:05:10,690 --> 03:05:10,700
right about Ivermectin and about mRNA
 

9653
03:05:10,700 --> 03:05:13,309
right about Ivermectin and about mRNA
vaccines and all the rest like no that

9654
03:05:13,309 --> 03:05:13,319
vaccines and all the rest like no that
 

9655
03:05:13,319 --> 03:05:15,250
vaccines and all the rest like no that
that's

9656
03:05:15,250 --> 03:05:15,260
that's
 

9657
03:05:15,260 --> 03:05:18,650
that's
none of that connects and it was

9658
03:05:18,650 --> 03:05:18,660
none of that connects and it was
 

9659
03:05:18,660 --> 03:05:20,990
none of that connects and it was
possible to be falsely confident like

9660
03:05:20,990 --> 03:05:21,000
possible to be falsely confident like
 

9661
03:05:21,000 --> 03:05:22,190
possible to be falsely confident like
you shouldn't have been confident about

9662
03:05:22,190 --> 03:05:22,200
you shouldn't have been confident about
 

9663
03:05:22,200 --> 03:05:23,750
you shouldn't have been confident about
lab no one should have been confident

9664
03:05:23,750 --> 03:05:23,760
lab no one should have been confident
 

9665
03:05:23,760 --> 03:05:26,090
lab no one should have been confident
about lab leak early even if it turns

9666
03:05:26,090 --> 03:05:26,100
about lab leak early even if it turns
 

9667
03:05:26,100 --> 03:05:27,950
about lab leak early even if it turns
out to be lap league right it was always

9668
03:05:27,950 --> 03:05:27,960
out to be lap league right it was always
 

9669
03:05:27,960 --> 03:05:30,410
out to be lap league right it was always
plausible it was never definite it still

9670
03:05:30,410 --> 03:05:30,420
plausible it was never definite it still
 

9671
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:33,830
plausible it was never definite it still
isn't definite zoonotic is is is also

9672
03:05:33,830 --> 03:05:33,840
isn't definite zoonotic is is is also
 

9673
03:05:33,840 --> 03:05:36,230
isn't definite zoonotic is is is also
quite plausible it certainly was super

9674
03:05:36,230 --> 03:05:36,240
quite plausible it certainly was super
 

9675
03:05:36,240 --> 03:05:38,389
quite plausible it certainly was super
plausible then

9676
03:05:38,389 --> 03:05:38,399
plausible then
 

9677
03:05:38,399 --> 03:05:40,389
plausible then
um both are politically

9678
03:05:40,389 --> 03:05:40,399
um both are politically
 

9679
03:05:40,399 --> 03:05:43,490
um both are politically
uncomfortable uh both were both at the

9680
03:05:43,490 --> 03:05:43,500
uncomfortable uh both were both at the
 

9681
03:05:43,500 --> 03:05:46,130
uncomfortable uh both were both at the
time were inflammatory to be banging on

9682
03:05:46,130 --> 03:05:46,140
time were inflammatory to be banging on
 

9683
03:05:46,140 --> 03:05:47,990
time were inflammatory to be banging on
about when we were trying to secure some

9684
03:05:47,990 --> 03:05:48,000
about when we were trying to secure some
 

9685
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:49,250
about when we were trying to secure some
kind of cooperation from the Chinese

9686
03:05:49,250 --> 03:05:49,260
kind of cooperation from the Chinese
 

9687
03:05:49,260 --> 03:05:51,530
kind of cooperation from the Chinese
right so there's a time for these things

9688
03:05:51,530 --> 03:05:51,540
right so there's a time for these things
 

9689
03:05:51,540 --> 03:05:53,330
right so there's a time for these things
and and

9690
03:05:53,330 --> 03:05:53,340
and and
 

9691
03:05:53,340 --> 03:05:55,010
and and
and it's possible to be right by

9692
03:05:55,010 --> 03:05:55,020
and it's possible to be right by
 

9693
03:05:55,020 --> 03:06:00,110
and it's possible to be right by
accident right that's the that is

9694
03:06:00,110 --> 03:06:00,120

 

9695
03:06:00,120 --> 03:06:02,150

it Matt you're you're reasoning the

9696
03:06:02,150 --> 03:06:02,160
it Matt you're you're reasoning the
 

9697
03:06:02,160 --> 03:06:05,030
it Matt you're you're reasoning the
style of reasoning matters whether

9698
03:06:05,030 --> 03:06:05,040
style of reasoning matters whether
 

9699
03:06:05,040 --> 03:06:06,889
style of reasoning matters whether
you're right or not

9700
03:06:06,889 --> 03:06:06,899
you're right or not
 

9701
03:06:06,899 --> 03:06:08,809
you're right or not
you know it's like because your style of

9702
03:06:08,809 --> 03:06:08,819
you know it's like because your style of
 

9703
03:06:08,819 --> 03:06:10,550
you know it's like because your style of
reasoning is dictating what you're going

9704
03:06:10,550 --> 03:06:10,560
reasoning is dictating what you're going
 

9705
03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:15,230
reasoning is dictating what you're going
to do on the next topic

9706
03:06:15,230 --> 03:06:15,240

 

9707
03:06:15,240 --> 03:06:17,750

sure but this is a

9708
03:06:17,750 --> 03:06:17,760
sure but this is a
 

9709
03:06:17,760 --> 03:06:20,570
sure but this is a
this multivariate situation here it's

9710
03:06:20,570 --> 03:06:20,580
this multivariate situation here it's
 

9711
03:06:20,580 --> 03:06:22,730
this multivariate situation here it's
really difficult to know what's right on

9712
03:06:22,730 --> 03:06:22,740
really difficult to know what's right on
 

9713
03:06:22,740 --> 03:06:24,889
really difficult to know what's right on
covid given all the uncertainty all the

9714
03:06:24,889 --> 03:06:24,899
covid given all the uncertainty all the
 

9715
03:06:24,899 --> 03:06:26,870
covid given all the uncertainty all the
chaos especially when you step outside

9716
03:06:26,870 --> 03:06:26,880
chaos especially when you step outside
 

9717
03:06:26,880 --> 03:06:29,929
chaos especially when you step outside
the pure biology virology of it and you

9718
03:06:29,929 --> 03:06:29,939
the pure biology virology of it and you
 

9719
03:06:29,939 --> 03:06:32,750
the pure biology virology of it and you
started getting to policy yeah that's

9720
03:06:32,750 --> 03:06:32,760
started getting to policy yeah that's
 

9721
03:06:32,760 --> 03:06:34,849
started getting to policy yeah that's
really yeah it's just trade-offs yeah

9722
03:06:34,849 --> 03:06:34,859
really yeah it's just trade-offs yeah
 

9723
03:06:34,859 --> 03:06:37,490
really yeah it's just trade-offs yeah
like transmissibility of the virus

9724
03:06:37,490 --> 03:06:37,500
like transmissibility of the virus
 

9725
03:06:37,500 --> 03:06:40,550
like transmissibility of the virus
sure just knowing

9726
03:06:40,550 --> 03:06:40,560
sure just knowing
 

9727
03:06:40,560 --> 03:06:44,090
sure just knowing

to uh be more
 

9911
03:10:13,439 --> 03:10:15,769
to uh be more
uh serve as better catalysts for

9912
03:10:15,769 --> 03:10:15,779
uh serve as better catalysts for
 

9913
03:10:15,779 --> 03:10:18,530
uh serve as better catalysts for
conspiracy theories and I'm not sure

9914
03:10:18,530 --> 03:10:18,540
conspiracy theories and I'm not sure
 

9915
03:10:18,540 --> 03:10:20,150
conspiracy theories and I'm not sure
what what that is because I don't think

9916
03:10:20,150 --> 03:10:20,160
what what that is because I don't think
 

9917
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:23,510
what what that is because I don't think
there's an alternative for capitalism

9918

in delivering drugs that help people

9920
03:10:26,870 --> 03:10:26,880
in delivering drugs that help people
 

9921
03:10:26,880 --> 03:10:29,030
in delivering drugs that help people
but also at the same time that it seems

9922
03:10:29,030 --> 03:10:29,040
but also at the same time that it seems
 

9923
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:31,130
but also at the same time that it seems
to need to be a more transparency and

9924
03:10:31,130 --> 03:10:31,140
to need to be a more transparency and
 

9925
03:10:31,140 --> 03:10:32,870
to need to be a more transparency and
plus like regulation that actually makes

9926
03:10:32,870 --> 03:10:32,880
plus like regulation that actually makes
 

9927
03:10:32,880 --> 03:10:35,690
plus like regulation that actually makes
sense versus it seems like

9928
03:10:35,690 --> 03:10:35,700
sense versus it seems like
 

9929
03:10:35,700 --> 03:10:37,730

10347
03:18:37,439 --> 03:18:39,710
it was like okay you can say that panic
over anything is dumb fine but this was

10348
03:18:39,710 --> 03:18:39,720
over anything is dumb fine but this was
 

10349
03:18:39,720 --> 03:18:41,809
over anything is dumb fine but this was
not the how this was landed this was

10350
03:18:41,809 --> 03:18:41,819
not the how this was landed this was
 

10351
03:18:41,819 --> 03:18:45,650
not the how this was landed this was
like non-issue conspiracy there's gonna

10352
03:18:45,650 --> 03:18:45,660
like non-issue conspiracy there's gonna
 

10353
03:18:45,660 --> 03:18:47,870
like non-issue conspiracy there's gonna
be no covet in the U.S it's going to

10354
03:18:47,870 --> 03:18:47,880
be no covet in the U.S it's going to
 

10355

Peter out it's just going to become a

10356
03:18:49,070 --> 03:18:49,080
Peter out it's just going to become a
 

10357
03:18:49,080 --> 03:18:50,630
Peter out it's just going to become a
cold I mean that that's how this was

10358
03:18:50,630 --> 03:18:50,640
cold I mean that that's how this was
 

10359
03:18:50,640 --> 03:18:52,910
cold I mean that that's how this was
getting received whereas at that moment

10360
03:18:52,910 --> 03:18:52,920
getting received whereas at that moment
 

10361
03:18:52,920 --> 03:18:54,769
getting received whereas at that moment
it was absolutely obvious how big a deal

10362
03:18:54,769 --> 03:18:54,779
it was absolutely obvious how big a deal
 

10363
03:18:54,779 --> 03:18:56,929
it was absolutely obvious how big a deal
this was going to be no or that it was

10364
03:18:56,929 --> 03:18:56,939
this was going to be no or that it was
 

10365
03:18:56,939 --> 03:18:58,490
this was going to be no or that it was
going to add minimum going to be a big

10366
03:18:58,490 --> 03:18:58,500
going to add minimum going to be a big
 

10367
03:18:58,500 --> 03:19:00,050
going to add minimum going to be a big
deal I don't know if it was obvious but

10368
03:19:00,050 --> 03:19:00,060
deal I don't know if it was obvious but
 

10369
03:19:00,060 --> 03:19:01,969
deal I don't know if it was obvious but
it was it was obvious that it was a

10370
03:19:01,969 --> 03:19:01,979
it was it was obvious that it was a
 

10371
03:19:01,979 --> 03:19:04,010
it was it was obvious that it was a
significant probability that it could be

10372
03:19:04,010 --> 03:19:04,020
significant probability that it could be
 

10373
03:19:04,020 --> 03:19:06,769
significant probability that it could be
a big I remember in Mar it was unclear

10374
03:19:06,769 --> 03:19:06,779
a big I remember in Mar it was unclear
 

10375
03:19:06,779 --> 03:19:09,290
a big I remember in Mar it was unclear
like how big because there were still

10376
03:19:09,290 --> 03:19:09,300
like how big because there were still
 

10377
03:19:09,300 --> 03:19:11,090
like how big because there were still
stories of it like it's probably going

10378
03:19:11,090 --> 03:19:11,100
stories of it like it's probably going
 

10379
03:19:11,100 --> 03:19:13,309
stories of it like it's probably going
to like the big concern the hospital is

10380
03:19:13,309 --> 03:19:13,319
to like the big concern the hospital is
 

10381
03:19:13,319 --> 03:19:14,809
to like the big concern the hospital is
my overfilled but it's gonna yeah in

10382
03:19:14,809 --> 03:19:14,819
my overfilled but it's gonna yeah in
 

10383
03:19:14,819 --> 03:19:16,190
my overfilled but it's gonna yeah in
like two months or something yeah we

10384
03:19:16,190 --> 03:19:16,200
like two months or something yeah we
 

10385
03:19:16,200 --> 03:19:18,050
like two months or something yeah we
didn't know but it was there was no way

10386
03:19:18,050 --> 03:19:18,060
didn't know but it was there was no way
 

10387
03:19:18,060 --> 03:19:20,870
didn't know but it was there was no way
we weren't going to have

10388
03:19:20,870 --> 03:19:20,880
we weren't going to have
 

10389
03:19:20,880 --> 03:19:24,290
we weren't going to have
tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum

10390
03:19:24,290 --> 03:19:24,300
tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum
 

10391
03:19:24,300 --> 03:19:27,590
tens of thousands of deaths at a minimum
at that point and and it was it was

10392
03:19:27,590 --> 03:19:27,600
at that point and and it was it was
 

10393
03:19:27,600 --> 03:19:29,210
at that point and and it was it was
every it was totally rational to be

10394
03:19:29,210 --> 03:19:29,220
every it was totally rational to be
 

10395
03:19:29,220 --> 03:19:30,889
every it was totally rational to be
worried about hundreds of thousands and

10396
03:19:30,889 --> 03:19:30,899
worried about hundreds of thousands and
 

10397
03:19:30,899 --> 03:19:33,050
worried about hundreds of thousands and
when Nicholas christakis came on my

10398
03:19:33,050 --> 03:19:33,060
when Nicholas christakis came on my
 

10399
03:19:33,060 --> 03:19:35,630
when Nicholas christakis came on my
podcast very early you know he predicted

10400
03:19:35,630 --> 03:19:35,640
podcast very early you know he predicted
 

10401
03:19:35,640 --> 03:19:36,950
podcast very early you know he predicted
quite confidently that we would have

10402
03:19:36,950 --> 03:19:36,960
quite confidently that we would have
 

10403
03:19:36,960 --> 03:19:39,349
quite confidently that we would have
about a million people dead in the U.S

10404
03:19:39,349 --> 03:19:39,359
about a million people dead in the U.S
 

10405
03:19:39,359 --> 03:19:40,969
about a million people dead in the U.S
right and

10406
03:19:40,969 --> 03:19:40,979
right and
 

10407
03:19:40,979 --> 03:19:43,730
right and
that didn't seem you know it was it was

10408
03:19:43,730 --> 03:19:43,740
that didn't seem you know it was it was
 

10409
03:19:43,740 --> 03:19:45,530
that didn't seem you know it was it was
you know I think appropriately hedged

10410
03:19:45,530 --> 03:19:45,540
you know I think appropriately hedged
 

10411
03:19:45,540 --> 03:19:46,790
you know I think appropriately hedged
but it may was still it was just like

10412
03:19:46,790 --> 03:19:46,800
but it may was still it was just like
 

10413
03:19:46,800 --> 03:19:49,010
but it may was still it was just like
okay it's just gonna you just look at

10414
03:19:49,010 --> 03:19:49,020
okay it's just gonna you just look at
 

10415
03:19:49,020 --> 03:19:50,630
okay it's just gonna you just look at
the you we were kind of riding this

10416
03:19:50,630 --> 03:19:50,640
the you we were kind of riding this
 

10417
03:19:50,640 --> 03:19:53,750
the you we were kind of riding this
exponential and we're and

10418
03:19:53,750 --> 03:19:53,760
exponential and we're and
 

10419
03:19:53,760 --> 03:19:55,429
exponential and we're and
it's going to be you know it'd be very

10420
03:19:55,429 --> 03:19:55,439
it's going to be you know it'd be very
 

10421
03:19:55,439 --> 03:19:57,769
it's going to be you know it'd be very
surprising not to have that order of

10422
03:19:57,769 --> 03:19:57,779
surprising not to have that order of
 

10423
03:19:57,779 --> 03:19:59,690
surprising not to have that order of
magnitude and not something much much

10424
03:19:59,690 --> 03:19:59,700
magnitude and not something much much
 

10425
03:19:59,700 --> 03:20:02,809
magnitude and not something much much
less and

10426
03:20:02,809 --> 03:20:02,819
less and
 

10427
03:20:02,819 --> 03:20:05,990
less and
so anyway I mean again to to close the

10428
03:20:05,990 --> 03:20:06,000
so anyway I mean again to to close the
 

10429
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:07,370
so anyway I mean again to to close the
the

10430
03:20:07,370 --> 03:20:07,380
the
 

10431
03:20:07,380 --> 03:20:10,429
the
story on Elon

10432
03:20:10,429 --> 03:20:10,439
story on Elon
 

10433
03:20:10,439 --> 03:20:12,950
story on Elon
um I could see how this was being

10434
03:20:12,950 --> 03:20:12,960
um I could see how this was being
 

10435
03:20:12,960 --> 03:20:17,510
um I could see how this was being
received and uh I tried to get him to

10436
03:20:17,510 --> 03:20:17,520
received and uh I tried to get him to
 

10437
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:21,110
received and uh I tried to get him to
walk that back and then we we had a

10438
03:20:21,110 --> 03:20:21,120
walk that back and then we we had a
 

10439
03:20:21,120 --> 03:20:24,889
walk that back and then we we had a
fairly long and detailed uh exchange on

10440
03:20:24,889 --> 03:20:24,899
fairly long and detailed uh exchange on
 

10441
03:20:24,899 --> 03:20:27,290
fairly long and detailed uh exchange on
this issue and

10442
03:20:27,290 --> 03:20:27,300
this issue and
 

10443
03:20:27,300 --> 03:20:29,809
this issue and
that so that intervention didn't

10444
03:20:29,809 --> 03:20:29,819
that so that intervention didn't
 

10445
03:20:29,819 --> 03:20:32,450
that so that intervention didn't
work and it was not done you know I was

10446
03:20:32,450 --> 03:20:32,460
work and it was not done you know I was
 

10447
03:20:32,460 --> 03:20:35,150
work and it was not done you know I was
not an [\h__\h] I was not I was just

10448
03:20:35,150 --> 03:20:35,160
not an [\h__\h] I was not I was just
 

10449
03:20:35,160 --> 03:20:37,910
not an [\h__\h] I was not I was just
concerned you know for him for the world

10450
03:20:37,910 --> 03:20:37,920
concerned you know for him for the world
 

10451
03:20:37,920 --> 03:20:41,389
concerned you know for him for the world
for and you know

10452

um
 

10455
03:20:43,020 --> 03:20:44,570
um
and then there are other relationships

10456
03:20:44,570 --> 03:20:44,580
and then there are other relationships
 

10457
03:20:44,580 --> 03:20:46,370
and then there are other relationships
where

10458
03:20:46,370 --> 03:20:46,380
where
 

10459
03:20:46,380 --> 03:20:48,410
where
I didn't take the again that's an

10460
03:20:48,410 --> 03:20:48,420
I didn't take the again that's an
 

10461
03:20:48,420 --> 03:20:49,910
I didn't take the again that's an
example where taking the time didn't

10462
03:20:49,910 --> 03:20:49,920
example where taking the time didn't
 

10463
03:20:49,920 --> 03:20:51,710
example where taking the time didn't
work right privately

10464
03:20:51,710 --> 03:20:51,720
work right privately
 

10465
03:20:51,720 --> 03:20:53,150
work right privately
um there are other relations where I

03:20:53,150 --> 03:20:53,160
um there are other relations where I
 

10467
03:20:53,160 --> 03:20:53,929
um there are other relations where I
thought okay there's just going to be

10468
03:20:53,929 --> 03:20:53,939
thought okay there's just going to be
 

10469
03:20:53,939 --> 03:20:55,490
thought okay there's just going to be
more trouble than it's worth and I just

10527
03:21:57,240 --> 03:22:00,050
right we don't we're just a bunch of
idiots like one is an engineer you're a

10528
03:22:00,050 --> 03:22:00,060
idiots like one is an engineer you're a
 

10529
03:22:00,060 --> 03:22:02,990
idiots like one is an engineer you're a
neuroscientist but like it just kind of

figure out what the hell what yeah but
 

10539
03:22:10,380 --> 03:22:12,469
figure out what the hell what yeah but
the issue was that at that so at the

03:22:12,469 --> 03:22:12,479
the issue was that at that so at the
 

10541

certain things were not debatable right

10544
03:22:18,170 --> 03:22:18,180
certain things were not debatable right
 

10545
03:22:18,180 --> 03:22:20,630
certain things were not debatable right
it was just it was absolutely clear

10546
03:22:20,630 --> 03:22:20,640
it was just it was absolutely clear
 

10547
03:22:20,640 --> 03:22:23,750
it was just it was absolutely clear
where this was going it wasn't clear how

10548
03:22:23,750 --> 03:22:23,760
where this was going it wasn't clear how
 

10549
03:22:23,760 --> 03:22:25,670
where this was going it wasn't clear how
far it was going to go or how quickly we

10550
03:22:25,670 --> 03:22:25,680
far it was going to go or how quickly we
 

10551
03:22:25,680 --> 03:22:27,769
far it was going to go or how quickly we
would mitigate it but it was absolutely

10552
03:22:27,769 --> 03:22:27,779
would mitigate it but it was absolutely
 

10553
03:22:27,779 --> 03:22:29,389
would mitigate it but it was absolutely
clear that it was going to be an issue

10554
03:22:29,389 --> 03:22:29,399
clear that it was going to be an issue
 

10555
03:22:29,399 --> 03:22:32,389
clear that it was going to be an issue
right the the the the train had come off

10556
03:22:32,389 --> 03:22:32,399
right the the the the train had come off
 

10557
03:22:32,399 --> 03:22:34,090
right the the the the train had come off
the tracks in Italy

10558
03:22:34,090 --> 03:22:34,100
the tracks in Italy
 

10559
03:22:34,100 --> 03:22:36,710
the tracks in Italy
we knew we weren't going to seal our

10560
03:22:36,710 --> 03:22:36,720
we knew we weren't going to seal our
 

10561
03:22:36,720 --> 03:22:37,969
we knew we weren't going to seal our
borders

10562
03:22:37,969 --> 03:22:37,979
borders
 

10563
03:22:37,979 --> 03:22:40,550
borders
and there were already people you know

10564
03:22:40,550 --> 03:22:40,560
and there were already people you know
 

10565
03:22:40,560 --> 03:22:43,010
and there were already people you know
who there are already cases known to

10566
03:22:43,010 --> 03:22:43,020
who there are already cases known to
 

10567
03:22:43,020 --> 03:22:45,170
who there are already cases known to
many of us personally in the U.S at that

10568
03:22:45,170 --> 03:22:45,180
many of us personally in the U.S at that
 

10569
03:22:45,180 --> 03:22:46,370
many of us personally in the U.S at that
point

10570
03:22:46,370 --> 03:22:46,380
point
 

10571
03:22:46,380 --> 03:22:47,750
point
um

10572
03:22:47,750 --> 03:22:47,760
um
 

10573
03:22:47,760 --> 03:22:50,210
um
and

10574
03:22:50,210 --> 03:22:50,220
and
 

10575
03:22:50,220 --> 03:22:51,889
and
he was operating by a very different

10576
03:22:51,889 --> 03:22:51,899
he was operating by a very different
 

10577
03:22:51,899 --> 03:22:54,710
he was operating by a very different
logic that I couldn't engage with sure

10578
03:22:54,710 --> 03:22:54,720
logic that I couldn't engage with sure
 

10579
03:22:54,720 --> 03:22:56,690
logic that I couldn't engage with sure
but the logic represents

10580
03:22:56,690 --> 03:22:56,700
but the logic represents
 

10581
03:22:56,700 --> 03:22:58,849
but the logic represents
a part of the population and there's a

10582
03:22:58,849 --> 03:22:58,859
a part of the population and there's a
 

10583
03:22:58,859 --> 03:23:00,650
a part of the population and there's a
lot of interesting topics that have a

10584
03:23:00,650 --> 03:23:00,660
lot of interesting topics that have a
 

10585
03:23:00,660 --> 03:23:02,450
lot of interesting topics that have a
lot of uncertainty around them like the

10586
03:23:02,450 --> 03:23:02,460
lot of uncertainty around them like the
 

10587
03:23:02,460 --> 03:23:04,730
lot of uncertainty around them like the
effectiveness of masks like yeah but no

10588
03:23:04,730 --> 03:23:04,740
effectiveness of masks like yeah but no
 

10589
03:23:04,740 --> 03:23:07,370
effectiveness of masks like yeah but no
but where things broke down was not at

10590
03:23:07,370 --> 03:23:07,380
but where things broke down was not at
 

10591
03:23:07,380 --> 03:23:09,110
but where things broke down was not at
the point of oh there's a lot to talk

10592
03:23:09,110 --> 03:23:09,120
the point of oh there's a lot to talk
 

10593
03:23:09,120 --> 03:23:10,550
the point of oh there's a lot to talk
about a lot to debate this is all very

10594
03:23:10,550 --> 03:23:10,560
about a lot to debate this is all very
 

10595
03:23:10,560 --> 03:23:13,309
about a lot to debate this is all very
interesting and who knows what's what it

10596
03:23:13,309 --> 03:23:13,319
interesting and who knows what's what it
 

10597
03:23:13,319 --> 03:23:15,590
interesting and who knows what's what it
broke down very early at

10598
03:23:15,590 --> 03:23:15,600
broke down very early at
 

10599
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:18,469
broke down very early at
this is you know

10600
03:23:18,469 --> 03:23:18,479
this is you know
 

10601
03:23:18,479 --> 03:23:20,630
this is you know
there's nothing to talk about here like

10602
03:23:20,630 --> 03:23:20,640
there's nothing to talk about here like
 

10603
03:23:20,640 --> 03:23:23,269
there's nothing to talk about here like
it like it's like either there's a water

10604
03:23:23,269 --> 03:23:23,279
it like it's like either there's a water
 

10605
03:23:23,279 --> 03:23:25,070
it like it's like either there's a water
bottle on the table or there isn't right

10606
03:23:25,070 --> 03:23:25,080
bottle on the table or there isn't right
 

10607
03:23:25,080 --> 03:23:26,630
bottle on the table or there isn't right
like

10608
03:23:26,630 --> 03:23:26,640
like
 

10609
03:23:26,640 --> 03:23:29,210
like
it well technically there's only one

10610
03:23:29,210 --> 03:23:29,220
it well technically there's only one
 

10611
03:23:29,220 --> 03:23:31,550
it well technically there's only one
fourth of a water bottle right yeah

10612
03:23:31,550 --> 03:23:31,560
fourth of a water bottle right yeah
 

10613
03:23:31,560 --> 03:23:33,469
fourth of a water bottle right yeah
so what defines a water bottle is it the

10614
03:23:33,469 --> 03:23:33,479
so what defines a water bottle is it the
 

10615
03:23:33,479 --> 03:23:35,030
so what defines a water bottle is it the
water inside the water bottle is it the

10616
03:23:35,030 --> 03:23:35,040
water inside the water bottle is it the
 

10617
03:23:35,040 --> 03:23:36,830
water inside the water bottle is it the
water bottle what I'm giving you is an

10618
03:23:36,830 --> 03:23:36,840
water bottle what I'm giving you is an
 

10619
03:23:36,840 --> 03:23:39,050
water bottle what I'm giving you is an
example of is worth a conversation

10620
03:23:39,050 --> 03:23:39,060
example of is worth a conversation
 

10621
03:23:39,060 --> 03:23:40,910
example of is worth a conversation
this is difficult because this is we had

10622
03:23:40,910 --> 03:23:40,920
this is difficult because this is we had
 

10623
03:23:40,920 --> 03:23:42,530
this is difficult because this is we had
an exchange in private and I want to

10653
03:24:19,620 --> 03:24:23,030
taking that issue seriously I mean he
and I went to that initial uh conference

10654
03:24:23,030 --> 03:24:23,040
and I went to that initial uh conference
 

10655
03:24:23,040 --> 03:24:25,010
and I went to that initial uh conference
in Puerto Rico together and it was only

10656
03:24:25,010 --> 03:24:25,020
in Puerto Rico together and it was only
 

10657
03:24:25,020 --> 03:24:27,349
in Puerto Rico together and it was only
because he was going and I found out

10658
03:24:27,349 --> 03:24:27,359
because he was going and I found out
 

10659
03:24:27,359 --> 03:24:29,510
because he was going and I found out
about it through him and I just wrote

10660
03:24:29,510 --> 03:24:29,520
about it through him and I just wrote
 

10661
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:31,790
about it through him and I just wrote
his coattails to it you know that I that

10662
03:24:31,790 --> 03:24:31,800
his coattails to it you know that I that
 

10663
03:24:31,800 --> 03:24:33,170
his coattails to it you know that I that
I got to

10664
03:24:33,170 --> 03:24:33,180
I got to
 

10665
03:24:33,180 --> 03:24:36,590
I got to
dropped in that side of the pool uh to

10666
03:24:36,590 --> 03:24:36,600
dropped in that side of the pool uh to
 

10667
03:24:36,600 --> 03:24:38,570
dropped in that side of the pool uh to
hear about these concerns at that point

10668
03:24:38,570 --> 03:24:38,580
hear about these concerns at that point
 

10669
03:24:38,580 --> 03:24:41,090
hear about these concerns at that point
it would be interesting to hear how is

10670
03:24:41,090 --> 03:24:41,100
it would be interesting to hear how is
 

10671
03:24:41,100 --> 03:24:43,870
it would be interesting to hear how is
your concerned concern

10672
03:24:43,870 --> 03:24:43,880
your concerned concern
 

10673
03:24:43,880 --> 03:24:45,530
your concerned concern
evolved

10674
03:24:45,530 --> 03:24:45,540
evolved
 

10675
03:24:45,540 --> 03:24:48,170
evolved
with the coming out of Chad GPT

some incredible human-like things
 

10685
03:24:57,420 --> 03:24:59,870
some incredible human-like things
there's two questions one how is your

10686
03:24:59,870 --> 03:24:59,880
there's two questions one how is your
 

10687
03:24:59,880 --> 03:25:01,729
there's two questions one how is your
concern in terms of AGI and super

10688
03:25:01,729 --> 03:25:01,739
concern in terms of AGI and super
 

10689
03:25:01,739 --> 03:25:04,070
concern in terms of AGI and super
intelligence evolved and how impressed

10690
03:25:04,070 --> 03:25:04,080
intelligence evolved and how impressed
 

10691
03:25:04,080 --> 03:25:06,590
intelligence evolved and how impressed
that you would chat gbt as a as a

10692
03:25:06,590 --> 03:25:06,600
that you would chat gbt as a as a
 

10693

well my concern about AGI is unchanged

10698
03:25:13,729 --> 03:25:13,739
well my concern about AGI is unchanged
 

10699
03:25:13,739 --> 03:25:17,450
well my concern about AGI is unchanged
and so I I did a I've spoken about it a

10700
03:25:17,450 --> 03:25:17,460
and so I I did a I've spoken about it a
 

10701
03:25:17,460 --> 03:25:19,250
and so I I did a I've spoken about it a
bunch on my podcast but you know I did a

10702
03:25:19,250 --> 03:25:19,260
bunch on my podcast but you know I did a
 

10703
03:25:19,260 --> 03:25:22,729
bunch on my podcast but you know I did a
TED Talk in 2016 which was the the kind

10704
03:25:22,729 --> 03:25:22,739
TED Talk in 2016 which was the the kind
 

10705
03:25:22,739 --> 03:25:24,110
TED Talk in 2016 which was the the kind
of summary of

10706
03:25:24,110 --> 03:25:24,120
of summary of
 

10707
03:25:24,120 --> 03:25:26,889
of summary of
what that conference and and you know

10708
03:25:26,889 --> 03:25:26,899
what that conference and and you know
 

10709
03:25:26,899 --> 03:25:29,750
what that conference and and you know
various conversations I had after that

10710
03:25:29,750 --> 03:25:29,760
various conversations I had after that
 

10711
03:25:29,760 --> 03:25:33,469
various conversations I had after that
did to my my brain on this topic

10712
03:25:33,469 --> 03:25:33,479
did to my my brain on this topic
 

10713
03:25:33,479 --> 03:25:36,349
did to my my brain on this topic
um basically that once super

10714
03:25:36,349 --> 03:25:36,359
um basically that once super
 

10715
03:25:36,359 --> 03:25:38,929
um basically that once super
intelligence is achieved there's a take

10716
03:25:38,929 --> 03:25:38,939
intelligence is achieved there's a take
 

10717
03:25:38,939 --> 03:25:42,290
intelligence is achieved there's a take
off it becomes exponentially smarter and

10718
03:25:42,290 --> 03:25:42,300
off it becomes exponentially smarter and
 

10719
03:25:42,300 --> 03:25:44,809
off it becomes exponentially smarter and
in a matter of time there's just we're

10720
03:25:44,809 --> 03:25:44,819
in a matter of time there's just we're
 

10721
03:25:44,819 --> 03:25:47,690
in a matter of time there's just we're
ants and they're Gods well yeah unless

10722
03:25:47,690 --> 03:25:47,700
ants and they're Gods well yeah unless
 

10723
03:25:47,700 --> 03:25:50,210
ants and they're Gods well yeah unless
we find some way of

10724
03:25:50,210 --> 03:25:50,220
we find some way of
 

10725
03:25:50,220 --> 03:25:53,990
we find some way of
dude permanently tethering

10726
03:25:53,990 --> 03:25:54,000
dude permanently tethering
 

10727
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:57,889
dude permanently tethering
a a self a a super intelligent super

10728
03:25:57,889 --> 03:25:57,899
a a self a a super intelligent super
 

10729
03:25:57,899 --> 03:26:00,229
a a self a a super intelligent super
intelligent self-improving AI to our

10730
03:26:00,229 --> 03:26:00,239
intelligent self-improving AI to our
 

10731
03:26:00,239 --> 03:26:02,210
intelligent self-improving AI to our
value system and I you know I don't

10732
03:26:02,210 --> 03:26:02,220
value system and I you know I don't
 

10733
03:26:02,220 --> 03:26:03,590
value system and I you know I don't
believe anyone has

10734
03:26:03,590 --> 03:26:03,600
believe anyone has
 

10735
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:04,849
believe anyone has
figured out how to do that or whether

10736
03:26:04,849 --> 03:26:04,859
figured out how to do that or whether
 

10737
03:26:04,859 --> 03:26:06,410
figured out how to do that or whether
that's even possible in principle and I

10738
03:26:06,410 --> 03:26:06,420
that's even possible in principle and I
 

10739
03:26:06,420 --> 03:26:07,790
that's even possible in principle and I
know people like Stuart Russell who I

10740
03:26:07,790 --> 03:26:07,800
know people like Stuart Russell who I
 

10741
03:26:07,800 --> 03:26:09,889
know people like Stuart Russell who I
just had on my podcast

10742
03:26:09,889 --> 03:26:09,899
just had on my podcast
 

10743
03:26:09,899 --> 03:26:13,130
just had on my podcast
um are oh really have You released it I

10744
03:26:13,130 --> 03:26:13,140
um are oh really have You released it I
 

10745
03:26:13,140 --> 03:26:14,690
um are oh really have You released it I
haven't released it yet yeah he's been

10746
03:26:14,690 --> 03:26:14,700
haven't released it yet yeah he's been
 

10747
03:26:14,700 --> 03:26:16,070
haven't released it yet yeah he's been
on previous podcasts but we just

10748
03:26:16,070 --> 03:26:16,080
on previous podcasts but we just
 

10749
03:26:16,080 --> 03:26:18,229
on previous podcasts but we just
recorded this week because you haven't

10750
03:26:18,229 --> 03:26:18,239
recorded this week because you haven't
 

10751
03:26:18,239 --> 03:26:19,910
recorded this week because you haven't
done an AI podcast in a while so yeah

10752
03:26:19,910 --> 03:26:19,920
done an AI podcast in a while so yeah
 

10753
03:26:19,920 --> 03:26:21,830
done an AI podcast in a while so yeah
it's great yeah he's a good person to

10754
03:26:21,830 --> 03:26:21,840
it's great yeah he's a good person to
 

10755
03:26:21,840 --> 03:26:23,870
it's great yeah he's a good person to
talk about alignment with yeah so Stuart

10756
03:26:23,870 --> 03:26:23,880
talk about alignment with yeah so Stuart
 

10757
03:26:23,880 --> 03:26:26,750
talk about alignment with yeah so Stuart
I mean Stewart is has been you know

10758
03:26:26,750 --> 03:26:26,760
I mean Stewart is has been you know
 

10759
03:26:26,760 --> 03:26:29,150
I mean Stewart is has been you know
probably more than anyone my Guru on

10760
03:26:29,150 --> 03:26:29,160
probably more than anyone my Guru on
 

10761
03:26:29,160 --> 03:26:30,590
probably more than anyone my Guru on
this topic I mean like just reading his

10762
03:26:30,590 --> 03:26:30,600
this topic I mean like just reading his
 

10763
03:26:30,600 --> 03:26:33,290
this topic I mean like just reading his
book and doing I think I've done two

10764
03:26:33,290 --> 03:26:33,300
book and doing I think I've done two
 

10765
03:26:33,300 --> 03:26:34,729
book and doing I think I've done two
podcasts with them at this point I think

10766
03:26:34,729 --> 03:26:34,739
podcasts with them at this point I think
 

10767
03:26:34,739 --> 03:26:36,349
podcasts with them at this point I think
it's called the control problem or

10768
03:26:36,349 --> 03:26:36,359
it's called the control problem or
 

10769
03:26:36,359 --> 03:26:38,090
it's called the control problem or
something like that his is uh his book

10770
03:26:38,090 --> 03:26:38,100
something like that his is uh his book
 

10771
03:26:38,100 --> 03:26:39,889
something like that his is uh his book
is human compatible human compatible

10772
03:26:39,889 --> 03:26:39,899
is human compatible human compatible
 

10773
03:26:39,899 --> 03:26:42,170
is human compatible human compatible
yeah he talks about the control problem

10774
03:26:42,170 --> 03:26:42,180
yeah he talks about the control problem
 

10775
03:26:42,180 --> 03:26:43,550
yeah he talks about the control problem
and

10776
03:26:43,550 --> 03:26:43,560
and
 

10777
03:26:43,560 --> 03:26:46,130
and
yeah so I just think the idea that we

10778
03:26:46,130 --> 03:26:46,140
yeah so I just think the idea that we
 

10779
03:26:46,140 --> 03:26:49,190
yeah so I just think the idea that we
can define a value function in advance

10780
03:26:49,190 --> 03:26:49,200
can define a value function in advance
 

10781
03:26:49,200 --> 03:26:52,370
can define a value function in advance
that permanently tethers a a

10782
03:26:52,370 --> 03:26:52,380
that permanently tethers a a
 

10783
03:26:52,380 --> 03:26:56,630
that permanently tethers a a
self-improving super intelligent AI to

10784
03:26:56,630 --> 03:26:56,640
self-improving super intelligent AI to
 

10785
03:26:56,640 --> 03:27:00,229
self-improving super intelligent AI to
R values as we continue to

10786
03:27:00,229 --> 03:27:00,239
R values as we continue to
 

10787
03:27:00,239 --> 03:27:02,929
R values as we continue to
discover them refine them extrapolate

10788
03:27:02,929 --> 03:27:02,939
discover them refine them extrapolate
 

10789
03:27:02,939 --> 03:27:04,250
discover them refine them extrapolate
them

10790
03:27:04,250 --> 03:27:04,260
them
 

10791
03:27:04,260 --> 03:27:06,889
them
um in an open-ended way

10792
03:27:06,889 --> 03:27:06,899
um in an open-ended way
 

10793
03:27:06,899 --> 03:27:08,870
um in an open-ended way
I think that's a tall order and there I

10794
03:27:08,870 --> 03:27:08,880
I think that's a tall order and there I
 

10795
03:27:08,880 --> 03:27:10,190
I think that's a tall order and there I
think there are many more ways there

10796
03:27:10,190 --> 03:27:10,200
think there are many more ways there
 

10797
03:27:10,200 --> 03:27:11,929
think there are many more ways there
must be many more ways of Designing

10798
03:27:11,929 --> 03:27:11,939
must be many more ways of Designing
 

10799
03:27:11,939 --> 03:27:15,050
must be many more ways of Designing
super intelligence that is not aligned

10800
03:27:15,050 --> 03:27:15,060
super intelligence that is not aligned
 

10801
03:27:15,060 --> 03:27:16,990
super intelligence that is not aligned
in that way and is not ever

10802
03:27:16,990 --> 03:27:17,000
in that way and is not ever
 

10803
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:19,550
in that way and is not ever
approximating our values in that way so

10804
03:27:19,550 --> 03:27:19,560
approximating our values in that way so
 

10805
03:27:19,560 --> 03:27:21,889
approximating our values in that way so
I mean Stewart's idea to

10806
03:27:21,889 --> 03:27:21,899
I mean Stewart's idea to
 

10807
03:27:21,899 --> 03:27:25,429
I mean Stewart's idea to
put it in a very simple way is that

10808
03:27:25,429 --> 03:27:25,439
put it in a very simple way is that
 

10809
03:27:25,439 --> 03:27:27,349
put it in a very simple way is that
he thinks you don't want to specify the

10810
03:27:27,349 --> 03:27:27,359
he thinks you don't want to specify the
 

10811
03:27:27,359 --> 03:27:28,610
he thinks you don't want to specify the
value function up front you don't you

10812
03:27:28,610 --> 03:27:28,620
value function up front you don't you
 

10813
03:27:28,620 --> 03:27:29,830
value function up front you don't you
don't want to imagine you could ever

10814
03:27:29,830 --> 03:27:29,840
don't want to imagine you could ever
 

10815
03:27:29,840 --> 03:27:31,969
don't want to imagine you could ever
write the code

10816
03:27:31,969 --> 03:27:31,979
write the code
 

10817
03:27:31,979 --> 03:27:35,450
write the code
in such a way as to admit of no loophole

10818
03:27:35,450 --> 03:27:35,460
in such a way as to admit of no loophole
 

10819
03:27:35,460 --> 03:27:37,370
in such a way as to admit of no loophole
you want to

10820
03:27:37,370 --> 03:27:37,380
you want to
 

10821
03:27:37,380 --> 03:27:40,910
you want to
make the AI uncertain as to what human

10822
03:27:40,910 --> 03:27:40,920
make the AI uncertain as to what human
 

10823
03:27:40,920 --> 03:27:44,150
make the AI uncertain as to what human
values are and perpetually uncertain and

10824
03:27:44,150 --> 03:27:44,160
values are and perpetually uncertain and
 

10825
03:27:44,160 --> 03:27:46,790
values are and perpetually uncertain and
always trying to ameliorate that

10826
03:27:46,790 --> 03:27:46,800
always trying to ameliorate that
 

10827
03:27:46,800 --> 03:27:48,830
always trying to ameliorate that
uncertainty by by hewing more and more

10828
03:27:48,830 --> 03:27:48,840
uncertainty by by hewing more and more
 

10829
03:27:48,840 --> 03:27:50,870
uncertainty by by hewing more and more
closely to what our professed values are

10830
03:27:50,870 --> 03:27:50,880
closely to what our professed values are
 

10831
03:27:50,880 --> 03:27:54,229
closely to what our professed values are
so like this it's always interested in

10832
03:27:54,229 --> 03:27:54,239
so like this it's always interested in
 

10833
03:27:54,239 --> 03:27:56,150
so like this it's always interested in
uh saying oh no no that's not what we

10834
03:27:56,150 --> 03:27:56,160
uh saying oh no no that's not what we
 

10835
03:27:56,160 --> 03:27:57,769
uh saying oh no no that's not what we
want that's not what we intend stop

10836
03:27:57,769 --> 03:27:57,779
want that's not what we intend stop
 

10837
03:27:57,779 --> 03:27:59,690
want that's not what we intend stop
doing that right no matter how smart it

10838
03:27:59,690 --> 03:27:59,700
doing that right no matter how smart it
 

10839
03:27:59,700 --> 03:28:01,610
doing that right no matter how smart it
gets all it wants to do is more

10840
03:28:01,610 --> 03:28:01,620
gets all it wants to do is more
 

10841
03:28:01,620 --> 03:28:04,309
gets all it wants to do is more
perfectly approximate human values I

10842
03:28:04,309 --> 03:28:04,319
perfectly approximate human values I
 

10843
03:28:04,319 --> 03:28:06,710
perfectly approximate human values I
think there are a lot of problems with

10844
03:28:06,710 --> 03:28:06,720
think there are a lot of problems with
 

10845
03:28:06,720 --> 03:28:08,570
think there are a lot of problems with
that you know at a high level I'm not a

10846
03:28:08,570 --> 03:28:08,580
that you know at a high level I'm not a
 

10847
03:28:08,580 --> 03:28:10,010
that you know at a high level I'm not a
computer scientist so I'm sure there are

10848
03:28:10,010 --> 03:28:10,020
computer scientist so I'm sure there are
 

10849
03:28:10,020 --> 03:28:11,389
computer scientist so I'm sure there are
many problems at a low level that I

10850
03:28:11,389 --> 03:28:11,399
many problems at a low level that I
 

10851
03:28:11,399 --> 03:28:14,030
many problems at a low level that I
don't understand or like how to force a

10852
03:28:14,030 --> 03:28:14,040
don't understand or like how to force a
 

10853
03:28:14,040 --> 03:28:16,250
don't understand or like how to force a
human into the loop always no matter

10854
03:28:16,250 --> 03:28:16,260
human into the loop always no matter
 

10855
03:28:16,260 --> 03:28:18,290
human into the loop always no matter
what there's that and like what humans

10856
03:28:18,290 --> 03:28:18,300
what there's that and like what humans
 

10857
03:28:18,300 --> 03:28:20,870
what there's that and like what humans
get a vote and just just what is you

10858
03:28:20,870 --> 03:28:20,880
get a vote and just just what is you
 

10859
03:28:20,880 --> 03:28:23,870
get a vote and just just what is you
know what what do humans value and what

10860
03:28:23,870 --> 03:28:23,880
know what what do humans value and what
 

10861
03:28:23,880 --> 03:28:26,330
know what what do humans value and what
is the difference between what we say we

10862
03:28:26,330 --> 03:28:26,340
is the difference between what we say we
 

10863
03:28:26,340 --> 03:28:29,229
is the difference between what we say we
value and our revealed preferences which

10864
03:28:29,229 --> 03:28:29,239
value and our revealed preferences which
 

10865
03:28:29,239 --> 03:28:32,030
value and our revealed preferences which
I mean if you just if you were a super

10866
03:28:32,030 --> 03:28:32,040
I mean if you just if you were a super
 

10867
03:28:32,040 --> 03:28:34,510
I mean if you just if you were a super
intelligent AI they could look at

10868
03:28:34,510 --> 03:28:34,520
intelligent AI they could look at
 

10869
03:28:34,520 --> 03:28:36,469
intelligent AI they could look at
Humanity now

10870
03:28:36,469 --> 03:28:36,479
Humanity now
 

10871
03:28:36,479 --> 03:28:38,570
Humanity now
I think you could be forgiven for

10872
03:28:38,570 --> 03:28:38,580
I think you could be forgiven for
 

10873
03:28:38,580 --> 03:28:41,809
I think you could be forgiven for
concluding that what we value is

10874
03:28:41,809 --> 03:28:41,819
concluding that what we value is
 

10875
03:28:41,819 --> 03:28:44,150
concluding that what we value is
driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and

10876
03:28:44,150 --> 03:28:44,160
driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and
 

10877
03:28:44,160 --> 03:28:45,889
driving ourselves crazy with Twitter and
living perpetually on the brink of

10878
03:28:45,889 --> 03:28:45,899
living perpetually on the brink of
 

10879
03:28:45,899 --> 03:28:49,309
living perpetually on the brink of
nuclear war and you know just watching

10880
03:28:49,309 --> 03:28:49,319
nuclear war and you know just watching
 

10881
03:28:49,319 --> 03:28:51,530
nuclear war and you know just watching
you know of hot girls and yoga pants on

10882
03:28:51,530 --> 03:28:51,540
you know of hot girls and yoga pants on
 

10883
03:28:51,540 --> 03:28:53,150
you know of hot girls and yoga pants on
Tick Tock again and again and again it's

10884
03:28:53,150 --> 03:28:53,160
Tick Tock again and again and again it's
 

10885
03:28:53,160 --> 03:28:55,070
Tick Tock again and again and again it's
like when you're saying that is not this

10886
03:28:55,070 --> 03:28:55,080
like when you're saying that is not this
 

10887
03:28:55,080 --> 03:28:57,950
like when you're saying that is not this
is this is all revealed preference and

10888
03:28:57,950 --> 03:28:57,960
is this is all revealed preference and
 

10889
03:28:57,960 --> 03:29:00,290
is this is all revealed preference and
it's what is an AI to make of that right

10890
03:29:00,290 --> 03:29:00,300
it's what is an AI to make of that right
 

10891
03:29:00,300 --> 03:29:03,290
it's what is an AI to make of that right
and what should it optimize like so

10892
03:29:03,290 --> 03:29:03,300
and what should it optimize like so
 

10893
03:29:03,300 --> 03:29:05,269
and what should it optimize like so
part of the this is

10894
03:29:05,269 --> 03:29:05,279
part of the this is
 

10895
03:29:05,279 --> 03:29:07,610
part of the this is
also Stewart's observation that

10896
03:29:07,610 --> 03:29:07,620
also Stewart's observation that
 

10897
03:29:07,620 --> 03:29:09,530
also Stewart's observation that
one of the Insidious things about like

10898
03:29:09,530 --> 03:29:09,540
one of the Insidious things about like
 

10899
03:29:09,540 --> 03:29:11,269
one of the Insidious things about like
the YouTube algorithm is it's not that

10900
03:29:11,269 --> 03:29:11,279
the YouTube algorithm is it's not that
 

10901
03:29:11,279 --> 03:29:13,010
the YouTube algorithm is it's not that
it just caters

10902
03:29:13,010 --> 03:29:13,020
it just caters
 

10903
03:29:13,020 --> 03:29:17,269
it just caters
to our preferences it actually begins to

10904
03:29:17,269 --> 03:29:17,279
to our preferences it actually begins to
 

10905
03:29:17,279 --> 03:29:19,610
to our preferences it actually begins to
change Us in ways so as to make us more

10906
03:29:19,610 --> 03:29:19,620
change Us in ways so as to make us more
 

10907
03:29:19,620 --> 03:29:21,950
change Us in ways so as to make us more
predictable if I could find ways to make

10908
03:29:21,950 --> 03:29:21,960
predictable if I could find ways to make
 

10909
03:29:21,960 --> 03:29:25,190
predictable if I could find ways to make
us a better reporter of our of our

10910
03:29:25,190 --> 03:29:25,200
us a better reporter of our of our
 

10911
03:29:25,200 --> 03:29:27,229
us a better reporter of our of our
preferences uh and to trim our

10912
03:29:27,229 --> 03:29:27,239
preferences uh and to trim our
 

10913
03:29:27,239 --> 03:29:30,530
preferences uh and to trim our
preferences down so that it can can uh

10914
03:29:30,530 --> 03:29:30,540
preferences down so that it can can uh
 

10915
03:29:30,540 --> 03:29:33,170
preferences down so that it can can uh
further train to that signal so

10916
03:29:33,170 --> 03:29:33,180
further train to that signal so
 

10917
03:29:33,180 --> 03:29:35,510
further train to that signal so
the main concern is that

10918
03:29:35,510 --> 03:29:35,520
the main concern is that
 

10919
03:29:35,520 --> 03:29:38,690
the main concern is that
most of the people in the field seem not

10920
03:29:38,690 --> 03:29:38,700
most of the people in the field seem not
 

10921
03:29:38,700 --> 03:29:40,070
most of the people in the field seem not
to be taking

10922
03:29:40,070 --> 03:29:40,080
to be taking
 

10923
03:29:40,080 --> 03:29:43,790
to be taking
intelligence seriously like as as they

intelligence seriously like as as they
 

10925
03:29:43,800 --> 03:29:44,870
intelligence seriously like as as they
design

10926
03:29:44,870 --> 03:29:44,880
design
 

10927
03:29:44,880 --> 03:29:46,610
design
more and more intelligent machines and

03:29:46,610 --> 03:29:46,620
more and more intelligent machines and
 

10929
03:29:46,620 --> 03:29:49,849
more and more intelligent machines and
as they profess to want to design true

10930
03:29:49,849 --> 03:29:49,859

how to do this safely above all

how to do this safely above all

how to do this safely above all
they're just assuming that these

they're just assuming that these

they're just assuming that these

these problems are going to solve

know an AI would never form a motive to

unless we put that motive in there right

10962
03:30:26,510 --> 03:30:26,520
unless we put that motive in there right
 

10963
03:30:26,520 --> 03:30:28,190
unless we put that motive in there right
and that's that's not the concern the

10964
03:30:28,190 --> 03:30:28,200
and that's that's not the concern the
 

10965
03:30:28,200 --> 03:30:30,950
and that's that's not the concern the
concern is that in the presence of

10966
03:30:30,950 --> 03:30:30,960
concern is that in the presence of
 

10967
03:30:30,960 --> 03:30:34,670
concern is that in the presence of
of vast disparities in competence

10968
03:30:34,670 --> 03:30:34,680
of vast disparities in competence
 

10969
03:30:34,680 --> 03:30:38,330
of vast disparities in competence
and in certainly in a condition where

10970
03:30:38,330 --> 03:30:38,340
and in certainly in a condition where
 

10971
03:30:38,340 --> 03:30:39,590
and in certainly in a condition where
these the machines are improving

instrumental goals
 

10979
03:30:46,380 --> 03:30:48,530
instrumental goals
that are antithetical to our well-being

to harm insects on a daily basis but
 

10995
03:31:03,899 --> 03:31:05,570
to harm insects on a daily basis but
there are many things we could intend to

there are many things we could intend to
 

10997
03:31:05,580 --> 03:31:08,530
there are many things we could intend to
do that would in fact harm insects

do that would in fact harm insects

you're just not

you're just not
 

11007
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:17,269
you're just not
taking the the interest of insects into

taking the the interest of insects into
 

11009
03:31:17,279 --> 03:31:19,550
taking the the interest of insects into

you in terms of your cognitive Horizons
 

11013
03:31:23,279 --> 03:31:26,269
you in terms of your cognitive Horizons
and the so that the real challenge here

11014
03:31:26,269 --> 03:31:26,279
and the so that the real challenge here
 

11015
03:31:26,279 --> 03:31:28,250
and the so that the real challenge here
is that

11016
03:31:28,250 --> 03:31:28,260
is that
 

11017
03:31:28,260 --> 03:31:30,769
is that
if you believe that intelligence you

11018
03:31:30,769 --> 03:31:30,779
if you believe that intelligence you
 

11019
03:31:30,779 --> 03:31:33,710
if you believe that intelligence you
know scales up on a Continuum to toward

11020
03:31:33,710 --> 03:31:33,720
know scales up on a Continuum to toward
 

11021
03:31:33,720 --> 03:31:35,510
know scales up on a Continuum to toward
Heights that

11022
03:31:35,510 --> 03:31:35,520
Heights that
 

11023
03:31:35,520 --> 03:31:37,550
Heights that
we can only dimly imagine and I think

11024
03:31:37,550 --> 03:31:37,560
we can only dimly imagine and I think
 

11025
03:31:37,560 --> 03:31:38,630
we can only dimly imagine and I think
there's every reason to believe that

11026
03:31:38,630 --> 03:31:38,640
there's every reason to believe that
 

11027
03:31:38,640 --> 03:31:40,190
there's every reason to believe that
there's no reason to believe that we're

11028
03:31:40,190 --> 03:31:40,200
there's no reason to believe that we're
 

11029
03:31:40,200 --> 03:31:43,130
there's no reason to believe that we're
near the summit of intelligence

11030
03:31:43,130 --> 03:31:43,140
near the summit of intelligence
 

11031
03:31:43,140 --> 03:31:44,690
near the summit of intelligence
um and you can Define you know Define

11032
03:31:44,690 --> 03:31:44,700
um and you can Define you know Define
 

11033
03:31:44,700 --> 03:31:47,090
um and you can Define you know Define
maybe maybe there's

11034
03:31:47,090 --> 03:31:47,100
maybe maybe there's
 

11035
03:31:47,100 --> 03:31:48,769
maybe maybe there's
maybe there's some forms of intelligence

11036
03:31:48,769 --> 03:31:48,779
maybe there's some forms of intelligence
 

11037
03:31:48,779 --> 03:31:51,229
maybe there's some forms of intelligence
for which this is not true but

11038
03:31:51,229 --> 03:31:51,239
for which this is not true but
 

11039
03:31:51,239 --> 03:31:53,750
for which this is not true but
for for many relevant forms you know

11040
03:31:53,750 --> 03:31:53,760
for for many relevant forms you know
 

11041
03:31:53,760 --> 03:31:56,030
for for many relevant forms you know
like the top 100 things we care about

11042
03:31:56,030 --> 03:31:56,040
like the top 100 things we care about
 

11043
03:31:56,040 --> 03:31:58,309
like the top 100 things we care about
cognitively I think there's every reason

11044
03:31:58,309 --> 03:31:58,319
cognitively I think there's every reason
 

11045
03:31:58,319 --> 03:31:59,809
cognitively I think there's every reason
to believe that many of those things

11046
03:31:59,809 --> 03:31:59,819
to believe that many of those things
 

11047
03:31:59,819 --> 03:32:01,550
to believe that many of those things
most of those things

11048
03:32:01,550 --> 03:32:01,560
most of those things
 

11049
03:32:01,560 --> 03:32:04,550
most of those things
are a lot like chess or go where once

11050
03:32:04,550 --> 03:32:04,560
are a lot like chess or go where once
 

11051
03:32:04,560 --> 03:32:06,170
are a lot like chess or go where once
the machines get better than we are

11052
03:32:06,170 --> 03:32:06,180
the machines get better than we are
 

11053
03:32:06,180 --> 03:32:07,490
the machines get better than we are
they're going to stay better than we are

11054
03:32:07,490 --> 03:32:07,500
they're going to stay better than we are
 

11055
03:32:07,500 --> 03:32:08,990
they're going to stay better than we are
although they're I don't know if you

11056
03:32:08,990 --> 03:32:09,000
although they're I don't know if you
 

11057
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:11,150
although they're I don't know if you
caught the recent thing with go we're in

11058
03:32:11,150 --> 03:32:11,160
caught the recent thing with go we're in
 

11059
03:32:11,160 --> 03:32:12,349
caught the recent thing with go we're in
this actually came out of Stewart's lab

11060
03:32:12,349 --> 03:32:12,359
this actually came out of Stewart's lab
 

11061
03:32:12,359 --> 03:32:16,070
this actually came out of Stewart's lab
yeah yeah yeah one time a human beat a

11062
03:32:16,070 --> 03:32:16,080
yeah yeah yeah one time a human beat a
 

11063
03:32:16,080 --> 03:32:18,889
yeah yeah yeah one time a human beat a
machine and yeah they found a hack for

11064
03:32:18,889 --> 03:32:18,899
machine and yeah they found a hack for
 

11065
03:32:18,899 --> 03:32:21,950
machine and yeah they found a hack for
that but anyway in the ultimately

11066
03:32:21,950 --> 03:32:21,960
that but anyway in the ultimately
 

11067
03:32:21,960 --> 03:32:24,050
that but anyway in the ultimately
there's going to be no looking back and

11068
03:32:24,050 --> 03:32:24,060
there's going to be no looking back and
 

11069
03:32:24,060 --> 03:32:26,570
there's going to be no looking back and
then the question is

11070
03:32:26,570 --> 03:32:26,580
then the question is
 

11071
03:32:26,580 --> 03:32:29,510
then the question is
what do you what do we do in relate in

11072
03:32:29,510 --> 03:32:29,520
what do you what do we do in relate in
 

11073
03:32:29,520 --> 03:32:32,809
what do you what do we do in relate in
relationship to these systems that are

11074
03:32:32,809 --> 03:32:32,819
relationship to these systems that are
 

11075
03:32:32,819 --> 03:32:34,670
relationship to these systems that are
more competent than we are in every

11076
03:32:34,670 --> 03:32:34,680
more competent than we are in every
 

11077
03:32:34,680 --> 03:32:37,250
more competent than we are in every
relevant respect because it will be a

11078
03:32:37,250 --> 03:32:37,260
relevant respect because it will be a
 

11079
03:32:37,260 --> 03:32:39,469
relevant respect because it will be a
relationship it's not like the people

11080
03:32:39,469 --> 03:32:39,479
relationship it's not like the people
 

11081
03:32:39,479 --> 03:32:41,750
relationship it's not like the people
the people who think we're just going to

11082
03:32:41,750 --> 03:32:41,760
the people who think we're just going to
 

11083
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:43,550
the people who think we're just going to
figure this all out

11084
03:32:43,550 --> 03:32:43,560
figure this all out
 

11085
03:32:43,560 --> 03:32:45,590
figure this all out
you know without thinking about it in

11086
03:32:45,590 --> 03:32:45,600
you know without thinking about it in
 

11087
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:46,969
you know without thinking about it in
advance it's just gonna these the

11088
03:32:46,969 --> 03:32:46,979
advance it's just gonna these the
 

11089
03:32:46,979 --> 03:32:47,870
advance it's just gonna these the
solutions are just going to find

11090
03:32:47,870 --> 03:32:47,880
solutions are just going to find
 

11091
03:32:47,880 --> 03:32:49,729
solutions are just going to find
themselves

11092
03:32:49,729 --> 03:32:49,739
themselves
 

11093
03:32:49,739 --> 03:32:51,170
themselves
um

11094
03:32:51,170 --> 03:32:51,180
um
 

11095
03:32:51,180 --> 03:32:53,510
um
seem not to be taking

11096
03:32:53,510 --> 03:32:53,520
seem not to be taking
 

11097
03:32:53,520 --> 03:32:56,530
seem not to be taking
the prospect of really creating

11098
03:32:56,530 --> 03:32:56,540
the prospect of really creating
 

11099
03:32:56,540 --> 03:32:59,450
the prospect of really creating
autonomous super intelligence seriously

11100
03:32:59,450 --> 03:32:59,460
autonomous super intelligence seriously
 

11101
03:32:59,460 --> 03:33:02,450
autonomous super intelligence seriously
like like what does that mean it's every

11102
03:33:02,450 --> 03:33:02,460
like like what does that mean it's every
 

11103
03:33:02,460 --> 03:33:03,849
like like what does that mean it's every
bit as

11104
03:33:03,849 --> 03:33:03,859
bit as
 

11105
03:33:03,859 --> 03:33:07,969
bit as
independent and ungovernable ultimately

11106
03:33:07,969 --> 03:33:07,979
independent and ungovernable ultimately
 

11107
03:33:07,979 --> 03:33:10,130
independent and ungovernable ultimately
as us having create I mean just imagine

11108
03:33:10,130 --> 03:33:10,140
as us having create I mean just imagine
 

11109
03:33:10,140 --> 03:33:12,769
as us having create I mean just imagine
if we created a race of people that were

11110
03:33:12,769 --> 03:33:12,779
if we created a race of people that were
 

11111
03:33:12,779 --> 03:33:15,110
if we created a race of people that were
10 times smarter than all of us like how

11112
03:33:15,110 --> 03:33:15,120
10 times smarter than all of us like how
 

11113
03:33:15,120 --> 03:33:17,150
10 times smarter than all of us like how
would we live with those people they're

11114
03:33:17,150 --> 03:33:17,160
would we live with those people they're
 

11115
03:33:17,160 --> 03:33:19,190
would we live with those people they're
10 times smarter than us right like they

11116
03:33:19,190 --> 03:33:19,200
10 times smarter than us right like they
 

11117
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:20,690
10 times smarter than us right like they
begin to talk about things we don't

11118
03:33:20,690 --> 03:33:20,700
begin to talk about things we don't
 

11119
03:33:20,700 --> 03:33:22,610
begin to talk about things we don't
understand they begin to want things we

11120
03:33:22,610 --> 03:33:22,620
understand they begin to want things we
 

11121
03:33:22,620 --> 03:33:24,349
understand they begin to want things we
don't understand they begin to view us

11122
03:33:24,349 --> 03:33:24,359
don't understand they begin to view us
 

11123
03:33:24,359 --> 03:33:26,870
don't understand they begin to view us
as obstacles to them so they're solving

11124
03:33:26,870 --> 03:33:26,880
as obstacles to them so they're solving
 

11125
03:33:26,880 --> 03:33:28,910
as obstacles to them so they're solving
those problems we're gratifying those

11126
03:33:28,910 --> 03:33:28,920
those problems we're gratifying those
 

11127
03:33:28,920 --> 03:33:29,950
those problems we're gratifying those

we become the chickens or the monkeys in

11130
03:33:32,990 --> 03:33:33,000
we become the chickens or the monkeys in
 

11131
03:33:33,000 --> 03:33:35,690
we become the chickens or the monkeys in
their presence and

11132
03:33:35,690 --> 03:33:35,700
their presence and
 

11133
03:33:35,700 --> 03:33:37,750
their presence and
I think that

11134
03:33:37,750 --> 03:33:37,760
I think that
 

11135
03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:41,809
I think that
it's but for some amazing solution of

11136
03:33:41,809 --> 03:33:41,819
it's but for some amazing solution of
 

11137
03:33:41,819 --> 03:33:44,030
it's but for some amazing solution of
the sort that Stuart is is imagining

03:33:44,030 --> 03:33:44,040
the sort that Stuart is is imagining
 

11139
03:33:44,040 --> 03:33:46,010
the sort that Stuart is is imagining
that we could somehow anchor their

11140
03:33:46,010 --> 03:33:46,020
that we could somehow anchor their
 

11141
03:33:46,020 --> 03:33:48,170
that we could somehow anchor their

reward function permanently no matter
 

11143
03:33:48,180 --> 03:33:52,070
reward function permanently no matter
how intelligent scales I think um it's

11144
03:33:52,070 --> 03:33:52,080
how intelligent scales I think um it's
 

11145
03:33:52,080 --> 03:33:54,530
how intelligent scales I think um it's
it's really worth worrying about this I

11146
03:33:54,530 --> 03:33:54,540
it's really worth worrying about this I
 

11147
03:33:54,540 --> 03:33:58,190
it's really worth worrying about this I
do I do buy the the you know the Sci-Fi

11148
03:33:58,190 --> 03:33:58,200
do I do buy the the you know the Sci-Fi
 

11149
03:33:58,200 --> 03:34:01,550
do I do buy the the you know the Sci-Fi
uh notion that this is an existential

11150
03:34:01,550 --> 03:34:01,560
uh notion that this is an existential
 

11151
03:34:01,560 --> 03:34:04,309
uh notion that this is an existential
risk if we don't do it well I worry that

11152
03:34:04,309 --> 03:34:04,319
risk if we don't do it well I worry that
 

11153
03:34:04,319 --> 03:34:05,750
risk if we don't do it well I worry that
we don't notice it

11154
03:34:05,750 --> 03:34:05,760
we don't notice it
 

11155
03:34:05,760 --> 03:34:08,150
we don't notice it
I'm I'm deeply impressed with Chad GPT

11156
03:34:08,150 --> 03:34:08,160
I'm I'm deeply impressed with Chad GPT
 

11157
03:34:08,160 --> 03:34:11,510
I'm I'm deeply impressed with Chad GPT
and I'm worried that it will become

11158
03:34:11,510 --> 03:34:11,520
and I'm worried that it will become
 

11159
03:34:11,520 --> 03:34:14,210
and I'm worried that it will become
super intelligent these language models

11160
03:34:14,210 --> 03:34:14,220
super intelligent these language models
 

11161
03:34:14,220 --> 03:34:15,469
super intelligent these language models
will become super intelligent because

11162
03:34:15,469 --> 03:34:15,479
will become super intelligent because
 

11163
03:34:15,479 --> 03:34:16,729
will become super intelligent because
they're basically trained in the

11164
03:34:16,729 --> 03:34:16,739
they're basically trained in the
 

11165
03:34:16,739 --> 03:34:18,229
they're basically trained in the
collective intelligence of the human

11166
03:34:18,229 --> 03:34:18,239
collective intelligence of the human
 

11167
03:34:18,239 --> 03:34:20,510
collective intelligence of the human
species and then it will start

11168
03:34:20,510 --> 03:34:20,520
species and then it will start
 

11169
03:34:20,520 --> 03:34:21,950
species and then it will start
controlling our Behavior if they're

11170
03:34:21,950 --> 03:34:21,960
controlling our Behavior if they're
 

11171
03:34:21,960 --> 03:34:24,290
controlling our Behavior if they're
integrated into our algorithms

11172
03:34:24,290 --> 03:34:24,300
integrated into our algorithms
 

11173
03:34:24,300 --> 03:34:26,990
integrated into our algorithms
the recommender systems and then we just

11174
03:34:26,990 --> 03:34:27,000
the recommender systems and then we just
 

11175
03:34:27,000 --> 03:34:28,370
the recommender systems and then we just
won't notice

11176
03:34:28,370 --> 03:34:28,380
won't notice
 

11177
03:34:28,380 --> 03:34:31,790
won't notice
that there's a super intelligent system

11178
03:34:31,790 --> 03:34:31,800
that there's a super intelligent system
 

11179
03:34:31,800 --> 03:34:33,950
that there's a super intelligent system
that's controlling our Behavior

11180
03:34:33,950 --> 03:34:33,960
that's controlling our Behavior
 

11181
03:34:33,960 --> 03:34:37,729
that's controlling our Behavior
well I think that's true even before far

11182
03:34:37,729 --> 03:34:37,739
well I think that's true even before far
 

11183
03:34:37,739 --> 03:34:39,290
well I think that's true even before far
before super intelligence even before

11184
03:34:39,290 --> 03:34:39,300
before super intelligence even before
 

11185
03:34:39,300 --> 03:34:41,090
before super intelligence even before
general intelligence I mean I think just

11186
03:34:41,090 --> 03:34:41,100
general intelligence I mean I think just
 

11187
03:34:41,100 --> 03:34:43,090
general intelligence I mean I think just
the narrow intelligence

11188
03:34:43,090 --> 03:34:43,100
the narrow intelligence
 

11189
03:34:43,100 --> 03:34:47,150
the narrow intelligence
of these algorithms and of what

11190
03:34:47,150 --> 03:34:47,160
of these algorithms and of what
 

11191
03:34:47,160 --> 03:34:50,750
of these algorithms and of what
something like you know chat GPT can can

11192
03:34:50,750 --> 03:34:50,760
something like you know chat GPT can can
 

11193
03:34:50,760 --> 03:34:52,429
something like you know chat GPT can can
do

11194
03:34:52,429 --> 03:34:52,439
do
 

11195
03:34:52,439 --> 03:34:55,849
do
um

11196
03:34:55,849 --> 03:34:55,859

 

11197
03:34:55,859 --> 03:34:57,469

I mean it's just

11198
03:34:57,469 --> 03:34:57,479
I mean it's just
 

11199
03:34:57,479 --> 03:34:58,849
I mean it's just
far

11200
03:34:58,849 --> 03:34:58,859
far
 

11201
03:34:58,859 --> 03:35:02,990
far
short of it developing its own goals and

11202
03:35:02,990 --> 03:35:03,000
short of it developing its own goals and
 

11203
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:05,809
short of it developing its own goals and
that is that are at Cross purposes with

11204
03:35:05,809 --> 03:35:05,819
that is that are at Cross purposes with
 

11205
03:35:05,819 --> 03:35:09,290
that is that are at Cross purposes with
ours just the just the unintended

11206
03:35:09,290 --> 03:35:09,300
ours just the just the unintended

consequences of of using it in the ways

11208
03:35:12,170 --> 03:35:12,180
consequences of of using it in the ways
 

11209
03:35:12,180 --> 03:35:14,150
consequences of of using it in the ways
we're going to be incentivized to use it

11210
03:35:14,150 --> 03:35:14,160
we're going to be incentivized to use it
 

11211
03:35:14,160 --> 03:35:15,950
we're going to be incentivized to use it
and and you know the money to be made

11212
03:35:15,950 --> 03:35:15,960
and and you know the money to be made
 

11213
03:35:15,960 --> 03:35:20,389
and and you know the money to be made
from scaling this thing and what it does

11214
03:35:20,389 --> 03:35:20,399
from scaling this thing and what it does
 

11215
03:35:20,399 --> 03:35:22,490
from scaling this thing and what it does
to to our information space and our

11216
03:35:22,490 --> 03:35:22,500
to to our information space and our
 

11217
03:35:22,500 --> 03:35:24,769
to to our information space and our
sense of of just being able to get the

11218
03:35:24,769 --> 03:35:24,779
sense of of just being able to get the
 

11219
03:35:24,779 --> 03:35:26,769
sense of of just being able to get the
ground truth of

11220
03:35:26,769 --> 03:35:26,779
ground truth of
 

11221
03:35:26,779 --> 03:35:30,590
ground truth of
on any facts it's um

11222
03:35:30,590 --> 03:35:30,600
on any facts it's um
 

11223
03:35:30,600 --> 03:35:33,349
on any facts it's um
yeah it's it's super scary and it was

11224
03:35:33,349 --> 03:35:33,359
yeah it's it's super scary and it was
 

11225
03:35:33,359 --> 03:35:36,229
yeah it's it's super scary and it was
it's do you think it's a giant leap in

11226
03:35:36,229 --> 03:35:36,239
it's do you think it's a giant leap in
 

11227
03:35:36,239 --> 03:35:37,670
it's do you think it's a giant leap in
terms of the development towards AGI

11228
03:35:37,670 --> 03:35:37,680
terms of the development towards AGI
 

11229
03:35:37,680 --> 03:35:40,790
terms of the development towards AGI
child GPT or we still

11230
03:35:40,790 --> 03:35:40,800
child GPT or we still
 

11231
03:35:40,800 --> 03:35:42,590
child GPT or we still
um this is just an impre impressive

11232
03:35:42,590 --> 03:35:42,600
um this is just an impre impressive
 

11233
03:35:42,600 --> 03:35:43,610
um this is just an impre impressive
little

11234
03:35:43,610 --> 03:35:43,620
little
 

11235
03:35:43,620 --> 03:35:47,090
little
toolbox so like what do you think the

11236
03:35:47,090 --> 03:35:47,100
toolbox so like what do you think the
 

11237
03:35:47,100 --> 03:35:49,010
toolbox so like what do you think the
singularity is coming

11238
03:35:49,010 --> 03:35:49,020
singularity is coming
 

11239
03:35:49,020 --> 03:35:50,690
singularity is coming
or is it to you it doesn't matter

11240
03:35:50,690 --> 03:35:50,700
or is it to you it doesn't matter
 

11241
03:35:50,700 --> 03:35:53,210
or is it to you it doesn't matter
eventually I have no intuitions on that

11242
03:35:53,210 --> 03:35:53,220
eventually I have no intuitions on that
 

11243
03:35:53,220 --> 03:35:55,429
eventually I have no intuitions on that
front apart from the fact that if we

11244
03:35:55,429 --> 03:35:55,439
front apart from the fact that if we
 

11245
03:35:55,439 --> 03:35:57,889
front apart from the fact that if we
continue to make progress it will come

11246
03:35:57,889 --> 03:35:57,899
continue to make progress it will come
 

11247
03:35:57,899 --> 03:36:00,290
continue to make progress it will come
right so it's just you just have to

11248
03:36:00,290 --> 03:36:00,300
right so it's just you just have to
 

11249
03:36:00,300 --> 03:36:01,610
right so it's just you just have to
assume we continue to make progress

11250
03:36:01,610 --> 03:36:01,620
assume we continue to make progress
 

11251
03:36:01,620 --> 03:36:03,650
assume we continue to make progress
there's only two assumptions you you

11252
03:36:03,650 --> 03:36:03,660
there's only two assumptions you you
 

11253
03:36:03,660 --> 03:36:06,769
there's only two assumptions you you
have to assume substrate Independence so

11254
03:36:06,769 --> 03:36:06,779
have to assume substrate Independence so
 

11255
03:36:06,779 --> 03:36:08,870
have to assume substrate Independence so
there's no reason why this can't be done

11256
03:36:08,870 --> 03:36:08,880
there's no reason why this can't be done
 

11257
03:36:08,880 --> 03:36:11,469
there's no reason why this can't be done
in silico it's it's just we can build

11258
03:36:11,469 --> 03:36:11,479
in silico it's it's just we can build
 

11259
03:36:11,479 --> 03:36:15,530
in silico it's it's just we can build
arbitrarily intelligent machines

11260
03:36:15,530 --> 03:36:15,540
arbitrarily intelligent machines
 

11261
03:36:15,540 --> 03:36:17,150
arbitrarily intelligent machines
there's nothing magical about having

11262
03:36:17,150 --> 03:36:17,160
there's nothing magical about having
 

11263
03:36:17,160 --> 03:36:19,790
there's nothing magical about having
having this done in in the wet wear of

having this done in in the wet wear of
 

11265
03:36:19,800 --> 03:36:21,050
having this done in in the wet wear of

I think that is true and I think that's

03:36:22,610 --> 03:36:22,620
I think that is true and I think that's
 

11269

to think that that's true

11272
03:36:26,150 --> 03:36:26,160
to think that that's true
 

11273
03:36:26,160 --> 03:36:27,830
to think that that's true
um and then you just have to assume

11274
03:36:27,830 --> 03:36:27,840
um and then you just have to assume
 

11275
03:36:27,840 --> 03:36:29,510
um and then you just have to assume
we're going to keep making progress it

03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,210
progress doesn't have to be Moore's Law
it can just be we just keep going at a

it can just be we just keep going at a

that tell us to humans yeah I think uh

11344
03:37:49,370 --> 03:37:49,380
that tell us to humans yeah I think uh
 

11345
03:37:49,380 --> 03:37:52,670
that tell us to humans yeah I think uh
my gut says that that tether is not oh

my gut says that that tether is not oh

there's a lot of ways to do it so it's

11348
03:37:54,950 --> 03:37:54,960
there's a lot of ways to do it so it's
 

11349
03:37:54,960 --> 03:37:57,889
there's a lot of ways to do it so it's
not this increasingly impossible problem

not this increasingly impossible problem
 

11351
03:37:57,899 --> 03:38:01,429
not this increasingly impossible problem
right so I have no you know you know as

03:38:01,429 --> 03:38:01,439
right so I have no you know you know as
 

11353

right so I have no you know you know as
you know I'm not a computer scientist I

you know I'm not a computer scientist I
 

11355
03:38:02,760 --> 03:38:04,729
you know I'm not a computer scientist I
have no intuitions about just

have no intuitions about just
 

11357
03:38:04,739 --> 03:38:06,710

algorithmically how you would approach

that and what's possible my main

that and what's possible my main
 

11361
03:38:08,939 --> 03:38:12,349
that and what's possible my main
intuition is uh maybe deeply flawed but

11362
03:38:12,349 --> 03:38:12,359
intuition is uh maybe deeply flawed but
 

11363
03:38:12,359 --> 03:38:13,790
intuition is uh maybe deeply flawed but
the main intuition is based on the fact

11364
03:38:13,790 --> 03:38:13,800
the main intuition is based on the fact
 

11365
03:38:13,800 --> 03:38:16,370
the main intuition is based on the fact
that most of the learning is currently

abstraction the way we do and so

11430
03:39:25,490 --> 03:39:25,500
abstraction the way we do and so

um although they have strange holes in

11432
03:39:28,250 --> 03:39:28,260
um although they have strange holes in
 

11433
03:39:28,260 --> 03:39:29,870
um although they have strange holes in
their competence but the size of the

11434
03:39:29,870 --> 03:39:29,880
their competence but the size of the
 

11435
03:39:29,880 --> 03:39:32,330
their competence but the size of the
holes is shrinking every time and that's

11436
03:39:32,330 --> 03:39:32,340
holes is shrinking every time and that's
 

11437
03:39:32,340 --> 03:39:34,969
holes is shrinking every time and that's
so the intuition starts to slowly fall

11438
03:39:34,969 --> 03:39:34,979
so the intuition starts to slowly fall
 

11439
03:39:34,979 --> 03:39:37,550
so the intuition starts to slowly fall
apart you know the intuition is like

11440
03:39:37,550 --> 03:39:37,560
apart you know the intuition is like
 

11441
03:39:37,560 --> 03:39:40,130
apart you know the intuition is like
surely it can't be this simple to

03:39:40,130 --> 03:39:40,140
surely it can't be this simple to
 

11443
03:39:40,140 --> 03:39:43,130
surely it can't be this simple to
achieve super intelligence yeah but it's

11444
03:39:43,130 --> 03:39:43,140
achieve super intelligence yeah but it's
 

11445
03:39:43,140 --> 03:39:45,170
achieve super intelligence yeah but it's
becoming simpler and simpler so I don't

11446
03:39:45,170 --> 03:39:45,180
becoming simpler and simpler so I don't
 

11447
03:39:45,180 --> 03:39:47,269
becoming simpler and simpler so I don't
know I don't the progress is quite

11448
03:39:47,269 --> 03:39:47,279
know I don't the progress is quite

since seen some of those videos I mean

11702
03:44:38,630 --> 03:44:38,640
since seen some of those videos I mean
 

11703
03:44:38,640 --> 03:44:40,610
since seen some of those videos I mean
now now this is going back still at

11704
03:44:40,610 --> 03:44:40,620
now now this is going back still at
 

11705
03:44:40,620 --> 03:44:42,590
now now this is going back still at
least a year but some of those videos

11706
03:44:42,590 --> 03:44:42,600
least a year but some of those videos
 

11707
03:44:42,600 --> 03:44:45,050
least a year but some of those videos
seem like fairly credible debunkings of

11708
03:44:45,050 --> 03:44:45,060
seem like fairly credible debunkings of
 

11709
03:44:45,060 --> 03:44:48,229
seem like fairly credible debunkings of
some of the the optical evidence

11710
03:44:48,229 --> 03:44:48,239
some of the the optical evidence
 

11711
03:44:48,239 --> 03:44:49,190
some of the the optical evidence
um

11712
03:44:49,190 --> 03:44:49,200
um
 

11713
03:44:49,200 --> 03:44:51,290
um
and I'm surprised we don't haven't seen

11714
03:44:51,290 --> 03:44:51,300
and I'm surprised we don't haven't seen
 

11715
03:44:51,300 --> 03:44:53,030
and I'm surprised we don't haven't seen
more of that like there was a

11716
03:44:53,030 --> 03:44:53,040
more of that like there was a
 

11717
03:44:53,040 --> 03:44:55,790
more of that like there was a
a fairly credulous 60 Minutes piece that

11718
03:44:55,790 --> 03:44:55,800
a fairly credulous 60 Minutes piece that
 

11719
03:44:55,800 --> 03:44:57,229
a fairly credulous 60 Minutes piece that
came out around that time looking at

11720
03:44:57,229 --> 03:44:57,239
came out around that time looking at
 

11721
03:44:57,239 --> 03:44:58,849
came out around that time looking at
some of that video and it was the very

11722
03:44:58,849 --> 03:44:58,859
some of that video and it was the very
 

11723
03:44:58,859 --> 03:45:00,769
some of that video and it was the very
video that he was debunking on YouTube

11724
03:45:00,769 --> 03:45:00,779
video that he was debunking on YouTube
 

11725
03:45:00,779 --> 03:45:02,990
video that he was debunking on YouTube
and you know his his video only had like

11726
03:45:02,990 --> 03:45:03,000
and you know his his video only had like
 

11727
03:45:03,000 --> 03:45:06,170
and you know his his video only had like
50 000 views on it or whatever

11728
03:45:06,170 --> 03:45:06,180
50 000 views on it or whatever
 

11729
03:45:06,180 --> 03:45:06,950
50 000 views on it or whatever
um

11730
03:45:06,950 --> 03:45:06,960
um
 

11731
03:45:06,960 --> 03:45:08,510
um
but again it seemed like a fairly

11732
03:45:08,510 --> 03:45:08,520
but again it seemed like a fairly
 

11733
03:45:08,520 --> 03:45:10,070
but again it seemed like a fairly
credible debunking I haven't seen

11734
03:45:10,070 --> 03:45:10,080
credible debunking I haven't seen
 

11735
03:45:10,080 --> 03:45:12,889
credible debunking I haven't seen
debunkings of his debunkings but uh I

11736
03:45:12,889 --> 03:45:12,899
debunkings of his debunkings but uh I
 

11737
03:45:12,899 --> 03:45:14,690
debunkings of his debunkings but uh I
think there is but he's basically saying

11738
03:45:14,690 --> 03:45:14,700
think there is but he's basically saying
 

11739
03:45:14,700 --> 03:45:16,849
think there is but he's basically saying
that there is there is possible

11740
03:45:16,849 --> 03:45:16,859
that there is there is possible
 

11741
03:45:16,859 --> 03:45:18,950
that there is there is possible
explanations for it right and usually in

11742
03:45:18,950 --> 03:45:18,960
explanations for it right and usually in
 

11743
03:45:18,960 --> 03:45:20,450
explanations for it right and usually in
these kinds of contexts if there's a

11744
03:45:20,450 --> 03:45:20,460
these kinds of contexts if there's a
 

11745
03:45:20,460 --> 03:45:22,190
these kinds of contexts if there's a
possible explanation even if it seems

11746
03:45:22,190 --> 03:45:22,200
possible explanation even if it seems
 

11747
03:45:22,200 --> 03:45:23,510
possible explanation even if it seems
unlikely

11748
03:45:23,510 --> 03:45:23,520
unlikely
 

11749
03:45:23,520 --> 03:45:26,870
unlikely
is going to be more likely than an alien

11750
03:45:26,870 --> 03:45:26,880
is going to be more likely than an alien
 

11751
03:45:26,880 --> 03:45:29,690
is going to be more likely than an alien
civilization visiting us yeah it's the

11752
03:45:29,690 --> 03:45:29,700
civilization visiting us yeah it's the
 

11753
03:45:29,700 --> 03:45:30,710
civilization visiting us yeah it's the
extraordinary claims require

11754
03:45:30,710 --> 03:45:30,720
extraordinary claims require
 

11755
03:45:30,720 --> 03:45:32,630
extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence principle which I

11756
03:45:32,630 --> 03:45:32,640
extraordinary evidence principle which I
 

11757
03:45:32,640 --> 03:45:35,150
extraordinary evidence principle which I
I think is generally true well with

11758
03:45:35,150 --> 03:45:35,160
I think is generally true well with
 

11759
03:45:35,160 --> 03:45:37,370
I think is generally true well with
aliens I think generally

11760
03:45:37,370 --> 03:45:37,380
aliens I think generally
 

11761
03:45:37,380 --> 03:45:38,990
aliens I think generally
I think there should be some humility

11762
03:45:38,990 --> 03:45:39,000
I think there should be some humility
 

11763
03:45:39,000 --> 03:45:41,269
I think there should be some humility
about what they would look like when

11764
03:45:41,269 --> 03:45:41,279
about what they would look like when
 

11765
03:45:41,279 --> 03:45:43,250
about what they would look like when
they show up but I tend to think they're

11766
03:45:43,250 --> 03:45:43,260
they show up but I tend to think they're
 

11767
03:45:43,260 --> 03:45:45,050
they show up but I tend to think they're
already here the amazing thing about

11768
03:45:45,050 --> 03:45:45,060
already here the amazing thing about
 

11769
03:45:45,060 --> 03:45:46,490
already here the amazing thing about
this AI conversation though is that

11770
03:45:46,490 --> 03:45:46,500
this AI conversation though is that
 

11771
03:45:46,500 --> 03:45:49,130
this AI conversation though is that
we're talking about a circumstance where

11772
03:45:49,130 --> 03:45:49,140
we're talking about a circumstance where
 

11773
03:45:49,140 --> 03:45:52,190
we're talking about a circumstance where
we would be designing the aliens yeah

11774
03:45:52,190 --> 03:45:52,200
we would be designing the aliens yeah
 

11775
03:45:52,200 --> 03:45:54,889
we would be designing the aliens yeah
and they would and there's every reason

11776
03:45:54,889 --> 03:45:54,899
and they would and there's every reason
 

11777
03:45:54,899 --> 03:45:56,929
and they would and there's every reason
to believe that eventually this is going

11778
03:45:56,929 --> 03:45:56,939
to believe that eventually this is going
 

11779
03:45:56,939 --> 03:45:58,550
to believe that eventually this is going
to happen like I said I'm not at all

11780
03:45:58,550 --> 03:45:58,560
to happen like I said I'm not at all

intelligence shows up

11790
03:46:08,090 --> 03:46:08,100
intelligence shows up
 

11791
03:46:08,100 --> 03:46:11,150
intelligence shows up
will this be trending on Twitter for a

11792
03:46:11,150 --> 03:46:11,160
will this be trending on Twitter for a
 

11793
03:46:11,160 --> 03:46:12,950
will this be trending on Twitter for a
day and then we'll go on to complain

day and then we'll go on to complain
about

11796
03:46:14,090 --> 03:46:14,100
about
 

11797
03:46:14,100 --> 03:46:16,130
about
something Sam Harris once again said in

notice when I was on but um do you have
this concern about

11810
03:46:32,690 --> 03:46:32,700
this concern about
 

11811
03:46:32,700 --> 03:46:36,170
this concern about
uh AGI basically same kind of thing that

11812
03:46:36,170 --> 03:46:36,180
uh AGI basically same kind of thing that
 

11813
03:46:36,180 --> 03:46:37,490
uh AGI basically same kind of thing that
we would just look the other way is

11814
03:46:37,490 --> 03:46:37,500
we would just look the other way is
 

11815
03:46:37,500 --> 03:46:39,349
we would just look the other way is
there something about this time where

11816
03:46:39,349 --> 03:46:39,359
there something about this time where
 

11817
03:46:39,359 --> 03:46:42,349
there something about this time where
even like world war three which has been

11818
03:46:42,349 --> 03:46:42,359
even like world war three which has been
 

11819
03:46:42,359 --> 03:46:44,410
even like world war three which has been
throwing around very casually

11820
03:46:44,410 --> 03:46:44,420
throwing around very casually
 

11821
03:46:44,420 --> 03:46:48,229
throwing around very casually
concerningly so even that the new cycle

11822
03:46:48,229 --> 03:46:48,239
concerningly so even that the new cycle
 

11823
03:46:48,239 --> 03:46:50,990
concerningly so even that the new cycle
wipes that away yeah well I I think we

11824
03:46:50,990 --> 03:46:51,000
wipes that away yeah well I I think we
 

11825
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:53,410
wipes that away yeah well I I think we
have this

11826
03:46:53,410 --> 03:46:53,420
have this
 

11827
03:46:53,420 --> 03:46:59,990
have this
this General problem that we can't make

11828
03:46:59,990 --> 03:47:00,000

 

11829
03:47:00,000 --> 03:47:02,990

certain information even

11830
03:47:02,990 --> 03:47:03,000
certain information even
 

11831
03:47:03,000 --> 03:47:04,210
certain information even
you know

11832
03:47:04,210 --> 03:47:04,220
you know
 

11833
03:47:04,220 --> 03:47:07,929
you know
unequivocally certain information

11834
03:47:07,929 --> 03:47:07,939
unequivocally certain information
 

11835
03:47:07,939 --> 03:47:09,830
unequivocally certain information
emotionally

11836
03:47:09,830 --> 03:47:09,840
emotionally
 

11837
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:13,370
emotionally
Salient like like we we respond quite

11838
03:47:13,370 --> 03:47:13,380
Salient like like we we respond quite
 

11839
03:47:13,380 --> 03:47:15,170
Salient like like we we respond quite
readily to certain things I mean as we

11840
03:47:15,170 --> 03:47:15,180
readily to certain things I mean as we
 

11841
03:47:15,180 --> 03:47:18,410
readily to certain things I mean as we
talked about we respond to the

11842
03:47:18,410 --> 03:47:18,420
talked about we respond to the
 

11843
03:47:18,420 --> 03:47:20,150
talked about we respond to the
the little girl who fell down a well I

11844
03:47:20,150 --> 03:47:20,160
the little girl who fell down a well I
 

11845
03:47:20,160 --> 03:47:22,250
the little girl who fell down a well I
mean that just that gets 100 of our

11846
03:47:22,250 --> 03:47:22,260
mean that just that gets 100 of our
 

11847
03:47:22,260 --> 03:47:25,130
mean that just that gets 100 of our
emotional resources but

11848
03:47:25,130 --> 03:47:25,140
emotional resources but
 

11849
03:47:25,140 --> 03:47:28,910
emotional resources but
the abstract probability that of nuclear

11850
03:47:28,910 --> 03:47:28,920
the abstract probability that of nuclear
 

11851
03:47:28,920 --> 03:47:31,190
the abstract probability that of nuclear
war right even a high probability even

11852
03:47:31,190 --> 03:47:31,200
war right even a high probability even
 

11853
03:47:31,200 --> 03:47:32,630
war right even a high probability even
just even an intolerable probability

11854
03:47:32,630 --> 03:47:32,640
just even an intolerable probability
 

11855
03:47:32,640 --> 03:47:35,510
just even an intolerable probability
even if we put it at

11856
03:47:35,510 --> 03:47:35,520
even if we put it at
 

11857
03:47:35,520 --> 03:47:38,690
even if we put it at
30 percent right you know like it's just

11858
03:47:38,690 --> 03:47:38,700
30 percent right you know like it's just
 

11859
03:47:38,700 --> 03:47:40,250
30 percent right you know like it's just
like that's

11860
03:47:40,250 --> 03:47:40,260
like that's
 

11861
03:47:40,260 --> 03:47:42,170
like that's
a Russian roulette with a you know gun

11862
03:47:42,170 --> 03:47:42,180
a Russian roulette with a you know gun
 

11863
03:47:42,180 --> 03:47:44,090
a Russian roulette with a you know gun
with three chambers and you know it's

11864
03:47:44,090 --> 03:47:44,100
with three chambers and you know it's
 

11865
03:47:44,100 --> 03:47:46,010
with three chambers and you know it's
aimed at the heads not only your head

11866
03:47:46,010 --> 03:47:46,020
aimed at the heads not only your head
 

11867
03:47:46,020 --> 03:47:47,630
aimed at the heads not only your head
but your kid's head and everyone's kid's

11868
03:47:47,630 --> 03:47:47,640
but your kid's head and everyone's kid's
 

11869
03:47:47,640 --> 03:47:51,349
but your kid's head and everyone's kid's
head and it's just 24 hours a day and

11870
03:47:51,349 --> 03:47:51,359
head and it's just 24 hours a day and
 

11871
03:47:51,359 --> 03:47:52,670
head and it's just 24 hours a day and
um

11872
03:47:52,670 --> 03:47:52,680
um
 

11873
03:47:52,680 --> 03:47:55,010
um
I mean I think people who who this

11874
03:47:55,010 --> 03:47:55,020
I mean I think people who who this
 

11875
03:47:55,020 --> 03:47:56,929
I mean I think people who who this
pre-ukraine I think the people who have

11876
03:47:56,929 --> 03:47:56,939
pre-ukraine I think the people who have
 

11877
03:47:56,939 --> 03:47:59,269
pre-ukraine I think the people who have
made it their business to

11878
03:47:59,269 --> 03:47:59,279
made it their business to
 

11879
03:47:59,279 --> 03:48:00,950
made it their business to
you know professionally to think about

11880
03:48:00,950 --> 03:48:00,960
you know professionally to think about
 

11881
03:48:00,960 --> 03:48:03,590
you know professionally to think about
the risk of nuclear war and to mitigate

11882
03:48:03,590 --> 03:48:03,600
the risk of nuclear war and to mitigate
 

11883
03:48:03,600 --> 03:48:05,210
the risk of nuclear war and to mitigate
it you know people like Graham Allison

11884
03:48:05,210 --> 03:48:05,220
it you know people like Graham Allison
 

11885
03:48:05,220 --> 03:48:08,929
it you know people like Graham Allison
or William Perry or

11886
03:48:08,929 --> 03:48:08,939
or William Perry or
 

11887
03:48:08,939 --> 03:48:11,690
or William Perry or
I think they were putting like the the

11888
03:48:11,690 --> 03:48:11,700
I think they were putting like the the
 

11889
03:48:11,700 --> 03:48:13,910
I think they were putting like the the
ongoing risk I mean just the risk that

11890
03:48:13,910 --> 03:48:13,920

people were putting it at something like
 

11899
03:48:23,760 --> 03:48:26,330
people were putting it at something like
50 right they were living with this sort

11903
03:48:30,359 --> 03:48:32,150
of Damocles over our heads now you might
wonder whether

11904
03:48:32,150 --> 03:48:32,160
wonder whether
 

11905
03:48:32,160 --> 03:48:34,070
wonder whether
anyone can have reliable intuitions

03:48:34,080 --> 03:48:35,210
anyone can have reliable intuitions
about the probability of that kind of

about the probability of that kind of
 

11909
03:48:35,220 --> 03:48:37,010
about the probability of that kind of

I think at least twice by

I think at least twice by
 

11943
03:49:23,520 --> 03:49:26,630
I think at least twice by
you know Soviet submarine commanders

11947
03:49:28,260 --> 03:49:29,990

to change a chain of command right it's

11948
03:49:29,990 --> 03:49:30,000
to change a chain of command right it's
 

11949
03:49:30,000 --> 03:49:32,050
to change a chain of command right it's
like this is

11950
03:49:32,050 --> 03:49:32,060
like this is
 

11951
03:49:32,060 --> 03:49:34,790
like this is
it's almost certainly an error and it

11952
03:49:34,790 --> 03:49:34,800
it's almost certainly an error and it
 

11953
03:49:34,800 --> 03:49:36,910
it's almost certainly an error and it
turns out it wasn't error it's like like

11954
03:49:36,910 --> 03:49:36,920
turns out it wasn't error it's like like
 

11955
03:49:36,920 --> 03:49:40,250
turns out it wasn't error it's like like
and we we need people

11956
03:49:40,250 --> 03:49:40,260
and we we need people
 

11957
03:49:40,260 --> 03:49:42,110
and we we need people
to I mean in that particular case like

11958
03:49:42,110 --> 03:49:42,120
to I mean in that particular case like
 

11959
03:49:42,120 --> 03:49:44,809
to I mean in that particular case like
he saw I think it was five

11960
03:49:44,809 --> 03:49:44,819
he saw I think it was five
 

11961
03:49:44,819 --> 03:49:47,090
he saw I think it was five
what seemed like five missiles launched

11962
03:49:47,090 --> 03:49:47,100
what seemed like five missiles launched
 

11963
03:49:47,100 --> 03:49:50,630
what seemed like five missiles launched
from the US to Russia and he reasoned if

11964
03:49:50,630 --> 03:49:50,640
from the US to Russia and he reasoned if
 

11965
03:49:50,640 --> 03:49:52,370
from the US to Russia and he reasoned if
the if America was going to engage in a

11966
03:49:52,370 --> 03:49:52,380
the if America was going to engage in a
 

11967
03:49:52,380 --> 03:49:53,630
the if America was going to engage in a
first strike they'd launch more than

11968
03:49:53,630 --> 03:49:53,640
first strike they'd launch more than
 

11969
03:49:53,640 --> 03:49:56,030
first strike they'd launch more than
five missiles right so this this has to

11970
03:49:56,030 --> 03:49:56,040
five missiles right so this this has to
 

11971
03:49:56,040 --> 03:49:58,610
five missiles right so this this has to
be fictional and then he waited long

11972
03:49:58,610 --> 03:49:58,620
be fictional and then he waited long
 

11973
03:49:58,620 --> 03:50:00,410
be fictional and then he waited long
enough to decide that it was fictional

11974
03:50:00,410 --> 03:50:00,420
enough to decide that it was fictional
 

11975
03:50:00,420 --> 03:50:03,410
enough to decide that it was fictional
but the probability of of

03:50:03,410 --> 03:50:03,420
but the probability of of

03:50:03,420 --> 03:50:07,429
but the probability of of
a nuclear war Happening by mistake or in

that's intolerable forget about the the

that's intolerable forget about the the

we that might change the

we that might change the
 

12021

um the engine we have for skepticism
 

12023
03:50:59,399 --> 03:51:02,710

12058
03:51:43,309 --> 03:51:43,319
was saying it's like unless I put it out
 

12059
03:51:43,319 --> 03:51:46,130
was saying it's like unless I put it out
you know you can't be sure that I

12060
03:51:46,130 --> 03:51:46,140
you know you can't be sure that I
 

12061
03:51:46,140 --> 03:51:47,750
you know you can't be sure that I
actually said it you know I mean it's

12062
03:51:47,750 --> 03:51:47,760
actually said it you know I mean it's
 

12063
03:51:47,760 --> 03:51:50,389
actually said it you know I mean it's
it's just uh

12064
03:51:50,389 --> 03:51:50,399
it's just uh
 

12065
03:51:50,399 --> 03:51:52,790
it's just uh
but I don't know what it's like to live

12066
03:51:52,790 --> 03:51:52,800
but I don't know what it's like to live
 

12067
03:51:52,800 --> 03:51:55,790
but I don't know what it's like to live
like that for all forms of information

12068
03:51:55,790 --> 03:51:55,800
like that for all forms of information
 

12069
03:51:55,800 --> 03:51:59,929
like that for all forms of information
and uh I mean Strangely I think it may

12070
03:51:59,929 --> 03:51:59,939
and uh I mean Strangely I think it may
 

12071
03:51:59,939 --> 03:52:01,969
and uh I mean Strangely I think it may
require a

12072
03:52:01,969 --> 03:52:01,979
require a
 

12073
03:52:01,979 --> 03:52:05,330
require a
a greater siloin of information in the

12074
03:52:05,330 --> 03:52:05,340
a greater siloin of information in the
 

12075
03:52:05,340 --> 03:52:08,630
a greater siloin of information in the
end you know it's like it it it's uh

12076
03:52:08,630 --> 03:52:08,640
end you know it's like it it it's uh
 

12077
03:52:08,640 --> 03:52:10,550
end you know it's like it it it's uh
we're living through this sort of wild

12078
03:52:10,550 --> 03:52:10,560
we're living through this sort of wild
 

12079
03:52:10,560 --> 03:52:12,410
we're living through this sort of wild
west period where everyone's got a

12080
03:52:12,410 --> 03:52:12,420
west period where everyone's got a
 

12081
03:52:12,420 --> 03:52:13,790
west period where everyone's got a

12083
03:52:13,800 --> 03:52:16,910

everyone's got an opinion but once you

12084
03:52:16,910 --> 03:52:16,920
everyone's got an opinion but once you
 

12085
03:52:16,920 --> 03:52:18,469
everyone's got an opinion but once you
can fake everything there might be

12086
03:52:18,469 --> 03:52:18,479
can fake everything there might be
 

12087
03:52:18,479 --> 03:52:20,510
can fake everything there might be
greater value for expertise yeah for

12088
03:52:20,510 --> 03:52:20,520
greater value for expertise yeah for
 

12089
03:52:20,520 --> 03:52:23,570
greater value for expertise yeah for
experts but a more rigorous system for

12090
03:52:23,570 --> 03:52:23,580
experts but a more rigorous system for
 

12091
03:52:23,580 --> 03:52:25,309
experts but a more rigorous system for
identifying who the experts are yeah or

12092
03:52:25,309 --> 03:52:25,319
identifying who the experts are yeah or
 

12093
03:52:25,319 --> 03:52:27,349
identifying who the experts are yeah or
just or just knowing that you know it's

12094
03:52:27,349 --> 03:52:27,359
just or just knowing that you know it's
 

12095
03:52:27,359 --> 03:52:29,510
just or just knowing that you know it's
going to be an arms race to

12096
03:52:29,510 --> 03:52:29,520
going to be an arms race to
 

12097
03:52:29,520 --> 03:52:32,870
going to be an arms race to
authenticate information so it's like if

12098
03:52:32,870 --> 03:52:32,880
authenticate information so it's like if
 

12099
03:52:32,880 --> 03:52:35,269
authenticate information so it's like if
if you can never trust a photograph

12100
03:52:35,269 --> 03:52:35,279
if you can never trust a photograph
 

12101
03:52:35,279 --> 03:52:38,690
if you can never trust a photograph
yeah unless it has been vetted by Getty

12102
03:52:38,690 --> 03:52:38,700
yeah unless it has been vetted by Getty
 

12103
03:52:38,700 --> 03:52:39,650
yeah unless it has been vetted by Getty
Images

12104
03:52:39,650 --> 03:52:39,660
Images
 

12105
03:52:39,660 --> 03:52:41,510
Images
because only Getty Images has the

12106
03:52:41,510 --> 03:52:41,520
because only Getty Images has the
 

12107
03:52:41,520 --> 03:52:44,450
because only Getty Images has the
resources to to authenticate the

12108
03:52:44,450 --> 03:52:44,460
resources to to authenticate the
 

12109
03:52:44,460 --> 03:52:46,969
resources to to authenticate the
provenance of that photograph and then a

12110
03:52:46,969 --> 03:52:46,979
provenance of that photograph and then a
 

12111
03:52:46,979 --> 03:52:50,510
provenance of that photograph and then a
test that hasn't been meddled with by AI

12112
03:52:50,510 --> 03:52:50,520
test that hasn't been meddled with by AI
 

12113
03:52:50,520 --> 03:52:52,070
test that hasn't been meddled with by AI
um and again I don't even know if that's

12114
03:52:52,070 --> 03:52:52,080
um and again I don't even know if that's
 

12115
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:53,389
um and again I don't even know if that's
technically possible and maybe the

12116
03:52:53,389 --> 03:52:53,399
technically possible and maybe the
 

12117
03:52:53,399 --> 03:52:55,269
technically possible and maybe the
whatever the tools

12118
03:52:55,269 --> 03:52:55,279
whatever the tools
 

12119
03:52:55,279 --> 03:52:58,070
whatever the tools
available for this will be you know

12120
03:52:58,070 --> 03:52:58,080
available for this will be you know
 

12121
03:52:58,080 --> 03:53:00,950
available for this will be you know
commodified and and the cost will be

12122
03:53:00,950 --> 03:53:00,960
commodified and and the cost will be
 

12123
03:53:00,960 --> 03:53:02,990
commodified and and the cost will be
driven to zero so quickly that everyone

12124
03:53:02,990 --> 03:53:03,000
driven to zero so quickly that everyone
 

12125
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:04,250
driven to zero so quickly that everyone
will be able to do it you know it could

12126
03:53:04,250 --> 03:53:04,260
will be able to do it you know it could
 

12127
03:53:04,260 --> 03:53:06,410
will be able to do it you know it could
be like encryption but and it would be

12128
03:53:06,410 --> 03:53:06,420
be like encryption but and it would be
 

12129
03:53:06,420 --> 03:53:09,229
be like encryption but and it would be
proven and tested most effectively first

12130
03:53:09,229 --> 03:53:09,239
proven and tested most effectively first
 

12131
03:53:09,239 --> 03:53:11,510
proven and tested most effectively first

03:54:36,000 --> 03:54:37,490
you think there will be do you think
we're like living through a

12202
03:54:37,490 --> 03:54:37,500
we're like living through a
 

12203
03:54:37,500 --> 03:54:40,070
we're like living through a
transformation of a kind

12204
03:54:40,070 --> 03:54:40,080
transformation of a kind
 

12205
03:54:40,080 --> 03:54:42,110
transformation of a kind
where we're going to be doing more and

12206
03:54:42,110 --> 03:54:42,120
where we're going to be doing more and
 

12207
03:54:42,120 --> 03:54:44,510
where we're going to be doing more and
more interaction than digital space

12208
03:54:44,510 --> 03:54:44,520
more interaction than digital space
 

12209
03:54:44,520 --> 03:54:46,010
more interaction than digital space
like everything we've been complaining

12210
03:54:46,010 --> 03:54:46,020
like everything we've been complaining
 

12211
03:54:46,020 --> 03:54:47,150
like everything we've been complaining
about Twitter

12212
03:54:47,150 --> 03:54:47,160
about Twitter
 

12213
03:54:47,160 --> 03:54:49,309
about Twitter
is it possible that Twitter's just the

12214
03:54:49,309 --> 03:54:49,319
is it possible that Twitter's just the
 

12215
03:54:49,319 --> 03:54:51,110
is it possible that Twitter's just the
early days of a broken system that's

12216
03:54:51,110 --> 03:54:51,120
early days of a broken system that's
 

12217
03:54:51,120 --> 03:54:53,750
early days of a broken system that's
actually uh giving birth to a better

12218
03:54:53,750 --> 03:54:53,760
actually uh giving birth to a better
 

12219
03:54:53,760 --> 03:54:56,929
actually uh giving birth to a better
working system that's ultimately digital

12220
03:54:56,929 --> 03:54:56,939
working system that's ultimately digital
 

12221
03:54:56,939 --> 03:55:01,010
working system that's ultimately digital
I think we're gonna

12222
03:55:01,010 --> 03:55:01,020

 

12223
03:55:01,020 --> 03:55:03,370

experience a pendulum swing back into

12224
03:55:03,370 --> 03:55:03,380
experience a pendulum swing back into
 

12225
03:55:03,380 --> 03:55:05,870
experience a pendulum swing back into
the real world I mean I think many of us

12226
03:55:05,870 --> 03:55:05,880
the real world I mean I think many of us
 

12227
03:55:05,880 --> 03:55:07,490
the real world I mean I think many of us
are experiencing that now anyway I'm

12228
03:55:07,490 --> 03:55:07,500
are experiencing that now anyway I'm
 

12229
03:55:07,500 --> 03:55:09,950
are experiencing that now anyway I'm
just just wanting to

12230
03:55:09,950 --> 03:55:09,960
just just wanting to
 

12231
03:55:09,960 --> 03:55:13,070
just just wanting to
have face to face encounters and spend

12232
03:55:13,070 --> 03:55:13,080
have face to face encounters and spend
 

12233
03:55:13,080 --> 03:55:14,929
have face to face encounters and spend
less time on our phones and less time

12234
03:55:14,929 --> 03:55:14,939
less time on our phones and less time
 

12235
03:55:14,939 --> 03:55:17,870
less time on our phones and less time
online I think you know maybe everyone

12236
03:55:17,870 --> 03:55:17,880
online I think you know maybe everyone
 

12237
03:55:17,880 --> 03:55:20,630
online I think you know maybe everyone
isn't going in that direction but

12238
03:55:20,630 --> 03:55:20,640
isn't going in that direction but
 

12239
03:55:20,640 --> 03:55:24,590
isn't going in that direction but
I do notice it myself and I notice

Twitter world
 

12279
03:56:02,220 --> 03:56:04,610
Twitter world
well I I think all we have is our

12280
03:56:04,610 --> 03:56:04,620
well I I think all we have is our
 

12281
03:56:04,620 --> 03:56:07,189
well I I think all we have is our
attention in the end and we just have to

12282
03:56:07,189 --> 03:56:07,199
attention in the end and we just have to
 

12283
03:56:07,199 --> 03:56:10,189
attention in the end and we just have to
notice what these various tools are

12284
03:56:10,189 --> 03:56:10,199
notice what these various tools are
 

12285
03:56:10,199 --> 03:56:12,349
notice what these various tools are
doing to it and

12286
03:56:12,349 --> 03:56:12,359
doing to it and
 

12287
03:56:12,359 --> 03:56:14,990
doing to it and
it's just it became very clear to me

12288
03:56:14,990 --> 03:56:15,000
it's just it became very clear to me
 

12289
03:56:15,000 --> 03:56:16,429
it's just it became very clear to me
that

12290
03:56:16,429 --> 03:56:16,439
that
 

12291
03:56:16,439 --> 03:56:18,830
that
it was an unrewarding use of my

12292
03:56:18,830 --> 03:56:18,840
it was an unrewarding use of my
 

12293
03:56:18,840 --> 03:56:20,269
it was an unrewarding use of my
attention now it's not to say there

12294
03:56:20,269 --> 03:56:20,279
attention now it's not to say there
 

12295
03:56:20,279 --> 03:56:22,790
attention now it's not to say there
isn't some digital platform that's

12296
03:56:22,790 --> 03:56:22,800
isn't some digital platform that's
 

12297
03:56:22,800 --> 03:56:24,650
isn't some digital platform that's
conceivable that would be

12298
03:56:24,650 --> 03:56:24,660
conceivable that would be
 

12299
03:56:24,660 --> 03:56:26,510
conceivable that would be
useful but

12300
03:56:26,510 --> 03:56:26,520
useful but
 

12301
03:56:26,520 --> 03:56:30,889
useful but
um and rewarding but

12302
03:56:30,889 --> 03:56:30,899

 

12303
03:56:30,899 --> 03:56:33,050

yeah I mean we just have

12304
03:56:33,050 --> 03:56:33,060
yeah I mean we just have
 

12305
03:56:33,060 --> 03:56:35,330
yeah I mean we just have
you know our life is doled out to us in

12306
03:56:35,330 --> 03:56:35,340
you know our life is doled out to us in
 

12307
03:56:35,340 --> 03:56:37,370
you know our life is doled out to us in
moments and we we have and we're

12308
03:56:37,370 --> 03:56:37,380
moments and we we have and we're
 

12309
03:56:37,380 --> 03:56:40,370
moments and we we have and we're
continually solving this riddle of

12310
03:56:40,370 --> 03:56:40,380
continually solving this riddle of
 

12311
03:56:40,380 --> 03:56:43,370
continually solving this riddle of
what is going to suffice to make this

12312
03:56:43,370 --> 03:56:43,380
what is going to suffice to make this
 

12313
03:56:43,380 --> 03:56:47,870
what is going to suffice to make this
moment engaging and meaningful and

12314
03:56:47,870 --> 03:56:47,880
moment engaging and meaningful and
 

12315
03:56:47,880 --> 03:56:49,790
moment engaging and meaningful and
aligned with

12316
03:56:49,790 --> 03:56:49,800
aligned with
 

12317
03:56:49,800 --> 03:56:51,769
aligned with
who I want to be now and how I want the

12318
03:56:51,769 --> 03:56:51,779
who I want to be now and how I want the
 

12319
03:56:51,779 --> 03:56:54,769
who I want to be now and how I want the
future to to look right and it's that we

12320
03:56:54,769 --> 03:56:54,779
future to to look right and it's that we
 

12321
03:56:54,779 --> 03:56:58,010
future to to look right and it's that we
have this tension between being in the

12322
03:56:58,010 --> 03:56:58,020
have this tension between being in the
 

12323
03:56:58,020 --> 03:57:00,530
have this tension between being in the
present and becoming in the future

12324
03:57:00,530 --> 03:57:00,540
present and becoming in the future
 

12325
03:57:00,540 --> 03:57:02,689
present and becoming in the future
and um

12326
03:57:02,689 --> 03:57:02,699
and um
 

12327
03:57:02,699 --> 03:57:04,729
and um
you know it's a seeming Paradox again

12328
03:57:04,729 --> 03:57:04,739
you know it's a seeming Paradox again
 

12329
03:57:04,739 --> 03:57:06,410
you know it's a seeming Paradox again
it's not really a paradox but it can see

12330
03:57:06,410 --> 03:57:06,420
it's not really a paradox but it can see
 

12331
03:57:06,420 --> 03:57:09,290
it's not really a paradox but it can see
it like I do think the ground truth

12332
03:57:09,290 --> 03:57:09,300
it like I do think the ground truth
 

12333
03:57:09,300 --> 03:57:11,870
it like I do think the ground truth
for personal well-being

12334
03:57:11,870 --> 03:57:11,880
for personal well-being
 

12335
03:57:11,880 --> 03:57:14,630
for personal well-being
is to find a mode of being where

12336

you can pay attention to the present
 

12345
03:57:23,340 --> 03:57:26,590
you can pay attention to the present
moment with sufficient you know gravity

this does open up a degree of freedom
 

12525
04:00:44,640 --> 04:00:47,389
this does open up a degree of freedom
for a person but it's not a freedom that

term of jargon you know in the Buddhist

12550
04:01:16,910 --> 04:01:16,920
term of jargon you know in the Buddhist
 

12551
04:01:16,920 --> 04:01:19,010
term of jargon you know in the Buddhist
and and increasingly you know outside

right but they're sort of different
 

12557
04:01:22,500 --> 04:01:24,469
right but they're sort of different
levels of mindfulness and there's

12558
04:01:24,469 --> 04:01:24,479
levels of mindfulness and there's
 

12559
04:01:24,479 --> 04:01:26,990
levels of mindfulness and there's
there's different um

12560
04:01:26,990 --> 04:01:27,000
there's different um
 

12561
04:01:27,000 --> 04:01:28,910
there's different um
degrees of insight into this but yes I

12562
04:01:28,910 --> 04:01:28,920
degrees of insight into this but yes I
 

12563
04:01:28,920 --> 04:01:31,370
degrees of insight into this but yes I
mean what I'm calling evidence of lack

12564
04:01:31,370 --> 04:01:31,380
mean what I'm calling evidence of lack
 

12565
04:01:31,380 --> 04:01:33,889
mean what I'm calling evidence of lack
of Free Will and lack of you know lack

12566
04:01:33,889 --> 04:01:33,899
of Free Will and lack of you know lack
 

12567
04:01:33,899 --> 04:01:36,229
of Free Will and lack of you know lack
of the self and I got two sides of the

12568
04:01:36,229 --> 04:01:36,239
of the self and I got two sides of the
 

12569
04:01:36,239 --> 04:01:39,110
of the self and I got two sides of the
same coin there's a sense of being

12570
04:01:39,110 --> 04:01:39,120
same coin there's a sense of being
 

12571
04:01:39,120 --> 04:01:41,630
same coin there's a sense of being
a subject in the middle of experience to

12572
04:01:41,630 --> 04:01:41,640
a subject in the middle of experience to
 

12573
04:01:41,640 --> 04:01:44,689
a subject in the middle of experience to
whom all experience refers the sense of

12574
04:01:44,689 --> 04:01:44,699
whom all experience refers the sense of
 

12575
04:01:44,699 --> 04:01:46,729
whom all experience refers the sense of
I the sense of me

12576
04:01:46,729 --> 04:01:46,739
I the sense of me
 

12577
04:01:46,739 --> 04:01:49,250
I the sense of me
and that's almost everybody's starting

12578
04:01:49,250 --> 04:01:49,260
and that's almost everybody's starting
 

12579
04:01:49,260 --> 04:01:51,170
and that's almost everybody's starting
point when they they start to meditate

12580
04:01:51,170 --> 04:01:51,180
point when they they start to meditate
 

12581
04:01:51,180 --> 04:01:52,969
point when they they start to meditate
and that's almost always the place

12582
04:01:52,969 --> 04:01:52,979
and that's almost always the place
 

12583
04:01:52,979 --> 04:01:56,090
and that's almost always the place
people live most of their lives from I

12584
04:01:56,090 --> 04:01:56,100
people live most of their lives from I
 

12585
04:01:56,100 --> 04:01:57,710
people live most of their lives from I
do think that gets interrupted in ways

12586
04:01:57,710 --> 04:01:57,720
do think that gets interrupted in ways
 

12587
04:01:57,720 --> 04:01:59,630
do think that gets interrupted in ways
that get unrecognized I think people are

12588
04:01:59,630 --> 04:01:59,640
that get unrecognized I think people are
 

12589
04:01:59,640 --> 04:02:01,910
that get unrecognized I think people are
constantly losing the sense of I they're

12590
04:02:01,910 --> 04:02:01,920
constantly losing the sense of I they're
 

12591
04:02:01,920 --> 04:02:03,410
constantly losing the sense of I they're
losing the sense of subject object

12592
04:02:03,410 --> 04:02:03,420
losing the sense of subject object
 

12593
04:02:03,420 --> 04:02:04,370
losing the sense of subject object
distance

12594
04:02:04,370 --> 04:02:04,380
distance
 

12595
04:02:04,380 --> 04:02:06,710
distance
but they're not recognizing it and and

12596
04:02:06,710 --> 04:02:06,720
but they're not recognizing it and and
 

12597
04:02:06,720 --> 04:02:08,809
but they're not recognizing it and and
meditation is

12598
04:02:08,809 --> 04:02:08,819
meditation is
 

12599
04:02:08,819 --> 04:02:12,050
meditation is
the mode in which you can recognize you

12600
04:02:12,050 --> 04:02:12,060
the mode in which you can recognize you
 

12601
04:02:12,060 --> 04:02:13,910
the mode in which you can recognize you
can you can both consciously precipitate

12602
04:02:13,910 --> 04:02:13,920
can you can both consciously precipitate
 

12603
04:02:13,920 --> 04:02:16,010
can you can both consciously precipitate
it you can look for the self and fail to

12604
04:02:16,010 --> 04:02:16,020
it you can look for the self and fail to
 

12605
04:02:16,020 --> 04:02:19,030
it you can look for the self and fail to
find it and then recognize its absence

12606
04:02:19,030 --> 04:02:19,040
find it and then recognize its absence
 

12607
04:02:19,040 --> 04:02:22,130
find it and then recognize its absence
and that's the just the flip side of the

12608
04:02:22,130 --> 04:02:22,140
and that's the just the flip side of the
 

12609
04:02:22,140 --> 04:02:24,830
and that's the just the flip side of the
coin of free will I mean the the the the

12610
04:02:24,830 --> 04:02:24,840
coin of free will I mean the the the the
 

12611
04:02:24,840 --> 04:02:27,530
coin of free will I mean the the the the
feeling of having free will is what it

12612
04:02:27,530 --> 04:02:27,540
feeling of having free will is what it
 

12613
04:02:27,540 --> 04:02:30,050
feeling of having free will is what it
feels like to feel like a self

12614
04:02:30,050 --> 04:02:30,060
feels like to feel like a self
 

12615
04:02:30,060 --> 04:02:32,389
feels like to feel like a self
who's thinking his thoughts and doing

12616
04:02:32,389 --> 04:02:32,399
who's thinking his thoughts and doing
 

12617

and he the the man in the middle of the
 

12621
04:02:37,439 --> 04:02:39,590
and he the the man in the middle of the
boat who's Rowan

12622

boat who's Rowan
 

12623
04:02:39,600 --> 04:02:40,670
boat who's Rowan
um

12624
04:02:40,670 --> 04:02:40,680
um
 

12625
04:02:40,680 --> 04:02:42,650
um
that's the story that's the false

12626
04:02:42,650 --> 04:02:42,660
that's the story that's the false
 

12627
04:02:42,660 --> 04:02:44,450
that's the story that's the false
starting point when you find that

12628
04:02:44,450 --> 04:02:44,460
starting point when you find that
 

12629
04:02:44,460 --> 04:02:45,710
starting point when you find that
there's no one in the middle of the boat

12630
04:02:45,710 --> 04:02:45,720
there's no one in the middle of the boat
 

12631
04:02:45,720 --> 04:02:47,750
there's no one in the middle of the boat
right or in fact there's no boat there's

12632
04:02:47,750 --> 04:02:47,760
right or in fact there's no boat there's
 

12633
04:02:47,760 --> 04:02:50,450
right or in fact there's no boat there's
just the river there's just the flow of

12634
04:02:50,450 --> 04:02:50,460
just the river there's just the flow of
 

12635
04:02:50,460 --> 04:02:51,950
just the river there's just the flow of
experience

12636
04:02:51,950 --> 04:02:51,960
experience
 

12637
04:02:51,960 --> 04:02:53,809
experience
and there's no Center to it and there's

12638
04:02:53,809 --> 04:02:53,819
and there's no Center to it and there's
 

12639
04:02:53,819 --> 04:02:55,670
and there's no Center to it and there's
no place from which you would control it

12640
04:02:55,670 --> 04:02:55,680
no place from which you would control it
 

12641
04:02:55,680 --> 04:02:58,550
no place from which you would control it
again even when you're doing things this

12642
04:02:58,550 --> 04:02:58,560
again even when you're doing things this
 

12643
04:02:58,560 --> 04:02:59,870
again even when you're doing things this
does not negate the difference between

12644
04:02:59,870 --> 04:02:59,880
does not negate the difference between
 

12645
04:02:59,880 --> 04:03:01,849
does not negate the difference between
voluntary and involuntary Behavior it's

12646
04:03:01,849 --> 04:03:01,859
voluntary and involuntary Behavior it's
 

12647
04:03:01,859 --> 04:03:02,689
voluntary and involuntary Behavior it's
like

like
 

12649
04:03:02,699 --> 04:03:06,050
like
I can voluntarily reach for this but

12650
04:03:06,050 --> 04:03:06,060
I can voluntarily reach for this but
 

12651
04:03:06,060 --> 04:03:09,170
I can voluntarily reach for this but
when I'm paying attention I'm aware that

12652
04:03:09,170 --> 04:03:09,180
when I'm paying attention I'm aware that
 

12653
04:03:09,180 --> 04:03:10,910
when I'm paying attention I'm aware that
everything is just happening like just

the intention to move is just Horizon
 

12657
04:03:13,560 --> 04:03:15,349
the intention to move is just Horizon
right and

04:03:15,349 --> 04:03:15,359
right and
 

12659
04:03:15,359 --> 04:03:17,210
right and
I'm in no position I don't know why it

12660
04:03:17,210 --> 04:03:17,220
I'm in no position I don't know why it
 

12661
04:03:17,220 --> 04:03:19,849
I'm in no position I don't know why it
didn't arise a moment before or a moment

I move slow I mean I'm not

12672
04:03:33,889 --> 04:03:33,899
I move slow I mean I'm not
 

12673
04:03:33,899 --> 04:03:35,809
I move slow I mean I'm not
yeah I can never run the counter

12674
04:03:35,809 --> 04:03:35,819
yeah I can never run the counter
 

12675
04:03:35,819 --> 04:03:40,070
yeah I can never run the counter
factuals I can never all this opens the

12676
04:03:40,070 --> 04:03:40,080
factuals I can never all this opens the
 

12677
04:03:40,080 --> 04:03:42,469
factuals I can never all this opens the
door to a

12678
04:03:42,469 --> 04:03:42,479
door to a
 

12679
04:03:42,479 --> 04:03:44,210
door to a
and even more disconcerting picture

12680
04:03:44,210 --> 04:03:44,220
and even more disconcerting picture
 

12681
04:03:44,220 --> 04:03:46,150
and even more disconcerting picture
along the same lines which is

12682
04:03:46,150 --> 04:03:46,160
along the same lines which is

subsumes this conversation about Free

12684
04:03:48,170 --> 04:03:48,180
subsumes this conversation about Free
 

12685
04:03:48,180 --> 04:03:54,050
subsumes this conversation about Free
Will and it's the question of whether

12686
04:03:54,050 --> 04:03:54,060

 

12687
04:03:54,060 --> 04:03:57,650

anything is ever possible like what if

12688
04:03:57,650 --> 04:03:57,660
anything is ever possible like what if
 

12689
04:03:57,660 --> 04:04:00,110
anything is ever possible like what if
this is a question I I haven't thought a

12690
04:04:00,110 --> 04:04:00,120
this is a question I I haven't thought a
 

12691
04:04:00,120 --> 04:04:01,969
this is a question I I haven't thought a
lot of about it but

12692
04:04:01,969 --> 04:04:01,979
lot of about it but
 

12693
04:04:01,979 --> 04:04:03,769
lot of about it but
it's been a few years I've been kicking

12694
04:04:03,769 --> 04:04:03,779
it's been a few years I've been kicking
 

12695
04:04:03,779 --> 04:04:05,809
it's been a few years I've been kicking
this question around

12696
04:04:05,809 --> 04:04:05,819
this question around
 

12697
04:04:05,819 --> 04:04:07,790
this question around
um

12698
04:04:07,790 --> 04:04:07,800
um
 

12699
04:04:07,800 --> 04:04:10,969
um
so I mean what if only the actual

12700
04:04:10,969 --> 04:04:10,979
so I mean what if only the actual
 

12701
04:04:10,979 --> 04:04:13,429
so I mean what if only the actual
is possible would it what if there was

12702
04:04:13,429 --> 04:04:13,439
is possible would it what if there was
 

12703
04:04:13,439 --> 04:04:15,650
is possible would it what if there was
what if it was do we live with this

12704
04:04:15,650 --> 04:04:15,660
what if it was do we live with this
 

12705
04:04:15,660 --> 04:04:17,450
what if it was do we live with this
feeling of possibility we live with a

12706
04:04:17,450 --> 04:04:17,460
feeling of possibility we live with a
 

12707
04:04:17,460 --> 04:04:21,590
feeling of possibility we live with a
sense that

12708
04:04:21,590 --> 04:04:21,600

 

12709
04:04:21,600 --> 04:04:24,110

let me tell you so you know I have two

12710
04:04:24,110 --> 04:04:24,120
let me tell you so you know I have two
 

12711
04:04:24,120 --> 04:04:25,309
let me tell you so you know I have two
daughters

12712
04:04:25,309 --> 04:04:25,319
daughters
 

12713
04:04:25,319 --> 04:04:28,490
daughters
I could have had a third child right so

12714
04:04:28,490 --> 04:04:28,500
I could have had a third child right so
 

12715
04:04:28,500 --> 04:04:30,229
I could have had a third child right so
what does it mean to say that I could

12716
04:04:30,229 --> 04:04:30,239
what does it mean to say that I could
 

12717
04:04:30,239 --> 04:04:31,849
what does it mean to say that I could
have had a third child all right so do

12718
04:04:31,849 --> 04:04:31,859
have had a third child all right so do
 

12719
04:04:31,859 --> 04:04:34,130
have had a third child all right so do
you you don't have kids I don't think so

12720
04:04:34,130 --> 04:04:34,140
you you don't have kids I don't think so
 

12721
04:04:34,140 --> 04:04:35,870
you you don't have kids I don't think so
not that I know of yes so the

12722
04:04:35,870 --> 04:04:35,880
not that I know of yes so the
 

12723
04:04:35,880 --> 04:04:38,450
not that I know of yes so the
possibility might be there so what do we

12724
04:04:38,450 --> 04:04:38,460
possibility might be there so what do we
 

12725
04:04:38,460 --> 04:04:40,269
possibility might be there so what do we
mean when we say

12726
04:04:40,269 --> 04:04:40,279
mean when we say
 

12727
04:04:40,279 --> 04:04:44,570
mean when we say
you could have had a child or

12728
04:04:44,570 --> 04:04:44,580
you could have had a child or
 

12729
04:04:44,580 --> 04:04:47,210
you could have had a child or
you might you you might have a child in

12730
04:04:47,210 --> 04:04:47,220
you might you you might have a child in
 

12731
04:04:47,220 --> 04:04:50,269
you might you you might have a child in
the future like what what what is the

12732
04:04:50,269 --> 04:04:50,279
the future like what what what is the
 

12733
04:04:50,279 --> 04:04:52,070
the future like what what what is the
space in real what's the relationship

12734
04:04:52,070 --> 04:04:52,080
space in real what's the relationship
 

12735
04:04:52,080 --> 04:04:55,429
space in real what's the relationship
between possibility and actuality and

12736
04:04:55,429 --> 04:04:55,439
between possibility and actuality and
 

12737
04:04:55,439 --> 04:04:59,769
between possibility and actuality and
reality is there a reality in which

12738
04:04:59,769 --> 04:04:59,779

 

12739
04:04:59,779 --> 04:05:01,969

non-actual things

12740
04:05:01,969 --> 04:05:01,979
non-actual things
 

12741
04:05:01,979 --> 04:05:05,450
non-actual things
are nonetheless real and so there we

12742
04:05:05,450 --> 04:05:05,460
are nonetheless real and so there we
 

12743
04:05:05,460 --> 04:05:08,030
are nonetheless real and so there we
have other categories of like non

12744
04:05:08,030 --> 04:05:08,040
have other categories of like non
 

12745
04:05:08,040 --> 04:05:09,830
have other categories of like non
concrete things we have things that

12746
04:05:09,830 --> 04:05:09,840
concrete things we have things that
 

12747
04:05:09,840 --> 04:05:12,110
concrete things we have things that
don't have spatial temporal Dimension

12748
04:05:12,110 --> 04:05:12,120
don't have spatial temporal Dimension
 

12749
04:05:12,120 --> 04:05:14,030
don't have spatial temporal Dimension
but they're nonetheless they they

12750
04:05:14,030 --> 04:05:14,040
but they're nonetheless they they
 

12751
04:05:14,040 --> 04:05:17,330
but they're nonetheless they they
nonetheless exist so like you know in

12752
04:05:17,330 --> 04:05:17,340
nonetheless exist so like you know in
 

12753
04:05:17,340 --> 04:05:20,090
nonetheless exist so like you know in
the integers right so numbers

12754
04:05:20,090 --> 04:05:20,100
the integers right so numbers
 

12755
04:05:20,100 --> 04:05:22,790
the integers right so numbers
there's a there's a reality there's an

12756
04:05:22,790 --> 04:05:22,800
there's a there's a reality there's an
 

12757
04:05:22,800 --> 04:05:25,729
there's a there's a reality there's an
abstract reality to numbers and this is

12758
04:05:25,729 --> 04:05:25,739
abstract reality to numbers and this is
 

12759
04:05:25,739 --> 04:05:27,050
abstract reality to numbers and this is
it's philosophically interesting to

12760
04:05:27,050 --> 04:05:27,060
it's philosophically interesting to
 

12761
04:05:27,060 --> 04:05:28,250
it's philosophically interesting to
think about these things so they're not

12762
04:05:28,250 --> 04:05:28,260
think about these things so they're not
 

12763
04:05:28,260 --> 04:05:31,670
think about these things so they're not
like in some sense they're

12764
04:05:31,670 --> 04:05:31,680
like in some sense they're
 

12765
04:05:31,680 --> 04:05:34,010
like in some sense they're
they're they're real

12766
04:05:34,010 --> 04:05:34,020
they're they're real
 

12767
04:05:34,020 --> 04:05:35,809
they're they're real
and they're just they're not merely

12768
04:05:35,809 --> 04:05:35,819
and they're just they're not merely
 

12769
04:05:35,819 --> 04:05:37,370
and they're just they're not merely
invented by us they're discovered

12770
04:05:37,370 --> 04:05:37,380
invented by us they're discovered
 

12771
04:05:37,380 --> 04:05:38,870
invented by us they're discovered
because they have structure that we

12772
04:05:38,870 --> 04:05:38,880
because they have structure that we
 

12773
04:05:38,880 --> 04:05:40,309
because they have structure that we
can't impose upon them right it's not

12774
04:05:40,309 --> 04:05:40,319
can't impose upon them right it's not
 

12775
04:05:40,319 --> 04:05:42,229
can't impose upon them right it's not
like they're not fictional characters

12776
04:05:42,229 --> 04:05:42,239
like they're not fictional characters
 

12777
04:05:42,239 --> 04:05:45,170
like they're not fictional characters
like you know I mean Hamlet and Superman

12778
04:05:45,170 --> 04:05:45,180
like you know I mean Hamlet and Superman
 

12779
04:05:45,180 --> 04:05:47,809
like you know I mean Hamlet and Superman
also exist in some sense but they exist

12780
04:05:47,809 --> 04:05:47,819
also exist in some sense but they exist
 

12781
04:05:47,819 --> 04:05:49,910
also exist in some sense but they exist
at the level of of Our Own

12782
04:05:49,910 --> 04:05:49,920
at the level of of Our Own
 

12783
04:05:49,920 --> 04:05:52,849
at the level of of Our Own
fiction and abstraction but it's like

12784
04:05:52,849 --> 04:05:52,859
fiction and abstraction but it's like
 

12785
04:05:52,859 --> 04:05:54,650
fiction and abstraction but it's like
they're true they're true and false

12786
04:05:54,650 --> 04:05:54,660
they're true they're true and false
 

12787
04:05:54,660 --> 04:05:56,030
they're true they're true and false
statements you can make about Hamlet

12788
04:05:56,030 --> 04:05:56,040
statements you can make about Hamlet
 

12789
04:05:56,040 --> 04:05:57,769
statements you can make about Hamlet
they're true and false statements you

12790
04:05:57,769 --> 04:05:57,779
they're true and false statements you
 

12791
04:05:57,779 --> 04:06:00,650
they're true and false statements you
can make about Superman because our

12792
04:06:00,650 --> 04:06:00,660
can make about Superman because our
 

12793
04:06:00,660 --> 04:06:02,510
can make about Superman because our
fiction the fictional worlds we've

12794
04:06:02,510 --> 04:06:02,520
fiction the fictional worlds we've
 

12795
04:06:02,520 --> 04:06:03,830
fiction the fictional worlds we've
created have a certain kind of structure

12796
04:06:03,830 --> 04:06:03,840
created have a certain kind of structure
 

12797
04:06:03,840 --> 04:06:06,050
created have a certain kind of structure
but again this is all abstract it's like

12798
04:06:06,050 --> 04:06:06,060
but again this is all abstract it's like
 

12799
04:06:06,060 --> 04:06:08,570
but again this is all abstract it's like
it's all abstractable from any of its

12800
04:06:08,570 --> 04:06:08,580
it's all abstractable from any of its
 

12801
04:06:08,580 --> 04:06:10,670
it's all abstractable from any of its
concrete instantiations it's not just in

12802
04:06:10,670 --> 04:06:10,680
concrete instantiations it's not just in
 

12803
04:06:10,680 --> 04:06:12,170
concrete instantiations it's not just in
the comic books and just in the movies

12804
04:06:12,170 --> 04:06:12,180
the comic books and just in the movies
 

12805
04:06:12,180 --> 04:06:16,250
the comic books and just in the movies
it's in our you know ongoing ideas about

12806
04:06:16,250 --> 04:06:16,260
it's in our you know ongoing ideas about
 

12807
04:06:16,260 --> 04:06:17,689
it's in our you know ongoing ideas about
these characters

12808
04:06:17,689 --> 04:06:17,699
these characters
 

12809
04:06:17,699 --> 04:06:19,969
these characters
but natural numbers or

12810
04:06:19,969 --> 04:06:19,979
but natural numbers or
 

12811
04:06:19,979 --> 04:06:20,630
but natural numbers or
um

12812
04:06:20,630 --> 04:06:20,640
um
 

12813
04:06:20,640 --> 04:06:23,269
um
the integers don't

12814
04:06:23,269 --> 04:06:23,279
the integers don't
 

12815
04:06:23,279 --> 04:06:25,070
the integers don't
function quite that way I mean they're

12816
04:06:25,070 --> 04:06:25,080
function quite that way I mean they're
 

12817
04:06:25,080 --> 04:06:26,870
function quite that way I mean they're
similar but they also have a structure

12818
04:06:26,870 --> 04:06:26,880
similar but they also have a structure
 

12819
04:06:26,880 --> 04:06:28,790
similar but they also have a structure
that's purely a matter of Discovery it's

12820
04:06:28,790 --> 04:06:28,800
that's purely a matter of Discovery it's
 

12821
04:06:28,800 --> 04:06:31,070
that's purely a matter of Discovery it's
not you can't just make up whether

12822
04:06:31,070 --> 04:06:31,080
not you can't just make up whether
 

12823
04:06:31,080 --> 04:06:32,570
not you can't just make up whether
numbers are prime

12824
04:06:32,570 --> 04:06:32,580
numbers are prime
 

12825
04:06:32,580 --> 04:06:34,790
numbers are prime
you know if you give me two integers you

12826
04:06:34,790 --> 04:06:34,800
you know if you give me two integers you
 

12827
04:06:34,800 --> 04:06:37,510
you know if you give me two integers you
know of a certain size to let's you

12828
04:06:37,510 --> 04:06:37,520
know of a certain size to let's you
 

12829
04:06:37,520 --> 04:06:40,189
know of a certain size to let's you
mentioned two enormous integers

12830
04:06:40,189 --> 04:06:40,199
mentioned two enormous integers
 

12831
04:06:40,199 --> 04:06:41,990
mentioned two enormous integers
if I were to say okay well between those

12832
04:06:41,990 --> 04:06:42,000
if I were to say okay well between those
 

12833
04:06:42,000 --> 04:06:44,630
if I were to say okay well between those
two integers they're exactly 11 prime

12834
04:06:44,630 --> 04:06:44,640
two integers they're exactly 11 prime
 

12835
04:06:44,640 --> 04:06:47,510
two integers they're exactly 11 prime
numbers right that's a very specific

12836
04:06:47,510 --> 04:06:47,520
numbers right that's a very specific
 

12837
04:06:47,520 --> 04:06:49,429
numbers right that's a very specific
Claim about which I can be right or

12838
04:06:49,429 --> 04:06:49,439
Claim about which I can be right or
 

12839
04:06:49,439 --> 04:06:51,229
Claim about which I can be right or
wrong and whether or not anyone knows

12840
04:06:51,229 --> 04:06:51,239
wrong and whether or not anyone knows
 

12841
04:06:51,239 --> 04:06:52,610
wrong and whether or not anyone knows
I'm right or it's like that's just

12842
04:06:52,610 --> 04:06:52,620
I'm right or it's like that's just
 

12843
04:06:52,620 --> 04:06:54,710
I'm right or it's like that's just
there's a domain of facts there these

12844
04:06:54,710 --> 04:06:54,720
there's a domain of facts there these
 

12845
04:06:54,720 --> 04:06:56,510
there's a domain of facts there these
are abstract it's an abstract reality

12846
04:06:56,510 --> 04:06:56,520
are abstract it's an abstract reality
 

12847
04:06:56,520 --> 04:06:58,910
are abstract it's an abstract reality
that relates in some way that's

12848
04:06:58,910 --> 04:06:58,920
that relates in some way that's
 

12849
04:06:58,920 --> 04:07:00,590
that relates in some way that's
philosophically interesting you know

12850
04:07:00,590 --> 04:07:00,600
philosophically interesting you know
 

12851
04:07:00,600 --> 04:07:02,750
philosophically interesting you know
metaphysically interesting too

12852
04:07:02,750 --> 04:07:02,760
metaphysically interesting too
 

12853
04:07:02,760 --> 04:07:04,790
metaphysically interesting too
what we call real reality you know this

12854
04:07:04,790 --> 04:07:04,800
what we call real reality you know this
 

12855
04:07:04,800 --> 04:07:07,070
what we call real reality you know this
the spatial temporal order

12856
04:07:07,070 --> 04:07:07,080
the spatial temporal order
 

12857
04:07:07,080 --> 04:07:08,990
the spatial temporal order
the physics of things

12858
04:07:08,990 --> 04:07:09,000
the physics of things
 

12859
04:07:09,000 --> 04:07:10,389
the physics of things
but

12860
04:07:10,389 --> 04:07:10,399
but
 

12861
04:07:10,399 --> 04:07:13,910
but
possibility at least in my view occupies

12862
04:07:13,910 --> 04:07:13,920
possibility at least in my view occupies
 

12863
04:07:13,920 --> 04:07:16,250
possibility at least in my view occupies
a different space and this is something

12864
04:07:16,250 --> 04:07:16,260
a different space and this is something
 

12865
04:07:16,260 --> 04:07:18,469
a different space and this is something
again I my thoughts on this are pretty

12866
04:07:18,469 --> 04:07:18,479
again I my thoughts on this are pretty
 

12867
04:07:18,479 --> 04:07:22,010
again I my thoughts on this are pretty
in co-ed I I think I need to talk to

12868
04:07:22,010 --> 04:07:22,020
in co-ed I I think I need to talk to
 

12869
04:07:22,020 --> 04:07:24,710
in co-ed I I think I need to talk to
a philosopher of physics and and or a

12870
04:07:24,710 --> 04:07:24,720
a philosopher of physics and and or a
 

12871
04:07:24,720 --> 04:07:26,090
a philosopher of physics and and or a
physicist about how this may interact

12872
04:07:26,090 --> 04:07:26,100
physicist about how this may interact
 

12873
04:07:26,100 --> 04:07:27,710
physicist about how this may interact
with with things like the many worlds

12874
04:07:27,710 --> 04:07:27,720
with with things like the many worlds
 

12875
04:07:27,720 --> 04:07:29,450
with with things like the many worlds
interpretation yeah that's an

12876
04:07:29,450 --> 04:07:29,460
interpretation yeah that's an
 

12877
04:07:29,460 --> 04:07:33,050
interpretation yeah that's an
interesting right right exactly so I I

12878
04:07:33,050 --> 04:07:33,060
interesting right right exactly so I I
 

12879
04:07:33,060 --> 04:07:35,450
interesting right right exactly so I I
wonder if discover is in physics like

12880
04:07:35,450 --> 04:07:35,460
wonder if discover is in physics like
 

12881
04:07:35,460 --> 04:07:37,370
wonder if discover is in physics like
further proof or more concrete proof

12882
04:07:37,370 --> 04:07:37,380
further proof or more concrete proof
 

12883
04:07:37,380 --> 04:07:38,750
further proof or more concrete proof
that many world's interpretation of

12884
04:07:38,750 --> 04:07:38,760
that many world's interpretation of
 

12885
04:07:38,760 --> 04:07:41,210
that many world's interpretation of
quantum mechanics has some validity

12886
04:07:41,210 --> 04:07:41,220
quantum mechanics has some validity
 

12887
04:07:41,220 --> 04:07:43,010
quantum mechanics has some validity
right if that completely starts to

12888
04:07:43,010 --> 04:07:43,020
right if that completely starts to
 

12889
04:07:43,020 --> 04:07:45,110
right if that completely starts to
change things but even if that that's

12890
04:07:45,110 --> 04:07:45,120
change things but even if that that's
 

12891
04:07:45,120 --> 04:07:46,809
change things but even if that that's
just more

12892
04:07:46,809 --> 04:07:46,819
just more
 

12893
04:07:46,819 --> 04:07:50,030
just more
actuality so if I took that seriously ah

12894
04:07:50,030 --> 04:07:50,040
actuality so if I took that seriously ah
 

12895
04:07:50,040 --> 04:07:53,150
actuality so if I took that seriously ah
sure that's that's a case of

12896
04:07:53,150 --> 04:07:53,160
sure that's that's a case of
 

12897
04:07:53,160 --> 04:07:55,070
sure that's that's a case of
and and Truth is that happens even even

12898
04:07:55,070 --> 04:07:55,080
and and Truth is that happens even even
 

12899
04:07:55,080 --> 04:07:57,830
and and Truth is that happens even even
if the many worlds interpretation isn't

12900
04:07:57,830 --> 04:07:57,840
if the many worlds interpretation isn't
 

12901
04:07:57,840 --> 04:07:59,809
if the many worlds interpretation isn't
true but we just imagine we have a

12902
04:07:59,809 --> 04:07:59,819
true but we just imagine we have a
 

12903
04:07:59,819 --> 04:08:02,510
true but we just imagine we have a
physically infinite universe

12904
04:08:02,510 --> 04:08:02,520
physically infinite universe
 

12905
04:08:02,520 --> 04:08:04,969
physically infinite universe
the implication of infinity is such that

12906
04:08:04,969 --> 04:08:04,979
the implication of infinity is such that
 

12907
04:08:04,979 --> 04:08:06,969
the implication of infinity is such that
things will begin to repeat themselves

12908
04:08:06,969 --> 04:08:06,979
things will begin to repeat themselves
 

12909
04:08:06,979 --> 04:08:09,110
things will begin to repeat themselves
you know the farther you go in space

12910
04:08:09,110 --> 04:08:09,120
you know the farther you go in space
 

12911
04:08:09,120 --> 04:08:11,150
you know the farther you go in space
right so the you know if

12912
04:08:11,150 --> 04:08:11,160
right so the you know if
 

12913
04:08:11,160 --> 04:08:12,830
right so the you know if
if you just head out in One Direction

12914
04:08:12,830 --> 04:08:12,840
if you just head out in One Direction
 

12915
04:08:12,840 --> 04:08:14,210
if you just head out in One Direction
eventually you're going to meet two

12916
04:08:14,210 --> 04:08:14,220
eventually you're going to meet two
 

12917
04:08:14,220 --> 04:08:15,950
eventually you're going to meet two
people just like us having a

12918
04:08:15,950 --> 04:08:15,960
people just like us having a
 

12919
04:08:15,960 --> 04:08:17,870
people just like us having a
conversation just like this and you're

12920
04:08:17,870 --> 04:08:17,880
conversation just like this and you're
 

12921
04:08:17,880 --> 04:08:19,130
conversation just like this and you're
going to meet them an infinite number of

12922
04:08:19,130 --> 04:08:19,140
going to meet them an infinite number of
 

12923
04:08:19,140 --> 04:08:22,790
going to meet them an infinite number of
times in every you know infinite variety

12924
04:08:22,790 --> 04:08:22,800
times in every you know infinite variety
 

12925
04:08:22,800 --> 04:08:24,590
times in every you know infinite variety
of permutations slightly different from

12926
04:08:24,590 --> 04:08:24,600
of permutations slightly different from
 

12927
04:08:24,600 --> 04:08:26,269
of permutations slightly different from
this conversation right so I mean

12928
04:08:26,269 --> 04:08:26,279
this conversation right so I mean
 

12929
04:08:26,279 --> 04:08:28,490
this conversation right so I mean
Infinity is just so big that our

12930
04:08:28,490 --> 04:08:28,500
Infinity is just so big that our
 

12931
04:08:28,500 --> 04:08:29,990
Infinity is just so big that our
intuitions of probability completely

12932
04:08:29,990 --> 04:08:30,000
intuitions of probability completely
 

12933
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:31,070
intuitions of probability completely
break down

12934
04:08:31,070 --> 04:08:31,080
break down
 

12935
04:08:31,080 --> 04:08:33,710
break down
but what I'm suggesting is

12936
04:08:33,710 --> 04:08:33,720
but what I'm suggesting is
 

12937
04:08:33,720 --> 04:08:36,410
but what I'm suggesting is
maybe probability isn't a thing right

12938
04:08:36,410 --> 04:08:36,420
maybe probability isn't a thing right
 

12939
04:08:36,420 --> 04:08:39,590
maybe probability isn't a thing right
maybe there's only actuality if there's

12940
04:08:39,590 --> 04:08:39,600
maybe there's only actuality if there's
 

12941
04:08:39,600 --> 04:08:41,750
maybe there's only actuality if there's
maybe there's only what happens

12942
04:08:41,750 --> 04:08:41,760
maybe there's only what happens
 

12943
04:08:41,760 --> 04:08:44,750
maybe there's only what happens
and at every point along the way

12944
04:08:44,750 --> 04:08:44,760
and at every point along the way
 

12945
04:08:44,760 --> 04:08:46,429
and at every point along the way
our notion of what could have happened

12946
04:08:46,429 --> 04:08:46,439
our notion of what could have happened
 

12947
04:08:46,439 --> 04:08:48,769
our notion of what could have happened
or what might have happened is just that

12948
04:08:48,769 --> 04:08:48,779
or what might have happened is just that
 

12949
04:08:48,779 --> 04:08:51,349
or what might have happened is just that
it's just a thought about what could

12950
04:08:51,349 --> 04:08:51,359
it's just a thought about what could
 

12951
04:08:51,359 --> 04:08:53,269
it's just a thought about what could
have happened or there's no so it's a

12952
04:08:53,269 --> 04:08:53,279
have happened or there's no so it's a
 

12953
04:08:53,279 --> 04:08:54,650
have happened or there's no so it's a
fundamentally different thing if you can

12954
04:08:54,650 --> 04:08:54,660
fundamentally different thing if you can
 

12955
04:08:54,660 --> 04:08:56,630
fundamentally different thing if you can
imagine a thing that doesn't make it

12956
04:08:56,630 --> 04:08:56,640
imagine a thing that doesn't make it
 

12957
04:08:56,640 --> 04:08:57,650
imagine a thing that doesn't make it
real

12958
04:08:57,650 --> 04:08:57,660
real
 

12959
04:08:57,660 --> 04:08:59,870
real
so they because that's that's where that

12960
04:08:59,870 --> 04:08:59,880
so they because that's that's where that
 

12961
04:08:59,880 --> 04:09:02,469
so they because that's that's where that
possibility exists in your imagination

12962
04:09:02,469 --> 04:09:02,479
possibility exists in your imagination
 

12963
04:09:02,479 --> 04:09:05,510
possibility exists in your imagination
yeah and and possibility itself is a

12964
04:09:05,510 --> 04:09:05,520
yeah and and possibility itself is a
 

12965
04:09:05,520 --> 04:09:08,030
yeah and and possibility itself is a
kind of spooky idea because it it too

12966
04:09:08,030 --> 04:09:08,040
kind of spooky idea because it it too
 

12967
04:09:08,040 --> 04:09:10,189
kind of spooky idea because it it too
has a sort of structure

12968
04:09:10,189 --> 04:09:10,199
has a sort of structure
 

12969
04:09:10,199 --> 04:09:16,250
has a sort of structure
right so like if I if I'm going to say

12970
04:09:16,250 --> 04:09:16,260

 

12971
04:09:16,260 --> 04:09:17,870

you know

12972
04:09:17,870 --> 04:09:17,880
you know
 

12973
04:09:17,880 --> 04:09:21,410
you know
you could have had a daughter right last

12974
04:09:21,410 --> 04:09:21,420
you could have had a daughter right last
 

12975
04:09:21,420 --> 04:09:23,990
you could have had a daughter right last
year

12976
04:09:23,990 --> 04:09:24,000

 

12977
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:25,849

um

12978
04:09:25,849 --> 04:09:25,859
um
 

12979
04:09:25,859 --> 04:09:28,729
um
so we're saying that's that's possible

12980
04:09:28,729 --> 04:09:28,739
so we're saying that's that's possible
 

12981
04:09:28,739 --> 04:09:30,650
so we're saying that's that's possible
but not actual

12982
04:09:30,650 --> 04:09:30,660
but not actual
 

12983
04:09:30,660 --> 04:09:33,469
but not actual
right that is a claim they're things

12984
04:09:33,469 --> 04:09:33,479
right that is a claim they're things
 

12985
04:09:33,479 --> 04:09:34,910
right that is a claim they're things
that

12986
04:09:34,910 --> 04:09:34,920
that
 

12987
04:09:34,920 --> 04:09:36,950
that
are true and not true

12988
04:09:36,950 --> 04:09:36,960
are true and not true
 

12989
04:09:36,960 --> 04:09:38,990
are true and not true
about that daughter right like that it

12990
04:09:38,990 --> 04:09:39,000
about that daughter right like that it
 

12991
04:09:39,000 --> 04:09:40,670
about that daughter right like that it
has a kind of structure it's like

12992
04:09:40,670 --> 04:09:40,680
has a kind of structure it's like
 

12993
04:09:40,680 --> 04:09:43,910
has a kind of structure it's like
I feel like there's a lot of fog around

12994
04:09:43,910 --> 04:09:43,920
I feel like there's a lot of fog around
 

12995
04:09:43,920 --> 04:09:46,670
I feel like there's a lot of fog around
that the possibility it feels like

12996
04:09:46,670 --> 04:09:46,680
that the possibility it feels like
 

12997
04:09:46,680 --> 04:09:48,769
that the possibility it feels like
almost like a useful narrative but what

12998
04:09:48,769 --> 04:09:48,779
almost like a useful narrative but what
 

12999
04:09:48,779 --> 04:09:50,570
almost like a useful narrative but what
does it mean so like

13000
04:09:50,570 --> 04:09:50,580
does it mean so like
 

13001
04:09:50,580 --> 04:09:54,170
does it mean so like
what does it mean if if we say you know

13002
04:09:54,170 --> 04:09:54,180
what does it mean if if we say you know
 

13003
04:09:54,180 --> 04:09:56,630
what does it mean if if we say you know
I just did that but I'm it's conceivable

13004
04:09:56,630 --> 04:09:56,640
I just did that but I'm it's conceivable
 

13005
04:09:56,640 --> 04:09:57,830
I just did that but I'm it's conceivable
that I wouldn't have done that right

13006
04:09:57,830 --> 04:09:57,840
that I wouldn't have done that right
 

13007
04:09:57,840 --> 04:09:59,750
that I wouldn't have done that right
like it's possible that I I just threw

13008
04:09:59,750 --> 04:09:59,760
like it's possible that I I just threw
 

13009
04:09:59,760 --> 04:10:02,630
like it's possible that I I just threw
this cap but I might not have done that

13010
04:10:02,630 --> 04:10:02,640
this cap but I might not have done that
 

13011
04:10:02,640 --> 04:10:05,150
this cap but I might not have done that
so you're taking it very temporarily

13012
04:10:05,150 --> 04:10:05,160
so you're taking it very temporarily
 

13013
04:10:05,160 --> 04:10:07,130
so you're taking it very temporarily
close to the original like what would

13014
04:10:07,130 --> 04:10:07,140
close to the original like what would
 

13015
04:10:07,140 --> 04:10:08,630
close to the original like what would
appear as a decision

13016
04:10:08,630 --> 04:10:08,640
appear as a decision
 

13017
04:10:08,640 --> 04:10:10,250
appear as a decision
whenever we're saying something's

13018
04:10:10,250 --> 04:10:10,260
whenever we're saying something's
 

13019
04:10:10,260 --> 04:10:13,010
whenever we're saying something's
possible but not actual right like this

13020
04:10:13,010 --> 04:10:13,020
possible but not actual right like this
 

13021
04:10:13,020 --> 04:10:16,010
possible but not actual right like this
thing just happened but it's conceived

13022
04:10:16,010 --> 04:10:16,020
thing just happened but it's conceived
 

13023
04:10:16,020 --> 04:10:17,389
thing just happened but it's conceived
it's possible that it wouldn't have

13024
04:10:17,389 --> 04:10:17,399
it's possible that it wouldn't have
 

13025
04:10:17,399 --> 04:10:18,410
it's possible that it wouldn't have
happened or that would have happened

13026
04:10:18,410 --> 04:10:18,420
happened or that would have happened
 

13027
04:10:18,420 --> 04:10:20,450
happened or that would have happened
differently

13028
04:10:20,450 --> 04:10:20,460
differently
 

13029
04:10:20,460 --> 04:10:23,929
differently
in what does that possibility

13030
04:10:23,929 --> 04:10:23,939
in what does that possibility
 

13031
04:10:23,939 --> 04:10:26,809
in what does that possibility
consist like where is that what it for

13032
04:10:26,809 --> 04:10:26,819
consist like where is that what it for
 

13033
04:10:26,819 --> 04:10:29,389
consist like where is that what it for
that to be real for the possibility to

13034
04:10:29,389 --> 04:10:29,399
that to be real for the possibility to
 

13035
04:10:29,399 --> 04:10:30,729
that to be real for the possibility to
be real

13036
04:10:30,729 --> 04:10:30,739
be real
 

13037
04:10:30,739 --> 04:10:33,170
be real
what do we what claim are we making

13038
04:10:33,170 --> 04:10:33,180
what do we what claim are we making
 

13039
04:10:33,180 --> 04:10:34,490
what do we what claim are we making
about

13040
04:10:34,490 --> 04:10:34,500
about
 

13041
04:10:34,500 --> 04:10:36,530
about
the universe well isn't that an

13042
04:10:36,530 --> 04:10:36,540
the universe well isn't that an
 

13043
04:10:36,540 --> 04:10:38,689
the universe well isn't that an
extension of the idea that Free Will is

13044
04:10:38,689 --> 04:10:38,699
extension of the idea that Free Will is
 

13045
04:10:38,699 --> 04:10:40,070
extension of the idea that Free Will is
an illusion that all we have is

13046
04:10:40,070 --> 04:10:40,080
an illusion that all we have is
 

13047
04:10:40,080 --> 04:10:41,990
an illusion that all we have is
sexuality that the possibility isn't

13048
04:10:41,990 --> 04:10:42,000
sexuality that the possibility isn't
 

13049
04:10:42,000 --> 04:10:43,790
sexuality that the possibility isn't
right yeah I'm just extending it Beyond

13050
04:10:43,790 --> 04:10:43,800
right yeah I'm just extending it Beyond
 

13051
04:10:43,800 --> 04:10:47,269
right yeah I'm just extending it Beyond
is there human action uh like it's it

13052
04:10:47,269 --> 04:10:47,279
is there human action uh like it's it
 

13053
04:10:47,279 --> 04:10:48,530
is there human action uh like it's it
this goes to the physics of things this

13054
04:10:48,530 --> 04:10:48,540
this goes to the physics of things this
 

13055
04:10:48,540 --> 04:10:50,450
this goes to the physics of things this
is just everything like we're always

13056
04:10:50,450 --> 04:10:50,460
is just everything like we're always
 

13057
04:10:50,460 --> 04:10:52,790
is just everything like we're always
telling ourselves a story yeah that

13058
04:10:52,790 --> 04:10:52,800
telling ourselves a story yeah that
 

13059
04:10:52,800 --> 04:10:55,010
telling ourselves a story yeah that
includes possibility possibility is

13060
04:10:55,010 --> 04:10:55,020
includes possibility possibility is
 

13061
04:10:55,020 --> 04:10:57,670
includes possibility possibility is
really compelling for some reason

13062
04:10:57,670 --> 04:10:57,680
really compelling for some reason
 

13063
04:10:57,680 --> 04:11:00,349
really compelling for some reason
well yeah well because it's it's

13064
04:11:00,349 --> 04:11:00,359
well yeah well because it's it's
 

13065
04:11:00,359 --> 04:11:02,689
well yeah well because it's it's
I mean so this yeah I mean this could

13066
04:11:02,689 --> 04:11:02,699
I mean so this yeah I mean this could
 

13067
04:11:02,699 --> 04:11:05,510
I mean so this yeah I mean this could
sound just academic but it every

13068
04:11:05,510 --> 04:11:05,520
sound just academic but it every
 

13069
04:11:05,520 --> 04:11:08,450
sound just academic but it every
backward looking regret or

13070
04:11:08,450 --> 04:11:08,460
backward looking regret or
 

13071
04:11:08,460 --> 04:11:09,590
backward looking regret or
disappointment

13072
04:11:09,590 --> 04:11:09,600
disappointment
 

13073
04:11:09,600 --> 04:11:12,889
disappointment
and every forward-looking worry

13074
04:11:12,889 --> 04:11:12,899
and every forward-looking worry
 

13075
04:11:12,899 --> 04:11:15,710
and every forward-looking worry
is completely dependent on this notion

13076
04:11:15,710 --> 04:11:15,720
is completely dependent on this notion
 

13077
04:11:15,720 --> 04:11:18,290
is completely dependent on this notion
of possibility like every regret is

13078
04:11:18,290 --> 04:11:18,300
of possibility like every regret is
 

13079
04:11:18,300 --> 04:11:20,030
of possibility like every regret is
based on the sense that something else I

13080
04:11:20,030 --> 04:11:20,040
based on the sense that something else I
 

13081
04:11:20,040 --> 04:11:21,170
based on the sense that something else I
could have done something else something

13082
04:11:21,170 --> 04:11:21,180
could have done something else something
 

13083
04:11:21,180 --> 04:11:24,070
could have done something else something
else could have happened every

13084
04:11:24,070 --> 04:11:24,080
else could have happened every
 

13085
04:11:24,080 --> 04:11:27,290
else could have happened every
disposition to worry about the future

13086
04:11:27,290 --> 04:11:27,300
disposition to worry about the future
 

13087
04:11:27,300 --> 04:11:29,510
disposition to worry about the future
is based on the feeling that there's

13088
04:11:29,510 --> 04:11:29,520
is based on the feeling that there's
 

13089
04:11:29,520 --> 04:11:31,370
is based on the feeling that there's
this range of possibilities it could go

13090
04:11:31,370 --> 04:11:31,380
this range of possibilities it could go
 

13091
04:11:31,380 --> 04:11:32,450
this range of possibilities it could go
either way

13092
04:11:32,450 --> 04:11:32,460
either way
 

13093
04:11:32,460 --> 04:11:35,210
either way
and

13094
04:11:35,210 --> 04:11:35,220
and
 

13095
04:11:35,220 --> 04:11:37,250
and
you know I I know whether whether or not

13096
04:11:37,250 --> 04:11:37,260
you know I I know whether whether or not
 

13097
04:11:37,260 --> 04:11:38,809
you know I I know whether whether or not
there's such a thing as possibility you

13098
04:11:38,809 --> 04:11:38,819
there's such a thing as possibility you
 

13099
04:11:38,819 --> 04:11:40,370
there's such a thing as possibility you
know I'm convinced that worry is Almost

13100
04:11:40,370 --> 04:11:40,380
know I'm convinced that worry is Almost
 

13101
04:11:40,380 --> 04:11:41,830
know I'm convinced that worry is Almost
Never

13102
04:11:41,830 --> 04:11:41,840
Never

04:11:43,500 --> 04:11:45,830
psychologically
appropriate because the reality is in

04:11:47,279 --> 04:11:49,070
any given moment
either you can do something to solve the

13110
04:11:49,070 --> 04:11:49,080
either you can do something to solve the
 

13111
04:11:49,080 --> 04:11:50,750
either you can do something to solve the
problem you're worried about or not so

if you can do something just do it you

if you can do something just do it you
 

13115
04:11:52,800 --> 04:11:54,590
if you can do something just do it you
know and if you can't you're worrying is

13116
04:11:54,590 --> 04:11:54,600
know and if you can't you're worrying is
 

13117
04:11:54,600 --> 04:11:56,389
know and if you can't you're worrying is
just causing you to suffer twice over

13118
04:11:56,389 --> 04:11:56,399
just causing you to suffer twice over
 

13119
04:11:56,399 --> 04:11:57,590
just causing you to suffer twice over
right you're gonna

04:11:59,100 --> 04:12:00,769
you know you're gonna you're gonna get
the medical procedure next week anyway

13124
04:12:00,769 --> 04:12:00,779
the medical procedure next week anyway
 

13125
04:12:00,779 --> 04:12:03,290
the medical procedure next week anyway
how much time between now and next week

13126
04:12:03,290 --> 04:12:03,300
how much time between now and next week
 

13127
04:12:03,300 --> 04:12:04,550
how much time between now and next week
do you want to spend worrying about it

13128
04:12:04,550 --> 04:12:04,560
do you want to spend worrying about it
 

13129
04:12:04,560 --> 04:12:06,889
do you want to spend worrying about it
right it's gonna it's the worry the

13130
04:12:06,889 --> 04:12:06,899
right it's gonna it's the worry the
 

13131
04:12:06,899 --> 04:12:08,510
right it's gonna it's the worry the
worry doesn't accomplish anything how

13132
04:12:08,510 --> 04:12:08,520
worry doesn't accomplish anything how
 

13133
04:12:08,520 --> 04:12:09,590
worry doesn't accomplish anything how
much do physicists think about

13134
04:12:09,590 --> 04:12:09,600
much do physicists think about
 

13135
04:12:09,600 --> 04:12:11,750
much do physicists think about
possibility well they think about it in

13136
04:12:11,750 --> 04:12:11,760
possibility well they think about it in
 

13137
04:12:11,760 --> 04:12:13,610
possibility well they think about it in
terms of probability

13138
04:12:13,610 --> 04:12:13,620
terms of probability
 

13139
04:12:13,620 --> 04:12:15,469
terms of probability
more often but probability just

13140
04:12:15,469 --> 04:12:15,479
more often but probability just
 

13141
04:12:15,479 --> 04:12:17,809
more often but probability just
describes

13142
04:12:17,809 --> 04:12:17,819
describes
 

13143
04:12:17,819 --> 04:12:19,729
describes
and again this is a place where I'm I

13144
04:12:19,729 --> 04:12:19,739
and again this is a place where I'm I
 

13145
04:12:19,739 --> 04:12:21,469
and again this is a place where I'm I
might be out of my depth and need to

13146
04:12:21,469 --> 04:12:21,479
might be out of my depth and need to
 

13147
04:12:21,479 --> 04:12:24,830
might be out of my depth and need to
talk to somebody to to uh debunk this

13148
04:12:24,830 --> 04:12:24,840
talk to somebody to to uh debunk this
 

13149
04:12:24,840 --> 04:12:27,349
talk to somebody to to uh debunk this
but the um do therapy with a physicist

13150
04:12:27,349 --> 04:12:27,359
but the um do therapy with a physicist
 

13151
04:12:27,359 --> 04:12:29,750
but the um do therapy with a physicist
yeah um but probably it seems just

13152
04:12:29,750 --> 04:12:29,760
yeah um but probably it seems just
 

13153
04:12:29,760 --> 04:12:32,210
yeah um but probably it seems just
describes a pattern of actuality that

13154
04:12:32,210 --> 04:12:32,220
describes a pattern of actuality that
 

13155
04:12:32,220 --> 04:12:33,469
describes a pattern of actuality that
we've observed

13156
04:12:33,469 --> 04:12:33,479
we've observed
 

13157
04:12:33,479 --> 04:12:34,790
we've observed
right I mean we have there are certain

13158
04:12:34,790 --> 04:12:34,800
right I mean we have there are certain
 

13159
04:12:34,800 --> 04:12:36,229
right I mean we have there are certain
things we observe

13160
04:12:36,229 --> 04:12:36,239
things we observe
 

13161
04:12:36,239 --> 04:12:37,849
things we observe
and those are the actual things that

13162
04:12:37,849 --> 04:12:37,859
and those are the actual things that
 

13163
04:12:37,859 --> 04:12:38,809
and those are the actual things that
have happened

13164
04:12:38,809 --> 04:12:38,819
have happened
 

13165
04:12:38,819 --> 04:12:41,929
have happened
and we have this additional story about

13166
04:12:41,929 --> 04:12:41,939
and we have this additional story about
 

13167
04:12:41,939 --> 04:12:43,910
and we have this additional story about
probability I mean is that we have the

13168
04:12:43,910 --> 04:12:43,920
probability I mean is that we have the
 

13169
04:12:43,920 --> 04:12:45,769
probability I mean is that we have the
frequency with which things happen have

13170
04:12:45,769 --> 04:12:45,779
frequency with which things happen have
 

13171
04:12:45,779 --> 04:12:48,410
frequency with which things happen have
happened in the past

13172
04:12:48,410 --> 04:12:48,420
happened in the past
 

13173
04:12:48,420 --> 04:12:49,729
happened in the past
um

13174
04:12:49,729 --> 04:12:49,739
um
 

13175
04:12:49,739 --> 04:12:52,550
um
you know I can flip a Fair coin and know

13176
04:12:52,550 --> 04:12:52,560
you know I can flip a Fair coin and know
 

13177
04:12:52,560 --> 04:12:54,170
you know I can flip a Fair coin and know
I know in the abstract that I have a

13178
04:12:54,170 --> 04:12:54,180
I know in the abstract that I have a
 

13179
04:12:54,180 --> 04:12:56,750
I know in the abstract that I have a
belief that in the limit that those

13180
04:12:56,750 --> 04:12:56,760
belief that in the limit that those
 

13181
04:12:56,760 --> 04:12:58,910
belief that in the limit that those
flips the you know those tosses should

13182
04:12:58,910 --> 04:12:58,920
flips the you know those tosses should
 

13183
04:12:58,920 --> 04:13:02,269
flips the you know those tosses should
Converge on 50 heads and 50 Tails I know

13184
04:13:02,269 --> 04:13:02,279
Converge on 50 heads and 50 Tails I know
 

13185
04:13:02,279 --> 04:13:04,429
Converge on 50 heads and 50 Tails I know
I have a story as to why it's not going

13186
04:13:04,429 --> 04:13:04,439
I have a story as to why it's not going
 

13187
04:13:04,439 --> 04:13:07,070
I have a story as to why it's not going
to be exactly 50 within any

13188
04:13:07,070 --> 04:13:07,080
to be exactly 50 within any
 

13189
04:13:07,080 --> 04:13:09,530
to be exactly 50 within any
arbitrary time frame

13190
04:13:09,530 --> 04:13:09,540
arbitrary time frame
 

13191
04:13:09,540 --> 04:13:12,410
arbitrary time frame
um

13192
04:13:12,410 --> 04:13:12,420

 

13193
04:13:12,420 --> 04:13:15,050

but in reality all we ever have are the

13194
04:13:15,050 --> 04:13:15,060
but in reality all we ever have are the
 

13195
04:13:15,060 --> 04:13:17,330
but in reality all we ever have are the
observed tosses

13196
04:13:17,330 --> 04:13:17,340
observed tosses
 

13197
04:13:17,340 --> 04:13:18,710
observed tosses
right and then we have an additional

13198
04:13:18,710 --> 04:13:18,720
right and then we have an additional
 

13199
04:13:18,720 --> 04:13:20,689
right and then we have an additional
story that oh it came up heads but it

13200
04:13:20,689 --> 04:13:20,699
story that oh it came up heads but it
 

13201
04:13:20,699 --> 04:13:23,389
story that oh it came up heads but it
could have come up tails

13202
04:13:23,389 --> 04:13:23,399
could have come up tails
 

13203
04:13:23,399 --> 04:13:26,269
could have come up tails
why do we think that

13204
04:13:26,269 --> 04:13:26,279
why do we think that
 

13205
04:13:26,279 --> 04:13:28,849
why do we think that
about that last toss

13206
04:13:28,849 --> 04:13:28,859
about that last toss
 

13207
04:13:28,859 --> 04:13:32,870
about that last toss
and and what are we claiming is true

13208
04:13:32,870 --> 04:13:32,880
and and what are we claiming is true
 

13209
04:13:32,880 --> 04:13:35,570
and and what are we claiming is true
about the physics of things

13210
04:13:35,570 --> 04:13:35,580
about the physics of things
 

13211
04:13:35,580 --> 04:13:39,410
about the physics of things
if we say it could have been otherwise I

13212
04:13:39,410 --> 04:13:39,420
if we say it could have been otherwise I
 

13213
04:13:39,420 --> 04:13:41,269
if we say it could have been otherwise I
think we're claiming that probability is

13214
04:13:41,269 --> 04:13:41,279
think we're claiming that probability is
 

13215
04:13:41,279 --> 04:13:42,650
think we're claiming that probability is
true

13216
04:13:42,650 --> 04:13:42,660
true
 

13217
04:13:42,660 --> 04:13:45,830
true
that that just it allows us to

13218
04:13:45,830 --> 04:13:45,840
that that just it allows us to
 

13219
04:13:45,840 --> 04:13:48,170
that that just it allows us to
have a nice model about the world it

13220
04:13:48,170 --> 04:13:48,180
have a nice model about the world it
 

13221
04:13:48,180 --> 04:13:50,450
have a nice model about the world it
gives us hope about the world yeah it

13222
04:13:50,450 --> 04:13:50,460
gives us hope about the world yeah it
 

13223
04:13:50,460 --> 04:13:52,969
gives us hope about the world yeah it
seems that possibility has to be

13224
04:13:52,969 --> 04:13:52,979
seems that possibility has to be
 

13225
04:13:52,979 --> 04:13:55,250
seems that possibility has to be
somewhere to be effective it's a little

13226
04:13:55,250 --> 04:13:55,260
somewhere to be effective it's a little
 

13227
04:13:55,260 --> 04:13:56,389
somewhere to be effective it's a little
it's a little bit like what's what's

13228
04:13:56,389 --> 04:13:56,399
it's a little bit like what's what's
 

13229
04:13:56,399 --> 04:13:58,490
it's a little bit like what's what's
happening with the laws there's

13230
04:13:58,490 --> 04:13:58,500
happening with the laws there's
 

13231
04:13:58,500 --> 04:13:59,990
happening with the laws there's
something metaphysically interesting

13232
04:13:59,990 --> 04:14:00,000
something metaphysically interesting
 

13233
04:14:00,000 --> 04:14:02,269
something metaphysically interesting
about the laws of nature too because the

13234
04:14:02,269 --> 04:14:02,279
about the laws of nature too because the
 

13235
04:14:02,279 --> 04:14:03,710
about the laws of nature too because the
laws of nature so the laws of nature

13236
04:14:03,710 --> 04:14:03,720
laws of nature so the laws of nature
 

13237
04:14:03,720 --> 04:14:05,870
laws of nature so the laws of nature
impose their their work on the world

13238
04:14:05,870 --> 04:14:05,880
impose their their work on the world
 

13239
04:14:05,880 --> 04:14:08,570
impose their their work on the world
right we see their evidence

13240
04:14:08,570 --> 04:14:08,580
right we see their evidence
 

13241
04:14:08,580 --> 04:14:11,570
right we see their evidence
but they're not reducible to any

13242
04:14:11,570 --> 04:14:11,580
but they're not reducible to any
 

13243
04:14:11,580 --> 04:14:14,330
but they're not reducible to any
specific set of instances right so

13244
04:14:14,330 --> 04:14:14,340
specific set of instances right so
 

13245
04:14:14,340 --> 04:14:16,070
specific set of instances right so
there's some structure there

13246
04:14:16,070 --> 04:14:16,080
there's some structure there
 

13247
04:14:16,080 --> 04:14:18,469
there's some structure there
but the structure isn't

13248
04:14:18,469 --> 04:14:18,479
but the structure isn't
 

13249
04:14:18,479 --> 04:14:21,410
but the structure isn't
just a matter of the actual things with

13250
04:14:21,410 --> 04:14:21,420
just a matter of the actual things with
 

13251
04:14:21,420 --> 04:14:23,030
just a matter of the actual things with
the actual billiard balls that are

13252
04:14:23,030 --> 04:14:23,040
the actual billiard balls that are
 

13253
04:14:23,040 --> 04:14:24,650
the actual billiard balls that are
banging into each other

13254
04:14:24,650 --> 04:14:24,660
banging into each other
 

13255
04:14:24,660 --> 04:14:26,570
banging into each other
all of that actuality can be explained

13256
04:14:26,570 --> 04:14:26,580
all of that actuality can be explained
 

13257
04:14:26,580 --> 04:14:29,150
all of that actuality can be explained
by what actual things are actually doing

13258
04:14:29,150 --> 04:14:29,160
by what actual things are actually doing
 

13259
04:14:29,160 --> 04:14:30,830
by what actual things are actually doing
but then we have this notion that in

13260
04:14:30,830 --> 04:14:30,840
but then we have this notion that in
 

13261
04:14:30,840 --> 04:14:33,050
but then we have this notion that in
addition to that we have the laws of

13262
04:14:33,050 --> 04:14:33,060
addition to that we have the laws of
 

13263
04:14:33,060 --> 04:14:34,250
addition to that we have the laws of
nature that are making they're

13264
04:14:34,250 --> 04:14:34,260
nature that are making they're
 

13265
04:14:34,260 --> 04:14:36,710
nature that are making they're
explaining this act but but how are the

13266
04:14:36,710 --> 04:14:36,720
explaining this act but but how are the
 

13267
04:14:36,720 --> 04:14:38,929
explaining this act but but how are the
laws of nature an additional thing

13268
04:14:38,929 --> 04:14:38,939
laws of nature an additional thing
 

13269
04:14:38,939 --> 04:14:40,490
laws of nature an additional thing
in addition to just the actual things

13270
04:14:40,490 --> 04:14:40,500
in addition to just the actual things
 

13271
04:14:40,500 --> 04:14:42,590
in addition to just the actual things
that are actually effect costly and if

13272
04:14:42,590 --> 04:14:42,600
that are actually effect costly and if
 

13273
04:14:42,600 --> 04:14:44,269
that are actually effect costly and if
they're if they are an additional thing

13274
04:14:44,269 --> 04:14:44,279
they're if they are an additional thing
 

13275
04:14:44,279 --> 04:14:48,110
they're if they are an additional thing
in how are they effective if not they're

13276
04:14:48,110 --> 04:14:48,120
in how are they effective if not they're
 

13277
04:14:48,120 --> 04:14:49,550
in how are they effective if not they're
not among the actual things that are

13278
04:14:49,550 --> 04:14:49,560
not among the actual things that are
 

13279
04:14:49,560 --> 04:14:52,130
not among the actual things that are
just actually banging around yeah and so

13280
04:14:52,130 --> 04:14:52,140
just actually banging around yeah and so
 

13281
04:14:52,140 --> 04:14:54,170
just actually banging around yeah and so
to some degree for that possible

13282
04:14:54,170 --> 04:14:54,180
to some degree for that possible
 

13283
04:14:54,180 --> 04:14:56,330
to some degree for that possible
possibly has to be hiding somewhere for

13284
04:14:56,330 --> 04:14:56,340
possibly has to be hiding somewhere for
 

13285
04:14:56,340 --> 04:14:58,750
possibly has to be hiding somewhere for
the laws of nature to be possible

13286
04:14:58,750 --> 04:14:58,760
the laws of nature to be possible
 

13287
04:14:58,760 --> 04:15:01,250
the laws of nature to be possible
for anything to be possible it has to be

13288
04:15:01,250 --> 04:15:01,260
for anything to be possible it has to be
 

13289
04:15:01,260 --> 04:15:03,050
for anything to be possible it has to be
it has to have closets somewhere I'm

13290
04:15:03,050 --> 04:15:03,060
it has to have closets somewhere I'm
 

13291
04:15:03,060 --> 04:15:04,969
it has to have closets somewhere I'm
sure it's just where all the possibility

13292
04:15:04,969 --> 04:15:04,979
sure it's just where all the possibility
 

13293
04:15:04,979 --> 04:15:07,550
sure it's just where all the possibility
goes it has to be attached to something

13294
04:15:07,550 --> 04:15:07,560
goes it has to be attached to something
 

13295
04:15:07,560 --> 04:15:10,910
goes it has to be attached to something
so you don't think many worlds is that

13296
04:15:10,910 --> 04:15:10,920
so you don't think many worlds is that
 

13297
04:15:10,920 --> 04:15:13,550
so you don't think many worlds is that
yeah because maybe once it still exists

13298
04:15:13,550 --> 04:15:13,560
yeah because maybe once it still exists
 

13299
04:15:13,560 --> 04:15:15,950
yeah because maybe once it still exists
well because we're in this strand of

13300
04:15:15,950 --> 04:15:15,960
well because we're in this strand of
 

13301
04:15:15,960 --> 04:15:18,889
well because we're in this strand of
that Multiverse yeah right so it's still

13302
04:15:18,889 --> 04:15:18,899
that Multiverse yeah right so it's still
 

13303
04:15:18,899 --> 04:15:21,110
that Multiverse yeah right so it's still
still you have just a local instance of

13304
04:15:21,110 --> 04:15:21,120
still you have just a local instance of
 

13305
04:15:21,120 --> 04:15:23,030
still you have just a local instance of
what is actual yeah and then if it

13306
04:15:23,030 --> 04:15:23,040
what is actual yeah and then if it
 

13307
04:15:23,040 --> 04:15:24,590
what is actual yeah and then if it
proliferates elsewhere where you can't

13308
04:15:24,590 --> 04:15:24,600
proliferates elsewhere where you can't
 

13309
04:15:24,600 --> 04:15:27,290
proliferates elsewhere where you can't
be affected by it many worlds as well

13310
04:15:27,290 --> 04:15:27,300
be affected by it many worlds as well
 

13311
04:15:27,300 --> 04:15:29,150
be affected by it many worlds as well
you can't really connect with the other

13312
04:15:29,150 --> 04:15:29,160
you can't really connect with the other
 

13313
04:15:29,160 --> 04:15:32,090
you can't really connect with the other
yeah yeah and so many worlds is just a

13314
04:15:32,090 --> 04:15:32,100
yeah yeah and so many worlds is just a
 

13315
04:15:32,100 --> 04:15:34,130
yeah yeah and so many worlds is just a
statement of

13316
04:15:34,130 --> 04:15:34,140
statement of
 

13317
04:15:34,140 --> 04:15:36,170
statement of
basically everything that can happen

13318
04:15:36,170 --> 04:15:36,180
basically everything that can happen
 

13319
04:15:36,180 --> 04:15:38,330
basically everything that can happen
happens somewhere

13320
04:15:38,330 --> 04:15:38,340
happens somewhere
 

13321
04:15:38,340 --> 04:15:40,670
happens somewhere
right that's yeah you know and that's I

13322
04:15:40,670 --> 04:15:40,680
right that's yeah you know and that's I
 

13323
04:15:40,680 --> 04:15:43,130
right that's yeah you know and that's I
mean maybe that's not an entirely kosher

13324
04:15:43,130 --> 04:15:43,140
mean maybe that's not an entirely kosher
 

13325
04:15:43,140 --> 04:15:44,929
mean maybe that's not an entirely kosher
formulation of it but it it seems pretty

13326
04:15:44,929 --> 04:15:44,939
formulation of it but it it seems pretty
 

13327
04:15:44,939 --> 04:15:49,010
formulation of it but it it seems pretty
close so so but there's whatever happens

13328
04:15:49,010 --> 04:15:49,020
close so so but there's whatever happens
 

13329
04:15:49,020 --> 04:15:50,450
close so so but there's whatever happens
right in fact there's you know

13330
04:15:50,450 --> 04:15:50,460
right in fact there's you know
 

13331
04:15:50,460 --> 04:15:52,849
right in fact there's you know
relativistically there's a

13332
04:15:52,849 --> 04:15:52,859
relativistically there's a
 

13333
04:15:52,859 --> 04:15:55,130
relativistically there's a
there's a you know the the Einstein's

13334
04:15:55,130 --> 04:15:55,140
there's a you know the the Einstein's
 

13335
04:15:55,140 --> 04:15:57,830
there's a you know the the Einstein's
original notion of a block universe

13336
04:15:57,830 --> 04:15:57,840
original notion of a block universe
 

13337
04:15:57,840 --> 04:15:59,689
original notion of a block universe
seems to suggest this and I it's been a

13338
04:15:59,689 --> 04:15:59,699
seems to suggest this and I it's been a
 

13339
04:15:59,699 --> 04:16:01,010
seems to suggest this and I it's been a
while since I've been in a conversation

13340
04:16:01,010 --> 04:16:01,020
while since I've been in a conversation
 

13341
04:16:01,020 --> 04:16:02,269
while since I've been in a conversation
with a physicist where I've gotten a

13342
04:16:02,269 --> 04:16:02,279
with a physicist where I've gotten a
 

13343
04:16:02,279 --> 04:16:03,830
with a physicist where I've gotten a
chance to ask about the standing of this

13344
04:16:03,830 --> 04:16:03,840
chance to ask about the standing of this
 

13345
04:16:03,840 --> 04:16:05,269
chance to ask about the standing of this
concept in physics currently I don't

13346
04:16:05,269 --> 04:16:05,279
concept in physics currently I don't
 

13347
04:16:05,279 --> 04:16:07,610
concept in physics currently I don't
hear it discuss much but the idea of a

13348
04:16:07,610 --> 04:16:07,620
hear it discuss much but the idea of a
 

13349
04:16:07,620 --> 04:16:09,769
hear it discuss much but the idea of a
block universe is that you know the

13350
04:16:09,769 --> 04:16:09,779
block universe is that you know the
 

13351
04:16:09,779 --> 04:16:11,090
block universe is that you know the
space-time

13352
04:16:11,090 --> 04:16:11,100
space-time
 

13353
04:16:11,100 --> 04:16:14,990
space-time
exists as a totality in our sense that

13354
04:16:14,990 --> 04:16:15,000
exists as a totality in our sense that
 

13355
04:16:15,000 --> 04:16:16,610
exists as a totality in our sense that
we are traveling

13356
04:16:16,610 --> 04:16:16,620
we are traveling
 

13357
04:16:16,620 --> 04:16:18,710
we are traveling
through space-time

13358
04:16:18,710 --> 04:16:18,720
through space-time
 

13359
04:16:18,720 --> 04:16:20,689
through space-time
where there's a real difference between

13360
04:16:20,689 --> 04:16:20,699
where there's a real difference between
 

13361
04:16:20,699 --> 04:16:22,250
where there's a real difference between
the past and the future

13362
04:16:22,250 --> 04:16:22,260
the past and the future
 

13363
04:16:22,260 --> 04:16:24,710
the past and the future
that that's an illusion of just our you

13364
04:16:24,710 --> 04:16:24,720
that that's an illusion of just our you
 

13365
04:16:24,720 --> 04:16:26,330
that that's an illusion of just our you
know

13366
04:16:26,330 --> 04:16:26,340
know
 

13367
04:16:26,340 --> 04:16:28,490
know
you know weird the weird the weird slice

13368
04:16:28,490 --> 04:16:28,500
you know weird the weird the weird slice
 

13369
04:16:28,500 --> 04:16:30,590
you know weird the weird the weird slice
we're taking of of this larger object

13370
04:16:30,590 --> 04:16:30,600
we're taking of of this larger object
 

13371
04:16:30,600 --> 04:16:33,650
we're taking of of this larger object
but on some level

13372
04:16:33,650 --> 04:16:33,660
but on some level
 

13373
04:16:33,660 --> 04:16:35,030
but on some level
it's like you know you're reading a

13374
04:16:35,030 --> 04:16:35,040
it's like you know you're reading a
 

13375
04:16:35,040 --> 04:16:37,250
it's like you know you're reading a
novel The last page of the novel exists

13376
04:16:37,250 --> 04:16:37,260
novel The last page of the novel exists
 

13377
04:16:37,260 --> 04:16:40,070
novel The last page of the novel exists
just as much as the first page when

13378
04:16:40,070 --> 04:16:40,080
just as much as the first page when
 

13379
04:16:40,080 --> 04:16:41,330
just as much as the first page when
you're in the middle of it and they're

13380
04:16:41,330 --> 04:16:41,340
you're in the middle of it and they're
 

13381
04:16:41,340 --> 04:16:42,110
you're in the middle of it and they're
just

13382
04:16:42,110 --> 04:16:42,120
just
 

13383
04:16:42,120 --> 04:16:43,550
just
you know if that's if we're living in

13384
04:16:43,550 --> 04:16:43,560
you know if that's if we're living in
 

13385
04:16:43,560 --> 04:16:45,290
you know if that's if we're living in
anything like that then there's no such

13386
04:16:45,290 --> 04:16:45,300
anything like that then there's no such
 

13387
04:16:45,300 --> 04:16:47,030
anything like that then there's no such
thing as

13388
04:16:47,030 --> 04:16:47,040
thing as
 

13389
04:16:47,040 --> 04:16:49,910
thing as
possibility I I would it would seem this

13390
04:16:49,910 --> 04:16:49,920
possibility I I would it would seem this
 

13391
04:16:49,920 --> 04:16:50,809
possibility I I would it would seem this
just

13392
04:16:50,809 --> 04:16:50,819
just
 

13393
04:16:50,819 --> 04:16:53,809
just
what is actual so

13394
04:16:53,809 --> 04:16:53,819
what is actual so
 

13395
04:16:53,819 --> 04:16:56,090
what is actual so
as a matter of our experience moment to

13396
04:16:56,090 --> 04:16:56,100
as a matter of our experience moment to
 

13397
04:16:56,100 --> 04:16:57,410
as a matter of our experience moment to
moment

13398
04:16:57,410 --> 04:16:57,420
moment
 

13399
04:16:57,420 --> 04:16:59,630
moment
I think it's totally compatible with

13400
04:16:59,630 --> 04:16:59,640
I think it's totally compatible with
 

13401
04:16:59,640 --> 04:17:02,389
I think it's totally compatible with
that being true that there is only what

13402
04:17:02,389 --> 04:17:02,399
that being true that there is only what
 

13403
04:17:02,399 --> 04:17:04,790
that being true that there is only what
is actual and

13404
04:17:04,790 --> 04:17:04,800
is actual and
 

13405
04:17:04,800 --> 04:17:08,269
is actual and
that sounds to the the naive ear that

13406
04:17:08,269 --> 04:17:08,279
that sounds to the the naive ear that
 

13407
04:17:08,279 --> 04:17:09,710
that sounds to the the naive ear that
sounds like it would be depressing and

13408
04:17:09,710 --> 04:17:09,720
sounds like it would be depressing and
 

13409
04:17:09,720 --> 04:17:11,870
sounds like it would be depressing and
disempowering and confining

13410
04:17:11,870 --> 04:17:11,880
disempowering and confining
 

13411
04:17:11,880 --> 04:17:15,590
disempowering and confining
but as anything but it's actually it's a

13412
04:17:15,590 --> 04:17:15,600
but as anything but it's actually it's a
 

13413
04:17:15,600 --> 04:17:17,809
but as anything but it's actually it's a
circumstance of pure Discovery like you

13414
04:17:17,809 --> 04:17:17,819
circumstance of pure Discovery like you
 

13415
04:17:17,819 --> 04:17:20,630
circumstance of pure Discovery like you
have no idea what's going to happen next

13416
04:17:20,630 --> 04:17:20,640
have no idea what's going to happen next
 

13417
04:17:20,640 --> 04:17:22,849
have no idea what's going to happen next
right you don't know who you're going to

13418
04:17:22,849 --> 04:17:22,859
right you don't know who you're going to
 

13419
04:17:22,859 --> 04:17:25,030
right you don't know who you're going to
be tomorrow you're only by tendency

13420
04:17:25,030 --> 04:17:25,040
be tomorrow you're only by tendency
 

13421

seeming to resemble yourself from

seeming to resemble yourself from
 

13423
04:17:27,720 --> 04:17:29,269
seeming to resemble yourself from
yesterday and there's there's way more

13424
04:17:29,269 --> 04:17:29,279
yesterday and there's there's way more
 

13425
04:17:29,279 --> 04:17:32,630

freedom in all of that than than it

freedom in all of that than than it

the basic Insight is that you're not

you're not in the the real freedom is is

you're not in the the real freedom is is
the recognition that you're not in

about this world in the coming
here in the coming decade in the coming

here in the coming decade in the coming

here in the coming decade in the coming
hundred years maybe a thousand years

13596
04:20:45,889 --> 04:20:45,899
hundred years maybe a thousand years
 

13597
04:20:45,899 --> 04:20:50,450
hundred years maybe a thousand years
what's the source of Hope for you

13598
04:20:50,450 --> 04:20:50,460

 

13599
04:20:50,460 --> 04:20:52,250

well it comes back to a few of the

13600
04:20:52,250 --> 04:20:52,260
well it comes back to a few of the
 

13601
04:20:52,260 --> 04:20:55,790
well it comes back to a few of the
things we've talked about I think I'm

13602
04:20:55,790 --> 04:20:55,800
things we've talked about I think I'm
 

13603
04:20:55,800 --> 04:20:58,729
things we've talked about I think I'm
I'm hopeful I I know that most people

13604
04:20:58,729 --> 04:20:58,739
I'm hopeful I I know that most people
 

13605
04:20:58,739 --> 04:21:01,969
I'm hopeful I I know that most people
are good and are mostly

13606
04:21:01,969 --> 04:21:01,979
are good and are mostly
 

13607
04:21:01,979 --> 04:21:05,450
are good and are mostly
converging on the same core values right

13608
04:21:05,450 --> 04:21:05,460
converging on the same core values right
 

13609
04:21:05,460 --> 04:21:08,290
converging on the same core values right
it's like we're not surrounded by

13610
04:21:08,290 --> 04:21:08,300
it's like we're not surrounded by
 

13611
04:21:08,300 --> 04:21:10,969
it's like we're not surrounded by
Psychopaths and

13612
04:21:10,969 --> 04:21:10,979
Psychopaths and
 

13613
04:21:10,979 --> 04:21:13,370
Psychopaths and
I um the thing that

13614
04:21:13,370 --> 04:21:13,380
I um the thing that
 

13615
04:21:13,380 --> 04:21:15,229
I um the thing that
finally convinced me to to get off

13616
04:21:15,229 --> 04:21:15,239
finally convinced me to to get off
 

13617
04:21:15,239 --> 04:21:17,809
finally convinced me to to get off
Twitter was how different life was

13618
04:21:17,809 --> 04:21:17,819
Twitter was how different life was
 

13619
04:21:17,819 --> 04:21:19,910
Twitter was how different life was
seeming through the lens of Twitter it's

13620
04:21:19,910 --> 04:21:19,920
seeming through the lens of Twitter it's
 

13621
04:21:19,920 --> 04:21:21,349
seeming through the lens of Twitter it's
like I just got the sense that there's

13622
04:21:21,349 --> 04:21:21,359
like I just got the sense that there's
 

13623
04:21:21,359 --> 04:21:23,570
like I just got the sense that there's
way more Psychopaths or effective

13624
04:21:23,570 --> 04:21:23,580
way more Psychopaths or effective
 

13625
04:21:23,580 --> 04:21:26,510
way more Psychopaths or effective
Psychopaths than I realized and then I

13626
04:21:26,510 --> 04:21:26,520
Psychopaths than I realized and then I
 

13627
04:21:26,520 --> 04:21:29,030
Psychopaths than I realized and then I
thought okay that's this isn't real this

13628
04:21:29,030 --> 04:21:29,040
thought okay that's this isn't real this
 

13629
04:21:29,040 --> 04:21:31,250
thought okay that's this isn't real this
is this is either a strange context in

13630
04:21:31,250 --> 04:21:31,260
is this is either a strange context in
 

13631
04:21:31,260 --> 04:21:33,170
is this is either a strange context in
which actually decent people are

13632
04:21:33,170 --> 04:21:33,180
which actually decent people are
 

13633
04:21:33,180 --> 04:21:37,130
which actually decent people are
behaving like Psychopaths or it's um you

13634
04:21:37,130 --> 04:21:37,140
behaving like Psychopaths or it's um you
 

13635
04:21:37,140 --> 04:21:39,650
behaving like Psychopaths or it's um you
know it's a bot army or something that I

13636
04:21:39,650 --> 04:21:39,660
know it's a bot army or something that I
 

13637
04:21:39,660 --> 04:21:41,689
know it's a bot army or something that I
don't have to take seriously so

13638
04:21:41,689 --> 04:21:41,699
don't have to take seriously so
 

13639
04:21:41,699 --> 04:21:45,290
don't have to take seriously so
yeah I just think most people

13640
04:21:45,290 --> 04:21:45,300
yeah I just think most people
 

13641
04:21:45,300 --> 04:21:47,150
yeah I just think most people
if we can get the if we can get the

13642
04:21:47,150 --> 04:21:47,160
if we can get the if we can get the
 

13643
04:21:47,160 --> 04:21:49,370
if we can get the if we can get the
incentives right

13644
04:21:49,370 --> 04:21:49,380
incentives right
 

13645
04:21:49,380 --> 04:21:53,570
incentives right
I think there's no reason why we can't

13646
04:21:53,570 --> 04:21:53,580
I think there's no reason why we can't
 

13647
04:21:53,580 --> 04:21:56,269
I think there's no reason why we can't
really Thrive collectively like so

13648
04:21:56,269 --> 04:21:56,279
really Thrive collectively like so
 

13649
04:21:56,279 --> 04:21:58,130
really Thrive collectively like so
there's enough wealth to go around

13650
04:21:58,130 --> 04:21:58,140
there's enough wealth to go around
 

13651
04:21:58,140 --> 04:21:59,389
there's enough wealth to go around
there's enough

13652
04:21:59,389 --> 04:21:59,399
there's enough
 

13653
04:21:59,399 --> 04:22:01,910
there's enough
you know there's no

13654
04:22:01,910 --> 04:22:01,920
you know there's no
 

13655
04:22:01,920 --> 04:22:03,889
you know there's no
there's no effective limit you know I

13656
04:22:03,889 --> 04:22:03,899
there's no effective limit you know I
 

13657
04:22:03,899 --> 04:22:05,809
there's no effective limit you know I
mean again within the limits of what's

13658
04:22:05,809 --> 04:22:05,819
mean again within the limits of what's
 

13659
04:22:05,819 --> 04:22:07,790
mean again within the limits of what's
physically possible but we're nowhere

13660
04:22:07,790 --> 04:22:07,800
physically possible but we're nowhere
 

13661
04:22:07,800 --> 04:22:09,469
physically possible but we're nowhere
near the limit

13662
04:22:09,469 --> 04:22:09,479
near the limit
 

13663
04:22:09,479 --> 04:22:11,269
near the limit
on abundance

13664
04:22:11,269 --> 04:22:11,279
on abundance
 

13665
04:22:11,279 --> 04:22:13,010
on abundance
you know on this I forget about going to

13666
04:22:13,010 --> 04:22:13,020
you know on this I forget about going to
 

13667
04:22:13,020 --> 04:22:16,250
you know on this I forget about going to
Mars on this the one Rock right it's

13668
04:22:16,250 --> 04:22:16,260
Mars on this the one Rock right it's
 

13669
04:22:16,260 --> 04:22:19,210
Mars on this the one Rock right it's
like we we could make this place

13670
04:22:19,210 --> 04:22:19,220
like we we could make this place
 

13671
04:22:19,220 --> 04:22:24,050
like we we could make this place
incredibly beautiful uh and stable if we

13672
04:22:24,050 --> 04:22:24,060
incredibly beautiful uh and stable if we
 

13673
04:22:24,060 --> 04:22:25,429
incredibly beautiful uh and stable if we
just

13674
04:22:25,429 --> 04:22:25,439
just
 

13675
04:22:25,439 --> 04:22:30,889
just
did enough work to

13676
04:22:30,889 --> 04:22:30,899

 

13677
04:22:30,899 --> 04:22:33,950

solve some you know you know rather uh

13678
04:22:33,950 --> 04:22:33,960
solve some you know you know rather uh
 

13679
04:22:33,960 --> 04:22:37,010
solve some you know you know rather uh
long-standing political problems in the

13680
04:22:37,010 --> 04:22:37,020
long-standing political problems in the
 

13681
04:22:37,020 --> 04:22:39,170
long-standing political problems in the
problem of incentives so that to you the

13682
04:22:39,170 --> 04:22:39,180
problem of incentives so that to you the
 

13683
04:22:39,180 --> 04:22:41,030
problem of incentives so that to you the
the basic characteristics of human

13684
04:22:41,030 --> 04:22:41,040
the basic characteristics of human
 

13685
04:22:41,040 --> 04:22:43,969
the basic characteristics of human
nature such that we'll be okay if the

13686
04:22:43,969 --> 04:22:43,979
nature such that we'll be okay if the
 

13687
04:22:43,979 --> 04:22:45,650
nature such that we'll be okay if the
incentives are okay

13688
04:22:45,650 --> 04:22:45,660
incentives are okay
 

13689
04:22:45,660 --> 04:22:48,290
incentives are okay
we'll do it we'll do pretty good

13690
04:22:48,290 --> 04:22:48,300
we'll do it we'll do pretty good
 

13691
04:22:48,300 --> 04:22:50,450
we'll do it we'll do pretty good
I'm worried about the asymmetry is that

13692
04:22:50,450 --> 04:22:50,460
I'm worried about the asymmetry is that
 

13693
04:22:50,460 --> 04:22:51,889
I'm worried about the asymmetry is that
it's easier to break things than to fix

13694
04:22:51,889 --> 04:22:51,899
it's easier to break things than to fix
 

13695
04:22:51,899 --> 04:22:53,330
it's easier to break things than to fix
them it's easier to

13696
04:22:53,330 --> 04:22:53,340
them it's easier to
 

13697
04:22:53,340 --> 04:22:55,189
them it's easier to
to um

13698
04:22:55,189 --> 04:22:55,199
to um
 

13699
04:22:55,199 --> 04:22:58,130
to um
light a fire than to put it out and

13700
04:22:58,130 --> 04:22:58,140
light a fire than to put it out and
 

13701
04:22:58,140 --> 04:22:59,990
light a fire than to put it out and
uh

13702
04:22:59,990 --> 04:23:00,000
uh
 

13703
04:23:00,000 --> 04:23:02,090
uh
I do worry that you know as technology

13704
04:23:02,090 --> 04:23:02,100
I do worry that you know as technology
 

13705
04:23:02,100 --> 04:23:04,130
I do worry that you know as technology
gets more and more powerful it becomes

13706
04:23:04,130 --> 04:23:04,140
gets more and more powerful it becomes
 

13707
04:23:04,140 --> 04:23:07,309
gets more and more powerful it becomes
easier for the minority who wants to

13708
04:23:07,309 --> 04:23:07,319
easier for the minority who wants to
 

13709
04:23:07,319 --> 04:23:09,830
easier for the minority who wants to
screw things up to effectively screw

13710
04:23:09,830 --> 04:23:09,840
screw things up to effectively screw
 

13711
04:23:09,840 --> 04:23:11,389
screw things up to effectively screw
things up for everybody right so it's

13712
04:23:11,389 --> 04:23:11,399
things up for everybody right so it's
 

13713
04:23:11,399 --> 04:23:13,130
things up for everybody right so it's
easier it's like it

13714
04:23:13,130 --> 04:23:13,140
easier it's like it
 

13715
04:23:13,140 --> 04:23:14,870
easier it's like it
a thousand years ago it was simply

13716
04:23:14,870 --> 04:23:14,880
a thousand years ago it was simply
 

13717
04:23:14,880 --> 04:23:18,170
a thousand years ago it was simply
impossible for one person to

13718
04:23:18,170 --> 04:23:18,180
impossible for one person to
 

13719
04:23:18,180 --> 04:23:21,889
impossible for one person to
derange the lives of millions much less

13720
04:23:21,889 --> 04:23:21,899
derange the lives of millions much less
 

13721
04:23:21,899 --> 04:23:23,210
derange the lives of millions much less
billions

13722
04:23:23,210 --> 04:23:23,220
billions
 

13723
04:23:23,220 --> 04:23:26,030
billions
now that's getting to be possible

13724
04:23:26,030 --> 04:23:26,040
now that's getting to be possible
 

13725
04:23:26,040 --> 04:23:27,710
now that's getting to be possible
so on the assumption that we're always

13726
04:23:27,710 --> 04:23:27,720
so on the assumption that we're always
 

13727
04:23:27,720 --> 04:23:29,870
so on the assumption that we're always
going to have a sufficient number of

13728
04:23:29,870 --> 04:23:29,880
going to have a sufficient number of
 

13729
04:23:29,880 --> 04:23:35,570
going to have a sufficient number of
crazy individuals or or

13730
04:23:35,570 --> 04:23:35,580

 

13731
04:23:35,580 --> 04:23:39,290

malevolent individuals it's it's uh

13732
04:23:39,290 --> 04:23:39,300
malevolent individuals it's it's uh
 

13733
04:23:39,300 --> 04:23:40,910
malevolent individuals it's it's uh
that is we have to figure out that

13734
04:23:40,910 --> 04:23:40,920
that is we have to figure out that
 

13735
04:23:40,920 --> 04:23:43,210
that is we have to figure out that
asymmetry somehow and so there's some

13736
04:23:43,210 --> 04:23:43,220
asymmetry somehow and so there's some
 

13737
04:23:43,220 --> 04:23:46,670
asymmetry somehow and so there's some
cautious exploration of emergent

13738
04:23:46,670 --> 04:23:46,680
cautious exploration of emergent
 

13739
04:23:46,680 --> 04:23:49,729
cautious exploration of emergent
technology that we need to get

13740
04:23:49,729 --> 04:23:49,739
technology that we need to get
 

13741
04:23:49,739 --> 04:23:52,189
technology that we need to get
our our head screw on straight about so

13742
04:23:52,189 --> 04:23:52,199
our our head screw on straight about so
 

13743
04:23:52,199 --> 04:23:54,110
our our head screw on straight about so
like so gain a function research like

13744
04:23:54,110 --> 04:23:54,120
like so gain a function research like
 

13745
04:23:54,120 --> 04:23:56,830
like so gain a function research like

free to decide what they want to promote
 

13831
04:25:22,319 --> 04:25:23,750
free to decide what they want to promote
or not their public I view them as

13832
04:25:23,750 --> 04:25:23,760
or not their public I view them as
 

13833
04:25:23,760 --> 04:25:26,530
or not their public I view them as
Publishers more you know more than as as

13834
04:25:26,530 --> 04:25:26,540
Publishers more you know more than as as
 

13835
04:25:26,540 --> 04:25:29,630
Publishers more you know more than as as
Platforms in the end and

13836
04:25:29,630 --> 04:25:29,640
Platforms in the end and
 

13837
04:25:29,640 --> 04:25:31,429
Platforms in the end and
um that has other implications

13838
04:25:31,429 --> 04:25:31,439
um that has other implications
 

13839
04:25:31,439 --> 04:25:32,510
um that has other implications
but

13840
04:25:32,510 --> 04:25:32,520
but
 

13841
04:25:32,520 --> 04:25:34,070
but
I do worry about this problem of

13842
04:25:34,070 --> 04:25:34,080
I do worry about this problem of
 

13843
04:25:34,080 --> 04:25:36,790
I do worry about this problem of
misinformation and

13844
04:25:36,790 --> 04:25:36,800
misinformation and
 

13845
04:25:36,800 --> 04:25:38,990
misinformation and
algorithmically and otherwise you know

13846
04:25:38,990 --> 04:25:39,000
algorithmically and otherwise you know
 

13847
04:25:39,000 --> 04:25:41,210
algorithmically and otherwise you know
supercharged misinformation

13848
04:25:41,210 --> 04:25:41,220
supercharged misinformation
 

13849
04:25:41,220 --> 04:25:44,030
supercharged misinformation
and

13850
04:25:44,030 --> 04:25:44,040

 

13851
04:25:44,040 --> 04:25:45,889

I think

13852
04:25:45,889 --> 04:25:45,899
I think
 

13853
04:25:45,899 --> 04:25:47,929
I think
I do think we have we're at a bottleneck

13854
04:25:47,929 --> 04:25:47,939
I do think we have we're at a bottleneck
 

13855
04:25:47,939 --> 04:25:50,090
I do think we have we're at a bottleneck
now I mean I guess it could be the

13856
04:25:50,090 --> 04:25:50,100
now I mean I guess it could be the
 

13857
04:25:50,100 --> 04:25:51,830
now I mean I guess it could be the
hubris of every present generation to

13858
04:25:51,830 --> 04:25:51,840
hubris of every present generation to
 

13859
04:25:51,840 --> 04:25:54,710
hubris of every present generation to
think that their moment is especially

13860
04:25:54,710 --> 04:25:54,720
think that their moment is especially
 

13861
04:25:54,720 --> 04:25:57,590
think that their moment is especially
important but I do think with the

13862
04:25:57,590 --> 04:25:57,600
important but I do think with the
 

13863
04:25:57,600 --> 04:25:59,809
important but I do think with the
emergence of these Technologies

13864
04:25:59,809 --> 04:25:59,819
emergence of these Technologies
 

13865
04:25:59,819 --> 04:26:01,610
emergence of these Technologies
or some kind of bottleneck where we

13866
04:26:01,610 --> 04:26:01,620
or some kind of bottleneck where we
 

13867
04:26:01,620 --> 04:26:03,469
or some kind of bottleneck where we
really have to figure out how to get

13868
04:26:03,469 --> 04:26:03,479
really have to figure out how to get
 

13869
04:26:03,479 --> 04:26:05,570
really have to figure out how to get
this right and if we do get this right

13870
04:26:05,570 --> 04:26:05,580
this right and if we do get this right
 

13871
04:26:05,580 --> 04:26:07,309
this right and if we do get this right
if we figure out how to not drive

13872
04:26:07,309 --> 04:26:07,319
if we figure out how to not drive
 

13873
04:26:07,319 --> 04:26:09,889
if we figure out how to not drive
ourselves Crazy by giving people access

13874
04:26:09,889 --> 04:26:09,899
ourselves Crazy by giving people access
 

13875
04:26:09,899 --> 04:26:12,410

I think yeah we could there's no limit

13880
04:26:18,229 --> 04:26:18,239
I think yeah we could there's no limit
 

13881
04:26:18,239 --> 04:26:19,490
I think yeah we could there's no limit
to how

13882
04:26:19,490 --> 04:26:19,500
to how
 

13883
04:26:19,500 --> 04:26:21,670
to how
happily we could collaborate with
