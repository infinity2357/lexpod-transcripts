00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:52,920
that was one of the demands in one of
 

95
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,770

the cases in that time frame
 

97
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,510
the cases in that time frame
now first of all even if we'd have been

98
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:56,520
now first of all even if we'd have been
 

99
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,950
now first of all even if we'd have been
willing the US government Coalition

00:02:01,969 --> 00:02:01,979
wouldn't be able to happen in 72 hours

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,510
so is it an impossible ask from the
beginning

110
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:07,500

123
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,729
that you just even if you wanted to do

705
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,870

point of view
every single one of them that testified

712
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:17,639
every single one of them that testified
 

713
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:19,610

714
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:19,620
that's empathy not agreeing with where
 

715
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,230
that's empathy not agreeing with where
the other side is coming from

716
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,240
the other side is coming from

but common vernacular is its sympathy
and its compassion and that's when it

722
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:28,440
and its compassion and that's when it
 

723
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,690
and its compassion and that's when it
becomes useless

724
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:29,700
becomes useless
 

725
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,569
becomes useless
and there is a gray area maybe you can

compassion
 

731
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:39,470
compassion
helps make that empathy more effective

732
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:39,480
helps make that empathy more effective
 

733
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,150
helps make that empathy more effective

entire chapter is that empathy puts you

1126
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:13,620
entire chapter is that empathy puts you
 

1127
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,529
entire chapter is that empathy puts you
in a position to assert

1128
00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:15,539
in a position to assert
 

1129
00:21:15,539 --> 00:21:18,049
in a position to assert
and that there is no tension it's a

1130
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:18,059
and that there is no tension it's a
 

1131
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:19,669
and that there is no tension it's a
sequencing issue

1132
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:19,679
sequencing issue
 

1133
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,650
sequencing issue
and that's why again I think it's it was

1134
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:21,660
and that's why again I think it's it was
 

1135
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,169
and that's why again I think it's it was
written for lawyers yeah sequencing

1136
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:24,179
written for lawyers yeah sequencing
 

1137
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:27,169

the best way to deactivate negativity is

the best way to deactivate negativity is
 

1255
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,210
the best way to deactivate negativity is
by calling it out

by calling it out
and I could say look I don't I don't

1258
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:40,260
and I could say look I don't I don't
 

1259
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,510
and I could say look I don't I don't
want you to be offended by what I'm

want you to be offended by what I'm

want you to be offended by what I'm
getting ready to say

00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:42,900
getting ready to say
 

1263
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,890
getting ready to say
that's a denial your guard is up you're

1264
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:45,900
that's a denial your guard is up you're
 

1265
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,630
that's a denial your guard is up you're
getting ready to get mad

1266
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:47,640
getting ready to get mad
 

1267
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,549
getting ready to get mad
if I say what I'm getting ready to say

1268
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:49,559
if I say what I'm getting ready to say
 

1269
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:51,470
if I say what I'm getting ready to say
is probably going to offend you

1270
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:51,480
is probably going to offend you
 

1271
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,330
is probably going to offend you
now you relax a little bit

1272
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:53,340
now you relax a little bit
 

1273
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,570
now you relax a little bit
and you go all right what is it and then

1274
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:56,580
and you go all right what is it and then
 

1275
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,669
and you go all right what is it and then
I say it whatever it is and you're going

1276
00:23:58,669 --> 00:23:58,679
I say it whatever it is and you're going
 

1277
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:01,310
I say it whatever it is and you're going
to be like oh that wasn't that bad

1278
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:01,320
to be like oh that wasn't that bad
 

1279
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,810
to be like oh that wasn't that bad
because

1280

because
 

1281
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,909
because
we knew from hostage negotiation by

1282
00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:04,919
we knew from hostage negotiation by
 

1283
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,830
we knew from hostage negotiation by
calling out the negativity deactivated

1284

calling out the negativity deactivated
 

1285
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,190
calling out the negativity deactivated
and then number of Neuroscience

1286
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:09,200
and then number of Neuroscience
 

1287
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,270
and then number of Neuroscience
experiments have been done right and

1288
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:11,280
experiments have been done right and
 

1289
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,830
experiments have been done right and
left by calling out negativity

1290
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:12,840
left by calling out negativity
 

1291
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,770
left by calling out negativity
deactivating the negativity

1292
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:15,780
deactivating the negativity
 

1293
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,690
deactivating the negativity
calling out ahead of time so like

1294
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:17,700
calling out ahead of time so like
 

1295
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,909
calling out ahead of time so like
acknowledging that this is

1296
00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:19,919
acknowledging that this is
 

1297
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,730

the this is go ahead of time that this
 

1299
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,110
the this is go ahead of time that this
is going to hurt

1300
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,120
is going to hurt
 

1301
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,630
is going to hurt
the experiments that I've seen

1302
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:26,640
the experiments that I've seen
 

1303
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,850
the experiments that I've seen
um have been when the negativity was

1304
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:28,860
um have been when the negativity was
 

1305
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,590
um have been when the negativity was
inflicted and then having a person that

1306
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:30,600
inflicted and then having a person that
 

1307
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,110
inflicted and then having a person that
was being inflicted upon simply identify

1308
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,120
was being inflicted upon simply identify
 

1309
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,970
was being inflicted upon simply identify
it just identify yeah what are you

1310
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:34,980
it just identify yeah what are you
 

1311

1315
00:24:39,299 --> 00:24:42,890

it's tough because I've had a few and

1316
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:42,900
it's tough because I've had a few and
 

1317
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,890
it's tough because I've had a few and
again we're dancing between things but

I've had a few conversations where anger

1320
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:48,299
I've had a few conversations where anger
 

1321
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:52,250
I've had a few conversations where anger
arose in the guests I spoke with

1322
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:52,260
arose in the guests I spoke with
 

1323
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:54,909
arose in the guests I spoke with
yeah and I'm not sure

1324
00:24:54,909 --> 00:24:54,919
yeah and I'm not sure
 

1325
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:57,409
yeah and I'm not sure
identifying it

1326
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:57,419
identifying it
 

1327
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,870
identifying it
that that that's like leaning into it

1328

that that that's like leaning into it
 

1329
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,789
that that that's like leaning into it
and going into the depths

1330
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:01,799
and going into the depths
 

1331
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:02,930
and going into the depths
because

1332
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:02,940
because
 

1333
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,730
because
that's going to the depths of some

psychological thing they're going
 

1339
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,330
psychological thing they're going
through that I'm not sure I want to

1340
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:11,340
through that I'm not sure I want to
 

1341
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,490
through that I'm not sure I want to
explore that Iceberg with a little ship

1342
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:13,500
explore that Iceberg with a little ship
 

1343
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,130

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,930
we got I
um it's a you have to decide do you want

1346
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:17,940
um it's a you have to decide do you want
 

1347
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,450
um it's a you have to decide do you want
to avoid it

1348
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:20,460
to avoid it
 

1349
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,310
to avoid it
or do you want to lean into it it's a

1350

tough choice it's the elephant in a room

1352
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:23,760
tough choice it's the elephant in a room
 

1353
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,669
tough choice it's the elephant in a room
it is an alpha in the room it is an

1354
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:25,679
it is an alpha in the room it is an
 

1355
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,310
it is an alpha in the room it is an
outfit especially when I think that's

1356
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:28,320
outfit especially when I think that's
 

1357
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,049
outfit especially when I think that's
the big difference between conversations

1358
00:25:30,049 --> 00:25:30,059
the big difference between conversations
 

1359
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:34,370
the big difference between conversations
and negotiations negotiation ultimately

1360
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:34,380
and negotiations negotiation ultimately
 

1361
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,990
and negotiations negotiation ultimately
who is looking for closure and

1362
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,000
who is looking for closure and
 

1363
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,390
who is looking for closure and
resolution I think General conversations

1364
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:38,400
resolution I think General conversations
 

1365
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,590
resolution I think General conversations
like this

1366
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:39,600
like this
 

1367
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,690
like this
is more exploring

1368
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:41,700
is more exploring
 

1369
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:44,570
is more exploring
there's not necessarily a goal

1370
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:44,580
there's not necessarily a goal
 

1371
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,730
there's not necessarily a goal
like if you were to put like if I had to

1372
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:46,740
like if you were to put like if I had to
 

1373
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,710
like if you were to put like if I had to
put a goal for this conversation there's

1374
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:48,720
put a goal for this conversation there's
 

1375
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,070
put a goal for this conversation there's
no real goal it's curiously exploring

1376
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,080
no real goal it's curiously exploring
 

1377
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,450
no real goal it's curiously exploring
ideas

1378
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:53,460
ideas
 

1379
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,570
ideas
so that'll gives you freedom to not call

1380
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:56,580
so that'll gives you freedom to not call
 

1381
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,909
so that'll gives you freedom to not call
out the elephant

1382
00:25:57,909 --> 00:25:57,919
out the elephant
 

1383
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,289
out the elephant
for for time you could be like all right

1384
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:00,299
for for time you could be like all right
 

1385
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:01,789
for for time you could be like all right
let's go to the Next Room get a snack

1386
00:26:01,789 --> 00:26:01,799
let's go to the Next Room get a snack
 

1387
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,610
let's go to the Next Room get a snack
and come back to the elephant right

1388
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:04,620
and come back to the elephant right
 

1389
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,769
and come back to the elephant right
all right so I I'd make a tiny

1390
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:06,779
all right so I I'd make a tiny
 

1391
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:08,750
all right so I I'd make a tiny
adjustment on the negotiation definition

1392
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:08,760
adjustment on the negotiation definition
 

1393
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,049
adjustment on the negotiation definition
sure because you said I think um

1394
00:26:12,049 --> 00:26:12,059
sure because you said I think um
 

1395
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:15,230
sure because you said I think um
seeking closure

1396
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,240

 

1397
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:15,950

um

1398
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:15,960
um
 

1399
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,470
um
you use two words enclosure was one of

1400
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:18,480
you use two words enclosure was one of
 

1401
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,630
you use two words enclosure was one of
them goals maybe another well yeah what

1402
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:20,640
them goals maybe another well yeah what
 

1403
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,549
them goals maybe another well yeah what
is what is negotiation well I would say

1404
00:26:22,549 --> 00:26:22,559
is what is negotiation well I would say
 

1405
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,950
is what is negotiation well I would say
seeking collaboration

1406
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:24,960
seeking collaboration
 

1407
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,289
seeking collaboration
and because closure kind of puts a

1408
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:27,299
and because closure kind of puts a
 

1409
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,970
and because closure kind of puts a
little bit of a finality to it a real

1410
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:28,980
little bit of a finality to it a real
 

1411
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,649
little bit of a finality to it a real
problem in any negotiations always

1412
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:30,659
problem in any negotiations always
 

1413
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,630
problem in any negotiations always
implementation

1414
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:32,640
implementation
 

1415
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,570
implementation
that's why we say yeses I say we yes

1416
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:35,580
that's why we say yeses I say we yes
 

1417
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,610
that's why we say yeses I say we yes
there's nothing without how

1418
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:37,620
there's nothing without how
 

1419
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,250
there's nothing without how
and and yes and it's at its very best

1429
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,010
good lie yes it's usually a counterfeit
it's aspirational without the how yeah

1430
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:52,020
it's aspirational without the how yeah
 

1431
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,230
it's aspirational without the how yeah
it's just a good line yeah thank you and

it's just a good line yeah thank you and
we're working on it I was practicing I

1434
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:56,100
we're working on it I was practicing I
 

1435
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,890
we're working on it I was practicing I
in front of the mirror 14. pretty good

1436
00:26:59,890 --> 00:26:59,900
in front of the mirror 14. pretty good

stuff these days there's the switch like

1602
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:57,240
stuff these days there's the switch like
 

1603
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,990
stuff these days there's the switch like
so at what point in time do we catch on

1604
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:00,000
so at what point in time do we catch on
 

1605
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,330
so at what point in time do we catch on
because the difference between survival

1606
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:02,340
because the difference between survival
 

1607
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,149
because the difference between survival
and success mindset

1608
00:30:05,149 --> 00:30:05,159
and success mindset
 

1609
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:09,529
and success mindset
the success mindset is highly optimistic

1610
00:30:09,529 --> 00:30:09,539
the success mindset is highly optimistic
 

1611
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:12,110
the success mindset is highly optimistic
so where do we switch or how do we stay

1612
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:12,120
so where do we switch or how do we stay
 

1613
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,510
so where do we switch or how do we stay
switched from survival to success that's

1614
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:14,520
switched from survival to success that's
 

1615
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,730
switched from survival to success that's
the challenge

1616
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:16,740
the challenge
 

1617
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,769
the challenge
yeah somewhere we stopped being eaten by

1618
00:30:18,769 --> 00:30:18,779
yeah somewhere we stopped being eaten by
 

1619
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:20,149
yeah somewhere we stopped being eaten by
saber-toothed tigers and started

1620
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:20,159
saber-toothed tigers and started
 

1621
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,250
saber-toothed tigers and started
building bridges and buildings and

1622
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:22,260
building bridges and buildings and
 

1623
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,850
building bridges and buildings and
computers and companies and we started

1624
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:25,860
computers and companies and we started
 

1625
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,850
computers and companies and we started
to experience we got enough data back

1626
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:28,860
to experience we got enough data back
 

1627
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,010
to experience we got enough data back
to collaborate

1628
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:31,020
to collaborate
 

1629
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,169
to collaborate
and we stopped listening to our amygdala

1630
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:33,179
and we stopped listening to our amygdala
 

1631
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:35,149
and we stopped listening to our amygdala
and we started listening to our gut

1632
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:35,159
and we started listening to our gut
 

1633
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:37,250
and we started listening to our gut

didn't inherit it from somebody else he
 

1669
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,830
didn't inherit it from somebody else he
signed

1670
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:21,840
signed
 

1671
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,870

and the number two in the embassy says

1674
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:27,140
and the number two in the embassy says

and the number two in the embassy says
last night on TV the president of the

00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:32,039
United States said we don't negotiate
 

1679
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,529
United States said we don't negotiate
with terrorists are you calling a

1680
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:33,539
with terrorists are you calling a
 

1681
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,049
with terrorists are you calling a
president United States a liar

1682
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:36,059
president United States a liar
 

1683
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,669
president United States a liar
and I remember thinking like all right

1684
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:37,679
and I remember thinking like all right
 

1685
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,889
and I remember thinking like all right
so

1686
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:39,899
so
 

1687
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,310
so
he probably said that and that's not on

1688
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:43,320
he probably said that and that's not on
 

1689
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,130
he probably said that and that's not on
the document that he signed

1690
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:46,140
the document that he signed
 

1691
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,649
the document that he signed
so I said look it you know

1692
00:31:48,649 --> 00:31:48,659
so I said look it you know
 

1693
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,230
so I said look it you know
I'm familiar with what he's signed and

1694
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:51,240
I'm familiar with what he's signed and
 

1695
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,210
I'm familiar with what he's signed and
it that's not what it says well you know

1696
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:53,220
it that's not what it says well you know
 

1697
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,889
it that's not what it says well you know
and so the argument but that's always

1698
00:31:54,889 --> 00:31:54,899
and so the argument but that's always
 

1699
00:31:54,899 --> 00:31:56,389
and so the argument but that's always
been the sound bite that everybody likes

1700
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:56,399
been the sound bite that everybody likes
 

1701
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,430
been the sound bite that everybody likes
we don't negotiate with terrorists

1702
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:58,440
we don't negotiate with terrorists
 

1703
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,750
we don't negotiate with terrorists

00:31:59,750 --> 00:31:59,760
depends upon your definition of
 

1705
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,610
depends upon your definition of
negotiation if it's just communication

1706
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:01,620
negotiation if it's just communication
 

1707

bone-headed deal with the bad guys
 

1715
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,250
bone-headed deal with the bad guys
like Obama released five high-level

1716
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:16,260

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:20,340
Taliban leaders from Guantanamo in
 

1719
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:23,029
Taliban leaders from Guantanamo in
exchange for an AWOL soldier that we

1720
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:23,039
exchange for an AWOL soldier that we
 

1721
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:24,710
exchange for an AWOL soldier that we
immediately threw in jail

1722
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:24,720
immediately threw in jail
 

1723
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,990
immediately threw in jail
and I thought that was a horrible deal

1724
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,000
and I thought that was a horrible deal
 

1725
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,850
and I thought that was a horrible deal
and that would that's putting terrorists

1726
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:28,860
and that would that's putting terrorists
 

1727
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,889
and that would that's putting terrorists
back on a Battlefield

1728
00:32:30,889 --> 00:32:30,899

but what makes this different in person

2168
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:51,420
but what makes this different in person
 

2169
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,329
but what makes this different in person
I I actually think

2170
00:40:53,329 --> 00:40:53,339
I I actually think
 

2171
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,370
I I actually think
um I think there's energy

2172
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:55,380
um I think there's energy
 

2173
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:57,230
um I think there's energy
that we're unable we don't have the

2174
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,240
that we're unable we don't have the
 

2175
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,390
that we're unable we don't have the
instrumentation to Define yet

2176
00:40:59,390 --> 00:40:59,400
instrumentation to Define yet
 

2177
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,370
instrumentation to Define yet
and I think that there's a feel I think

2178
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:01,380
and I think that there's a feel I think
 

2179
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,890
and I think that there's a feel I think
there's an actual energetic feel that

2180
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:03,900
there's an actual energetic feel that
 

2181
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,349
there's an actual energetic feel that
changes and just because we don't we

2182
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:06,359
changes and just because we don't we
 

2183
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:08,329
changes and just because we don't we
again just because we can't

2184
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:08,339
again just because we can't
 

2185
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,190
again just because we can't
measure it

2186
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:10,200
measure it
 

2187
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,530
measure it
doesn't mean it's not there

2188
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:12,540
doesn't mean it's not there
 

2189
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,810
doesn't mean it's not there
yeah I would love to figure out what

2190
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:14,820
yeah I would love to figure out what
 

2191
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,510
yeah I would love to figure out what
that is uh folks that are working on

2192
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,520
that is uh folks that are working on
 

2193
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,890
that is uh folks that are working on
virtual reality are trying to figure out

2194
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:18,900
virtual reality are trying to figure out
 

2195
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,990
virtual reality are trying to figure out
that what that is during the pandemic

2196
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,000
that what that is during the pandemic
 

2197
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,990
that what that is during the pandemic
everybody was on Zoom zoom and Microsoft

everybody was on Zoom zoom and Microsoft
everybody was trying to figure out how

2200
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:25,619
everybody was trying to figure out how
 

2201
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,650
everybody was trying to figure out how
do we replicate that I'm trying to

2202
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:27,660
do we replicate that I'm trying to
 

2203
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,270
do we replicate that I'm trying to
understand how to replicate that because

2204
00:41:29,270 --> 00:41:29,280
understand how to replicate that because
 

2205
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,550
understand how to replicate that because
it sure is not fun to travel across the

2206
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:31,560
it sure is not fun to travel across the
 

2207
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,010
it sure is not fun to travel across the
world just to talk to Snowden or Putin

2227
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,710
right probably ah getting a given us to
see see that and here's the issue that

2228
00:41:57,710 --> 00:41:57,720
see see that and here's the issue that
 

2229
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,510
see see that and here's the issue that
trips everybody up in negotiation the

2230
00:41:59,510 --> 00:41:59,520
trips everybody up in negotiation the
 

2231
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,849
trips everybody up in negotiation the
difference between hearing and speaking

2232
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:01,859
difference between hearing and speaking
 

2233
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:04,670
difference between hearing and speaking
the same words are vastly different

2234
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:04,680
the same words are vastly different
 

2235
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:06,589
the same words are vastly different
and what I'm looking for is what I'm the

2236
00:42:06,589 --> 00:42:06,599

and they found us they could talk
you know we all right so it might not be

2894
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:26,160
you know we all right so it might not be
 

2895
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:27,230
you know we all right so it might not be
better for us how do we make it better

2896
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:27,240
better for us how do we make it better

00:54:29,339 --> 00:54:30,829
for our kids
and that that's where the the Hope

2900
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:30,839
and that that's where the the Hope
 

2901
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:32,990
and that that's where the the Hope
derives from because I think both sides

2902
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:33,000
derives from because I think both sides
 

2903
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,210
derives from because I think both sides
ultimately wanted to be better for their

they still engage in interactions and
which is why I think the leadership

2910
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:40,980
which is why I think the leadership
 

2911
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:43,569
which is why I think the leadership

accommodators that are hope driven
 

3725
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:20,149
accommodators that are hope driven
I hope this works out

the idea is you can adopt these three

3738
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:31,260
the idea is you can adopt these three
 

3739
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,649
the idea is you can adopt these three
voices you can yeah you can learn them

3740
01:10:33,649 --> 01:10:33,659
voices you can yeah you can learn them
 

3741
01:10:33,659 --> 01:10:35,510
voices you can yeah you can learn them
they're all learnable

3742
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:35,520
they're all learnable
 

3743
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,130
they're all learnable
the analysts

3744
01:10:37,130 --> 01:10:37,140
the analysts
 

3745
01:10:37,140 --> 01:10:41,630
the analysts
are often mistaken for accommodators

3746
01:10:41,630 --> 01:10:41,640
are often mistaken for accommodators
 

3747
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,970
are often mistaken for accommodators
because as you said before

3748
01:10:43,970 --> 01:10:43,980
because as you said before
 

3749
01:10:43,980 --> 01:10:46,310
because as you said before
you know analysts are more introspective

3750
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:46,320
you know analysts are more introspective
 

3751
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,570
you know analysts are more introspective
more analytical

3752
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:47,580
more analytical
 

3753
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:50,270
more analytical
they're looking at the systems at work

3754
01:10:50,270 --> 01:10:50,280
they're looking at the systems at work
 

3755
01:10:50,280 --> 01:10:51,890
they're looking at the systems at work
and

3756
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:51,900
and
 

3757
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,149
and
if

if
 

3759
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,250
if
um if they like to learn

01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:55,260
um if they like to learn
 

3761
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:57,410
um if they like to learn
they notice

3762
01:10:57,410 --> 01:10:57,420
they notice
 

3763
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,750
they notice
that accommodators make more deals than

3764
01:10:59,750 --> 01:10:59,760
that accommodators make more deals than
 

3765
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,669
that accommodators make more deals than
they make they also notice that there's

3766
01:11:01,669 --> 01:11:01,679
they make they also notice that there's
 

3767
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:04,250
they make they also notice that there's
a higher failure rate of the deals

3768
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:04,260
a higher failure rate of the deals
 

3769
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,810
a higher failure rate of the deals
but since they notice stuff and they

01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:05,820
but since they notice stuff and they
 

3771
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:06,950
but since they notice stuff and they
think about it

3772
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:06,960
think about it
 

3773
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:09,530
think about it
they catch on faster than asserters do

3774
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:09,540
they catch on faster than asserters do
 

3775

that the pleasant nature of an ant of an
accommodator contributes strongly to

accommodator contributes strongly to
 

3779
01:11:15,659 --> 01:11:17,149
accommodator contributes strongly to
them making deals

01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,330
analysts are assassins
you know an analyst will snap you from a

3790
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:29,340
you know an analyst will snap you from a
 

3791

night
 

3795
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:32,810
night
and you never know what hit you and

3796
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:32,820
and you never know what hit you and
 

3797
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:36,350
and you never know what hit you and
they're really happy with that

3798
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:36,360

 

3799
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:39,950

but uh has how has assertiveness the

3800
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:39,960
but uh has how has assertiveness the
 

3801
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,930
but uh has how has assertiveness the
assertive voice served you in

3802
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:41,940
assertive voice served you in
 

3803
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:44,030
assertive voice served you in
negotiation poorly

3804
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:44,040
negotiation poorly
 

3805
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,550
negotiation poorly
that's the sort of voice

3806
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:46,560
that's the sort of voice
 

3807
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,830
that's the sort of voice
is almost always counterproductive it

3808
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:48,840
is almost always counterproductive it
 

3809
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,970
is almost always counterproductive it
feels like getting hit in the face with

3810
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:49,980
feels like getting hit in the face with
 

3811
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:52,130
feels like getting hit in the face with
a brick

3812
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:52,140
a brick
 

3813
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,810
a brick
and that's almost always

3814
01:11:53,810 --> 01:11:53,820
and that's almost always
 

3815
01:11:53,820 --> 01:11:56,330
and that's almost always
counterproductive so for me to be more

3816
01:11:56,330 --> 01:11:56,340
counterproductive so for me to be more
 

3817
01:11:56,340 --> 01:11:58,390
counterproductive so for me to be more
effective especially in a negotiation

3818

effective especially in a negotiation
 

3819

effective especially in a negotiation
I'll need to slow slow down

3820
01:12:01,610 --> 01:12:01,620
I'll need to slow slow down
 

3821
01:12:01,620 --> 01:12:04,250
I'll need to slow slow down
and smile

3822
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:04,260
and smile
 

3823
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:06,410

you know I heard that uh Teddy Roosevelt

3824
01:12:06,410 --> 01:12:06,420
you know I heard that uh Teddy Roosevelt
 

3825
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,890
you know I heard that uh Teddy Roosevelt
was a good negotiator and then he was

3826
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:08,900
was a good negotiator and then he was
 

3827
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:11,090
was a good negotiator and then he was
extremely stubborn

3828
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:11,100
extremely stubborn
 

3829
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,910
extremely stubborn
and perhaps the right term for that will

3830
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:13,920
and perhaps the right term for that will
 

3831
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,709
and perhaps the right term for that will
be assertive but he picked his battles

3832
01:12:15,709 --> 01:12:15,719
be assertive but he picked his battles
 

3833
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:19,570
be assertive but he picked his battles

implementation there's just a deal and
 

4059
01:16:31,739 --> 01:16:34,490
implementation there's just a deal and
then they walk away a pretense situation

then they walk away a pretense situation
 

4061
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:36,470
then they walk away a pretense situation
so they got no actual real skin in the

intentionally I'm good at labeling but

4210
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:25,860
intentionally I'm good at labeling but
 

4211
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:27,950
intentionally I'm good at labeling but
does it almost always work

4212
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:27,960
does it almost always work
 

4213
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:29,450
does it almost always work
oh yeah

4214
01:19:29,450 --> 01:19:29,460
oh yeah
 

4215
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:30,830
oh yeah
yeah it's

4216
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:30,840
yeah it's
 

4217
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:33,590
yeah it's
it feels maybe awkward but there's it's

4218
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:33,600
it feels maybe awkward but there's it's
 

4219
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,870
it feels maybe awkward but there's it's
true there's got to be ways to signal

4220
01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:35,880
true there's got to be ways to signal
 

4221
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:38,090
true there's got to be ways to signal
that you're truly listening

4222
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:38,100
that you're truly listening
 

4223
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:40,010
that you're truly listening
that's part of it I think you do body

4224
01:19:40,010 --> 01:19:40,020
that's part of it I think you do body
 

4225
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:42,350
that's part of it I think you do body
language you can yeah there's a lot of

4226
01:19:42,350 --> 01:19:42,360
language you can yeah there's a lot of
 

4227
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,850
language you can yeah there's a lot of
ways to signal that but mirroring is

4228
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:43,860
ways to signal that but mirroring is
 

4229
01:19:43,860 --> 01:19:47,149
ways to signal that but mirroring is
probably just this trivial little hack

4230
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:47,159
probably just this trivial little hack
 

4231
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:48,830
probably just this trivial little hack
it kind of is

4232
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:48,840
it kind of is
 

4233
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,110
it kind of is
you know what there's a situation I had

4234
01:19:51,110 --> 01:19:51,120
you know what there's a situation I had
 

4235
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,790
you know what there's a situation I had
a conversation with Stephen codkin he's

a conversation with Stephen codkin he's
this historian and uh he would say my

4238
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:57,540

4239
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,870
this historian and uh he would say my

Lex
is that and for some reason that was

01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:07,189
is that and for some reason that was
making me feel really good I was like he

4248
01:20:07,189 --> 01:20:07,199
making me feel really good I was like he
 

4249
01:20:07,199 --> 01:20:10,130
making me feel really good I was like he
cares about me and I wonder if that key

4250
01:20:10,130 --> 01:20:10,140
cares about me and I wonder if that key
 

4251
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:12,410
cares about me and I wonder if that key
if everyone has that key that could be

4252
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:12,420
if everyone has that key that could be
 

4253
01:20:12,420 --> 01:20:14,630
if everyone has that key that could be
the name just using people's name could

4254
01:20:14,630 --> 01:20:14,640
the name just using people's name could
 

4255
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,709
the name just using people's name could
be

4256
01:20:15,709 --> 01:20:15,719
be
 

4257
01:20:15,719 --> 01:20:19,310
be
powerful using the name is really

4258
01:20:19,310 --> 01:20:19,320
powerful using the name is really
 

4259
01:20:19,320 --> 01:20:22,010
powerful using the name is really
context driven

4260
01:20:22,010 --> 01:20:22,020
context driven
 

4261
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,830
context driven
it can be extremely powerful with

4262
01:20:24,830 --> 01:20:24,840
it can be extremely powerful with
 

4263
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,110
it can be extremely powerful with
someone who's genuine and it comes

4264
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:27,120
someone who's genuine and it comes
 

4265
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:29,570
someone who's genuine and it comes
across in their demeanor

across in their demeanor
 

4267
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,610
across in their demeanor
and it's used in a way

4268
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:31,620
and it's used in a way
 

4269
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:34,490
and it's used in a way
that you can tell is meant to encourage

4270
01:20:34,490 --> 01:20:34,500
that you can tell is meant to encourage
 

4271
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,490

and the people that are really into
 

4275
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,669
and the people that are really into
exploiting will also use it do the same

4276
01:20:43,669 --> 01:20:43,679
exploiting will also use it do the same
 

4277
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:46,729
exploiting will also use it do the same
thing so you have to be you have to

01:20:46,729 --> 01:20:46,739
thing so you have to be you have to
 

4279
01:20:46,739 --> 01:20:48,950
thing so you have to be you have to
avoid using the things that people that

4280
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:48,960
avoid using the things that people that
 

4281
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,410
avoid using the things that people that
are exploiters manipulators use

4282
01:20:51,410 --> 01:20:51,420
are exploiters manipulators use
 

4283
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:53,990
are exploiters manipulators use
because it's it might signal to others

4284
01:20:53,990 --> 01:20:54,000
because it's it might signal to others
 

4285
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,970

that this person is uh trying to trick
 

4287
01:20:55,980 --> 01:20:58,250
that this person is uh trying to trick
me it'll be very conscious over here uh

sound angry to this is probably going to
 

4297
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,370

labeling is is hanging a label on an

labeling is is hanging a label on an
 

4301
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:13,189
labeling is is hanging a label on an
emotion or an affect and then just

emotion or an affect and then just
 

4303
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:15,410
emotion or an affect and then just
calling it up

01:21:15,410 --> 01:21:15,420
calling it up
 

4305
01:21:15,420 --> 01:21:17,990
calling it up
is that almost always good it could

4306
01:21:17,990 --> 01:21:18,000
is that almost always good it could
 

4307
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,030
is that almost always good it could
could it be a source of frustration when

4308
01:21:20,030 --> 01:21:20,040

4349
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:11,270
yes that would be annoying if it's just
so absurdly obvious yeah that there's no

4350
01:22:11,270 --> 01:22:11,280
so absurdly obvious yeah that there's no
 

4351
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,310
so absurdly obvious yeah that there's no
Insight in your label at all

4352
01:22:13,310 --> 01:22:13,320
Insight in your label at all
 

4353
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,950
Insight in your label at all
and as soon as you're

4354
01:22:15,950 --> 01:22:15,960
and as soon as you're
 

4355
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:19,250
and as soon as you're
demonstrating an awareness or a subtlety

4356
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:19,260
demonstrating an awareness or a subtlety
 

4357
01:22:19,260 --> 01:22:22,550
demonstrating an awareness or a subtlety

now we're making progress
 

4361
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:27,410
now we're making progress
so the only time

4362
01:22:27,410 --> 01:22:27,420
so the only time
 

4363
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,090
so the only time
a label could ever potentially be

4364
01:22:29,090 --> 01:22:29,100
a label could ever potentially be
 

4365
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:30,709
a label could ever potentially be
counterproductive it's like if you

4366
01:22:30,709 --> 01:22:30,719
counterproductive it's like if you
 

4367
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,169
counterproductive it's like if you

01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:23,990
it's a thing to try maybe with uh with
people in your life just hang out and

4626
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:24,000
people in your life just hang out and

4631
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:31,490
don't say anything the entire day
but we're trying yeah definitely it's

4632
01:27:31,490 --> 01:27:31,500
but we're trying yeah definitely it's
 

4633
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:34,270
but we're trying yeah definitely it's
interesting I haven't tried it myself

4634
01:27:34,270 --> 01:27:34,280
interesting I haven't tried it myself
 

4635
01:27:34,280 --> 01:27:37,729
interesting I haven't tried it myself
it seems uh uh it's kind of like a

4636
01:27:37,729 --> 01:27:37,739
it seems uh uh it's kind of like a
 

4637
01:27:37,739 --> 01:27:41,149
it seems uh uh it's kind of like a
silent retreat but more uh active as

4638
01:27:41,149 --> 01:27:41,159
silent retreat but more uh active as
 

4639
01:27:41,159 --> 01:27:43,729
silent retreat but more uh active as
part of like regular everyday life

4640
01:27:43,729 --> 01:27:43,739
part of like regular everyday life
 

4641
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:45,189
part of like regular everyday life
um anyway

4642
01:27:45,189 --> 01:27:45,199
um anyway
 

4643
01:27:45,199 --> 01:27:47,990
um anyway
the is there other other interesting

4644
01:27:47,990 --> 01:27:48,000
the is there other other interesting
 

4645
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,149
the is there other other interesting
techniques we can talk about here so um

4646
01:27:50,149 --> 01:27:50,159
techniques we can talk about here so um
 

4647
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:52,490
techniques we can talk about here so um
for example creating the illusion of

4648
01:27:52,490 --> 01:27:52,500
for example creating the illusion of
 

4649
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,629
for example creating the illusion of
control

4650
01:27:53,629 --> 01:27:53,639
control
 

4651
01:27:53,639 --> 01:27:56,090
control
yeah that's principally you know by

4652
01:27:56,090 --> 01:27:56,100
yeah that's principally you know by
 

4653
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,370
yeah that's principally you know by
asking what and how questions

4654
01:27:58,370 --> 01:27:58,380
asking what and how questions
 

4655
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:00,649
asking what and how questions
because people love to tell others what

4656
01:28:00,649 --> 01:28:00,659
because people love to tell others what
 

4657
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:03,229
because people love to tell others what
to do or how to do it

4658
01:28:03,229 --> 01:28:03,239
to do or how to do it
 

4659
01:28:03,239 --> 01:28:05,330
to do or how to do it
um it does a lot that was that was

4660
01:28:05,330 --> 01:28:05,340
um it does a lot that was that was
 

4661
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:07,250
um it does a lot that was that was
really the way when the book was first

4662
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:07,260
really the way when the book was first
 

4663
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,750
really the way when the book was first
written

4664
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:08,760
written
 

4665
01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:10,310
written
that we really thought about what and

4666
01:28:10,310 --> 01:28:10,320
that we really thought about what and
 

4667
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,169
that we really thought about what and
how questions is giving the other side

4668
01:28:12,169 --> 01:28:12,179
how questions is giving the other side
 

4669
01:28:12,179 --> 01:28:14,870
how questions is giving the other side
the illusion of control

4670
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:14,880
the illusion of control
 

4671
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:16,910
the illusion of control
and there's a lot more to it than that

4672
01:28:16,910 --> 01:28:16,920
and there's a lot more to it than that
 

4673
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:18,830
and there's a lot more to it than that
that we've discovered I mean it triggers

4674
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:18,840
that we've discovered I mean it triggers
 

4675
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:21,169
that we've discovered I mean it triggers
deep thinking it wears people down

4676

deep thinking it wears people down
 

4677
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:23,570
deep thinking it wears people down
deep thinking is could be exhausting and

deep thinking is could be exhausting and
 

4679
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,850
deep thinking is could be exhausting and
you want so what's the what's the role

4680
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:25,860
you want so what's the what's the role
 

4681
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,530
you want so what's the what's the role
of exhaustion and negotiation is that

4682
01:28:27,530 --> 01:28:27,540
of exhaustion and negotiation is that
 

4683
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:28,850
of exhaustion and negotiation is that
ultimately you gotta be careful with

4684
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:28,860
ultimately you gotta be careful with
 

4685

that
 

4687
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:33,669
that
um some people uh exhaust intentionally

and then which the other side found
 

4751
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:55,250
and then which the other side found
exhaust would often find exhausting

4752
01:29:55,250 --> 01:29:55,260
exhaust would often find exhausting
 

4753
01:29:55,260 --> 01:29:59,290
exhaust would often find exhausting
so exhaustion is a can be a component of

4754
01:29:59,290 --> 01:29:59,300
so exhaustion is a can be a component of
 

4755
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:02,629
so exhaustion is a can be a component of
finding resolution in the negotiation if

finding resolution in the negotiation if
 

4757
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:04,310
finding resolution in the negotiation if
it's if it tamps down the negative

4758
01:30:04,310 --> 01:30:04,320
it's if it tamps down the negative
 

4759
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,350
it's if it tamps down the negative
emotions often exhaustion will Tamp down

4760
01:30:06,350 --> 01:30:06,360
emotions often exhaustion will Tamp down
 

4761
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,290
emotions often exhaustion will Tamp down
negative emotions if it puts you if in

4762
01:30:09,290 --> 01:30:09,300
negative emotions if it puts you if in
 

4763
01:30:09,300 --> 01:30:10,970
negative emotions if it puts you if in
getting the real trick is really getting

4764
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:10,980
getting the real trick is really getting
 

4765
01:30:10,980 --> 01:30:13,070
getting the real trick is really getting
negative emotions out of out of the way

4766
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:13,080
negative emotions out of out of the way
 

4767
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,870
negative emotions out of out of the way
because you're Dumber in a negative

4768
01:30:14,870 --> 01:30:14,880
because you're Dumber in a negative
 

4769
01:30:14,880 --> 01:30:16,310
because you're Dumber in a negative
frame of mind

4770

frame of mind
 

4771
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,169
frame of mind
so the goal is always positive emotion

4772
01:30:18,169 --> 01:30:18,179
so the goal is always positive emotion
 

4773
01:30:18,179 --> 01:30:19,790
so the goal is always positive emotion
as you talk about that's what you're

always chasing together I think I think
 

4777
01:30:21,540 --> 01:30:23,810
always chasing together I think I think
so yeah and that's what the that's right

4778
01:30:23,810 --> 01:30:23,820
so yeah and that's what the that's right
 

4779
01:30:23,820 --> 01:30:26,149
so yeah and that's what the that's right
it's about yes

4780

it's about yes
 

4781
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,550
it's about yes
like whatever you're triggering whatever

4782
01:30:28,550 --> 01:30:28,560
like whatever you're triggering whatever
 

4783
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:29,810

and we're going to address it
 

4953
01:33:34,440 --> 01:33:36,649
and we're going to address it
big ridiculous question but

4954
01:33:36,649 --> 01:33:36,659
big ridiculous question but
 

4955
01:33:36,659 --> 01:33:41,510
big ridiculous question but
how do you uh close the deal how do you

4956
01:33:41,510 --> 01:33:41,520
how do you uh close the deal how do you
 

4957
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:45,890
how do you uh close the deal how do you
take the uh negotiation to its end is it

4958
01:33:45,890 --> 01:33:45,900
take the uh negotiation to its end is it
 

4959
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,050
take the uh negotiation to its end is it
implementation ultimately you got to put

4960
01:33:48,050 --> 01:33:48,060
implementation ultimately you got to put
 

4961
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:49,430
implementation ultimately you got to put
you gotta pivot to agreed upon

4962
01:33:49,430 --> 01:33:49,440
you gotta pivot to agreed upon
 

4963
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,050
you gotta pivot to agreed upon
implementation to really to really move

4964
01:33:51,050 --> 01:33:51,060
implementation to really to really move
 

4965
01:33:51,060 --> 01:33:53,270
implementation to really to really move
out of the negotiation

4966
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:53,280
out of the negotiation
 

4967
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,370
out of the negotiation
um and I may say how do you how do you

4968
01:33:55,370 --> 01:33:55,380
um and I may say how do you how do you
 

4969
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:56,870
um and I may say how do you how do you
want to proceed

4970
01:33:56,870 --> 01:33:56,880
want to proceed
 

4971
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,169
want to proceed
and if you don't know I might say no

4972
01:34:00,169 --> 01:34:00,179
and if you don't know I might say no
 

4973
01:34:00,179 --> 01:34:02,209
and if you don't know I might say no
more into question is it a ridiculous

4974
01:34:02,209 --> 01:34:02,219
more into question is it a ridiculous
 

4975
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:04,010
more into question is it a ridiculous
idea if I share with you some ideas of

4976
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:04,020
idea if I share with you some ideas of
 

4977
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:06,169
idea if I share with you some ideas of
how to proceed

4978
01:34:06,169 --> 01:34:06,179
how to proceed
 

4979
01:34:06,179 --> 01:34:08,510
how to proceed
and then you agree on the actual steps

4980
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:08,520
and then you agree on the actual steps
 

4981
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,189
and then you agree on the actual steps
and that's the implementation it's not

4982
01:34:10,189 --> 01:34:10,199
and that's the implementation it's not
 

4983
01:34:10,199 --> 01:34:12,649
and that's the implementation it's not
just the philosophical agreement it's

4984
01:34:12,649 --> 01:34:12,659
just the philosophical agreement it's
 

4985
01:34:12,659 --> 01:34:15,350
just the philosophical agreement it's
actual steps the big problem in all

4986
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:15,360
actual steps the big problem in all
 

4987
01:34:15,360 --> 01:34:17,870
actual steps the big problem in all
negotiations is a lack of discussion of

is just a bad idea for a variety of
reasons

5112
01:36:47,450 --> 01:36:47,460
reasons
 

5113
01:36:47,460 --> 01:36:50,810
reasons
first of all

5114
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:50,820

 

5115
01:36:50,820 --> 01:36:52,430

um there's really good change the other

5116
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:52,440
um there's really good change the other
 

5117
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:53,810
um there's really good change the other
side it's a better life than you are

5118
01:36:53,810 --> 01:36:53,820
side it's a better life than you are
 

5119
01:36:53,820 --> 01:36:54,950
side it's a better life than you are
they're going to spot it right off the

5120
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:54,960
they're going to spot it right off the
 

5121
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:56,030
they're going to spot it right off the
bat yeah

5122
01:36:56,030 --> 01:36:56,040
bat yeah
 

5123
01:36:56,040 --> 01:36:58,189
bat yeah
yeah secondly

5124
01:36:58,189 --> 01:36:58,199
yeah secondly
 

5125
01:36:58,199 --> 01:37:00,110
yeah secondly
they could be luring you into a trap to

5126
01:37:00,110 --> 01:37:00,120
they could be luring you into a trap to
 

5127
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,510
they could be luring you into a trap to
see if you will lie

5128
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:02,520
see if you will lie
 

5129
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,189
see if you will lie
thirdly the chances are they're going to

5130
01:37:04,189 --> 01:37:04,199
thirdly the chances are they're going to
 

5131
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:06,770
thirdly the chances are they're going to
find out they lied to them eventually

5132
01:37:06,770 --> 01:37:06,780
find out they lied to them eventually
 

5133
01:37:06,780 --> 01:37:10,010
find out they lied to them eventually
is really high and then the penalties

5134
01:37:10,010 --> 01:37:10,020
is really high and then the penalties
 

5135
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:11,570
is really high and then the penalties
and the taxes

5136
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:11,580
and the taxes
 

5137
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,910
and the taxes
are going to be way higher than what you

5138
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:13,920
are going to be way higher than what you
 

5139
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,430
are going to be way higher than what you
had in the first place so long term you

5140
01:37:16,430 --> 01:37:16,440
had in the first place so long term you
 

5141
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:17,689
had in the first place so long term you
want to have a reputation of somebody

5142
01:37:17,689 --> 01:37:17,699
want to have a reputation of somebody
 

5143
01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:19,790
want to have a reputation of somebody
with integrity and the more you lie the

5144
01:37:19,790 --> 01:37:19,800
with integrity and the more you lie the
 

5145
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,410
with integrity and the more you lie the
harder it is to maintain that reputation

5146
01:37:21,410 --> 01:37:21,420
harder it is to maintain that reputation
 

5147
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:23,330
harder it is to maintain that reputation
yeah exactly and where it's going to get

5148
01:37:23,330 --> 01:37:23,340
yeah exactly and where it's going to get
 

5149
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:24,290
yeah exactly and where it's going to get
out

5150
01:37:24,290 --> 01:37:24,300
out
 

5151
01:37:24,300 --> 01:37:27,830
out
yeah yeah so what's the if we can just

5152
01:37:27,830 --> 01:37:27,840
yeah yeah so what's the if we can just
 

5153
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,629
yeah yeah so what's the if we can just
return to that question what's the

5154
01:37:29,629 --> 01:37:29,639
return to that question what's the
 

5155
01:37:29,639 --> 01:37:32,450
return to that question what's the
difference between a good conversation

5156
01:37:32,450 --> 01:37:32,460
difference between a good conversation
 

5157
01:37:32,460 --> 01:37:34,370
difference between a good conversation
and a good negotiation

5158
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:34,380
and a good negotiation
 

5159
01:37:34,380 --> 01:37:36,110
and a good negotiation
can we uh because

5160
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:36,120
can we uh because
 

5161
01:37:36,120 --> 01:37:39,290
can we uh because
I think just uh reading your work

5162
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:39,300
I think just uh reading your work
 

5163

5167
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,790
there's a sense I have that the thing
we're doing now and just conversation on

5168
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:46,800
we're doing now and just conversation on
 

5169
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,590
we're doing now and just conversation on
the podcast and so on is different than

5170
01:37:48,590 --> 01:37:48,600
the podcast and so on is different than
 

5171
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,050
the podcast and so on is different than
negotiation it feels like the purpose is

5172
01:37:51,050 --> 01:37:51,060

different negotiations and conversations
 

5603
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,530
different negotiations and conversations
you've had

5604

5609
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,070

because when you empathize with other

5610
01:45:40,070 --> 01:45:40,080
because when you empathize with other
 

5611
01:45:40,080 --> 01:45:41,930
because when you empathize with other
human beings you start to realize we're

5612
01:45:41,930 --> 01:45:41,940
human beings you start to realize we're

the UCLA uh Professor that originally
 

5793
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:18,770
the UCLA uh Professor that originally
proposed the 738 55 ratio and discussed

5794
01:49:18,770 --> 01:49:18,780
proposed the 738 55 ratio and discussed
 

5795
01:49:18,780 --> 01:49:21,590
proposed the 738 55 ratio and discussed
it in terms of that it wasn't the

5796
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:21,600
it in terms of that it wasn't the
 

5797
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:23,689
it in terms of that it wasn't the
message but how much the he called it

5798
01:49:23,689 --> 01:49:23,699
message but how much the he called it
 

5799
01:49:23,699 --> 01:49:27,050
message but how much the he called it
liking like are you not that you're the

5800
01:49:27,050 --> 01:49:27,060
liking like are you not that you're the

meeting is coming across but you're
 

5803
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:31,310
meeting is coming across but you're
liking of the message and so

5804
01:49:31,310 --> 01:49:31,320
liking of the message and so
 

5805
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:34,550
liking of the message and so
that's been extrapolated heavily by

5806
01:49:34,550 --> 01:49:34,560
that's been extrapolated heavily by
 

5807

the message comes across this is how we
 

5827
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:04,370
the message comes across this is how we
got to balance it

so I I first of all a thousand percent

5850
01:50:30,169 --> 01:50:30,179
so I I first of all a thousand percent
 

5851
01:50:30,179 --> 01:50:32,090
so I I first of all a thousand percent
believe it's an accurate ratio

5852
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:32,100
believe it's an accurate ratio
 

5853
01:50:32,100 --> 01:50:34,550
believe it's an accurate ratio
but the real critical issue is not what

5854
01:50:34,550 --> 01:50:34,560
but the real critical issue is not what
 

5855
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:36,709
but the real critical issue is not what
the ratio of those three things are

5856
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:36,719
the ratio of those three things are
 

5857
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:38,810
the ratio of those three things are
it's what's what's the message when

5858
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:38,820
it's what's what's the message when
 

5859
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,850
it's what's what's the message when
they're out of line

5860
01:50:40,850 --> 01:50:40,860
they're out of line
 

5861
01:50:40,860 --> 01:50:42,709
they're out of line
like what's the message when the tone of

5862
01:50:42,709 --> 01:50:42,719
like what's the message when the tone of
 

5863
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,169
like what's the message when the tone of
voice is out of line with the words like

5864
01:50:45,169 --> 01:50:45,179
voice is out of line with the words like
 

5865
01:50:45,179 --> 01:50:46,850
voice is out of line with the words like
it don't matter what your ratio is you

5866
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:46,860
it don't matter what your ratio is you
 

5867
01:50:46,860 --> 01:50:49,430
it don't matter what your ratio is you
got a problem if their tone does not

5868
01:50:49,430 --> 01:50:49,440
got a problem if their tone does not
 

5869
01:50:49,440 --> 01:50:50,930
got a problem if their tone does not
match their warts

01:50:50,940 --> 01:50:52,370
match their warts
yeah and that's that's hard to really

5872
01:50:52,370 --> 01:50:52,380
yeah and that's that's hard to really
 

5873
01:50:52,380 --> 01:50:53,450
yeah and that's that's hard to really
put

5874

01:57:03,709 --> 01:57:03,719
boundary and stick to it
 

6207
01:57:03,719 --> 01:57:06,590
boundary and stick to it
interesting I because I think it's hard

6208
01:57:06,590 --> 01:57:06,600
interesting I because I think it's hard
 

6209
01:57:06,600 --> 01:57:08,209
interesting I because I think it's hard
for me to trust a person who's not aware

6210
01:57:08,209 --> 01:57:08,219
for me to trust a person who's not aware
 

6211
01:57:08,219 --> 01:57:11,030
for me to trust a person who's not aware
of their own demons

6212
01:57:11,030 --> 01:57:11,040
of their own demons
 

6213
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:12,890
of their own demons
because if you say you don't have any

6214
01:57:12,890 --> 01:57:12,900
because if you say you don't have any
 

6215
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:14,810
because if you say you don't have any
demons if you don't have any flaws I

6216
01:57:14,810 --> 01:57:14,820
demons if you don't have any flaws I
 

6217
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:16,250
demons if you don't have any flaws I
can't trust you

6218
01:57:16,250 --> 01:57:16,260
can't trust you
 

6219
01:57:16,260 --> 01:57:17,930
can't trust you
yeah well it's first of all it's a lie

6220
01:57:17,930 --> 01:57:17,940
yeah well it's first of all it's a lie
 

6221
01:57:17,940 --> 01:57:19,609
yeah well it's first of all it's a lie
right so somebody's lying right because

6222
01:57:19,609 --> 01:57:19,619
right so somebody's lying right because
 

6223
01:57:19,619 --> 01:57:22,129
right so somebody's lying right because
it gets back to life yes so you have to

6224
01:57:22,129 --> 01:57:22,139
it gets back to life yes so you have to
 

6225
01:57:22,139 --> 01:57:25,490
it gets back to life yes so you have to
have a self-awareness about that uh but

6226
01:57:25,490 --> 01:57:25,500
have a self-awareness about that uh but
 

6227
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:26,930
have a self-awareness about that uh but
he'd be able to control it demonstrate

6228
01:57:26,930 --> 01:57:26,940
he'd be able to control it demonstrate
 

6229
01:57:26,940 --> 01:57:28,609
he'd be able to control it demonstrate
be able to control it I mean this is

6230
01:57:28,609 --> 01:57:28,619
be able to control it I mean this is
 

6231
01:57:28,619 --> 01:57:30,669
be able to control it I mean this is
humans I just think humans

6232
01:57:30,669 --> 01:57:30,679
humans I just think humans
 

6233
01:57:30,679 --> 01:57:32,930
humans I just think humans
intelligent effective humans are able to

6234
01:57:32,930 --> 01:57:32,940
intelligent effective humans are able to
 

6235
01:57:32,940 --> 01:57:36,709
intelligent effective humans are able to
do this well and chat Bots are not yet

6236
01:57:36,709 --> 01:57:36,719
do this well and chat Bots are not yet
 

6237
01:57:36,719 --> 01:57:39,950
do this well and chat Bots are not yet
and they're moving that direction so

6238
01:57:39,950 --> 01:57:39,960
and they're moving that direction so
 

6239
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:42,109
and they're moving that direction so
it makes me think about what is actually

6240
01:57:42,109 --> 01:57:42,119
it makes me think about what is actually
 

6241
01:57:42,119 --> 01:57:43,669
it makes me think about what is actually
required for Effective negotiation

6242
01:57:43,669 --> 01:57:43,679
required for Effective negotiation
 

6243
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,550
required for Effective negotiation
that's what AI systems do is they make

6244
01:57:46,550 --> 01:57:46,560
that's what AI systems do is they make
 

6245
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:49,070
that's what AI systems do is they make
you ask yourself

6246
01:57:49,070 --> 01:57:49,080
you ask yourself
 

6247
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:51,770
you ask yourself
what is it that makes humans special any

6248
01:57:51,770 --> 01:57:51,780
what is it that makes humans special any
 

6249
01:57:51,780 --> 01:57:53,930
what is it that makes humans special any
discipline what is it that makes human

what is it that makes them effective at

6256
01:58:02,330 --> 01:58:02,340
what is it that makes them effective at
 

6257
01:58:02,340 --> 01:58:04,370
what is it that makes them effective at
negotiation what does it make them

6258
01:58:04,370 --> 01:58:04,380
negotiation what does it make them
 

6259
01:58:04,380 --> 01:58:06,229

something that's extremely difficult
 

6265
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:12,350
something that's extremely difficult
which is navigating physical spaces so

6266

which is navigating physical spaces so
 

6267
01:58:12,360 --> 01:58:13,669
which is navigating physical spaces so
doing things that we take for granted

6268
01:58:13,669 --> 01:58:13,679
doing things that we take for granted
 

6269
01:58:13,679 --> 01:58:16,129
doing things that we take for granted
like making yourself a cup of coffee is

01:58:16,129 --> 01:58:16,139
like making yourself a cup of coffee is
 

6271
01:58:16,139 --> 01:58:18,109
like making yourself a cup of coffee is
exceptionally difficult problem

exceptionally difficult problem
 

6273
01:58:18,119 --> 01:58:21,290
exceptionally difficult problem
for robots yeah because of all the

6274
01:58:21,290 --> 01:58:21,300
for robots yeah because of all the
 

6275
01:58:21,300 --> 01:58:23,870
for robots yeah because of all the
complexities involved in navigating

complexities involved in navigating
 

6277
01:58:23,880 --> 01:58:27,709

um objects move

6284
01:58:37,490 --> 01:58:37,500

to describe because it all seems so damn

6292
01:58:45,950 --> 01:58:45,960
to describe because it all seems so damn
 

6293
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:47,990

trivial but it's not trivial right

01:58:47,990 --> 01:58:48,000
trivial but it's not trivial right
 

6295
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:50,209
trivial but it's not trivial right
because a lot of that we just learned as

6296
01:58:50,209 --> 01:58:50,219
because a lot of that we just learned as
 

6297
01:58:50,219 --> 01:58:52,609
because a lot of that we just learned as
babies we keep running into things and

6298
01:58:52,609 --> 01:58:52,619
babies we keep running into things and
 

6299
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:55,490
babies we keep running into things and
we'll learn about that so AI systems

6300
01:58:55,490 --> 01:58:55,500
we'll learn about that so AI systems
 

6301
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:57,169
we'll learn about that so AI systems
help us understand what is it that makes

6302
01:58:57,169 --> 01:58:57,179
help us understand what is it that makes
 

6303
01:58:57,179 --> 01:58:59,870
help us understand what is it that makes
humans really what is the wisdom we have

in our heads and negotiation to me is

6306
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:02,400
in our heads and negotiation to me is
 

6307
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,669
in our heads and negotiation to me is
super interesting because negotiation is

6308
01:59:04,669 --> 01:59:04,679
super interesting because negotiation is
 

6309
01:59:04,679 --> 01:59:08,830
super interesting because negotiation is
not it's about business it's about uh

6310
01:59:08,830 --> 01:59:08,840
not it's about business it's about uh
 

6311
01:59:08,840 --> 01:59:10,609
not it's about business it's about uh
geopolitics it's about running

6312
01:59:10,609 --> 01:59:10,619
geopolitics it's about running

01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:14,280
is basically negotiating how do we the
 

6317
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:17,209
is basically negotiating how do we the

different policies different uh bills
 

6319
01:59:17,219 --> 01:59:19,430
different policies different uh bills
and programs and so on how do we

6320
01:59:19,430 --> 01:59:19,440
and programs and so on how do we
 

6321
01:59:19,440 --> 01:59:21,169

allocate money

6322
01:59:21,169 --> 01:59:21,179
allocate money
 

6323
01:59:21,179 --> 01:59:23,750

how do we reallocate resources all that

6324
01:59:23,750 --> 01:59:23,760
how do we reallocate resources all that
 

6325
01:59:23,760 --> 01:59:25,970
how do we reallocate resources all that
kind of stuff that seems like AI in the

6326
01:59:25,970 --> 01:59:25,980
kind of stuff that seems like AI in the
 

6327
01:59:25,980 --> 01:59:28,189
kind of stuff that seems like AI in the
future could be better at that

6328
01:59:28,189 --> 01:59:28,199
future could be better at that
 

6329
01:59:28,199 --> 01:59:29,930
future could be better at that
but maybe not

well I mean the two thoughts that I had

6354
01:59:57,709 --> 01:59:57,719
well I mean the two thoughts that I had
 

6355
01:59:57,719 --> 01:59:59,750
well I mean the two thoughts that I had
along the way was

6356
01:59:59,750 --> 01:59:59,760
along the way was
 

6357
01:59:59,760 --> 02:00:01,490
along the way was
I mean anytime you're talking about

6358
02:00:01,490 --> 02:00:01,500
I mean anytime you're talking about
 

6359
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:04,370
I mean anytime you're talking about
systems or scaling

6360
02:00:04,370 --> 02:00:04,380
systems or scaling
 

6361
02:00:04,380 --> 02:00:07,250
systems or scaling
you know yeah you're talking my belief

6362
02:00:07,250 --> 02:00:07,260
you know yeah you're talking my belief
 

6363
02:00:07,260 --> 02:00:08,390
you know yeah you're talking my belief
is

6364
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:08,400
is
 

6365
02:00:08,400 --> 02:00:10,790

6499
02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:38,030
for lack of a better term I call it two
lines of code like somewhere when you

6500
02:02:38,030 --> 02:02:38,040
lines of code like somewhere when you
 

6501
02:02:38,040 --> 02:02:39,530
lines of code like somewhere when you
everybody when we were little somebody

6502

planted in two lines into our head we
 

6505
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,390
planted in two lines into our head we
don't know when it got in there
